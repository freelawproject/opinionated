He served his seventy-two month prison sentence, was released from custody on March 3, 2000, and then began his term of supervised release. On March 6, 2001, the probation officer filed a motion to revoke Graham\u2019s supervised release. After Graham\u2019s supervised release was revoked, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment. On appeal, Graham argues that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him to a term of incarceration greater than the statutory maximum applicable to an underlying conviction for an unspecified drug amount. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000), a defendant whose supervised release term is revoked is subject to a maximum of five years in prison if his underlying offense was a Class A felony; a maximum of three years for a Class B felony; and a maximum of two years for a Class C felony. With regard to Graham\u2019s underlying conspiracy conviction, if the specific drug quantity necessary for an increased sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (2000) was not sufficiently set forth, he was subject only to a maximum of twenty years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 156-57 (4th Cir. 2001), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2296, 152 L.Ed.2d 1053, 70 U.S.L.W. 3724 (2002). An offense with a twenty year maximum is classified as a Class C felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2000), and thus, upon revocation of supervised release, the maximum sentence of two years would be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Because Graham failed to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim in district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In order to demonstrate plain error, Graham must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732. Even if Graham can satisfy these requirements, we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error \u201cunless the error \u2018seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Graham\u2019s indictment did not allege that the conspiracy involved the distribution of any particular amount of drugs. However, the count did list eighteen overt acts, some of which included specific drug amounts totalling over twenty grams of crack cocaine. Graham\u2019s name appeared in relation to a drug amount only once: overt act 18 stated that Graham distributed .4 grams of crack cocaine on a specific date. We find that the indictment did not adequately allege a threshold drug quantity necessary to charge an enhanced penalty. <em>See United States v. Carrington, </em>301 F.3d 204, 209-10 (4th Cir.2002). Therefore, Graham was only subject to a twenty year maximum for the underlying conviction and a two year maximum sentence for revocation of supervised release. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3), 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Thus, we find that Graham\u2019s three year sentence was error and that the error was plain. We need not decide, however, whether the error affected Graham\u2019s substantial rights. Where the evidence is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted as to the error, we will decline to correct it. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence of drug quantity, as derived from Graham\u2019s guilty plea to the indictment and the language of the plea agreement, was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted. Accordingly, because the drug quantity attributable to Graham was sufficient to invoke the enhanced sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), we decline to correct his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We affirm Graham\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny the Government\u2019s motion to strike Graham\u2019s reply brief. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
