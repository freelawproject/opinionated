The district court dismissed the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Mesic contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling due to his limited understanding of English, lack of legal education, inability to afford a lawyer, limited access to the law library, and the death in 1998 of his attorney, who had promised in 1996 to file a petition on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Mesic fails to allege facts to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances beyond his control made it impossible for him to file his petition on time. <em>See Miles </em>at 1107; <em>Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1913, 152 L.Ed.2d 823 (2002) (holding that a petitioner is not entitled to equitable tolling due to negligence of lawyer).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Because Mesic\u2019s Section 2254 petition was filed more than three years after the statutory period expired, the district court properly dismissed his petition as untimely-</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
