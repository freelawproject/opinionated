Preska, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b882-13\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">AFTER ARGUMENT AND UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Seynabou Seek appeals from the June 6, 2001 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Richard Conway Casey, Judge) convicting her, following a jury trial, on two counts of credit card fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit credit card fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1029(a)(2), 1029(a)(3) and 371. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">The indictment charged Seek with participating in a fraudulent scheme in which stolen credit card numbers were used to purchase over $212,000 in credits for use with prepaid telephone calling cards. Specifically, Count One of the indictment charged Seek with conspiring to commit credit card fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Count Two charged Seek with unlawfully trafficking in and using credit card account numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2). Count Three charged Seek with unlawfully possessing fifteen or more credit card numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">At trial, the government\u2019s evidence included computer records revealing that some 4,566 fraudulent purchases of prepaid calling card credits had been conducted over telephone lines installed in Seek\u2019s apartment; telephone records demonstrating that Seek\u2019s apartment had approximately fifteen different phone lines established under eight different identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ties; testimony by the superintendent in Seek\u2019s building that Seek had attempted to bribe him if he permitted her to install a telephone line on the telephone box in the building\u2019s basement; documents seized from Seek\u2019s apartment that contained stolen credit card account numbers and bore Seek\u2019s fingerprints; eighty-four prepaid calling cards seized from Seek\u2019s apartment; receipts for over six-hundred dollars\u2019 worth of prepaid calling cards; and the testimony of Mamadou Diallo, a cooperating witness who testified that Seek had enlisted Diallo\u2019s assistance in procuring stolen credit card numbers and that Seek had come to Diallo\u2019s apartment asking that he hide for her a suitcase filled with credit card receipts and prepaid calling cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Seek testified in her own defense and denied participating in the fraudulent scheme. Seek claimed that she was away from her apartment on business for extended periods of time, that an individual named \u201cBabacar\u201d had also lived in Seek\u2019s apartment during the relevant period, and that Babacar carried out the scheme in her apartment without her knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">On July 26, 2000, following a twelve-day trial, the jury convicted Seek on all counts. On June 5, 2001, the District Court sentenced Seek to forty months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a special assessment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">On appeal, Seek contends that four events undermined the overall fairness of her trial and that, as a result, this court should vacate her conviction and remand for a new trial. We conclude that none of these factors, either alone or in conjunction, is a sufficient ground for reversal. And even were we to ascribe error to the District Court in any given instance, which we do not, such error would be harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Seek\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">A. <em>The District Court\u2019s Questioning of Seek</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">At the conclusion of Seek\u2019s testimony, the following colloquy between the District Court and Seek took place before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">The Court: You\u2019re both finished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">Def. Counsel: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-14\">The Court: Ms. Seek, remain on the stand for a moment. I have a couple of questions for you. Ms. Seek, on Friday, I believe you testified that on July 10th, 1999 you received a call informing you that your stepmother had died. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-16\">The Court: Did some relative from Senegal call you to give you that sad news?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-17\">Seek: It was my mother who called me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-18\">The Court: From Senegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-19\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-20\">The Court: I believe you testified the next day, on July 11th, prayers were said in your apartment for your deceased stepmother. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-21\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-22\">The Court: Now, I believe you acknowledged earlier that your phone had been cut off, meaning there was no phone service as of June 12th, 1999. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-23\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-24\">The Court: Now, with your phone cut off, how did your mother know what phone number to call you on at your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-25\">Seek: She called me on Babacar\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-26\">phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>The Court: Yes, but who told her that phone number that she could use to reach you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\">Seek: When my phone was cut off, I gave them that number in case of emergencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">The Court: I believe earlier than last Friday, it was your testimony, you said that you have Mr. Torres, the budding supervisor, $100 for helping you carry some merchandise out of the building. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">The Court: When did that occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">Seek: I think, I think that it was in the month of June, but I don\u2019t remember the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">The Court: And this was for helping you carry out merchandise that belonged to some other person. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">Seek: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-11\">The Court: At the same time that you gave him this tip, did you owe the money to Bellevue Hospital you testified about earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-12\">Seek: Bellevue Hospital was when I left prison and when I was sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-13\">The Court: I thought you testified on Friday that as of the summer of 1999 that you owed money to Bellevue Hospital. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-14\">Seek: Yes, I left her in September of 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-15\">The Court: My question was: As of June of 1999, did you owe money to Bellevue Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-16\">Seek: I know that I owe money to Bellevue Hospital, but I don\u2019t remember the date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-17\">The Court: In June of 1999, were you already in arrears for your rent for your apartment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-18\">Seek: Yes, but I was paying on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-19\">The Court: No further questions, Ms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-20\">Seek. You may step down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-21\">Tr. 1107-09. Perceiving the District Court\u2019s questioning as evincing \u201cincredulity\u201d and \u201cdoubt\u201d as to Seek\u2019s testimony, counsel for Seek immediately moved for a mistrial. The District Court denied the motion and explained that its questions were necessary for the purpose of clarifying the record for the jury\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-22\">In determining whether a trial judge\u2019s conduct has deprived the defendant of a fair trial, we must \u201cexamine the entire record and attempt to determine whether the conduct of the trial judge has been such that the jurors have been impressed with the trial judge\u2019s partiality to one side to the point that this became a factor in the determination of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Guglielmini, </em>384 F.2d 602, 605 (2d Cir.1967). At the same time, Federal Rule of Evidence 614(b) explicitly provides that \u201c[t]he Court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party.\u201d We have thus held that a trial judge is permitted to ask questions of witnesses in order to clarify ambiguities, correct misstatements, or obtain information necessary to make rulings. <em>See United States v. Manko, </em>979 F.2d 900, 905 (2d Cir.1992), <em>cert, denied, </em>509 U.S. 903, 113 S.Ct. 2993, 125 L.Ed.2d 687 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-23\">While it is true that most of the District Court\u2019s questions to Seek were framed in leading language, we think that the questions neither amounted to nor smacked of prosecutorial cross-examination. Rather, the District Court appropriately sought to clarify factual ambiguities that had arisen in the course of a complex criminal trial, and once such ambiguities were cleared, the District Court promptly ceased its line of questioning. That the District Court\u2019s inquiries touched upon significant issues is not, by itself, dispositive; if anything, confusion that afflicts a significant trial issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>is more, not less, deserving of clarification by the trial judge. We are also mindful that the entirety of Seek\u2019s testimony lasted three days and comprised some 213 pages in the record, that the District Court\u2019s questions comprised three pages, and that, prior to the jury\u2019s deliberation, the District Court charged the jury that \u201cnothing I have said during the course of the trial should be considered by you as indicating that I have any opinion as to the facts or what your verdict should be.\u201d Tr. at 1243-44. In sum, having reviewed the trial transcript, we do not think that the District Court\u2019s questioning of Seek, as a whole, conveyed to the jury the impression that the court disbelieved the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">B. <em>The District Court\u2019s Comments to Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Seek also challenges her conviction on the basis of the District Court\u2019s criticisms, before the jury, of defense counsel. The District Court admonished defense counsel for various reasons, the most significant of which was counsel\u2019s repeated \u201ctelegraphing\u201d of answers to Seek during the government\u2019s cross-examination of Seek. We have held that because a trial judge is to be given wide latitude in maintaining control over trial proceedings, our role on appeal \u201cis not to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s conduct left something to be desired, or even whether some comments would have been better left unsaid.\u201d <em>United States v. Amiel, </em>95 F.3d 135, 146 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, reversal of conviction is warranted only if \u201cthe jury was so impressed with the judge\u2019s partiality to the prosecution that it became a factor in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt, or [if] it appear[ed] clear to the jury that the court believe[d] the accused is guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">We do not believe that the District Court\u2019s comments to defense counsel warrant a new trial given that defense counsel persisted in telegraphing answers to Seek despite repeated warnings against doing so by the District Court at side bar, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>635 F.2d 981, 984 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert, denied, </em>451 U.S. 992, 101 S.Ct. 2333, 68 L.Ed.2d 852 (1981), given that the District Court\u2019s criticisms of defense counsel constituted only a brief part of a lengthy trial and were otherwise quite limited, <em>see United States v. Pisani, </em>773 F.2d 397, 404 (2d Cir.1985), and given that the District Court\u2019s admonishments were directed at counsel\u2019s trial conduct rather than the underlying merits of Seek\u2019s innocence defense, <em>see United States v. DiTommaso, </em>817 F.2d 201, 220 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">C. <em>The Government\u2019s Summation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Seek argues on appeal that during summation the government should not have accused her of perjury, should not have appealed to jury sympathy by discussing the harm ostensibly suffered by Seek\u2019s victims, and should not have described defense counsel as having erected \u201csmokescreens\u201d during the course of the trial. None of these objections requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">We have held that \u201c[u]se of the words \u2018liar\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 to characterize disputed testimony when the witness\u2019s credibility is clearly in issue is ordinarily not improper unless such use is excessive or is likely to be inflammatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>808 F.2d 969, 977 (2d Cir.1987). Here, the government\u2019s suggestion to the jury that Seek had lied on the stand was not unreasonable, especially in light of the evidence that contradicted Seek\u2019s sworn testimony. That the government used the term \u201cperjury\u201d rather than \u201che\u201d is, in our view, not significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>As for the government\u2019s alleged appeals to the jury\u2019s sympathy, Seek points to statements by the government describing its prosecution of Seek as \u201cimportant\u201d and describing Seek\u2019s fraud as being \u201ca complete drain on society in terms of the number of man-hours it took ... to sift through all of the defendant\u2019s fraud and correct it.\u201d Tr. 1189-90. These comments, however, were fair responses to the defendant\u2019s attempts to characterize her prosecution as vindictive, thereby impugning the government\u2019s integrity. <em>See United States v. Feliciano, </em>223 F.3d 102, 123 (2d Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>532 U.S. 943, 121 S.Ct. 1405, 149 L.Ed.2d 348 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Lastly, we do not agree with Seek\u2019s characterization of the government\u2019s \u201csmokescreens\u201d comment as \u201cunfairly pitt[ing] government counsel as white knights searching for the truth versus an unscrupulous defense lawyer who was wasting the jury\u2019s time and trying to hide the truth.\u201d Def. Br. at 58. As above, this isolated comment was justified in light of defense counsel\u2019s claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>971 F.2d 876, 883 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">D. <em>Diallo\u2019s Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">During his direct examination at Seek\u2019s trial, Mamadou Diallo testified that he was unable to read or write in any language. On cross-examination, however, Diallo admitted that he had passed a written examination before receiving his New York state driver\u2019s license but that he had passed the examination, not because he really was literate, but \u201cbecause Allah gave me luck to go through with it.\u201d Tr. at 910. Five months after the conclusion of Seek\u2019s trial, the government confronted Diallo about his testimony regarding his driver\u2019s license. Diallo admitted that he had paid someone fifty dollars to help him pass the exam. This information was thereafter disclosed to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">On December 13, 1999, defense counsel moved to vacate Seek\u2019s conviction on the ground that Diallo\u2019s admission constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that warranted a new trial. The District Court denied Seek\u2019s motion because it found that the government did not know of Diallo\u2019s perjury, and that, even if the government did know, there was sufficient independent evidence to support Seek\u2019s conviction. The court additionally found that Diallo\u2019s perjury was in reference to a collateral matter and that Diallo\u2019s credibility had been thoroughly undermined by defense counsel during cross-examination and summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Where a new trial is sought based on perjury by a government witness of which the government knew or should have known, a new trial is warranted only if \u201c \u2018there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wong, </em>78 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Wallach, </em>935 F.2d 445, 456 (2d Cir.1991), <em>cert, denied, </em>508 U.S. 939, 113 S.Ct. 2414, 124 L.Ed.2d 637 (1993)). But \u201cwhere independent evidence supports a defendant\u2019s conviction, the subsequent discovery that a witness\u2019s testimony at trial was perjured will not warrant a new trial.\u201d <em>Wong, </em>78 F.3d at 82. A district court\u2019s decision on a new trial motion will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Torres, </em>128 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert, denied sub nom, Rivera v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 1065, 118 S.Ct. 1399, 140 L.Ed.2d 657 (1998), and all findings of fact made by the district court in resolving the motion are accepted on appeal unless clearly erroneous, <em>see United States v. Gallego, </em>191 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>530 U.S. 1216, 120 S.Ct. 2220, 147 L.Ed.2d 252 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Although the government has effectively admitted on appeal that it was aware of Diallo\u2019s perjury at the time of his cross-examination, and although we agree that the government would have been better off had it confronted Diallo promptly, we nonetheless conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the matter of Diallo\u2019s driver\u2019s license was collateral and, in any event, would not have served further to undermine Diallo\u2019s credibility to any appreciable degree. Second, even without Diallo\u2019s testimony, there existed overwhelming evidence of Seek\u2019s guilt, including but not limited to telephone records indicating that fifteen different phone lines had been installed in Seek\u2019s apartment within a span of thirteen months, computer records that fraudulent activity had occurred over those lines, testimony from Seek\u2019s superintendent that Seek had attempted to bribe him if he permitted Seek to install a phone line in the building\u2019s basement, and documents recovered from Seek\u2019s apartment containing stolen credit card numbers and bearing Seek\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\"><em>United States v. Wallach, </em>935 F.2d 445 (2d Cir.1991), <em>cert, denied, </em>508 U.S. 939, 113 S.Ct. 2414, 124 L.Ed.2d 637 (1993), is distinguishable because Diallo\u2019s credibility had already been thoroughly undermined at trial and because the government made no attempt to rehabilitate Diallo after cross-examination. And while the government stated on summation that Diallo\u2019s testimony could be corroborated, the government was speaking only in terms of the testimony that related to Seek\u2019s guilt and that could be independently corroborated by other government evidence. Indeed, the government readily admitted to the jury that Diallo \u201cis a criminal and ... has been prosecuted by the government.\u201d Tr. at 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">After carefully considering all of Seek\u2019s contentions on appeal, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. We also find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the perjury matter. <em>See United States v. Sasso, </em>59 F.3d 341, 350 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
