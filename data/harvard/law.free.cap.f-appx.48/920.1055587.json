Howard filed this action against her long-time employer, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), alleging claims of discrimination under the Tennessee Human Rights Act (\u201cTHRA\u201d), Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-101 <em>et seq., </em>and a claim of retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim under Tennessee common law. Specifically, she challenges UPS\u2019s decision to offer her reinstatement to her former position as a feeder driver rather than temporary alternate work after she suffered an on-the-job injury. She now appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of UPS on her gender discrimination and workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>Howard\u2019s claims are time-barred, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Helen Howard began working for UPS in 1981. She obtained a full-time position as a feeder (tractor-trailer) driver in 1991. The feeder driver position requires the employee to lift a minimum of seventy pounds when hooking up the trailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">On November 8, 1996, Howard was involved in an on-the-job accident in which she sustained injuries to her head, right shoulder, neck, and back. Within a few days of the accident, she was informed that her injury would be covered under workers\u2019 compensation, and she received benefits for between six and nine months without filing a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">In the months following the accident, Howard underwent treatment from several doctors. She initially sought treatment from Dr. Stephen Natelson, who was not a panel physician regularly used for UPS cases by Liberty Mutual, UPS\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer (\u201cpanel physician\u201d). Howard was then referred to four other doctors, all of whom were panel physicians. Not one of the four panel physicians ever assigned her any restrictions. One panel physician, Dr. Howard Brown, released Howard to return to her regular job duties with no restrictions, while another, Dr. Merrill White, expressly noted that he saw no reason to assign limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Subsequently, Howard went back to Dr. Natelson. On June 2, 1997, Dr. Natelson released her to return to work but recommended that she be restricted to lifting twenty-five pounds. After Dr. Natelson released her, Howard returned to UPS and worked a few days as a washer/fueler at the direction of her feeder supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">In June 1997, Jennifer Molyneaux, occupational safety supervisor for UPS\u2019s Tennessee district, realized that Howard had been released to return to work without any restrictions by Drs. Brown and White. She concluded that Howard was able to return to her position as a feeder driver and that the collective bargaining agreement between UPS and her union (\u201cUnion\u201d) prevented UPS from placing Howard in a temporary alternate work position. Molyneaux instructed Howard\u2019s supervisor accordingly. UPS then offered Howard reinstatement to her former position as a feeder driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Howard disagreed with the panel physicians\u2019 conclusions and refused to return to her former job as a feeder driver because of the position\u2019s lifting requirement. Without UPS\u2019s approval, Howard sought the opinions of physicians not on the workers\u2019 compensation panel for UPS cases and obtained restrictions conflicting with the prior complete releases from the panel physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">When UPS would not alter its decision to follow the panel physicians over those she chose, Howard took several courses of action. She complained to the Tennessee Department of Labor, filed a grievance with the Union, and filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). In her EEOC charge, she alleged that UPS denied her temporary alternate work due to either her gender or disability. On June 30,1998, the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">On May 11, 1998, Howard filed a complaint against UPS challenging the discontinuation of her workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On March 3, 1999, the state court determined that Howard sustained a permanent partial disability of forty percent to the body as a whole and a medical impairment of eleven percent to the body as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Howard filed this action in state court on March 13, 2000. Three months later, in June 2000, she returned to her job at UPS as a feeder driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Newman v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>266 F.3d 401, 404 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">1. Whether Howard\u2019s gender discrimination claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">An action under the THRA must be brought \u201cwithin one (1) year after the alleged discriminatory practice ceases.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d). Howard filed her complaint in this action on March 13, 2000. Therefore, her gender discrimination claim is barred if it accrued before March 13, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">The first step in determining whether Howard\u2019s claim is timely is identifying the alleged discriminatory practice. <em>Weber v. Moses, </em>938 S.W.2d 387, 390 (Tenn.1996). Howard challenges UPS\u2019s decision to offer her reinstatement to her former position as a feeder driver rather than temporary alternate work, claiming that UPS treated male drivers more favorably by providing them with temporary alternate work.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Having identified the discriminatory practice, we must next determine the date on which the discriminatory practice ended. <em>Id. </em>In determining when a discriminatory practice ends, the Tennessee Supreme Court has adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), and <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981). <em>See Weber, </em>938 S.W.2d at 390-91. Under this analysis, \u201ca discriminatory [practice] ceases and is complete, when the plaintiff is given unequivocal notice of the employer\u2019s ... decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The issue, then, is when did Howard receive \u201cunequivocal notice\u201d of UPS\u2019s decision not to provide her with temporary alternate work. In or around June 1997, Howard\u2019s supervisor informed her that she would be offered full reinstatement to her former job as a feeder driver rather than temporary alternate work. On January 23,1998, Howard filed a grievance with the Union seeking an alternate position, by which time she admittedly felt that she had been wronged. On March 4, 1998, Howard filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Howard acknowledges that she filed her EEOC charge because she felt that she had been wronged and that at the time she filed her charge, UPS \u201chad told [her] that they weren\u2019t going to accommodate [her] in anyway.\u201d Accordingly, Howard had \u201cunequivocal notice\u201d of UPS\u2019s decision, at the earliest, in June 1997 when her supervisor informed her that she would be offered her former position and not temporary alternate work and, at the latest, on March 4, 1998, when she filed her EEOC charge \u2014 more than two years prior to the filing of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">Howard asserts that her gender discrimination claim did not accrue until February 3, 2000, when Ed Finley, UPS\u2019s labor relations manager, unequivocally told Jimmy Miller, the Union\u2019s vice president and business agent, that UPS would not provide Howard with temporary alternate work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Finley\u2019s statement, however, was made in the course of the grievance negotiations between UPS and the Union. Miller negotiated with UPS on Howard\u2019s behalf after she filed her grievance in January 1998. In a letter to Miller dated October 4, 1999, Finley discussed the possibility of accommodating Howard\u2019s request for an alternate position in order to resolve her grievance. Subsequently, on February 2, 2000, Finley told Miller that UPS would not agree to make an accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In <em>Ricks, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a discrimination claim accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the employee receives notice that his or her grievance has been denied. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 260-61, 101 S.Ct. 498. The Supreme Court held that \u201centertaining a grievance complaining of the ... decision does not suggest that the earlier decision was in any respect tentative. The grievance procedure, by its nature, is a <em>remedy </em>for a prior decision, not an opportunity to <em>influence </em>that decision before it is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 101 S.Ct. 498. Accordingly, Finley\u2019s statements made in the context of grievance negotiations with the Union neither render UPS\u2019s prior decision ambiguous or uncertain nor affect in any way when Howard received \u201cunequivocal notice\u201d of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Next, Howard argues that her gender discrimination claim could not have accrued until after the decision in her workers\u2019 compensation case on March 3, 1999, which \u201cunequivocally establish[ed her] right to alternate work.\u201d Howard\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, in her EEOC charge filed on March 4, 1998, Howard noted that \u201cthe company stands f\u00edim in saying they will not accommodate me,\u201d demonstrating that she had received \u201cunequivocal notice\u201d of UPS\u2019s decision at that time. Therefore, the workers\u2019 compensation decision one year later is immaterial. Second, the workers\u2019 compensation decision on March 3, 1999, is outside the one-year statute of limitations, as Howard filed her complaint on March 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Finally, Howard asserts that her gender discrimination claim falls within the continuing violation doctrine. The continuing violation doctrine \u201creheves a plaintiff from the burden of proving that the entire violation occurred within the limitations period\u201d and requires that the plaintiff \u201cshow a series of related acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Spicer v. Beaman Bottling Co., </em>937 S.W.2d 884, 889 (Tenn.1996). The doctrine applies in only two narrowly limited instances: (1) \u201cwhere there is some evidence of <em>present </em>discriminatory activity giving rise to a claim of a continuing violation,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhere there has been a longstanding and demonstrable policy of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">In determining \u201cwhether the discriminatory conduct amounts to a continuing violation or whether it is merely discrete, isolated, and completed acts which are individual violations,\u201d the Tennessee Supreme Court has applied three factors: (1) subject matter, (2) frequency, and (3) degree of permanence. <em>Id. </em>at 890. Under the third and most important factor, degree of permanence, the court asks: \u201cDoes the act have the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights, or which should indicate to the employee that the continued existence of the adverse consequences of the act is to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate?\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, UPS\u2019s decision to offer Howard her former position rather than temporary alternate work not only should have triggered her \u201cawareness of and duty to assert\u201d her rights, it in fact did. Having already filed a grievance with the Union, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Howard filed an EEOC charge stating that \u201cthe company stands firm in saying they will not accommodate me.\u201d Howard\u2019s EEOC charge was filed on March 4, 1998, more than two years before this case was filed. As such, UPS\u2019s decision not to offer Howard temporary alternate work constitutes a discrete, individual act to which the continuing violation theory does not apply. Furthermore, Howard\u2019s allegations that UPS repeatedly failed to honor her requests for temporary alternate work do not amount to a continuing violation. <em>See EEOC v. McCall Printing Corp., </em>633 F.2d 1232, 1237 (6th Cir.1980) (\u201cRepeated requests for further relief from a prior act of discrimination will not set the time limitations running anew.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Howard received \u201cunequivocal notice\u201d of UPS\u2019s decision not to provide her with temporary alternate work, at the earliest, in June 1997 when her supervisor notified her of the decision and, at the latest, on March 4, 1998, when she filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Therefore, her gender discrimination claim accrued prior to March 13, 1999, and is barred by the THRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">2. Whether Howard\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">A retaliation claim based on an employee\u2019s exercise of her workers\u2019 compensation rights is subject to a one-year statute of hmitations. <em>Headrick v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>825 S.W.2d 424, 426 (Tenn.Ct.App. 1991). Howard contends that her retaliation claim did not accrue until after the state court\u2019s determination in the worker\u2019s compensation case on March 3, 1999, and that UPS continued to retaliate against her subsequent to the filing of the instant action by filing a motion to reduce the workers\u2019 compensation award on October 23, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">In support of her workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim, Howard alleges that UPS retaliated against her by offering her the position of feeder driver rather than providing her with temporary alternate work. Because this is the identical employment decision she challenges in her gender discrimination claim, her workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim accrued before March 13, 1999, and is barred by the one-year statute of hmitations for the same reasons her gender discrimination claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-15\">.
