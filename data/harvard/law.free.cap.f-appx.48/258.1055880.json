We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>235 F.3d 1165, 1168 (9th Cir. 2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">At sentencing the district court added two points to Christensen\u2019s criminal history score, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d), for a crime committed while on probation. Before entering a guilty plea, Christensen moved to consolidate his indictment for bank fraud, which he committed while on probation, with an indictment for drug possession, which occurred after his probation expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Christensen contends that only the post-probation drug offenses should be considered as the \u201cinstant offense\u201d in calculating his criminal history score. This argument is unpersuasive. By consolidating the bank fraud and drug charges for the purpose of sentencing, both sets of crimes became the instant offense for the purpose of calculating Christensen\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 920 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b313-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
