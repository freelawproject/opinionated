The Honorable Louis F.

Appellant received a sentence enhancement pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (\u201cACCA\u201d), based on three prior felony convictions. Appellant contests three orders of the District Court: (1) denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to declare a mistrial, or in the alternative to strike testimony, for the breach of a sequestration order by police officer witnesses; (2) denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to bifurcate trial of the \u201cprior offense\u201d and the \u201cin possession\u201d elements of Section 922(g); and (3) denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to bar enhanced sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial or to strike testimony for violation of a sequestration order by a witness. Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that \u201c[a]t the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d Sequestration is intended to prevent the possibility of witnesses shaping their testimony to match that <em>given </em>by other witnesses. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d 472, 473 (3d Cir.1980). The Rule does not explicitly address the situation in which a witness fails to comply with a sequestration order, and courts have considerable discretion to tailor appropriate remedies. <em>Pickel v. United States, </em>746 F.2d 176, 182 (3d Cir.1984). The court may remedy a violation by holding the witness in contempt, <em>id., </em>by commenting to the jury on the violation and its effect on the weight and credibility of the evidence, <em>id., </em>or by allowing opposing counsel to cross-examine the witnesses concerning the violation. <em>United States v. Blasco, </em>702 F.2d 1315, 1327 (11th Cir.1983). Only if the defendant has suffered actual prejudice as a result of the violation will a court consider excluding the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>United States v. McClain, </em>469 F.2d 68, 69 (3d Cir.1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, in order for a court to invoke the extreme remedy of declaring a mistrial, the violation must have prejudiced the defendant. <em>Pickel, </em>746 F.2d 176, 182 (noting that a violation of a sequestration order \u201cmight support dismissal in a most egregious situation\u201d); <em>Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d at 474 (holding that failure of a court to sequester a witness is not reversible error absent a showing of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The record is clear that the District Court gave substantial consideration to the motion to strike testimony or declare a mistrial, determined that Appellant had not suffered prejudice as a result of the violation of the sequestration order, and properly exercised its discretion to craft appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">We reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the District Court erred when it declined to bifurcate trial of a single count indictment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Section 922(g) provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person ... who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>nition.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In this Circuit a defendant in a single-count indictment under Section 922(g) is not entitled to bifurcate trial of the \u201cconvicted felon\u201d from the \u201cin possession\u201d elements. <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>44 F.3d 1219 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We also reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the District Court erred when it refused Appellant\u2019s motion to bar sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (\u201cACCA\u201d). The ACCA provides a sentence enhancement for a violation of Section 922(g) upon a judicial determination of \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Such judicial determination of prior convictions has withstood challenge on constitutional grounds, <em>Almandarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), even though judicial determination of other factors has been held to be unconstitutional. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Accordingly, we have upheld application of the sentence enhancement provisions of the ACCA to a violation of Section 922(g)(1). <em>United States v. Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and see no basis for reversal. The judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. More recent decisions from other circuits also require a showing of prejudice to the defendant. <em>United States v. Blasco, </em>702 F.2d 1315, 1327 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States, v. Kindle, </em>925 F.2d 272 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
