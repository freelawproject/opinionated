R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Boyer\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">Jade Lee Boyer appeals pro se the judgment of the district court affirming the decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to deny his application for Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) disability benefits. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order and we uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error. <em>Verduzco v. Apfel, </em>188 F.3d 1087, 1089 (9th Cir. 1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">Substantial medical evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) findings that Boyer\u2019s physical impairment did not result in a marked and severe functional limitation, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i), and that his physical impairment did not meet or equal any condition described in the Listing of Impairments, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926. Contrary to Boyer\u2019s contention on appeal, the ALJ properly concluded that the opinion of Dr. Gach, Boyer\u2019s family physician, was not supported by the medical evidence because Boyer\u2019s other treating and examining physicians unanimously opined that he did not suffer from neurological damage or a compromised range of motion. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(3); <em>Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1113-14 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">The ALJ did not have a duty to develop evidence of Boyer\u2019s mental impairment because there was no evidence of such an impairment in the record. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir. 2001). The Appeals Council properly declined to consider new evidence of Boyer\u2019s mental impairment because such evidence did not relate to the period encompassed by the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(b). The approval of Boyer\u2019s subsequent SSI application does not support reversal or remand of the ALJ\u2019s denial of the instant application because the two applications concern different time periods and different medical evidence. <em>See Bruton v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 824, 827 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">Boyer\u2019s remaining contentions also are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b330-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
