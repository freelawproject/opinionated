We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Hunt v. Rushton, </em>No. CA-00-2848-723BG (D.S.C. Mar. 28, 2002). In addition, we note that certain issues raised in Hunt\u2019s informal brief on appeal were waived by his failure to raise them in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 844-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.1982) (failure to file specific objections to particular conclusions in magistrate judge\u2019s report, after being warned of consequences, waives further review). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
