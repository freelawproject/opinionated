Wolters\u2019 attorney has filed a brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Wolters has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-25\">Based on our review of the district court record, we conclude that none of the issues raised in the <em>Anders </em>or pro se briefs warrants further review. In addition, pursuant to our independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no other issues requiring further review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b312-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-36\">.
