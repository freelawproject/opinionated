Bertelsman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b306-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">Malinn Cisneros appeals the decision of the district court affirming the rulings of a Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denying Cisneros disability benefits. Because we find that the ALJ erred in entirely disregarding the opinion of one of Cisneros\u2019s treating physicians and in its reasons for partially disregarding the opinion of another, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings before the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">In determining whether a claimant is entitled to disability benefits, the ALJ follows a five-step sequential analysis, determining, among other things, whether the claimant meets the criteria of one of the specific impairment \u201cListings\u201d in the SSA regulations and whether the claimant has residual functional capacity to perform other work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>see also Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 828 n. 5 (9th Cir.1995). Cisneros challenges the ALJ\u2019s rejection of her treating physicians\u2019 opinions on the issue of whether she met the criteria for the arthritis Listing and whether she had the residual capacity to perform other work.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">The ALJ has the responsibility of weighing the evidence to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989). The ALJ must, however, provide \u201c \u2018specific and legitimate reasons\u2019 supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d for rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>treating physicians\u2019 opinions. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Magallanes, </em>881 F.2d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In ruling that Cisneros had not met the criteria for the arthritis Listing, the ALJ pointed out that Dr. Lynda Lee, Cisneros\u2019s main treating physician, did not submit any objective diagnostic tests. Objective tests were an explicit requirement of the then-current arthritis Listing. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 (2000). The failure to meet this requirement is a sufficient reason to reject Dr. Lee\u2019s opinion on whether Cisneros met the Listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On the question whether Cisneros had residual functional capacity to perform other work, the ALJ did not even mention the opinion of Dr. David Waggoner, the first physician to treat Cisneros for the pain in her knee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In failing to mention Dr. Waggoner\u2019s opinion, the ALJ necessarily failed to give \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting Dr. Waggoner\u2019s opinion. <em>See Baxter v. Sullivan, </em>923 F.2d 1391, 1396 (9th Cir.1991). This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The ALJ also rejected Dr. Lee\u2019s opinion on Cisneros\u2019s residual functional capacity. One of the reasons given by the ALJ for its rejection was that the opinion was not consistent with Cisneros\u2019s own testimony about her abilities. There are no obvious inconsistencies, however, between Dr. Lee\u2019s opinion and Cisneros\u2019s testimony and the ALJ failed to point out what the inconsistencies were. The ALJ must give \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830. Without further clarification, this reason given by the ALJ for rejecting Dr. Lee\u2019s opinion on residual functional capacity does not appear to have been supported by the record. The ALJ gave another reason for rejecting Dr. Lee\u2019s opinion: that Dr. Lee did not explain the limitations she found Cisneros to have. In light of the whole record, however, we are not convinced that the ALJ would have reached the same result if the ALJ had concluded that the limitations described by Dr. Lee were in fact consistent with Cisneros\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Because the rejection of the two treating physicians was not adequately supported by specific and legitimate reasons for rejection, the decision of the ALJ is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>See Baxter, </em>923 F.2d at 1396. We accordingly reverse the decision of the district court and remand with instructions to remand this matter to the Secretary for further proceedings. In light of the uncertainties in the record, we reject Cisneros\u2019s request that we direct an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED, with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b306-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. From the record, it appears that Dr. Wag-goner saw Cisneros only once. He found that, at the time, she was \"totally disabled,\u201d and he referred her to Dr. Lee. The opinion of a physician who sees a patient for treatment purposes, even if he sees her only once, must be given more weight than that of a non-examining physician. <em>See Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
