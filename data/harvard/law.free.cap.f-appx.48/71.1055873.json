Fromal claimed that she was injured while disembarking from an amusement park ride at Busch Gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-22\">Fromal does not suggest that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence or the controlling law. Rather, she limits her appellate claims to numerous procedural issues alleging violations of due process. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <em>See generally United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 314 (2002) (holding that claims of procedural due process are reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
