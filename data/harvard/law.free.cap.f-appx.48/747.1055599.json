Gonzales appeals the February 14, 2002, final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), denying his application for a federal disability annuity as untimely. <em>Gonzales v. OPM, </em>91 M.S.P.R. 46 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">Mr. Gonzales resigned from the Defense Logistics Agency (\u201cDLA\u201d) effective September 30,1997. He applied for a disability retirement annuity under the Civil Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>vice Retirement System on August 31, 1999, and the application was received by the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) on September 2, 1999. The filing deadline for disability retirement annuities is one year, unless the employee can demonstrate that he was \u201cmentally incompetent ... at the date of separation of service or within 1 year thereafter,\u201d in which case the deadline \u201cmay be waived,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(b) (2000). This court has held that \u201cmay\u201d in this case means \u201cshall;\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the OPM must grant a waiver of the deadline if there is \u201cadequate factual support\u201d for a finding of mental incompetence. <em>French v. OPM, </em>810 F.2d 1118, 1119 (Fed. Cir.1987). A mental incompetent, for the purpose of this statute, is one who has no more than \u201csome minimal capacity to manage his own affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120. The employee must prove his mental incompetence by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(ii). The OPM found Mr. Gonzales had not done so and dismissed his application as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">On appeal, the administrative judge ruled on a written record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Mr. Gonzales was entitled to a waiver of the statutory deadline because he had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he was mentally incompetent during the application period, which tolled the deadline. The judge found that the sole medical evidence pertaining to Mr. Gonzales\u2019s incompetence during the requisite period was the sworn declaration of Dr. Richard March, who said that Mr. Gonzales was mentally incompetent when he resigned from the DLA and for more than a year afterwards. The judge acknowledged, however, that \u201cthe appellant\u2019s case could have been stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The OPM appealed the judge\u2019s finding to the full Board, which reversed. The Board considered but rejected Dr. March\u2019s conclusion because Dr. March did not explain how specific symptoms rendered Mr. Gonzales mentally incompetent. Under the Board\u2019s decisions, \u201ca physician\u2019s conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee\u2019s specific work requirements.\u201d <em>Johnson v. OPM, </em>87 M.S.P.R. 192 \u00b6 16 (2000); <em>accord Tanious v. OPM, </em>34 M.S.P.R. 107, 111 (1987). Moreover, the Board noted, Dr. March had not examined Mr. Gonzales until two years after he resigned from the DLA. Contrary to the administrative judge\u2019s finding that Dr. March\u2019s declaration was the sole evidence of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s condition, the Board cited evidence from Dr. Vincent Ogilvie, a clinical psychologist who examined Mr. Gonzales at about the same time Dr. March did and found his patient\u2019s flow of thought, memory, perception, judgment, and insight to be normal. The Board found Dr. Ogilvie\u2019s findings consistent with those of Dr. Montaitti-Alana, who examined Mr. Gonzales at about the same time as Dr. Ogilvie. The Board also cited lay evidence of Mr. Gonzales\u2019s resignation letter, which it found was coherent and which did not mention mental problems. Finally, the Board cited an evaluation of Mr. Gonzales in October 1996 which found his job performance satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Mr. Gonzales appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Our standard of review for decisions of the Board is limited by statute, which directs us to set aside Board decisions only if they are found to be 1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; 2) obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or 3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 145 F.Sd </em>1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Our review in cases such as this one is further limited by statute, which provides that \u201cdecisions of the Office [of Personnel Management] concerning [disability determinations] are final and conclusive and are not subject to review,\u201d except that \u201can administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual ... under this subchapter may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(a), (d)(1). It is well settled that disability determinations can be reviewed by this court only for \u201ca substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>Lindahl v. OPM, </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985); <em>accord Anthony v. OPM, </em>58 F.3d 620, 625 (Fed. Cir.1995). We are without authority to review \u201cthe factual underpinnings\u201d of the decision. <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791; <em>accord Bruner v. OPM, </em>996 F.2d 290, 291 (Fed. Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The only challenges Mr. Gonzales makes to the Board\u2019s decision are factual. He argues that the MPSB \u201cdid not consider evidence ... vital to my case,\u201d specifically an affidavit of Dr. Ogilvie and a statement from Dr. William Sheehan, who said Mr. Gonzales \u201ccannot work.\u201d Mr. Gonzales also contests the Board\u2019s finding that his resignation letter did not support finding a disability to toll the application deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Mr. Gonzales thus challenges the Board\u2019s factual determination as unsupported by the evidence. We cannot reverse the Board\u2019s decision on that basis. \u201cThe sufficiency of the evidentiary support for [a decision by the Board] ordinarily would not be viewed as a question of procedural rights or construction of legislation, or analogous or comparable to those questions.\u201d <em>Smith v. OPM, </em>784 F.2d 397, 400 (Fed.Cir.1986). Without the extension, Mr. Gonzales\u2019s application was untimely. Since there are no other challenges to the Board\u2019s determination, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">.
