The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> dismissed all the claims except one against Sergeant Char-Lyne Goins alleging she \u201ctook and destroyed [Conway\u2019s] gloves in retaliation for filing grievances against [prison employees Jennifer] Sachse and [Mary] Riordan.\u201d Goins filed a motion for summary judgment, attaching her affidavit stating she ordered Conway to leave the prison cafeteria because she found he was not scheduled to work that day, she had him escorted out of the cafeteria when he disobeyed her order, and she confiscated his gloves because she believed he had stolen them and \u201cfor no other reason,\u201d and she was not aware of Conway\u2019s claims against Sasche and Riorden, who both worked at a different prison than Goins. Conway did not controvert the affidavit with his own or any other sworn testimony, and submitted no evidence setting forth specific facts to show Goins knew of Conway\u2019s claims against Sashe and Riorden. The district court concluded that because Goins was not aware of Conway\u2019s claims, Goins\u2019s actions could not have been taken in retaliation for them. The district court granted summary judgment to Goins, and Conway appeals pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Conway first contends the allegations in his verified complaint are sufficient to overcome Goins\u2019s affidavit. We disagree. Conway\u2019s complaint merely alleges Goins \u201cis associated with officials Sachse and Riorden, and was privileged to each incident [involving Sachse and Riorden] referred to above.\u201d These allegations are conclusory and do not satisfy the \u201cspecific facts showing\u201d required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Likewise, Conway\u2019s late affidavit in opposition to summary judgment contains no specific facts refuting Goins\u2019s lack of knowledge about Conway\u2019s claims against Sachse and Riorden. Even now in his brief, Conway does not point to any specific facts showing Goins\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Conway next contends there are other material facts in dispute, specifically, whether Goins\u2019s alleged actions were motivated by Conway\u2019s refusal to obey Goins\u2019s direct order to leave the prison cafeteria\u2019s food service area, by Conway\u2019s witness testimony in a federal action on behalf of another inmate, or by Conway\u2019s claims against Sachse and Riorden. The first two alleged reasons are beyond the allegations of Conway\u2019s complaint, however. Further, an inmate cannot premise a retaliation claim on his refusal to obey a direct order. <em>Smith v. Erickson, </em>961 F.2d 1387, 1388 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam). In any event, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Conway\u2019s retaliation claim because Conway has not produced evidence that Conway acted with an impermissible motive and that his gloves would not have been taken but for the impermissible motive. <em>Foster v. Delo, </em>130 F.3d 307, 308 (8th Cir.1997) (per curiam); <em>Goff v. Burton, </em>7 F.3d 734, 738 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Conway also argues he was denied sufficient time to respond to Goins\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Conway waived this argument because he did not ask the district court for additional time to respond to Goins\u2019s motion. Further, Conway fails to assert any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Last, Conway asks us to review the district court\u2019s earlier dismissal of the defendants other than Goins. In his notice of appeal, however, Conway only referred to the district court\u2019s summary judgment order and the denial of his motion to alter or amend that judgment. We thus lack jurisdiction to review the earlier partial dismissal order. <em>See Klaudt v. United States Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>990 F.2d 409, 411 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The Honorable Catherine D.
