We deny Thomas\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to former Section 106(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) as amended by the transitional rules in Section 309(c)(4) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (Sept. 30, 1996), as amended by the Extension of Stay in United States for Nurses Act, Pub. L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656 (Oct. 11, 1996). IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply because the BIA disposed of this case after October 31, 1996, and these proceedings began prior to April 1, 1997. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">This court reviews BIA denials of motions to reopen and motions to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890-91 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Padilla-Agustin v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.1994); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 324, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">Thomas contends that the denial of his request for deportation waiver should be reopened or reconsidered because of a change in the law since the immigration judge\u2019s initial ruling. Congress, in changing the pertinent language of \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 212 of the INA, provided that the changes to \u00a7 241 \u201cshall not apply to deportation proceedings for which notice has been provided to the alien before March 1, 1991\u201d and changes to \u00a7 212 would apply \u201cto individuals entering the United States on or after June 1, 1991.\u201d Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, \u00a7 602(d) and \u00a7 601(e)(1990). Thomas entered the United States in November of 1983 and received notice of his deportation proceedings in July of 1986, making the new statutory language inapplicable to his case. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Thomas\u2019s motions for reopening and reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
