Vucic fled Montenegro after he was drafted to serve in the FRY army, and arrived in the United States in 1999. He requested asylum, claiming persecution on the basis of his Albanian ethnicity and his Muslim religion. The Immigration Judge denied the asylum application, and Vucic appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA dismissed the appeal, holding that Vucic failed to establish grounds for granting asylum. Vucic petitions this Court to review the BIA\u2019s order, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">This Court has jurisdiction over Vucic\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order pursuant to Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Vucic\u2019s removal to Spain during the pendency of this petition does not render his petition moot. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>see also Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 922 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Tapia Garcia v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1216, 1218-20 (10th Cir.2001). And as respondent concedes, Vucic has Article III standing to challenge the BIA\u2019s decision: the denial of Vucic\u2019s asylum application is an injury, traceable to respondent\u2019s conduct, that would be redressed by a favorable ruling by this Court. <em>See Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997); <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed,2d 351 (1992); <em>cf. Max-George v. Reno, </em>205 F.3d 194, 196 (5th Cir.2000), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>277 F.3d 1373 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Suleiman, </em>208 F.3d 32, 38 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In order to be eligible for asylum under INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), an applicant must first demonstrate that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d defined in relevant part as any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">This Court is required to give considerable deference to the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (\u201cThe BIA\u2019s determination that [petitioner] was not eligible for asylum ... can be reversed only if the evidence presented by [petitioner] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d); <em>Abankwah v. INS, </em>185 F.3d 18, 22-23 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">A showing of past persecution on one of the five listed grounds creates the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and can serve as the basis for an asylum application. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1) (2000). The BIA found that Vucic had not suffered past persecution: \u201cThe applicant ... has never been imprisoned or harmed and he does not allege facts which rise to the level of past persecution,\u201d The facts Vucic alleges in his petition for review are the same that he presented to the BIA, and cannot be read to compel a conclusion contrary to what the BIA found. <em>See, e.g., Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, </em>222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Bucur v. INS, </em>109 F.3d 399, 402 (7th Cir. 1997); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Vucic also claims that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to the FRY. In general, a government does not engage in persecution when it requires its citizens to perform military services or prosecutes them for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>serve. <em>See Foroglou v. INS, </em>170 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.1999); <em>Krastev v. INS, </em>101 F.3d 1213, 1217 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Matter of R-R-, </em>20 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 547, 551 (BIA 1992); <em>Matter of A-G-, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 502, 506 (BIA 1987). Forced military service can constitute persecution where \u201cdisproportionately severe punishment would result on account of one of the five [listed] grounds,\u201d or where the applicant would be required to commit human rights abuses. <em>Matter of A-G-, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. at 506; <em>see also Foroglou, </em>170 F.3d at 71. On close review of Vucic\u2019s brief and the supporting materials, we are unable to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to disturb the BIA\u2019s finding that Vucic has met neither exception. In reaching its conclusion, the BIA relied on the State Department\u2019s 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Serbia-Montenegro, which states that Montenegro resisted the FRY\u2019s attempts to draft Montenegrin citizens, that efforts to enforce the draft in Montenegro were largely ineffective and have generally ceased, and that Montenegro granted amnesty in 1999 to draft evaders. Vucic has not presented evidence sufficient to compel a contrary conclusion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we are unable to disturb the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We have considered Vucic\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying Vucic\u2019s claim for asylum is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-4\">. In fact, the government acknowledged during oral argument, and counsel for Vucic did not dispute, that subsequent to Montenegro granting amnesty to draft evaders in 1999, the FRY enacted a broad national amnesty for draft evasion as well. <em>See 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, available at </em>http:// www.st ate. gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/eur/8369.htm (\"In February [2001] the Yugoslav Government passed a law that granted amnesty to conscientious objectors and draft evaders who refused to take up arms from April 27, 1992 to October 7, 2000.... As the result of [the] February amnesty ..., draft evaders were able to travel freely without fear of arrest, and many have returned to the country.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
