Defendants (with the exception of Michael Donate, who prevailed at trial) appeal the judgment entered by the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on a jury verdict in Yancey\u2019s favor. Yancey cross-appeals the denial of her motions for injunctive relief, promotion, front-pay, prejudgment interest, and supplemental attorney fees and costs. We have eonsidered the record in light of the arguments of both parties. Finding no reversible error, and concluding that an opinion in this fact-intensive case would lack significant precedential value, we summarily affirm the District Court in all respects. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">. The Honorable Charles A.
