Gonzalez\u2019s plea was obtained pursuant to a plea agreement, which included a provision purportedly waiving Gonzalez\u2019s right to appeal. Citing this provision, the Government moved to dismiss the appeal, which Gonzalez had filed without the assistance of his appointed counsel. His counsel subsequently filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which counsel concluded that there are no non-frivolous issues to present on appeal and that he does not oppose the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal; counsel also requested that he be relieved from his representation of Gonzalez. The Government then moved that this Court summarily affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">By order dated July 1, 2002, we denied the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, finding that Gonzalez\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was at least partially ineffective. We asked the Government and Gonzalez\u2019s counsel to file supplemental letter briefs confined to the issue of whether the district court erred in imposing the term of supervised release that it did. We expressly reserved decision on the <em>Anders </em>motion and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In their supplemental letter briefs, both parties agree that the district court erred in imposing a five-year term of supervised release. The count to which Gonzalez pleaded guilty carries a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). This crime is therefore a Class C felony, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3559(a)(3), and the maximum term of supervised release for Class C felonies is three years, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3583(b)(2); <em>see also </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2) (2001) (providing a two- to three-year term of supervised release for Class C felonies).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">We agree with the parties that there should be a remand for the district court to correct the portion of Gonzalez\u2019s sentence concerning supervised release. We therefore vacate that portion of Gonzalez\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for partial resentencing. The motion of Gonzalez\u2019s counsel to be relieved of his representation of Gonzalez is denied. Finding no other non-frivolous issues to consider on this appeal, the judgment is otherwise affirmed, on the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART, AND IN REMAINING PART, AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
