This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Clements brought suit against several prison officials for allegedly violating his constitutional rights by improperly treating his heart condition, denying him medications, and interfering with his legal mail. A magistrate judge ordered Clements to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies. When Clements failed to do so, the magistrate judge then recommended dismissing the action for that reason. Upon de novo review and over Clements\u2019s objections, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the action. This appeal followed; Clements moves for miscellaneous relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPLRA\u201d) de novo. <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). The PLRA requires a prisoner to exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing federal lawsuits challenging prison conditions, even if the prisoner is seeking monetary damages. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740-41, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001); <em>Wyatt v. Leonard, </em>193 F.3d 876, 877 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Wright v. Morris, </em>111 F.3d 414, 417 (6th Cir.1997). The prisoner must allege and demonstrate that he has exhausted all available administrative remedies and should attach the decision containing the administrative disposition of his grievance to the complaint, or in the absence of written documentation, describe with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome. <em>Knuckles El v. Toombs, </em>215 F.3d 640, 642 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1040, 121 S.Ct. 634, 148 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Wyatt, </em>193 F.3d at 878; <em>Brown v. Toombs, </em>139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.1998) (per curiam). When a prisoner fails to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a civil rights complaint in federal court, or only partially exhausts administrative remedies, dismissal of the complaint is appropriate. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>White v. McGinnis, </em>131 F.3d 593, 595 (6th Cir.1997) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Ohio\u2019s grievance procedure permits an inmate to challenge \u201cany aspect of institutional life.\u201d <em>See </em>Ohio Admin. Code \u00a7 5120-9-31(B). To begin grievance proceedings, the inmate must first attempt to resolve the grievance by contacting the appropriate institutional department or staff member before notifying the inspector of institutional services. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5120-9-31(F); <em>Freeman v. Francis, </em>196 F.3d 641, 644 n. 4 (6th Cir.1999). If the inmate is not satisfied by the inspector\u2019s resolution of the grievance, he may appeal to the chief inspector. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5120-9-31(H)(8). The grievance procedure calls for written responses from both the inspector of institutional services and the chief inspector. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5120-9-31(H)(7) and (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Clements did not demonstrate that he had exhausted all available administrative remedies by the time he filed his complaint. <em>See Brown, </em>139 F.3d at 1104. He did not attach any grievances or dispositions to his complaint, or make particularized averments, but instead summarily stated that he. had exhausted his administrative remedies. After the magistrate judge issued the show cause order, Clements filed a flurry of papers, but did not attach any proof of exhaustion of any claim raised in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Accordingly, all pending motions are denied, and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
