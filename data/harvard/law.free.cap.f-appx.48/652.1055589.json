Preciado\u2019s habeas petition challenges his California guilty plea conviction and sentence of 26 years to life for transporting and possessing methamphetamine, and driving without a license. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a petition for writ of habeas corpus, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-22\">Preciado contends that his trial counsel was ineffective, and that his guilty plea was involuntary, because counsel erroneously advised him that the trial court would strike some of Preciado\u2019s prior convictions and impose' a sentence of only six years. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-23\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Preciado must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test \u201capplies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Preciado must show that defense counsel\u2019s representation was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-24\">A defense counsel\u2019s inaccurate prediction of sentence, without more, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Doganiere v. United States, </em>914 F.2d 165, 168 (9th Cir.1990). While there is an exception for cases involving the \u201cgross mischaraeterization of the likely outcome,\u201d see <em>Iaea v. Sunn, </em>800 F.2d 861, 865 (9th Cir.1986), and <em>Chacon v. Wood, </em>86 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by statute, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), this case is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In <em>Iaea, </em>counsel not only inaccurately predicted the guilty plea sentence, but misinformed the defendant of the consequences of going to trial, <em>see Iaea, </em>800 F.2d at 864-65, while in <em>Chacon, </em>there was a claim of deliberate misrepresentation, <em>see Chacon, </em>36 F.3d at 1462. Preciado does not allege either that counsel misinformed him of the consequences of going to trial or that counsel intentionally misled him. Counsel did move to strike some of Preciado\u2019s prior convictions, and he does not claim that counsel\u2019s efforts in that regard were insufficient. Further, at his change in plea hearing, Preciado acknowledged to the trial court that in pleading guilty no promises had been made to him and that he understood that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b706-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
