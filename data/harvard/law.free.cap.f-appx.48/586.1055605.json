Prison authorities subsequently charged him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>with refusing to submit to urinalysis. Smith denied the charge, but a conduct adjustment board found him guilty after a hearing and revoked 90 days of good time credit. In finding Smith guilty, the conduct board relied on a conduct report submitted by a correctional lieutenant and a laboratory form indicating that Smith had failed to provide a urine sample. After exhausting his state remedies, Smith sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The court denied his petition and Smith appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">As a preliminary matter, we reject Indiana\u2019s contention that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), which requires deference to a state court\u2019s determination of the merits, applies here. We have repeatedly held that prison disciplinary boards are not \u201ccourts\u201d under that provision. <em>Piggie v. McBride, </em>277 F.3d 922, 925-26 (7th Cir. 2002); <em>White v. Ind. Parole Bd., </em>266 F.3d 759, 763-66 (7th Cir.2001). Indiana contends that \u00a7 2254(d)(1) applies without acknowledging this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Piggie </em>and <em>White, </em>and despite recent reminders to it that this position is untenable. <em>See Higgason v. Davis, </em>32 Fed. Appx. 767 (7th Cir.2002) (unpublished); <em>Benford v. Newkirk, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 410 (7th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (labeling Indiana\u2019s position \u201cfrivolous\u201d). As we recently stated in <em>Pannell v. McBride, </em>306 F.3d 499 (7th Cir.2002), the Indiana Attorney General and his deputy attorneys must disclose controlling but adverse precedent, <em>see ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule </em>3.3(a)(3) (2000). If they do not, they will be sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As for the merits, Smith first contends that Indiana violated his Fourth Amendment rights by punishing him for refusing to take a urine test without justification. But \u201cprisoners lack any reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Phelan, </em>69 F.3d 144, 147 (7th Cir.1995); <em>see Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 526-30, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Moreover, though Smith complains that prison officials did not provide any justification for subjecting him to the drug test, they were not required to do so. Inmates cannot demand that a correctional officer justify an order before deciding whether to comply. <em>Soto v. Dickey, </em>744 F.2d 1260, 1267 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201cInmates cannot be permitted to decide which orders they will obey ... \u201d). Accordingly, his disobedience is not constitutionally protected and his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Smith next argues that his due process rights were violated in two ways: the conduct board and administrative reviewers did not specifically address or recite his defense to the charge in their decisions, and he was disciplined without sufficient evidence. Smith\u2019s grievances are governed by \u00a7 2254 because he lost good-time credits. <em>See Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641, 643 (7th Cir. 2001). He was therefore entitled to 24 hours\u2019 written notice of the charge, the opportunity to present a defense to an impartial decision maker, and a written explanation of the decision. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Here, the conduct board and administrative reviewers did provide coherent explanations and the evidentiary basis for their conclusions. That was all the process due.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Next, Smith attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. To avoid arbitrary deprivation of prisoners\u2019 liberty interests, due process requires that \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the conduct board\u2019s findings. <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). In evaluating the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>duct board\u2019s decision, we do not weigh the evidence but must instead determine whether the decision has some factual basis. <em>See id. </em>at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768; <em>McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir.1999). Smith contended that he gave a urine sample, but his account is refuted by the conduct report. <em>See McPherson, </em>188 F.3d at 786 (conduct report alone provides \u201csome evidence\u201d). Although the conduct board also relied on an ambiguous laboratory report (the lieutenant indicated on the form that he had collected the specimen, a fact administrative reviewers dismissed as clerical error), the conduct report alone is sufficient to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Finally, Indiana argues that we should reconsider our decision in <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>216 F.3d 626 (7th Cir.2000), which allowed Smith to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition without first obtaining a certificate of appealability. Indiana raises no new or compelling arguments for overturning <em>Walker, </em>relying instead on our opinion in <em>Moffat v. Broyles, </em>288 F.3d 978 (7th Cir.2002), which noted that several other circuits have rejected <em>Walker\u2019s </em>holding. We acknowledge the different conclusions reached by our sister circuits, but decline Indiana\u2019s invitation to rethink our position in <em>Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
