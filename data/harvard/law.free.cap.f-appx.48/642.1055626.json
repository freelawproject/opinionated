Piper\u2019s habeas petition challenges his sentence of 25 years to life imposed under California\u2019s \u201cThree Strikes\u201d Law, Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 667(b)-(i), following his conviction for firearm possession by a felon. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Piper\u2019s habeas corpus petition on procedural grounds, <em>see James v. Pliler, </em>269 F.3d 1124, 1125 (9th Cir. 2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">Piper\u2019s section 2254 habeas petition was dismissed without prejudice by the district court on the ground that it contained both exhausted and unexhausted claims. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 510, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). Piper alleges on appeal that, prior to dismissing, the district court erred by not treating his petition as fully exhausted, noticing the fact that the Supreme Court of California had denied his unexhausted claims since the initial filing of his federal habeas petition. In the alternative, Piper contends the district court erred in not advising Piper of his right to amend the petition by deleting his unexhausted claims and proceeding with his exhausted claims. Piper asserts that he was subsequently time-barred from resubmitting his petition for habeas review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">The district court did not have the benefit of our decisions issued after its denial of Piper\u2019s section 2254 petition. <em>See James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>269 F.3d at 1125-26; <em>Tillema v. Long, </em>253 F.3d 494, 503-04 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Kelly v. Small, </em>300 F.3d 1159, 1165 (9th Cir.2002). However, Piper has since successfully resubmitted his habeas petition to the district court, which addressed its merits and dismissed it with prejudice. <em>See Piper v. Lamarque, </em>No. 00-02610 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 30, 2001). Piper\u2019s appeal of that dismissal on the merits is currently pending in this court, along with a request for an expanded certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). <em>See Piper v. Lamarque, </em>No. 02-15260 (9th Cir. July 23, 2002) (holding briefing schedule and request for expanded COA in abeyance pending the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Andrade v. Attorney Gen. of Cal., </em>270 F.3d 743 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert, granted sub nom. Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1434, 152 L.Ed.2d 379 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Accordingly, because Piper has already received the habeas relief he sought herein, namely federal habeas review of the merits of his petition, <em>see James, </em>269 F.3d at 1126, it is unnecessary to rule upon the issues brought forth by this appeal. <em>See City of Auburn v. United States Government, </em>154 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir.1998) (ruling that an appeal should be dismissed if the occurrence of intervening events renders a decision unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
