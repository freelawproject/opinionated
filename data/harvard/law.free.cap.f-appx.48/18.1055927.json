We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) <em>de novo. See Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Shabtai filed a complaint in June 2001 against New York City Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, the City of New York, several New York State agencies and organizations, and private individuals alleging: (1) violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d); (2) fraud; (3) conspiracy; and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress. Shabtai sought monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We agree with the district court, for substantially the reasons set forth in its memorandum decision and order, that Shabtai failed to state a RICO cause of action. In addition, dismissal of Shabtai\u2019s state-law claims was proper because either the district court lacked jurisdiction over those claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 or judicial economy, convenience, fairness and comity suggest that the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, if permissible, was not appropriate. <em>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Shabtai\u2019s argues, on appeal, that the district court should have permitted her to amend her complaint. However, Shabtai\u2019s complaint contained substantive problems that an amended complaint would not have cured. <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
