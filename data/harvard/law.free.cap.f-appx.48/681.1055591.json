R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Bogart's request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b735-18\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">Peter D. Bogart appeals pro se from the judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing his adversary proceeding alleging that Byron Z. Moldo violated the automatic stay by acting as a state-appointed receiver to enforce a state court judgment in favor of the California Coastal Commission. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-23\">We lack jurisdiction to address Bogart\u2019s contentions regarding the merits of the BAP\u2019s original entry of judgment because he failed to file a timely notice of appeal or a timely post-judgment tolling motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii). Accordingly, the scope of Bogart\u2019s appeal is limited to the denial of his motion for reconsideration and clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-24\">We have jurisdiction to review the BAP\u2019s denial of Bogart\u2019s motion for reconsideration under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. The BAP did not abuse its discretion in denying Bogart\u2019s motion for reconsideration because he failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly-discovered evidence, or any other basis for relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9024; <em>Nat\u2019l Bank of Long Beach v. Donovan (In re Donovan), </em>871 F.2d 807, 808 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-25\">There is no support in the record for Bogart\u2019s contention that the bankruptcy judge was biased. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a); <em>Commercial Paper Holders v. Hine (In the Matter of Beverly Hills Bancorp), </em>752 F.2d 1334, 1341 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-26\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bogart\u2019s discovery motions. <em>See Paulman v. Gateway Venture Partners III, L.P. (In re Filtercorp, Inc.), </em>163 F.3d 570, 584 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-27\">We deny all pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b735-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
