We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Depew contends that the district court erred in determining there was probable cause in the redacted affidavit filed in support of the search warrant application. We review de novo the district court's determination of probable cause in a case with redacted affidavits. <em>United States v. Huguez-Ibarra, </em>954 F.2d 546, 551 (9th Cir.1992). In determining whether there was a substantial basis for the district court\u2019s finding of probable cause, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Mendonsa, </em>989 F.2d 366, 368 (9th Cir.1993). Although \u201can anonymous tip, without more, does not constitute probable cause,\u201d an anonymous tip \u201ccoupled with independent corroboration of predicted activity,\u201d rather than \u201cinnocent static details\u201d alone, may establish probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 368-69. The facts remaining after redaction included Depew\u2019s 1986 conviction for the same illegal activity, power usage records showing consumption of large amounts of electricity, perpetually covered windows, and the absence of light coming from that same portion of the house, coupled with an anonymous tip that Depew was growing marijuana in a Montana residence that shared the same phone number. We conclude that these facts were sufficient to amount to probable cause. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 244, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (stating that corroboration of information given in anonymous tip suffices for the \u201cpractical, common-sense judgment called for in making a probable cause determination\u201d). Depew\u2019s contention that the district court erred in denying his motion for release pending appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b) is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Next, Depew appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in denying him a two-level downward adjustment in his offense level for demonstrating \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d for his offense pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination as to whether or not the defendant has accepted responsibility for his crime. <em>United States v. Bazuaye, </em>240 F.3d 861, 863 (9th Cir.2001). Having reviewed the relevant facts, we conclude that there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s denial of a downward adjustment. <em>See United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201c[F]ailure to demonstrate contrition and remorse weighs against a finding of acceptance of responsibility.... Lying about offense conduct ... also weighs against acceptance of responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Finally, Depew argues that the district court erred in determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201csafety valve\u201d provision codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), entitling the defendant to a sentence below the statutory minimum, did not apply. We review the district court\u2019s determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Shrestha, </em>86 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s finding that Depew failed to meet the fifth criterion of the statute because he did not truthfully provide to the Government all information and evidence he had concerning the offense is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 926 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) applies only if the defendant meets five criteria).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the district court are therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
