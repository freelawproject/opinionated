The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-25\">Williams pleaded guilty on July 19, 2001, to the 41 counts described above. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>district court sentenced him on October 18, 2001, to 21 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. The court also imposed restitution \u2014 jointly and severally with his codefendant, Teresa Woods \u2014 in the amount of $74,203. The judgment was entered on October 24, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred by: (1) increasing his offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1; and (2) increasing his offense level for a leadership or supervisory role in the offense under USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Upon review, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment because the district court did not err in determining that Williams\u2019s conduct warranted application of the two-level enhancements under both \u00a7 3C1.1 and \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Williams first argues that the district court erred in applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice because of his failure to comply with a grand jury subpoena. This court has generally reviewed <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether the facts constitute an obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dunham, </em>295 F.3d 605, 609 (6th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Mise, </em>240 F.3d 527, 530-31 (6th Cir.2001). However, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001), this court recently concluded that \u201ca deferential standard of review is appropriate in reviewing applications of \u00a7 3C1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369, 389 (6th Cir.2002). Regardless of whether Williams\u2019s case is reviewed <em>de novo </em>or by a more deferential standard, the district court did not err in enhancing his offense level for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">The district court based its application of the enhancement on Williams\u2019s failure to comply with a grand jury subpoena to appear and provide fingerprints, handwriting exemplars, and a photograph. Williams argues on appeal that, because the postal inspector admitted that he actually obtained a set of fingerprints and a photograph of Williams from state law enforcement officials, there was no significant obstruction to the investigation or prosecution of this offense. This argument is unavailing. Section 3C1.1 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-10\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, <em>or attempted to obstruct or impede, </em>the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; ... increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (emphasis added); <em>see also Dunham, </em>295 F.3d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Applying this standard, it is irrelevant whether the postal inspectors were able to obtain part of what they needed from the state because the district court did not err in concluding that Williams <em>attempted </em>to impede or obstruct the investigation by refusing to comply with the grand jury\u2019s subpoena. The <em>Dunham </em>panel affirmed a district court\u2019s application of the obstruction of justice enhancement where the defendant, like Williams, failed to comply with a federal grand jury subpoena requesting handwriting exemplars and photographs. <em>Dunham, </em>295 F.3d at 610. Williams\u2019s first issue on appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">Nor did the district court err in increasing Williams\u2019s offense level by two for his role in the offense. Again, this court\u2019s standard of review for enhancements under \u00a7 3B1.1 is now open to ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>tion, but is not determinative of this case. This court has held that the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense are reviewed for clear error and its legal conclusion in applying the guideline is reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, </em>248 F.3d 506, 515 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 414, 151 L.Ed.2d 815 (2001); <em>United States v. Caseslorente, </em>220 F.3d 727, 734 (6th Cir.2000). However, recent case law states that a district court\u2019s decision as to whether a defendant is entitled to a <em>reduction </em>in offense level under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 for a mitigating role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 396 (6th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Sabino, </em>274 F.3d 1053, 1073 (6th Cir.2001). A single dear-error standard is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Buford </em>holding in which the Court unanimously held that review of a district court\u2019s application of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 should be under a deferential rather than a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>Buford, </em>532 U.S. at 64-66, 121 S.Ct. 1276. Again, the judgment must be affirmed under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The district court based its enhancement upon its finding that Williams used, his codefendant, Teresa Woods, to help carry out his scheme. Based upon this finding, the district court applied the enhancement in accordance with Application Note 2 of the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d This court has since interpreted this note as follows: \u201cWhere the defendant exerts control over <em>at least one participant in a supervisory, </em>managerial, leadership, or organizational capacity, a sentence enhancement is required under \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Gort-DiDonato, </em>109 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir.1997) (emphasis added); <em>see also Caseslorente, </em>220 F.3d at 734-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">This court must defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>890 F.2d 855, 867 (6th Cir.1989). Woods\u2019s testimony, corroborated by other evidence, is clearly sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that Williams supervised Woods during the commission of the offenses and that this role warranted application of the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
