Spatt, <em>Judge) </em>granting defendant-appellee Rubenfeld\u2019s motion to dismiss Gambino\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In the court below, Gambino sought both a declaratory judgment that the defendant, her attorney during her divorce proceedings, had taken her property without due process of law and violated New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 governing attorney conduct, and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 487. The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, finding Gambino\u2019s claims precluded under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine as \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court judgment and noting that even if the court had jurisdiction, Gambino\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1983 and New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 would fail because Gambino failed to demonstrate that Rubenfeld was a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983 and, in light of the failure of her other claims, the court would not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gambino\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that \u201cinferior federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of state courts and that federal review, if any, can occur only by way of a certiorari petition to the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 197 (2d Cir.1996). Gambino seeks a declaration from a federal court that her attorney\u2019s conduct violated state standards of professional conduct and constituted an illegal taking of her property without due process. Because the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>York state courts have already ruled on these arguments in the course of deciding Gambino\u2019s motion to vacate the state judgment, and because all supporting arguments are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s decision ordering her to pay her outstanding attorney\u2019s fees to Rubenfeld, <em>see id. </em>at 199-200, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">For the reasons stated above, the dismissal of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
