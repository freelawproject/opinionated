These statements fall into three categories. The first category consists of the testimony of Linden Levey, Rachel Brooks, and Donald Shank regarding statements made in their presence by Appellant\u2019s co-defendant Darnell Doss. According to these witnesses, Doss said that he was not making an adequate profit from his drug dealing activities and inquired as to whether anyone knew of persons in possession of large amounts of money or drugs that Doss could steal. The second category consists of Levey\u2019s testimony regarding statements Doss made when he returned to Levey\u2019s and Brooks\u2019s residence after committing the robbery. These statements refer to Appellant\u2019s and Doss\u2019s acts of breaking into the victims\u2019 apartment, holding the victims at gunpoint, searching for money and drugs and then departing. The final category consists of Shank\u2019s testimony regarding Doss\u2019s statements prior to the robbery concerning the methods to be used in committing the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We begin with Appellant\u2019s contention that the first category of statements\u2014 those regarding Doss\u2019s drug business and his inquiries regarding potential sources of money or drugs \u2014 constituted inadmissible hearsay. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c) defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed. Evid. 801(c). The question of whether a statement constitutes hearsay is one of law, and thus subject to plenary review by this Court. <em>See United States v. Sallins, </em>993 F.2d 344, 346 (3d Cir.1993); <em>United States v. McGlory, </em>968 F.2d 309, 332 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">If a party does not offer a statement into evidence for the purpose of establishing the statement\u2019s truth, such statement does not constitute hearsay. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>715 F.2d 99, 101 (3d Cir.1983). In the instant case, the Government did not offer either Doss\u2019s statements regarding his drug business or his inquiries about potential sources of drugs and money to prove the truth of the matters asserted. As the attorney for the Government stated at trial, the Government did not offer the drug business statements into evidence to prove that Doss was desperate for money, but rather to show Appellant\u2019s motive for conspiring to commit and committing the robbery in conjunction with Doss. As to Doss\u2019s requests for information, the federal courts of appeal are in agreement that interrogative statements cannot constitute hearsay because they do not assert the existence of facts and thus cannot be used to \u201cprove the truth\u201d of any matter. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 449 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Long, </em>905 F.2d 1572, 1579-80 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Vest, </em>842 F.2d 1319, 1330 (1st Cir.1988). Hence, the District Court correctly admitted the statements and questions in the first category.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">We now treat the second category of statements described above, which concern Appellant\u2019s and Doss\u2019s acts of entering the victims\u2019 apartment, robbing the victims and departing. The Government argues that such statements fall under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the prohibition of hearsay testimony in the Federal Rules of Evidence. The Federal Rules of Evidence define an excited utterance as a \u201cstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the event or condition.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(2). This Court has interpreted Rule 803(2) to require a purported excited utterance to meet four criteria to be admissible: (1) there must have been a startling occasion; (2) the statement must relate to the circumstances of the startling occasion; (3) the declarant must have had the opportunity to personally observe the events; and (4) the declarant must have made the statement while he was under the stress of excitement resulting from the occasion in question. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>254 F.3d 454, 458 (3d Cir.2001). We cannot say that the District Court clearly erred in finding that the robbery constituted a startling or exciting occasion. Since Doss\u2019s statements concerned the events that took place immediately prior to and during the robbery, they clearly related to the circumstances of the event at issue. Doss\u2019s participation in the robbery gave him the opportunity to personally observe it. Finally, given Levey\u2019s description of Doss\u2019s anger and agitation when Doss returned to Levey\u2019s apartment, the District Court did not clearly err in finding that Doss remained under the stress of excitement when he described the events of the robbery to Levey. Hence, Levey\u2019s testimony regarding Doss\u2019s statements upon his return to Levey\u2019s and Brooks\u2019s apartment following the robbery was properly admitted under Rule 803(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Finally, we turn to Doss\u2019s statements concerning the methods to be used in committing the robbery. The Government argues that these statements were admissible under the \u201ccoconspirator\u201d exception to the prohibition on hearsay evidence. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), an out-of-court statement is admissible if it is made \u201cby a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). The proponent of a purported coconspirator statement must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201c(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered were members of the conspiracy; (3) the statement was made in the course of the conspiracy; and (4) the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>156 F.3d 493, 496 (3d Cir.1998); <em>see also McGlory, </em>968 F.2d at 333-34. Here, the record afforded the District Court ample reason to find that Appellant entered into a conspiracy with Doss to commit the robbery. Multiple Government witnesses testified at trial that Appellant agreed to rob the victims\u2019 apartment with Doss, to kick open the door, and to hold the gun in the course of the robbery; furthermore, as noted above, Government witnesses testified as to Doss\u2019s statements after the robbery regarding the actions of Appellant and Doss during the robbery\u2019s commission. As to the making of the statements in the course of the conspiracy, Shank\u2019s testimony suggests that the discussions regarding the method by which the robbery would be committed occurred after Appellant\u2019s and Doss\u2019s agreement to participate in the robbery. Finally, Doss\u2019s statements regarding the location of and methods to be employed in the robbery were in furtherance of the conspiracy, since they were directed toward accomplishing the robbery. Hence, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the out-of-court statements falling into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Appellant next argues that even if the District Court\u2019s admission of the statements described above did not violate the prohibition on hearsay testimony in the Federal Rules of Evidence, the statements\u2019 admission violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him. U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Government responds first that the statements described above that did not fall within the Federal Rules of Evidence\u2019s definition of hearsay do not implicate the Confrontation Clause at all, and second that the statements falling under exceptions to the hearsay rule comport with the Confrontation Clause\u2019s mandate because the exceptions at issue are \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d in nature. The Government is correct on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We first examine the non-hearsay statements at issue in this appeal, which consist of Doss\u2019s discussion of the problems facing his drug business and his questions regarding where he could obtain drugs and money. The Supreme Court\u2019s precedents establish that the Confrontation Clause does not protect a litigant from the introduction of an out-of-court statement where that statement is not offered for the purpose of proving its truth. <em>See United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 394, 398 n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986); <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414-17, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985). As noted above, the Government did not offer Doss\u2019s statements about his drug business and his inquiries about sources of money and drugs to prove their truth. Hence, the introduction of Doss\u2019s statements did not violate Appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We reach the same conclusion regarding Doss\u2019s statements falling under the excited utterance and coconspirator exceptions to the hearsay prohibition. As the Supreme Court has stated, a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him is not violated by the introduction of hearsay testimony where either \u201cthe hearsay statement \u2018falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u2019 or where it is supported by \u2018a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 816-17, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). This Court has held that the excited utterance exception falls into the \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d category. <em>See Kontakis v. Beyer, </em>19 F.3d 110, 119 (3d Cir.1994). The Supreme Court has issued the same holding regarding the co-conspirator exception. <em>See Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987). Therefore, the District Court did not violate the Confrontation Clause by admitting Doss\u2019s excited utterances and Doss\u2019s statements in his capacity as Appellant\u2019s coconspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Appellant contends that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to warrant conviction in three respects. First, he claims that the Government presented insufficient evidence to prove that the gun Appellant used during the robbery had previously traveled in interstate commerce. Second, he claims that the evidence was generally insufficient to warrant conviction on Counts I and II of the indictment. Finally, he claims that the Government failed to prove that he committed the robbery to advance his position in a racketeering enterprise. We address each of these arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">First, Appellant claims that the evidence presented by the Government at trial was insufficient to prove that the gun he used in the commission of the robbery traveled in interstate commerce. Hence, Appellant argues, the Government failed to prove an essential element of its prima facie case against him. Presumably, Appellant is referring to Count III of the offenses alleged in the indictment, which charges Appellant with \u201cpossessing] in or affecting commerce\u201d a firearm while being an \u201cunlawful user of ... any controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>substance\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(3). App. I at 16. We draw this conclusion because Counts I, II, IV and V of Appellant\u2019s indictment do not charge Appellant with violations of statutes requiring that the defendant possess a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">An appellant may prevail on a claim that the evidence against him is insufficient to warrant a conviction if it is impossible that, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>843 F.2d 155, 157 (3d Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). The specific question here is whether a rational trier of fact could have found that Appellant possessed a firearm \u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d in the course of committing the robbery with Doss. The Government argues that the testimony of two Government witnesses at trial was sufficient to allow a rational jury to find that Appellant possessed firearm in or affecting commerce: first, Levey\u2019s testimony that the revolver Appellant used in the commission of the robbery was manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson; second, the testimony of Special Agent Keith Rossman of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to the effect that Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers are manufactured only in Massachusetts and therefore that the revolver in the instant case must have moved in interstate commerce at some point to reach Appellant in Pennsylvania. Appellant rejoins that Ross-man testified that he \u201cnever saw the gun, nor did he have any independent knowledge as to whether the gun was manufactured outside the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 8. This fact, however, does not defeat the possibility that a ration jury could choose to credit both Rossman\u2019s statement that all Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers are manufactured in Massachusetts and Levey\u2019s statement that the gun was a Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson, thus permitting an inference that Appellant\u2019s weapon must have traveled from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Hence, we reject Appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence as to the interstate commerce element of Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> Second, Appellant claims that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the crimes charged in Counts I and II of the indictment. Count I alleges that Appellant, \u201cduring ... and in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime for which he could be prosecuted in a court of the United States ... possessed, used and carried a firearm, and in furtherance of such crimes brandished a firearm\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(A)(ii). App. I at 15. The evidence the Government presented at trial was sufficient to prove the elements of this offense. The Government demonstrated that Appellant and Doss attempted and conspired to rob the victims with the goal of obtaining illegal drugs for Doss\u2019s operation. Attempting and conspiring to pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>sess a controlled substance with intent to distribute such substance are violations of federal law, and hence Appellant could have been prosecuted for such offenses \u201cin a court of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (prohibiting possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute such substance); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (prohibiting conspiracy to possess and attempt to acquire possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute). Furthermore, the Government showed through the testimony of the victims and several of Appellant\u2019s acquaintances that Appellant held a revolver in the course of the robbery. Hence, the Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish the elements of Count I. Count II simply alleges that Appellant conspired with Doss and others to commit the crime charged in Count I and performed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. App. II at 16. Given the Government\u2019s extensive evidence regarding the agreement between Appellant and Doss to rob the victims in order to obtain illegal drugs and their acts in furtherance of that agreement, we must also reject Appellant\u2019s challenge as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Finally, Appellant argues that the Government presented insufficient evidence to prove the allegation in Count IV that Appellant committed an assault \u201cfor the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing [his] position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3). Brief for Appellant at 8. The Government\u2019s evidence is insufficient, Appellant maintains, because (1) the Government failed to prove the existence of a racketeering enterprise at trial, and (2) even if the Government did show that such an enterprise was present, the Government failed to show that Appellant sought to \u201cenhance his status\u201d or act as an \u201cenforcer\u201d in that enterprise. <em>Id. </em>We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Section 1959(b)(1) incorporates the definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(b)(1). Section 1961(1)(A) specifies that racketeering activities include \u201cdealing in a controlled substance\u201d in a manner \u201cchargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A). Section 1959(b)(2)\u2019s definition of an \u201centerprise\u201d includes \u201cany ... group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity ... engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(b)(2). Here, the evidence permitted a reasonable jury to determine that at the time of the robbery, Doss was managing a drug distribution business employing multiple dealers and trafficking in heroin and marijuana. As to the question of whether this activity violated state law and was punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, it suffices to say that the delivery of as little as one gram of heroin was punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of two years under Pennsylvania law in 1999. <em>See </em>35 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) (prohibiting the \u201cdelivery ... [of] a controlled substance\u201d); 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7580(a)(7)(i) (stating that a \u201cperson who is convicted of violating section ... (30)\u201d of Section 780-113(a) \u201cwhere the controlled substance ... is heroin\u201d and the substance containing heroin has an aggregate weight of between 1.0 and 5.0 grams shall receive a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison). Finally, as to the interstate commerce element, this Court has previously stated that the distribution of illegal drugs is an \u201cinherently commercial activity\u201d and therefore \u201csubstantially affects\u201d interstate commerce for the purposes of the Commerce Clause. <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>98 F.3d 105, 107 (3d Cir.1996). As many of the other cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cuits have stated, a substantial effect upon interstate commerce is more than enough to establish the interstate commerce element of Section 1959(b)(2); indeed, a de minimis effect will suffice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>118 F.3d 1344, 1347 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 674 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Doherty, </em>867 F.2d 47, 68 (1st Cir.1989). Since the enterprise at issue here was engaged in drug trafficking, the interstate commerce requirement of Section 1959(b)(2) is met. The evidence is therefore sufficient to show that an enterprise was present for the purposes of Section 1961(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Appellant argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that he committed an assault in the course of the robbery for the purpose of \u201cgaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing his position\u201d in Doss\u2019s drug enterprise. The Government correctly responds that Section 1959(a)(3) only requires it to demonstrate that a defendant committed an assault for the purpose of furthering a criminal enterprise\u2019s goals to show that the defendant acted to \u201cmaintain or increase\u201d his position in that enterprise. <em>See United States v. Tse, </em>135 F.3d 200, 206 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Concepcion, </em>983 F.2d 369, 381 (2d Cir.1992). The evidence showed that Doss told Appellant that the reason he wanted to commit the robbery was to shore up Doss\u2019s drug distribution business, that Appellant agreed to assist Doss with full knowledge of Doss\u2019s goals, and that Appellant assaulted Schmader to facilitate the commission of the robbery. A rational trier of fact could find based on such evidence that Appellant committed the assault for the purpose of furthering Doss\u2019s ends. We therefore reject Appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence against him as to Count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Appellant contends that the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by failing to rule on his complaints during trial regarding the adequacy of his attorney. Where a criminal defendant requests new counsel or expresses a desire to represent himself, the trial court is obligated to inquire as to whether the reasons for the defendant\u2019s request \u201cconstitute good cause and ... [are] sufficiently substantial to justify a continuance of the trial in order to allow new counsel to be obtained,\u201d and to ensure that any decision to proceed pro se is accompanied by an \u201cintelligent and competent\u201d waiver of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 187 (3d Cir.1982); <em>see also Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>United States v. Peppers, </em>302 F.3d 120,---, 2002 U.S.App. LEXIS 17337, at *26-28 (3d Cir.2002). However, the Sixth Amendment does not require a trial court to rule on a criminal defendant\u2019s complaints regarding his counsel where he has neither requested new counsel nor asked to proceed pro se. <em>See United States v. lies, </em>906 F.2d 1122, 1131 (6th Cir.1990); <em>Moreno v. Estelle, </em>717 F.2d 171, 175 (5th Cir.1983). In the instant case, Appellant told the District Court that he was \u201cnot happy with the representation\u201d and that he \u201craised some questions that were not asked,\u201d but he did not ask to have his counsel replaced or to represent himself. App. III at 6. Hence, the District Court did not err in declining to rule on Appellant\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Appellant finally argues that the United States lacks standing to bring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>criminal action against him in federal court because the indictment fails to present a \u201ccas[e]\u201d or \u201ccontroversy]\u201d as required by Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. U.S. Const. Art. Ill, sec. 2. Presumably, this is because, in Appellant\u2019s view, his crimes did not inflict the \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cimminent\u201d injury in fact\u201d on the United States that Article III requires civil litigants to demonstrate to have their claims adjudicated in federal court <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). This contention is frivolous. As sovereign, the United States has standing to prosecute violations of valid criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">. <em>See </em>App. I at 15 (describing Count I, which charges the use of a firearm \"in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime for which [Appellant] could be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)); <em>id. </em>at 15-16 (describing Count II, which charges conspiracy to use a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o)); <em>id. </em>at 16 (describing Count IV, which charges assault with a dangerous weapon for the purpose of entering or increasing Appellant's position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3)); <em>id. </em>at 16-17 (describing Count V, which charges non-firearms-related witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
