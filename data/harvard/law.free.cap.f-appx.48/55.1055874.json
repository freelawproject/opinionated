Grimsley appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court plainly erred in calculating his base offense level at 24 under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-27\">On November 7, 2000, Grimsley accompanied William Satterfield to the post office in Florence, South Carolina, where Satterfield picked up a package in which postal authorities had discovered 42.5 milliliters of LSD. Grimsley and Satterfield were both arrested and Grimsley\u2019s truck was searched. In the truck, agents found 104.14 grams of marijuana in four plastic bags, seven .30 caliber bullets, and a box of 9 mm bullets. Grimsley was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>federal drug and firearms offenses; he pled guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In sentencing Grimsley, the district court applied USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which provides a base offense level of 24 where the defendant has two prior felony convictions for either a controlled substance offense or a crime of violence. The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as used in \u00a7 2K2.1 is defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 to USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.5). Grimsley had a 1992 conviction for attempted burglary for which he received a sentence of four years suspended to three years probation. He also had a 1999 conviction for pointing and presenting a firearm for which he was given a three-year sentence suspended to three years probation. Grimsley asserted at sentencing that the correct base offense level was 17 because the two qualifying convictions were both non-violent offenses and because the attempted burglary was a misdemeanor under state law, but he withdrew his objection. The district court sentenced him to the minimum term of imprisonment under the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On appeal, Grimsley argues that the district court erred in finding that he had two felony convictions for crimes of violence that qualified him for a base offense level of 24 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Because Grimsley withdrew his objection to the guideline calculation in the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A crime of violence is defined in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Application Note 1 to \u00a7 4B1.2 defines a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d as \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Grimsley contends that he had only one prior conviction for a crime of violence because the 1992 attempted burglary conviction was really a misdemeanor conviction for entering a house without breaking with intent to steal under S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-13-70 (Law. Co-op. 1976). Even assuming the truth of this assertion (for which Grimsley provides no documentation), the district court did not plainly err in treating the offense as a crime of violence. First, it involved a substantial risk of physical injury to another. <em>See United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991) (breaking and entering of temporarily unoccupied house is crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Moreover, Grimsley\u2019s 1992 offense was punishable by more than a year of imprisonment. His offense was punishable \u201cin the discretion of the court\u201d when Grimsley was sentenced in 1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, the South Carolina Code provided a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment for felonies for which no specific punishment was directed. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-25-20 (Law. Co-op. 1976) (formerly \u00a7 17-552). For all other offenses where no punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ment was provided, the court was to impose \u201csuch sentence as is conformable to the common usage and practice in this State, according to the nature of the offense, and not repugnant to the Constitution.\u201d S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-25-30 (Law. Co-op. 1976). This section, formerly \u00a7 17-553, was interpreted by the South Carolina Supreme Court to permit a sentence of up to ten years for non-felony offenses for which no specific punishment is provided. <em>State v. Fogle, </em>256 S.C. 149, 181 S.E.2d 483, 484-85 (S.C.1971); <em>State v. Hill, </em>254 S.C. 321, 175 S.E.2d 227, 231-32 (S.C. 1970); <em>see also Wood v. State, </em>483 F.2d 149,150 (4th Cir.1973) (maximum sentence permitted \u201cin the discretion of the court\u201d for South Carolina misdemeanor offense of making obscene phone calls was ten years). Thus Grimsley\u2019s 1992 offense, whether characterized as attempted burglary or entering with intent to steal, was a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Grimsley also argues that, because the 1992 conviction was for a misdemeanor offense, he retained his right to possess a firearm and ammunition under state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Grimsley further argues that state law should control the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000), defines a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d to exclude \u201cany State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\u201d Here Grimsley confuses the requirements for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as used and defined in the sentencing guidelines with the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000) (providing aggravated sentence for armed career criminal). As explained above, Grimsley\u2019s 1992 conviction was a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2 and, consequently, the district court did not plainly err in using base offense level 24 under \u00a7 2K2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">.
