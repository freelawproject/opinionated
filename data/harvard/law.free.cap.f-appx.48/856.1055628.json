Kates, as Executrix of the Estate of the late Lewis Kates Esq., appeal the District Court\u2019s order of August 16, 2001, in which that court granted the Motion to Amend Judgment filed by Friends of Beth Rivka Schools for Girls, Inc. (\u201cBeth Rivka\u201d), thereby vacating the court\u2019s prior order of March 19, 1998 insofar as it applied to Beth Rivka. The court granted the Motion to Amend based upon its conclusion that Beth Rivka\u2019s presence negated diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court concluded that it therefore could not order Beth Rivka\u2019s compliance with the June 24, 1993 \u201cProceeds Stipulation.\u201d This appeal followed. For the reasons that follow, we will reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties and the District Court, we need not reiterate the protracted and tortured history of this dispute except insofar as it may assist our brief discussion of the jurisdictional issue before us, and place our analysis in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">This saga originally involved a fairly typical dispute over insurance proceeds purportedly owed under an insurance policy on real estate in New York. It has festered into a dispute that the district court aptly characterized as \u201cextremely litigious, angry, and bitter.\u201d <em>Dickler v. Cigna Property and Cas. Co., </em>1998 WL 126938, at *1 (E.D.Pa. March 19, 1998). Despite its protracted nature, and the underlying charitable purposes the parties profess to advance, the prospects for the amicable resolution of this litigation in the foreseeable future are no brighter than its dim history.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">The insurance phase of this lawsuit was settled nearly a decade ago when, on June 24, 1993, the District Court entered an order entitled \u201cStipulation Re: Allocation of Proceeds of Settlement.\u201d Appellants and Machne Israel, Inc. signed that \u201cProceeds Stipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">The Proceeds Stipulation required Machne Israel to build a school within a specified time frame and provided that Appellants would contribute $2,875.000.00 for this purpose. The Stipulation provided that Machne Israel would repay the funds to Appellants if the building was not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>pleted within the specified time frame. In a prior appeal, we held that the Proceeds Stipulation was the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and we approved the Stipulation. <em>See Dickler v. CIGNA Property and Casualty Co., </em>Nos. 96-1809 and 96-1935, slip op. at 5, 129 F.3d 1254,-(3d Cir. September 24,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The issue before us is whether the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the reversion provision of the Proceeds Stipulation and order Beth Rivka to repay the funds it had received to build the still uncompleted school. The District Court reached that conclusion with understandable reluctance inasmuch as it gave Beth Rivka a substantial windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">As the District Court correctly noted, \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (citations omitted). Within that jurisdiction, however, the district courts have inherent power to modify and enforce compliance with properly entered consent decrees. <em>See Holland v. New Jersey Dept, of Corrections, </em>246 F.3d 267, 277 (3d Cir.2001); <em>see also Spallone v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625,107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990); <em>United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>391 U.S. 244, 248-49, 88 S.Ct. 1496, 20 L.Ed.2d 562 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Here, the District Court entered an order stating that the Proceeds Stipulation was \u201capproved and <em>shall be enforceable as a Final Order.\u201d </em>App. at 42 (emphasis added). That order was therefore structured so that \u201ca breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.\u201d <em>Kokkonen, </em>511 U.S. at 381. Thus, the District Court incorporated language \u201cretaining jurisdiction\u201d into the consent decree. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">However, Beth Rivka seeks to escape the court\u2019s ability to enforce the settlement by arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation against it given its common residency with plaintiffs. Beth Rivka\u2019s argument is identical to one we rejected in <em>Lasky v. Continental Products Corp., </em>804 F.2d 250, 254 (3d Cir.1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, we held that the district court\u2019s authority to grant a Rule 60(b) motion to allocate funds under a consent decree was ancillary to its authority to approve the decree, and the court\u2019s jurisdiction was therefore not destroyed by the nondiversity of the party seeking the modification. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-15\">The power of a court to enter a consent decree emanates from its authority to adjudicate the rights of the parties in the first instance. The authority thereafter to modify the consent decree similarly derives directly from the court\u2019s initial exercise of jurisdiction over the dispute. Put otherwise, a court has inherent power to modify a consent decree that it initially had the power to approve. Thus, jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s motion to allocate is not contingent upon the diversity of the parties seeking modification of the consent decree. Rather, the district court\u2019s power to consider the motion at all is based on the consent decree itself which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>properly entered pursuant to the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\"><em>Lasky, </em>804 F.2d at 254 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Here, it is clear that the court had the initial authority to approve the Proceeds Stipulation, and we affirmed the district court in a prior appeal. Accordingly, Beth Rivka\u2019s residency is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Furthermore, though conceded on appeal, we hold that the District Court could properly exercise <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over Beth Rivka and thereby enforce the reversion in the Proceeds Stipulation. At oral argument counsel for Beth Rivka conceded that it willingly subjected itself to the authority of the District Court, and it could hardly argue otherwise. Though not a \u201cparty,\u201d it has fully involved itself in this litigation. Beth Rivka has even taken an appeal from prior orders of the district court, and argued those orders before this court. It has never sought to limit its appearance to contest the court\u2019s <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over it. Accordingly, the District Court clearly had <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over Beth Rivka, and its order of March 19, 1998 was ancillary to the subject matter jurisdiction it had when it approved the Proceeds Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Therefore, we will reverse the order of August 16, 2001, and remand the matter to the District Court so that it may entertain the application pending before it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">. Beth Rivka, like plaintiffs, is a New York entity. Defendant Cigna is a Pennsylvania entity, and defendant Pacific Employers Insurance Company is a California entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-13\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The district court had diversity jurisdiction over the underlying lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Neither Wantagh Union Free School District or CIGNA Property and Casualty Company participated in this appeal. We also note Machne Israel Inc. has petitioned for a writ of mandamus concerning the same court order at issue here. <em>See In re: Machne Israel, Inc., </em>No. 02-1962, argued May 23, 2002. Although this opinion necessarily refers to Machne Israel in discussing the underlying facts of this case, we express no view here as to the disposition of the Machne Israel petition which will be decided independently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-10\">. Ironically, we began our discussion in <em>Lasky </em>as follows: \u201cThis unfortunate appeal is again before us for resolution due to the parties\u2019 inability to reach a prompt settlement of their dispute.\u201d 804 F.2d at 251-2. We could say the same here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b913-11\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">I concur with the majority opinion, but write separately to clarify that our ancillary jurisdiction is limited to the district court\u2019s ability to enforce the consent decree against Beth Rivka. <em>See Lasky v. Continental Products Corp., </em>804 F.2d 250, 254 (3d Cir.1986). Although the district court held that Beth Rivka was not a party to the consent decree, the district court has the power to enforce the decree against Beth Rivka. Previously, the district court found that Appellants formally assigned to Beth Rivka their right in all proceeds which were or became due from the insurer in Appellants\u2019 action then pending against the insurer. <em>Dickler v. Cigna, </em>No. 90-4288,1996 WL 437048, at 1* (E.D.Pa. Aug. 2, 1996). It was these proceeds that were distributed by the consent decree. Beth Rivka is thus bound by the consent decree, though it is not a party. <em>Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, </em>414 U.S. 168, 179, 94 S.Ct. 414, 38 L.Ed.2d 388 (1973); <em>Behrens v. Skelly, </em>173 F.2d 715, 718-19 (3d Cir.1949) (applying New York law); <em>United States v. Premises Known as 2930 Greenleaf Street, Allentown, Pa., </em>920 F.Supp. 639, 645-46 (E.D.Pa.1996) (applying Pennsylvania law); 18A Charles Alan Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R.
