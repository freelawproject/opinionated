Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>239 F.3d 283, 288 (2d Cir.2001). After a two-day hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>district court found no evidence that counsel had coerced Davis\u2019s guilty plea and concluded that Davis had not been denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel as a result of counsel\u2019s refusal to testify at the plea-withdrawal hearing regarding his alleged coercion of his client. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cWhether a defendant\u2019s representation violates the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Schwarz, </em>283 F.3d 76, 90-91 (2d Cir.2002), To prove adverse effect for purposes of raising a presumption of prejudice under <em>Cuyler, </em>a claimant must point to an actual lapse in representation: \u201csome plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic [that] might have been pursued, and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney\u2019s other loyalties or interests.\u201d <em>Armienti v. United States, </em>234 F.3d 820, 824 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). To show adverse effect in this case, Davis essentially must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conflicted silence at the plea-withdrawal hearing resulted from his desire to conceal the fact that he had coerced Davis\u2019s plea, <em>see Lopez v. Scully, </em>58 F.3d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1995), rather than from something more innocuous, such as an unwillingness to testify regarding disagreements with Davis over the wisdom of a plea or other legal strategies, <em>see United States v. White, </em>174 F.3d 290, 294-95 (2d Cir.1999). Thus, the inquiry here, as below, \u201cnecessarily implicates the merits of the plea withdrawal motion,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>239 F.3d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The district court did not err in concluding that counsel did not coerce the plea. During his plea allocution, Davis admitted his guilt under oath and in his own words, and stated that his plea was free and voluntary, that no threats or untoward promises had been made to induce his plea, and that he was satisfied with the advice of counsel. A \u201cstrong presumption of verity\u201d attaches to admissions of guilt at a plea allocution. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d 1095, 1101 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977)). Although since his guilty plea Davis has consistently protested his innocence of the charges, a claim of innocence is not a basis for withdrawing a guilty plea unless supported by evidence. \u201cA defendant\u2019s bald statements that simply contradict what he said at his plea allocution are not sufficient grounds to withdraw the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Kirsch, </em>239 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir.2001). Davis\u2019s waiting nearly two months before moving to withdraw his plea does not suggest the swift change of heart that can indicate a plea made in haste or confusion. <em>Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Davis further alleges that counsel insisted that he plead guilty and threatened that he would not prepare for trial. Yet testimony at the hearing below established that counsel had had numerous discussions with the government about discovery, evidence, and witnesses, had engaged in telephone discussions with Davis, and had met with him on a number of occasions to discuss his case. The district court found, and we have no reason to doubt, that Davis\u2019s testimony did not credibly rebut this testimony. <em>See United States v. Moree, </em>220 F.3d 65, 71 (2d Cir.2000) (noting that \u201ccommonplace\u201d allegations that a court-appointed attorney \u201cis not paying sufficient attention to his case, has not come to see him in prison, has not undertaken sufficient investigation, is not making necessary motions, is not caking witnesses, or is trying to induce the defendant to plead gukty\u201d do not <em>\u201cipso facto </em>result[] in a conflict of interest\u201d). Davis\u2019s other conclusory allegations do not suggest that counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>doing more than vigorously urging him to accept a plea agreement in a case that, in his legal opinion, was hopeless. <em>See United States v. Juncal </em>245 F.3d 166, 172 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cNor does defense counsel\u2019s blunt rendering of an honest but negative assessment of appellant\u2019s chances at trial, combined with advice to enter the plea, constitute improper behavior or coercion that would suffice to invalidate a plea.\u201d). In short, there were no physical threats, no economic incentives, and no mental pressures that would have rendered Davis incapable of rationally assessing his options. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Davis also contends that he felt subjectively coerced into pleading guilty by \u201cthe extreme unease regarding the prospect of a trial where [he] did not feel \u2018ready\u2019 to proceed ... and the thought of losing something of value to him (his property)\u2014 \u201d We need not decide whether this contention is barred by the law of the case doctrine, as the government argues, because we find that it is without merit. Commonplace feelings of being \u201c \u2018coerced\u2019 in the lay sense of the word by an attorney\u2019s recommendation to plead guilty rather than proceed to trial\u201d are not \u201cvalid grounds for withdrawing [a] plea.\u201d <em>Juncal, </em>245 F.3d at 174; <em>cf. Moree, </em>220 F.3d at 72 (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s statement that he was \u2018scared\u2019 [by counsel\u2019s advice to take a plea or face a long prison term] is understandable, but is not attributed to any misconduct of his attorney.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">To the extent that Davis claims he felt subjectively coerced by forces other than his counsel \u2014 notably, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant him a short adjournment to resolve his differences with counsel and to discuss trial preparedness \u2014 this argument, too, fails on the merits. \u201cWhen a guilty plea is challenged as being the product of coercion, our concern is not solely with the subjective state of mind of the defendant, but also with the constitutional acceptability of the external forces inducing the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Iaea v. Sunn, </em>800 F.2d 861, 866 (9th Cir.1986); <em>cf. Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 115-16, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985) (\u201cAlthough sometimes framed as an issue of \u2018psychological fact,\u2019 the dispositive question of the voluntariness of a confession has always had a uniquely legal dimension.\u201d) (internal citation omitted). A motion to adjourn the start of trial is left to the discretion of the trial judge, <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>101 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir.1996), and \u201c[t]o show abuse of that discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s denial of a continuance was arbitrary and substantially impaired his defense,\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. 1985). On the record before us, Davis has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">In sum, Davis has not demonstrated a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d why the trial court should have permitted him to withdraw his guilty plea, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e), and has not \u201craise[d] a significant question about the voluntariness\u201d of the plea, <em>United States v. Torres, </em>129 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.1997). We therefore agree with the district court that counsel did not coerce Davis into pleading guilty, and that counsel\u2019s conflict of interest at the hearing on Davis\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea did not result in unconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We have considered Davis\u2019s other arguments and find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
