It is</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Ordered and Adjudged </em>that the appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The appeal is dismissed because this court has no jurisdiction to consider it. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals over district court actions is limited to review of \u201cfinal decisions.\u201d There is no \u201cfinal decision\u201d in this case, because the District Court has yet to decide whether United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d) is immune from suit pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d) on appellee\u2019s breach of contract claim, and the District Court has yet to determine whether UAE is a \u201cperson\u201d susceptible to suit under the D.C. Human Rights Act (\u201cDCHRA\u201d). Whether UAE can be sued under the DCHRA depends on whether UAE is a \u201cperson\u201d for the purpose of the DCHRA a question yet to be addressed by the District Court. And whether UAE is immune from suit under the FSIA depends on whether appellee\u2019s employment was \u201ccommercial activity\u201d under the Act, an issue yet to be resolved by the District Court. If the District Court resolves the FSIA issue against appellee, the appellee\u2019s DCHRA claim against UAE will fail as well; if, however, the District Court resolves the FSIA issue against UAE, a question will remain as to whether UAE is subject to liability under the DCHRA. Furthermore, UAE\u2019s attempt to gain interlocutory review by characterizing the matter as amenable to review under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine, <em>see Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>487 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Carp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), fails because the District Court has not \u201cconclusively determine[d] the disputed question\u201d relating to either the DCHRA or the FSIA. 437 U.S. at 468. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction and the case is hereby remanded to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition <em>for </em>rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
