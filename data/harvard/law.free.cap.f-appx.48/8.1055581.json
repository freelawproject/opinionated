He was sentenced to 121 months of incarceration, which he is now serving, three years' of supervised release, and a $200 special assessment. On appeal, Davis argues that (1) the district court improperly admitted his post-arrest statements; (2) the remaining evidence supporting his conviction was insufficient; and (3) the district court improperly applied various enhancements and failed to grant a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Davis argues that his post-arrest statements, in which he confessed to the robbery, should have been suppressed because he had been smoking marijuana and drinking the night of his arrest and thus could not have knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights. We disagree. After a hearing, the district court denied Davis\u2019s motion to suppress his post-arrest statements, crediting testimony that Davis had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and had knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. Reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>see United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d 984, 972 (2d Cir.1990), we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Davis\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary, and thus we affirm its decision to admit the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Because we find that appellant\u2019s statements were properly admitted, there is no need to address appellant\u2019s second claim that, absent his post-arrest confession, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Appellant\u2019s third claim is that the court committed reversible error in its determination of sentencing enhancements. Specifically, Davis contends that the district court erred in its determination that the amount of loss in the robbery was $15,000, that it was foreseeable that the robbery would result in the discharge of a firearm, that the gunshot wounds inflicted upon two victims constituted serious bodily injury, and that Davis did not play a minor role. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">When considering sentencing appeals, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact, including assessments of reasonable foreseeability, for clear error and \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>see also United States v. Molina, </em>106 F.3d 1118, 1121 (2d Cir.1997) (determinations of reasonable foreseeability in sentencing reviewed for clear error). The district court determined the amount of loss from the testimony of two accomplices in the robbery and Davis\u2019s own post-arrest statements. It found that discharge of a weapon was foreseeable because the robbery was \u201ca particularly violent attack on a public facility.\u201d It found that the victims\u2019 gunshot wounds to the chest, shoulder, and leg required medical intervention and thus constitute serious bodily injury. Whether or not medical intervention of the sort contemplated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment (n.1(j)), occurred, the assault, which included pistol-whipping, clearly inflicted extreme physical pain that warranted the enhancement. Finally, the district court rejected Davis\u2019s request for a minor-role adjustment on the basis of evidence showing that Davis was a \u201cvoluntary and significant participant in the actual robbery.\u201d The district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. We find that the district court did not err in determining the amount of loss, that the discharge of a firearm was foreseeable, that the victims\u2019 gunshot wounds constituted serious bodily injury, and that Davis played more than a minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
