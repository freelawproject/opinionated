Hill, United States Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">After James Taylor, recreation director for the City of Burlington, placed a videotape in the restroom of the Recreation Building, Lynn McTaggart, along with other plaintiffs videotaped by Taylor, brought suit against Taylor, the City Personnel Director Richard Patrick, and the City of Burlington. McTaggart currently appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants Patrick and the City of Burlington, dismissing McTaggart\u2019s state law claims of negligent supervision and hiring, as well as her claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u201c \u00a7 1983\u201d). We affirm. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">1. McTaggart did not present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that either Patrick or the City of Burlington \u201cknew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known\u201d that Taylor \u201cpresented a risk of danger to others,\u201d <em>Thompson v. Everett Clinic, </em>71 Wash.App. 548, 860 P.2d 1054, 1058 (1993) (citations omitted), and that the \u201cfield of danger\u201d he created included the videotaping of women and children in the restroom of the Recreation Building, <em>McLeod v. Grant Sch. Dist., </em>42 Wash.2d 316, 255 P.2d 360, 363 (1953). Although McTaggart alleges that Taylor had a known history of \u201cpeeping,\u201d the only evidence of prior \u201cpeeping\u201d activity is supplied by a 1974 incident. According to McTaggart, Patrick knew that Taylor was arrested for trespass, but not convicted, after looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>into a neighbor\u2019s window in 1974. Not only is a 23-year-old arrest for trespass scant notice that Taylor would videotape women in 1997, but also, policies established by Washington state law at the time of Taylor\u2019s employment discouraged Patrick and the City of Burlington from considering this incident. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 10.97.050 (2001) (restricting the dissemination of non-conviction data). <em>See also </em>Wash. Admin. Code. \u00a7 162-16-060 (repealed 1999) (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of criminal convictions more than 7 years old).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Although McTaggart points to other incidents, such as Taylor\u2019s discussion of adult videos with a female coworker and dissemination of a sexually explicit questionnaire, there is an insufficient nexus between these, arguably inappropriate, but likely legal, activities and Taylor\u2019s future utterly lawless behavior. <em>Cf. Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, </em>92 F.3d 831, 837 (9th Cir.1996) (police department could not for-see that police officer with history of violence would \u201cbecome a free-lance criminal.\u201d) Therefore, summary judgment on McTaggart\u2019s state law claims was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">2. McTaggart\u2019s contention that the City of Burlington is hable, under \u00a7 1983, for Taylor\u2019s videotaping activities also fails, because McTaggart\u2019s injuries did not result from a municipal policy or custom. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). McTaggart cannot, as a matter of law, establish that the City of Burlington had a policy of negligent supervision or retention: Because McTaggart failed to demonstrate facts sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the state law claims of negligent supervision and retention, she necessarily failed to meet the higher burden of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to a specific known risk that governs negligent supervision and retention claims brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We likewise reject the contention that Taylor\u2019s clandestine videotaping activities themselves represented official municipal \u201cpolicy.\u201d Whatever authority Taylor possessed as the recreation director, his decision to place a video camera in the women\u2019s restroom clearly exceeded that authority. Because Taylor did not have policymaking authority with respect to the particular action that caused McTaggart\u2019s injuries <em>(e.g. </em>the videotaping), the City of Burlington is not liable. <em>Pernbaur v. City of Cincinnati </em>475 U.S. 469, 481, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986); <em>Christie v. Iopa, </em>176 F.3d 1231, 1236-37 (9th Cir. 1999). The City of Burlington was entitled to summary judgment on McTaggart\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">3. Defendant Patrick is also entitled to summary judgment on McTaggart\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. In considering whether Patrick is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, we first consider, as a threshold question, whether McTaggart\u2019s allegations, taken in the fight most favorable to her, show that Patrick\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>Billington v. Smith, </em>292 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (2002) (quoting <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). Although McTaggart alleges that Patrick\u2019s conduct in negligently supervising and retaining Taylor violated her constitutional right to privacy, we have concluded that McTaggart\u2019s allegations, taken in the fight most favorable to her, failed to show that Patrick\u2019s conduct caused a constitutional violation. Therefore, McTaggart\u2019s claim fails at the threshold step, and we need not go on to consider whether McTaggart\u2019s privacy right was clearly established, nor whether Patrick\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>conduct, even if violative of McTaggart\u2019s rights, was nonetheless reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Because Patrick caused no constitutional violation, he is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b292-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
