Todd. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">In 2000, Servin-Gomez pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States after being convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), and was sentenced to 77 months of imprisonment. This court affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Servin-Gomez, </em>No. 00-5750, 2001 WL 1141350 (6th Cir. Sept.17, 2001). Thereafter, Judge Todd denied a motion to vacate sentence Servin-Gomez filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Servin-Gomez did not appeal that judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-19\">Next, Servin-Gomez filed documents that Judge Todd construed as a civil action against Judge Todd under the authority of <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 390-97, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Judge Todd ordered that the documents be filed as a new civil action and recused himself. The case was assigned to Judge Gibbons, who reviewed plaintiffs filings and dismissed the action as frivolous. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-20\">On appeal, plaintiff advances only frivolous claims that Judge Todd lacked authority to adjudicate his motion to vacate sentence filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Upon de novo review, <em>see McGore v. Wriggles-worth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997), we will affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal filed March 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
