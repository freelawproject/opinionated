Andrews argues that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; and (2) the district court erred by failing to make specific findings regarding its denial of a reduction in sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4). For the reasons discussed herein, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">In January, 1998, Andrews began serving a sentence in the Texas Department of Corrections for delivery of a controlled substance. On April 24, 1998, United States Circuit Judge Gilbert Merritt received a letter addressed to him in his Nashville, Tennessee chamber from a \u201cMark Andrew.\u201d The letter reads as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">Mr. Merritt, I am writing to you in concern of several things you have pulled and are pulling on the White Race. You have planned your next attack on the White Race for years now and its time for you to pay the price, you yellow belly Jew Loving Bastard. Are you aware of Robert Matthews coming back and is alive and well? Yes, he is, and so is Vicki Weaver, and that have come back to life through our Aryan race and now it\u2019s time for you and your people to pay for all the wrongs you have done to my people. Just like the Waco deal. Every one knows it was a setup, and all of you are involved, and <em>now </em>it\u2019s time for y\u2019all to pay, and you will pay, with your life, and then your so precious family, and that comes from my Aryan heart. You Jew-loving punk. And let me guess, your wife doesn\u2019t know about your female friend who you seen a couple of weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">It doesn\u2019t matter now because me and my people are coming for <em>you </em>and <em>your </em>family, and it\u2019s going to be a nice party for our Aryan people to watch and hear all of your deaths. It\u2019s time, Mr. Merritt. Your place is not secure enough for my people. Because we have your every move down and we, the Aryans of America, will stay true to our heritage. Because the day that Satan comes, all you Jew-ass loving punks, who kiss ass with the niggers, and are going to try to take over. And that will never come, Mr. Merritt, because you may be taken off count before you read this, and if not, then only in a few hours, and you will be dead. Just like the other Jew-lovers, and your heads will be served on a platter to the Governor during his daily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>luncheon. And your family will be tormented a slowly death, and that is the Aryan truth. Because Matthew and Weaver says so. Weiss Stoltz; Werhmacht; Rahowa. Yours truly, Mr. Mark Andrew, Roberts Matthews, and Vickie Weaver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Sara Pettit, Judge Merritt\u2019s administrative assistant, recognized the letter to be a death threat and contacted the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service. Deputy John Hargis of the Marshal\u2019s Service took the letter and tracked the return address on the envelope, which read, \u201cMark Andrew, inmate no. 814104, P.O. Box 100, Huntsville, Texas.\u201d The number was assigned by the correction officials to the defendant, who is also known as Mark Andrew. Hargis then forwarded the letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Special Agent Wilson of the Memphis FBI office submitted the letter to Valerie Betty, a fingerprint specialist. JA at 70. Betty concluded that the fingerprints on the letter matched those of Andrews.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On May 7, 1998, FBI Special Agent Stanley Burke visited the James B. Aired Prison Unit in Iowa Park, Texas to interview Andrews. Andrews agreed to meet with Burke and signed a waiver form acknowledging that he knowingly declined to be represented by counsel. In their interview, Andrews admitted to Burke that he had authored the letter. When asked why, Andrews replied that he was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and did not like Judge Merritt for anti-Semitic reasons. Andrews also stated that he disliked Judge Merritt because he is a member of the federal government. Andrews added that Judge Merritt had made some judgments that adversely affected his relatives, though he refused to elaborate. Andrews told Burke that he could not promise that no harm would come to Judge Merritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On November 18, 1998, a federal grand jury indicted Andrews on one count of threatening to harm the family member of a federal judge on account of his performance of his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(A) and one count of threatening to retaliate against a federal judge on account of the performance of his official duties in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">On May 23 and 24, 2000, Andrews was tried before Judge Nixon in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. At trial, the government introduced Pettit\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the letter sent to Judge Merritt, Burke\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of his interview with Andrews, and Betty\u2019s fingerprint testimony. In addition, the government presented the testimony of Deputy Hargis and Special Agent Wilson regarding their investigation of Andrews, along with the testimony of Robert Gambrell, the mail room supervisor for the Texas Department of Corrections. Gambrell testified that he recorded the mailing of a letter in his log book that was sent by Andrews to a \u201cJudge Merritt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Andrews was the sole defense witness. He testified that he sent the threatening letter to Judge Merritt in the hope of effecting a prison transfer to Nashville. He stated that just prior to his incarceration on drug charges in January 1998, he tested positive for HIV. Andrews testified that because of his questionable health, he wanted to be close to his mother, who resides in Nashville and was apparently unable to visit him in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Andrews testified that while incarcerated he met a fellow inmate named Bobby Joe James. Andrews was aware of the fact that James had sent a threatening letter to a federal judge in Missouri and was being transferred to Missouri on a federal warrant. Andrews stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>approached James about helping him to obtain a similar transfer to Tennessee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Andrews testified that he instructed James to write the letter to Judge Merritt, whose chamber is located in Nashville. Andrews stated that he did not know anything about Judge Merritt or his family \u2014 he said that he and James \u201cpicked\u201d Judge Merritt solely because he is a federal judge in Nashville. Andrews testified that he lied to Special Agent Burke when he stated that he had a personal vendetta against Judge Merritt and could not promise that no harm would come to him or his family. Andrews added that he fabricated the portion of the letter that alluded to an extramarital affair to \u201cadd to the intensity of the letter.\u201d Andrews stated that he said and wrote such statements because he hoped to garner enough attention to warrant prosecution and a prison transfer. Andrews explained, \u201cI knew I had to tell him what I had to tell him. I was willing to sacrifice whatever, to get down here to see my people.\u201d Andrews insisted that the letter did not express his actual beliefs about Judge Merritt\u2019s work as a judge, and that he never was a party to a matter before Judge Merritt. Andrews testified that he never had any intention of actually harming Judge Merritt or his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">On May 25, 2000, the jury reached guilty verdicts against Andrews on both counts. On September 14, 2000, a sentencing hearing was held, at which Andrews objected to the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s denial of a reduction in sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4). That section provides for a reduction in sentence where the threatening communication \u201cinvolved a single instance evidencing little or no deliberation.\u201d The district court denied the motion without comment or reference to the Presentence Investigation Report. Andrews was sentenced to 48 months incarceration, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The district court entered a final judgment of Andrews\u2019s conviction and sentence on September 26, 2000. Andrews filed a notice of appeal on October 10, 2000, four days beyond the applicable deadline, and moved the district court for an extension to file a notice of appeal. The district court granted Andrews\u2019s motion for an extension on November 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">This court has jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s final judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Andrews appeals the judgment below on two grounds. First, he argues that the government lacked sufficient evidence to convict him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115. Second, Andrews asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Andrews argues that because he never had any intention to harm Judge Merritt, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support his conviction. This court reviews a defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim to consider \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1032 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 provides in relevant part that, \u201c[w]hoever (A) threatens to assault, kidnap or murder a member of the immediate family of a United States judge or (B) threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder a United States judge with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official, judge, or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such official, judge, or law enforcement officer on account of the performance of official duties, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).\u201d (ellipses omitted). This court has held that the government can sustain a conviction under this section where it is able to demonstrate that (1) the defendant conveyed a threat of physical harm to a federal official or his family; (2) the threat was intended as an act of retaliation against the federal official; and (3) this threat could reasonably be construed by the person in receipt of the threat to be actually carried out. <em>See United States v. Vincent, </em>681 F.2d 462, 464 (6th Cir.1982). As to this last factor, we have held that the government need not establish that the defendant in fact intended to carry out the threat, but instead that \u201ca reasonable person would have taken [the defendant\u2019s] statements seriously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIndeed, a prosecutable threatening communication need not be supported either by evidence of the author\u2019s actual ability to carry out his threat, or his actual substantive intent to do so. Rather, if a reasonable person would foresee that an objective rational recipient of the statement would interpret its language to constitute a serious expression of intent to harm ... that message conveys a true threat.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>115 F.3d 361, 363 (6th Cir.1997). <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>928 F.2d 740, 741 (6th Cir.1991) (\u201c[W]e set a standard under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 which does not require that an actual substantive intent to carry out the threat be present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Furthermore, that the author of the threat is incarcerated is irrelevant to a determination of the seriousness of the threat, particularly where he has alluded to outside contacts or is a member of a criminally inclined organization. <em>See Miller, </em>115 F.3d at 363 (\u201c[T]he author\u2019s imprisonment does not automatically transmute a facially threatening letter into an innocuous prank.\u201d). In <em>Miller, </em>this court considered whether a threatening letter to the President of the United States and his family could constitute a credible threat where it was sent by an inmate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that it did, particularly where the author identifies himself to be a member of a hate group. The court reasoned that \u201can incarcerated individual who may be associated with a radical political organization, a lunatic fringe element, or any other criminally inclined gang or other affiliation may pose a significant risk of igniting or inspiring criminal activity outside the institution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Here, the record overwhelmingly supports the government\u2019s contention that Andrews violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 by sending the threatening letter to Judge Merritt. Andrews openly admits that he sent the letter to Judge Merritt\u2019s chamber knowing that he was violating \u00a7 115. While Andrews claims that he did not actually intend to harm Judge Merritt or his family, and that he only sent the letter so that he could obtain a transfer to a prison facility in or near Nashville, those argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ments are irrelevant to this court\u2019s inquiry. Rather, this court must consider whether the letter constitutes a credible threat. To that end, Andrews wrote to Judge Merritt that he was disgruntled with his work on the bench because it did not appeal to his sensibilities as a member of the Aryan Brotherhood. Andrews warned that, \u201cyour place is not secured enough for my people, because we have your every move down.\u201d Andrews also wrote, \u201cyou may be taken off count [i.e., killed] before you read this, and if not, then only in a few hours you\u2019ll be dead.... \u201d A reasonable reading of this letter would suggest that Andrews seriously intended to harm Judge Merritt, if not by himself, then through his fellow members of the Aryan Brotherhood. Moreover, the fact that Judge Merritt never actually handled a case involving Andrews or his family is irrelevant to a determination of the credibility of the threat. While this fact was known to Andrews, it was certainly not known by Judge Merritt, nor would it reasonably be known by any other judge upon receipt of such a threat. Because the credibility of the threat is examined from the vantage point of the reasonable recipient, Andrews\u2019s argument that he never actually intended to harm Judge Merritt is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Because the evidence supporting Andrews\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 115 is more than ample, we find that any rational trier of fact would find sufficient evidence of Andrews\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">B. Denial of Reduction in Sentence Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Andrews appeals the district court\u2019s rejection of his motion for a reduction in sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4). That section provides that where an offense involves threatening or harassing communications, a district court may decrease the defendant\u2019s base offense level by four levels if the \u201coffense involved a single instance evidencing little to no deliberation.\u201d The Presentence Investigation Report recommended that a reduction under this sentence be denied, as Andrews was likely involved in two other threatening letters sent to judges in Oklahoma and Texas. At the sentencing hearing, Andrews\u2019s counsel objected to the findings in the Presentence Investigation Report and argued that Andrews was entitled to the reduction because the facts introduced at trial demonstrated that Andrews did not \u201cthink through\u201d his actions and did what he thought would get him a transfer to the Nashville area. The government did not respond to the \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4) objection. Once Andrews\u2019s counsel had listed all of the objections to the Presentence Investigation Report, the district court summarily stated, \u201cI am going to overrule all of the objections, except the grouping of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Andrews argues that the district court was required to make the relevant factual findings as to Andrews\u2019s entitlement to a reduction under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4), and because the district court failed to do so, his sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its assessment of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Pierce, </em>17 F.3d 146, 151 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) provides that, \u201cfor each matter controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.\u201d This court has held that Rule 32(c)(1) must be interpreted literally, as \u201cit helps to ensure that defendants are sentenced on the basis of accurate information and provides a clear rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ord for appellate courts, prison officials, and administrative agencies who may later be involved in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>291 F.3d 908, 911 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Tackett, </em>113 F.3d 603, 613-14 (6th Cir.1997)). A \u201ccontroverted matter\u201d includes findings of fact relevant to the determination of the defendant\u2019s sentence that the defendant refutes by way of objection. <em>See United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 760 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. O\u2019Malley, </em>265 F.3d 353, 357 (6th Cir.2001). A district court is thus required to resolve factual disputes in assessing whether a reduction or enhancement in sentence is warranted. \u201cIf the sentencing court fails to make these factual findings, we must remand for resentencing.\u201d <em>Tackett, </em>113 F.3d at 614. <em>See also United States v. Cook, 238 </em>F.3d 786, 790 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he case was remanded in order for the district court to make specific factual findings in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1), as to why it denied Cook\u2019s motion for an acceptance of responsibility reduction.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Cook, </em>No. 97-5943, 1999 WL 220116, at *4 (6th Cir. April 7, 1999) (remanding for resentencing where district court failed to make a factual finding relating to the denial of reduction in sentence for acceptance of responsibility)).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">However, this court has found that while Rule 32(c)(1) should be interpreted literally, a technical violation of the rule does not necessarily require remand. <em>United States v. Parrott, </em>148 F.3d 629, 634 (6th Cir.1998). Instead, we have held that Rule 32(c) must be read in conjunction with Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a), which requires that \u201cany error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d <em>See Parrott, </em>148 F.3d at 634. Therefore, where the district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 32(c)(1) has no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence, that error is considered harmless. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIn the present case it is clear that the District Court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 32(c)(1) had no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence and therefore constituted harmless error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The government concedes on appeal that the sentencing court, in failing to make the relevant factual findings as to Andrews\u2019s involvement in other threats, \u201cerred in not making specific and independent factual findings to support his denial of the requested downward adjustment.\u201d The government insists, however, that any error emanating from the district court\u2019s failure to address Andrews\u2019s objection is harmless. We agree. Courts have held that a defendant is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4) where the undisputed facts reflect that the defendant made a single threat with some, though perhaps not much, deliberation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mattison, </em>No. 90-6119, 1991 WL 213760 (6th Cir. Oct. 23, 1991) (Finding defendant was not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4) where he took the time to call the clerk\u2019s office to determine the identity of the judge to whom his case would be assigned prior to sending the threat); <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>286 F.3d 173, 179 (3d Cir.2002). Here, Andrews concedes that he and James planned to target Judge Merritt because of his location in Tennessee and planned the contents of the threat beforehand such that they would arouse attention from the authorities. Indeed, Andrews\u2019s entire defense, that he threatened Judge Merritt in order to effect a prison transfer, necessarily implies that he invested some deliberation prior to sending the threat. Given these undisputed facts, Andrews is not entitled to a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4). Moreover, public policy reasons dictate that conduct such as Andrews\u2019s, that is, attempting to manipulate the prison transfer system by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>way of death threat, should not be rewarded with a reduction in sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Because Andrews does not dispute the facts relevant to a finding of deliberation, he is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4), and any error committed by the district court is harmless. Therefore, the sentence imposed by the district court stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-5\">. The Presentence Investigation Report includes findings that Andrews and James were actually responsible for sending two other threatening letters to federal judges in Oklahoma City and Texas. These findings include the fact that Andrews\u2019s fingerprints were present on one of these letters. However, the government did not question Andrews about these alleged incidents, nor did the government present these facts in its case in chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">. In <em>Miller, </em>the defendant was convicted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, which makes unlawful the threat to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States. This court has interpreted \u00a7 871 in the same manner as \u00a7 115. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>928 F.2d at 741.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
