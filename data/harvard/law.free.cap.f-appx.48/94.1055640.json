Blair\u2019s counsel noted a timely appeal and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he represents that there are no arguable issues of merit in this appeal. Nonetheless, in his brief, counsel addressed the possibility that the district court had committed reversible error in conducting Blair\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. Counsel also advanced several claims of error in the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence. The time for filing a supplemental brief has passed and Blair has not responded, despite being advised of her right to do so. Because we find counsel\u2019s assignments of error to be without merit and can discern no other reversible error in the record on appeal, we affirm Blair\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">On appeal, counsel identifies no specific error in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 hearing and our review of the record reveals no reversible error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524, 527 (4th Cir.2002). The district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Blair\u2019s guilty plea and we are able to conclude that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>See id. </em>At sentencing, there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity to be included in the relevant conduct, <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999), or Blair\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). Neither did the district court err in declining to compel the Government to move for a downward departure based on Blair\u2019s allegedly substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tial assistance. <em>See United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076 (4th Cir.1991). Finally, we have no difficulty in deciding that the district court did not err in declining to apply the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision to Blair\u2019s sentence. USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1)-(5) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and conclude that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (2000), this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Blair\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
