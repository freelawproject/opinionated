The district court denied Badley\u2019s motion. Because Badley does not establish that counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable and that the performance was prejudicial to his case, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On February 28,1995, Detective Michael Gray requested and received a search warrant for the residence of Andre Badley. The warrant authorized the search of the duplex located at 6728 Bayliss Ave. (downstairs) and 6730 Bayliss Ave. (upstairs). In addition to containing Badley\u2019s statement, made during an arrest for possession of crack cocaine on November 4 of the previous year, that he was on his way to his grandmother\u2019s residence at 6728 Bayliss Ave., the affidavit in support of the search warrant included information provided by three confidential informants. Two were specifically identified as reliable, and those two provided information that Badley had possessed large quantities of crack within the previous day and previous three days, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The third informant, who offered the only information that tied Badley specifically to the <em>upstairs </em>residence at 6730 Bayliss Ave., was not specifically identified as reliable. The affidavit for the warrant described this third informant\u2019s information as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">7. During the course of the past seventy-two hours, a confidential informant has revealed that Badley lives in the upstairs portion of the Bayliss address (6730) and that members of his family live in the downstairs portion (6728). Said informant has revealed that Badley utilizes the upstairs portion of the Bayliss residence to store money and/or cocaine-base.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 57. Agents executed a search on the same day and seized from the upstairs portion of the residence a safe that contained cocaine powder, crack cocaine, and personal papers belonging to Badley. The cocaine powder was in a brown paper bag on which Badley\u2019s fingerprint was found. On March 21, 1995, Badley was charged with possession with intent to distribute approximately 114.33 grams of cocaine base (crack) and possession with intent to distribute approximately 123.29 grams of cocaine, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Badley\u2019s counsel unsuccessfully challenged the crack and cocaine evidence that was obtained on February 28 as the product of an unreasonable search and seizure, <em>see United States v. Badley, </em>No. 95-3743, 1996 WL 683601 (6th Cir. Nov.22, 1996), <em>cert, denied, </em>520 U.S. 1149, 117 S.Ct. 1323, 137 L.Ed.2d 485 (1997), but counsel did not move for the government to disclose the identity of the informant whose reliability was not attested to in the affidavit. Badley was tried by a jury, convicted on both counts, and sentenced to life in prison. We affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Badley, </em>No. 97-4128, 1999 WL 187450 (6th Cir. Mar.8, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">On March 30, 2000, Badley moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his conviction and sentence and to receive an evidentiary hearing regarding the same. Badley argued that the petit jury by which he was convicted contained no racial minorities and thus was unconstitutionally selected and impaneled; that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial because his counsel failed to petition for disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant and failed to request an alternate jury pool; and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>peal because his counsel did not raise certain alleged inaccuracies in the search warrant on direct appeal of the conviction. The district court denied the motion, and a certificate of appealability was granted on only one issue: whether Badley was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel because counsel faded to move prior to trial for the disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant described in the affidavit submitted by the government for the issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cThis court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, but the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>Riggs v. United States, </em>209 F.3d 828, 831 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 884, 121 S.Ct. 200, 148 L.Ed.2d 140 (2000). If the district court has not held an evidentiary hearing, however, this court will affirm such a denial only if \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see Baker v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 85, 92 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>479 U.S. 1017, 107 S.Ct. 667, 93 L.Ed.2d 719 (1986). There was no such evidentiary hearing in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In order to show a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a defendant must satisfy the two-pronged inquiry of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>See Bell v. Cone, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850-51, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (stating that courts should apply <em>Strickland </em>to claims that counsel failed to satisfy constitutional requirements at specific points). First, the defendant must demonstrate that the attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, meaning that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. With respect to this performance element of the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u201c[i]t will generally be appropriate for a reviewing court to assess counsel\u2019s overall performance throughout the case in order to determine whether the \u2018identified acts or omissions\u2019 overcome the presumption that a counsel rendered reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 386, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Second, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This prejudice element \u201cfocuses on the question whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 372, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993). We take the inquiries in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">A. Performance</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">With respect to performance, we have recognized that defense counsel\u2019s failure to make a particular motion or objection that would succeed, would have no tactical disadvantage, and would either result in an acquittal of the defendant or prevent the proceedings from becoming fundamentally unfair constitutes objectively unreasonable performance. For example, in <em>Northrop v. Trippett, </em>265 F.3d 372 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1358, 152 L.Ed.2d 354 (2002), we ruled that when counsel failed to move for suppression of evidence that had been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the motion would have been successful with no tactical downside, counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 383-84. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>In that case, counsel had \u201cample notice\u201d that the search was illegal, and the evidence to be suppressed - cocaine seized from the defendant\u2019s duffle bag - was the only evidence supporting the conviction for possession of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 383. Thus the motion to suppress would have been dispositive, and there was no justification for not making it. Accordingly, the court found counsel\u2019s performance objectively unreasonable. Similarly, in <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 453 (6th Cir.2001), this court found that counsel was constitutionally deficient when he did not attempt to remove a juror who stated during <em>voir dire </em>that she could not be fair to a particular defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64. The juror\u2019s impartiality had not been re-established by further questioning, <em>see id. </em>at 458-59, so it was clear that her presence on the jury contravened \u201cessential demands of fairness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 457, and the failure to remove the juror was in no way a strategic decision, <em>see id. </em>at 463. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s performance did not meet constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In the present case, the fact that Badley\u2019s counsel failed to seek disclosure does not suggest that his performance was deficient. First, as discussed <em>infra </em>on prejudice, it is not at all clear that a motion for disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity would have been successful. Badley does not appear able to show, as is required under <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>341 F.2d 906, 907 (6th Cir.1965), that disclosure was essential to a fair trial. <em>See Martin v. Mitchell, </em>280 F.3d 594, 607 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201cAs any motion to suppress this evidence would have failed, Martin cannot show how the failure to make the motion was a result of his counsel\u2019s deficient performance or that the failure resulted in prejudice to his defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Second, disclosure of the informant might indeed have had a tactical disadvantage for Badley. Although the district court held no hearing to determine whether counsel actually made a strategic decision not to seek disclosure, and counsel on appeal sought no discovery from trial counsel to determine whether a reasonable strategy was in place, trial counsel\u2019s decision not to seek disclosure was certainly consistent with a reasonable strategy. If the informant\u2019s identity were disclosed, then a primary factor preventing the informant from testifying at trial - the informant\u2019s value to the government in future investigations - would disappear, and the informant would be available to testify against Badley at trial. Although Badley suggests that the informant would state that the drugs belonged to Badley\u2019s uncle, counsel may have presumed that the informant would testify to the same information the informant had previously provided: Badley used the upstairs residence to store money and/or crack. Thus, there would have been at least some tactical downside to learning the identity of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Third, Badley has not shown that learning the identity of the confidential informant would have made any difference in the outcome of the case. Accordingly, Badley\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to move for disclosure does not appear to have been objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">In order to satisfy the prejudice element of the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry, Badley must show that but for counsel\u2019s deficiencies, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. For Badley, this requires a showing of reasonable probability that if a motion had been made, it would have been granted and would have changed the outcome of the case. Badley claims that seeking dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>closure would have made a difference, because his uncle resided in the upstairs portion of the house and exercised control over the safe in which the crack, powder cocaine, and Badley\u2019s fingerprint were found. If counsel had sought and obtained the identity of the confidential informant who indicated that Badley himself lived in and stored crack in the upstairs residence, the informant might have confirmed Badley\u2019s defense that the drugs in fact belonged to the uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We agree, however, with the district court that governing caselaw would have resulted in the denial of a motion to disclose. The Supreme Court laid out the standard for analyzing whether to order the government to disclose a confidential informant\u2019s identity in <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). In that case, the defendant sought to learn the identity of the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d to whom he had allegedly sold heroin. The Supreme Court prescribed a balancing test for determining whether disclosure should be required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 62, 77 S.Ct. 623. Because the particular facts of <em>Rovario </em>made the confidential informant \u201cthe only witness in a position to amplify or contradict the testimony of government witnesses,\u201d and one government witness had testified that the informant denied ever meeting the defendant, the Supreme Court ruled that the defendant\u2019s interest in defending himself outweighed the government\u2019s interest in protecting the informant\u2019s identity. <em>See id. </em>at 64-65, 77 S.Ct. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Badley gives no reason to believe that he could have carried his burden to show that disclosure was necessary to his defense, as we have repeatedly required. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Moore, </em>954 F.2d 379, 381 (6th Cir.1992) (\u201cAn informant must be disclosed only upon a showing by the defendant that disclosure is essential to a fair trial.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>341 F.2d 906, 907 (6th Cir.1965)). Badley offers no evidence to support his assertion that the informant would have testified that the drugs belonged to Badley\u2019s uncle. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>4 F.3d 1338, 1341 n. 2 (6th Cir.1993), <em>cert, denied, </em>511 U.S. 1034, 114 S.Ct. 1547, 128 L.Ed.2d 197 (1994) (affirming district court\u2019s rejection of request for disclosure when defendant \u201cadvance[d] no basis for his contention that the informant\u2019s testimony would have aided his defense\u201d); <em>Moore, </em>954 F.2d at 381 (6th Cir.1992) (affirming district court\u2019s rejection of request for disclosure when defendant \u201cadvanced no more than a simple statement that [the informant\u2019s] testimony might assist in his defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">We also note that the confidential informant was not a participant in Badley\u2019s offenses. Although Rovario did not prescribe any \u201cfixed rule\u201d that informers who are not active participants in the alleged crime need not be disclosed, in ordering disclosure the <em>Rovario </em>Court made special mention of the fact that the informant there was a participant in the crime. <em>See Rovario, </em>353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. 623 . We have noted that participants in crimes are usually disclosed, while mere \u201ctipsters\u201d are usually not disclosed. <em>See United States v. Sharp, </em>778 F.2d 1182, 1186 n. 2 (6th Cir. 1985) (summarizing cases). This is one additional factor suggesting that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>counsel had moved for disclosure of the confidential informant\u2019s identity, the motion would not have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Yet even if the motion had been made and had been successful, Badley faces the additional burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that it would have changed the outcome of the case. The outcome here would have changed only if the informant\u2019s testimony would have resulted in suppression of the evidence gathered under the search warrant. Badley faces a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to show that the evidence would have been suppressed under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>905 F.2d 931, 934 (6th Cir.1990). Under <em>Franks, </em>a defendant must satisfy a two-part test. \u201cFirst, a defendant must make a substantial preliminary showing that specified portions of the affiant\u2019s averments are deliberately or recklessly false.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>142 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir.1998). \u201cAllegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Second, the defendant must show that absent the deliberately false statements, the affidavit lacked probable cause. <em>See Bennett, </em>905 F.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Badley does not show that, if the informant were in fact referring to Badle/s uncle and not to Badley himself, the statement in the affidavit to the contrary was deliberately or recklessly false. In any event, confusion over whether the drugs belonged to the uncle or to Badley himself would have no effect on the warrant\u2019s validity, which turned only on whether there was probable cause to search the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Accordingly, even if counsel had moved for disclosure, and disclosure had been granted, it is still highly unlikely that the evidence could have been suppressed. Badley has failed to show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Because \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
