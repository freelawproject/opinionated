The district court found that the contractors were entitled to derivative sovereign immunity and that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Sanders\u2019s claim against the DHHS. The court dismissed her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Sanders then obtained counsel. Through counsel, she sought relief from the district court\u2019s judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). That Rule provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[o]n motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for ... mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cImplicit in the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) affords extraordinary relief is the requirement that the movant make a sufficient showing of unusual or unique circumstances justifying such relief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sanders argued, in essence, that her former status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant resulted in errors that entitle her to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The district court disagreed, as do we. For essentially the reasons stated by Judge Fallon in his order of February 6, 2012, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
