In the order in question, the district court carefully explained that all of the claimed property that was indeed in the government\u2019s possession had been sent to Rudzavice\u2019s sister, as requested, except for compact discs containing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">The district court\u2019s order is supported by the record. To the extent that Rudza-vice, in his <em>pro se </em>brief and reply brief, seeks monetary compensation for property that he claims still has not been produced, the government correctly points out that Rudzavice has not satisfied the requirements of the applicable statutes and rules, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>there is property that has not been produced and that Rudzavice has adequately briefed that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-21\">The order appealed from is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
