Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Cueli\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search. The district court also did not err in denying Cueli safety-valve relief based on its finding that Cueli was not sufficiently truthful and complete \u2014 for example, about the involvement of others and about the plan for distribution \u2014 in providing information concerning his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
