After careful review, we conclude Bennett has not shown his petition satisfies the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), and we therefore affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>A jury convicted Bennett in 1991 of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Before sentencing, the government filed an information indicating that it would seek a mandatory life sentence based upon Bennett\u2019s prior state drug convictions. After argument on the issue, the district court found Bennett was subject to a mandatory life sentence under the version of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in place at the time. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (1990). Bennett appealed, arguing the two Georgia convictions upon which his sentence was predicated did not qualify him for the mandatory enhancement. <em>United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 716-17 (11th Cir.1995). But we affirmed, holding that, \u201cunder the plain language\u201d of the CSA in place when Bennett was convicted and sentenced, Bennett\u2019s prior state convictions were \u201c \u2018felony drug offense[s]\u2019 \u201d subjecting him to mandatory life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 717-18 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Bennett filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in 2001, raising a claim based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his mandatory life sentence violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because neither the drug quantity attributable to him nor his prior convictions were in the indictment or proved to the jury. The district court denied that motion because <em>Appren-di </em>was not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. We denied Bennett a certificate of appealability, and the Supreme Court denied Bennett\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Bennett v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 915, 122 S.Ct. 2380, 153 L.Ed.2d 198 (2002); <em>see In re Joshua; </em>224 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2000) (holding the Supreme Court had not made <em>Appren-di </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review). Subsequently, Bennett sought leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, but we denied his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">In September 2011, Bennett petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Rather than seeking again to file a successive \u00a7 2255 application as would otherwise have been required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), Bennett styled his application as a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. In his petition, Bennett argued that recent Supreme Court cases had made clear that his two state convictions were not appropriate predicates for a mandatory life sentence, in addition to reiterating a species of the <em>Apprendi </em>claim he made in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Bennett\u2019s petition, finding the savings clause did not apply to his claims. This is Bennett\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under [28] U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTypically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawlc-Sawyer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>405 F.3d 942, 944-45 (11th Cir.2005). Under certain circumstances, however, \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition if the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201cThe savings clause only applies to \u2018open a portal\u2019 to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding when (1) the \u2018claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a non-existent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945 (quoting <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999)). If a petition does not satisfy the first prong of this analysis, then the savings clause does not permit a \u00a7 2241 petition and we need not address the other requirements. <em>Flint v. Jordan, </em>514 F.3d 1165, 1168 (11th Cir.2008). Further, if a petitioner \u201cis actually seeking an extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\u201d then his claim is not \u201cbased upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision,\u201d and the savings clause does not permit him to seek relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>at 1167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Bennett chiefly contends several recent Supreme Court decisions make clear that his state convictions were not for the kinds of \u201cfelony drug offense[s]\u201d under the CSA that would qualify him for a mandatory life sentence. Specifically, he says the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008), <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>553 U.S. 377, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008), and <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), form the basis of his claim that his Georgia convictions for simple possession do not satisfy the CSA\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">The problem for Bennett with each of those decisions is that none dealt with the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) of the CSA as it existed when Bennett was convicted and sentenced. <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>addressed the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), which involved interpretation of the present-day definition of a felony under the CSA. 130 S.Ct. at 2589-90. Similarly, <em>Lopez </em>dealt with the same definition in the INA and, in so doing, interpreted what conduct would be punishable as a federal felony under the CSA. 549 U.S. at 60, 127 S.Ct. 625. The Court in <em>Rodriquez </em>interpreted language in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). 553 U.S. at 381-82, 128 S.Ct. 1783. Finally, although <em>Burgess </em>did interpret the meaning of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in the CSA, it interpreted the subsequently amended definition in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44). 553 U.S. at 127, 128 S.Ct. 1572. And, as we explained in Bennett\u2019s direct appeal, when Congress amended the CSA in 1994, it altered the definition of a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d <em>Hansley, </em>54 F.3d at 718 n. 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Because no decision upon which Bennett bases his claim interprets the statute under which he was convicted and sentenced, we could only find one of those decisions to be applicable to his sentence by extension. This we may not do. <em>Flint, </em>514 F.3d at 1167-68. As a result, Bennett\u2019s claims do not satisfy the first prerequisite to relief under the savings clause. Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing Bennett\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-24\">. Bennett also argues his 1981 conviction should not have been counted against him because, under Georgia\u2019s First Offender Act, he served a term of probation and his conviction was expunged. Similarly, he argues his 1989 conviction should not have contributed to his enhanced sentence because it was not final. These claims, however, do not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>an appropriate basis for \u00a7 2241 habeas relief because \"the savings clause does not cover sentence claims that could have been raised in earlier proceedings.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>- U.S. --, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-8\">. To the extent Bennett reasserts his claims that a jury did not decide the quantity of drugs attributable to him or the fact of his prior state convictions, that claim merely restates the arguments he raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion, which were rejected and Bennett did not appeal. We have no occasion to reconsider them in this appeal. <em>See Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively in either a \u00a7 2241 or a \u00a7 2255 proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b955-6\">. Bennett contends he is entitled to review based upon the amended definition of \"felony drug offense.\u201d But \u201c[t]he general rule is that a defendant should be sentenced under the law in effect at the time of sentencing,\u201d unless doing so would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, in which case an earlier version of the law should be applied. <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>142 F.3d 1342, 1351 (11th Cir. 1998). There is no authority to support Bennett\u2019s argument that he should have been sentenced based upon a version of the statute enacted years later. And even if he were correct that we should have reviewed his sentence on direct appeal under the amended statute, that claim would not be cognizable as a \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>petition under the savings clause for the same reason that we reject Bennett\u2019s other claims, namely because it is not based upon an on-point retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Flint, </em>514 F.3d at 1167-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
