The motion to reopen was made in 2011. Zhuo did not demonstrate that changed country conditions within China excepted her untimely motion to reopen from the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s (\u201cINA\u201d) time limitation on motions to reopen. Nothing shows that the BIA failed to deal with the evidence, and the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying her motion to reopen. So, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
