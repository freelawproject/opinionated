On appeal, Flores argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level by 16 levels because the government failed to prove that his prior California conviction for assault with a deadly weapon or force met the requirements of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Moreover, the government did not prove when Flores was released from incarceration for his prior California assault conviction or when the instant offense commenced. Therefore, Flores asserts, the district court could not properly determine whether his prior conviction occurred within 15 years of the current offense, and whether it would warrant any criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">I. Crime of Violence</p>\n<p id=\"b889-22\">We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rosales-Bruno, </em>676 F.3d 1017, 1020 (11th Cir.2012). Where, however, the defendant fails to object in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006). Under plain error review, we, at our discretion, may correct an error where (1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>When these factors are met, we may exercise discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 882. Although Flores objected in the district court to the 16-level enhancement to his offense level, arguing that the aggravated assault did not occur within 15 years of his current offense, he did not object to the classification of his aggravated assault as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831. As such, plain error review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase in the offense level if a defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined to include the federal, state, or local offense of \u201caggravated assault ... or any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We take a categorical approach to determine if a prior crime is a crime of violence under the Guidelines, looking only at the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior crime. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010). The label a state attaches to an offense is not conclusive of whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, and we must determine if the prior crime is equivalent to the generic definition of the listed crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1331. In <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>we held that the generic offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cinvolves a criminal assault accompanied by the aggravating factors of either the intent to cause serious bodily injury to the victim or the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The California Penal Code defines the crime of \u201c[ajssault with deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d in relevant part as follows: \u201cAny person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm\u201d or \u201c[a]ny person who commits an assault upon the person of another by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.\u201d CaLPenal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) and (4). \u201cAssault\u201d is defined as \u201can unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The district court did not plainly err in enhancing Flores\u2019s offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because Flores was previously convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in California, which is a crime of violence. Section 245 requires either the use of a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury. CaLPenal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1), (4), and (c). As such, the offense would qualify as the general offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 because it involves \u201ca criminal assault accompanied by the aggravating factors of either the intent to cause serious bodily injury to the victim or the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>II. Date of Incarceration and Current Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>but accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>447 F.3d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA fact admitted to during a guilty plea cannot later be contested when it appears in the defendant\u2019s PSI.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009). Further, if a defendant fails to object to factual allegations contained in the PSI, he admits those facts for consideration during sentencing. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). A challenge to the PSI \u201cmust assert with specificity and clarity each factual mistake of which defendant complains.\u201d <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>832 F.2d 142, 145 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant should be assessed three criminal history points \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Such a sentence must have been imposed \u201cwithin fifteen years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense\u201d to be counted. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). We have held that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, \u201cthe crime of being found in the United States commences when the alien enters the United States and is not completed until the defendant\u2019s arrest.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>447 F.3d at 1368 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The district court did not err by assessing Flores 3 criminal history points for his 1993 assault conviction because the conviction occurred within 15 years of the commencement of the present offense. Flores admitted at his change of plea hearing that he illegally reentered the United States in 1996, at which time the present offense commenced. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Flores\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
