On appeal, With-row argues that the district court should have granted him a greater sentence reduction because: (1) the court, at its original sentencing hearing, granted a 7-month downward variance from the Guideline range of 151 to 188 months, thereby warranting a term comparably less than the bottom of the amended Guideline range; (2) the court\u2019s minimal post-Amendment 750 sentence reduction was contrary to the rationale of the amendment; and (3) the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA) retroactively applied in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In April 2008, Withrow was charged with conspiracy to distribute a mixture and substance containing at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and \u00a7 846 (Count 1); and with distributing a mixture and substance containing at least five grams of cocaine base on three separate occasions, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Counts 2, 3, and 4). Withrow pleaded guilty to Count 1 pursuant to a plea agreement that contained an appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Withrow, </em>360 Fed.Appx. 93, 94 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam). When Withrow was originally sentenced, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) that involved 50 grams or more of crack cocaine carried a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) determined that Withrow had a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because the offense involved 68.2 grams of cocaine base. Withrow received a 2-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for his leadership role, and a 3-level reduction for his timely acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), resulting in a total offense level of 29. After considering the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court concluded that Withrow\u2019s total offense level was 29, his criminal history category was VI, and his Guideline range was 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Accordingly, on April 1, 2009, the court sentenced Withrow to 144 months of imprisonment, finding that the sentence, although below the Guideline range, was consistent with \u00a7 3553(a) and would be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, given Withrow\u2019s extensive criminal record. On appeal, this court affirmed Withrow\u2019s conviction and sentence, holding that his sentence appeal waiver was valid and enforceable. <em>Withrow, </em>360 Fed.Appx. at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">In 2010, the FSA raised the drug quantity thresholds of crack cocaine required to trigger the mandatory minimum imprisonment terms. Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010); U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750. Specifically, the FSA increased both the quantity threshold required to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum imprisonment term from 50 to 280 grams of crack cocaine, and the quantity threshold required to trigger the 5-year mandatory imprisonment term from 5 to 28 grams of crack' cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750; <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), (b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">The FSA instructed the Sentencing Commission to \u201cmake such conforming amendments to the Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission determines necessary to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.\u201d Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 8(2). To comply with the FSA\u2019s instructions, Amendment 750 altered the base offense levels for crack cocaine in the Drug Quantity Table, \u201cso that the statutory minimum penalties correspond to\u201d a level of 26 for offenses involving 28 grams but less than 112 grams of crack cocaine, and a level of 32 for offenses involving 280 grams but less than 840 grams of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4), (7). Amendment 750 became effective and retroactive on November 1, 2011, and may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) &amp; cmt. n. 4; U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 750 and 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>In December 2011, Withrow filed a <em>pro se </em>motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750. The district court appointed counsel to represent Withrow, but counsel did not file a separate \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion. In April 2012, the district court granted Withrow\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction. The district court explained that, pursuant to Amendment 750, Withrow\u2019s total offense level decreased from 29 to 25. Given Withrow\u2019s criminal history category of VI, the district court stated that, under normal circumstances, the amended Guideline range would be 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. In light of the 120-month statutory mandatory minimum, however, the district court determined that With-row\u2019s amended Guideline range was 120 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. Upon considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including, among others, Withrow\u2019s extensive criminal history, characteristics, and the need to protect the public from further crimes, the district court decided to grant a minimal sentence reduction. The district court thereby reduced Withrow\u2019s sentence from 144 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. With-row, through counsel, filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We review <em>de novo a </em>district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Where a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">A district court may modify an imprisonment term</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-8\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2). A defendant is eligible for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when an amendment lowers \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision ... or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">In ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must follow a two-step process. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, in determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [applicable retroactive amendment] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall substitute only the [retroactive amendment] ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court reaches the second step, it must decide, in its discretion, whether to retain the original sentence or to revise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>the sentence under the amended Guideline range. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">If the original imprisonment term imposed was outside of the Guideline range applicable at sentencing, the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s imprisonment term under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended Guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 131.10(b)(2)(A) &amp; cmt. (n.3). However, if the original imprisonment term was below the term provided by the original applicable Guideline range, and that downward variance was based on the government\u2019s motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, then a reduction \u201ccomparably less\u201d than the amended Guideline range may be appropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 131.10(b)(2)(B); <em>see Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2693, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (stating that below-Guideline range modifications in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are \u201cforbidden,\u201d except in limited circumstances under \u00a7 131.10(b)(2)(B)); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that a district court may lower a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range \u201conly if the original sentence was below the original guidelines range because the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Consistent with \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court shall consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining (1) whether a sentence reduction is warranted; and (2) the extent of such a reduction, but only within the limits described in \u00a7 lB1.10(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l(B)(i)). Among others, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; and (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from the defendant\u2019s further crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(C). The district court is not required to articulate the specific applicability, if any, of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, as long as the record as a whole \u201cdemonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that the district court provided sufficient reasons by referencing the government\u2019s brief that enumerated specific elements relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry and supported by the record). Additionally, the district court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.(l)(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Finally, in <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FSA\u2019s lower statutory mandatory minimums apply to defendants who committed a crack cocaine crime before, but were sentenced after, the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>See </em>132 S.Ct. at 2326. While the Supreme Court did not decide whether the FSA applies to a defendant who, like With-row, was sentenced before the FSA went into effect and who files a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence after the FSA\u2019s effective date, <em>see United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2012), this court has resolved the issue. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that \u201cthe FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d Moreover, even if a petitioner could bring an FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>motion, \u201cthe FSA does not apply retroactively to offenders sentenced before the effective date of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Withrow to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. Withrow argues that the amended Guideline range should be 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the FSA\u2019s statutory changes to the mandatory minimum imprisonment terms, and that he should receive a 105-month sentence to reflect the original downward variance. Withrow contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>changed the legal dynamic in determining the extent of a sentence reduction, and that the district court could not properly exercise its discretion because <em>Dorsey </em>was not decided when the court issued its order. <em>See </em>132 S.Ct. 2321.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In finding Withrow\u2019s amended guideline range to be 120 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the 120-month statutory minimum and Amendment 750\u2019s changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the district court correctly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and reasonably exercised its discretion in granting only a minimal reduction to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court considered the government\u2019s argument that Withrow should not receive a reduction because of his lifetime of serious and repetitive criminal activity, as presented in the PSI. The court specifically cited With-row\u2019s criminal history and characteristics as a reason for the need to protect the public from additional crimes. <em>See Eggersdorf </em>126 F.3d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Further, the district court had no authority to impose a sentence below the amended Guideline range, such that it would be comparable to the original 7-month downward variance, because the court did not impose a sentence below the original applicable Guideline range based on a substantial assistance motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), and cmt. (n.3); <em>see Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2693; <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1207. Finally, our holding in <em>Berry </em>forecloses Withrow\u2019s argument that the FSA applies retroactively under <em>Dorsey. </em>Withrow was sentenced in 2009, prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date in 2010; thus, his argument fails. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377 (11th Cir.2012) (finding that <em>Dorsey </em>does not apply to defendants who were sentenced prior to the FSA\u2019s effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">For all these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
