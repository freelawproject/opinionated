She defaulted in her payments, declared bankruptcy, and after receiving a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in November 2009, Bank of America appointed Recontrust Company (\u201cRC\u201d) as substitute trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-29\">On March 11, 2010, RC sent Hasbun a foreclosure letter, entitled \u201cNotice of Acceleration and Foreclosure,\u201d which notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>her that her promissory note was in default, that RC had been asked to institute foreclosure proceedings against the property, and that the notice was not intended as a demand for the balance due on the promissory note when she defaulted payment. Based on her receipt of this letter, Hasbun brought this lawsuit seeking damages against RC for its alleged violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692(e), 1692(f)(1). RC moved to dismiss Hasbun\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The court granted its motion. After her first and second amended complaints failed to state a claim, the court dismissed her case with prejudice. Hasbun appeals the dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The FDCPA expressly excludes from the term \u201cdebt collector\u201d \u201cany person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity (i) is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation or a bona fide escrow arrangement.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(a)(F). In short, creditors and their fiduciaries are not \u201cdebt collectors\u201d subject to the Act. The District Court properly dismissed Has-bun\u2019s second amended complaint for two reasons. First, RC, as fiduciary of the creditor to whom the debt was owed, was not a debt collector under the Act. And second, the March 11, 2011 letter explicitly informed Hasbun that RC was not demanding payment of a debt; instead, it was notifying her that the property was being foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. We stayed brief in this appeal at Hasbun's request pending the issuance of our mandate in <em>Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterbee &amp; Adams, LLP, </em>678 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir.2012). <em>Reese </em>is, as it turns out, inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
