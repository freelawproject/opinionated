Young\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>conviction and sentence were based, in part, on his prior felony convictions in Florida state court. In 2011, Young filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Middle District of Florida, arguing that his constitutional rights were violated when \u201cthe lower court ordered [him] barred from any future prose filings,\u201d and barred \u201cthe clerk of courts [from] accepting] any pro-se filings ... unless ... signed by a member in good standing of the Florida bar.\u201d Young also attacked Florida state court rulings denying his motions for post-conviction relief, arguing that \u201cthe lower court was without jurisdiction to make the rulings that it did\u201d because the rulings were made when he \u201cwas no longer in state custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The district court dismissed Young\u2019s petition without prejudice, stating that it was unclear whether Young was attacking a state or federal conviction. To the extent that Young was challenging his federal conviction, the district court held that Young should have filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the Northern District of Florida \u2014 the district where he was sentenced. To the extent that Young was challenging his state court convictions, the district court directed that his \u201crequest for relief should be filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Instead of heeding the district court\u2019s admonishments, Young then filed with the same court a \u201cMotion for Correction and Notice of Appeal.\u201d This motion clarified that Young sought relief from his \u201cstate judgment and conviction[s]\u201d and conceded that he was ineligible for habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 because he was \u201cin no form of custody, by the state\u201d and had \u201ccompleted all post-conviction supervision imposed by the state\u201d when he filed his habeas petition. He requested, however, that the court interpret his habeas petition as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), and that it vacate his state court convictions under that provision. The district court construed Young\u2019s motion as a Motion for Reconsideration or Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, and denied it without discussion. This <em>pro se </em>appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">We construe <em>pro se </em>appeals liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148\u2019 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). So construed, Young argues, first, that the district court erred in failing to grant his habeas petition under \u00a7 2241 and, second, that it erred in failing to treat his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 1651(a) petition for a writ of error coram nobis and to grant relief accordingly. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law we review <em>de novo.\u201d Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). A district court may entertain a habeas corpus petition only from a petitioner \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). This \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Stacey v. Warden, Apalachee Corr. Inst., </em>854 F.2d 401, 403 (11th Cir.1988). To satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement, \u201cthe habeas petitioner [must] be \u2018in custody5 under the conviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition is filed.\u201d <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Young concedes here, as he did below, that \u201che was no longer in state custody\u201d as of September 2004. Neither was he serving state probation when he filed his \u00a7 2241 petition attacking his state court convictions. The district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider, and thus properly dismissed, Young\u2019s \u00a7 2241 peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>tion attacking his state court convictions to the extent that he was no longer in state custody or under state supervision at the time it was filed. <em>See Stacey, </em>854 F.2d at 402-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Young\u2019s second claim is that the district court erred when it failed to grant him a writ of error coram nobis vacating his state court convictions, based on his \u00a7 2241 petition. We review a denial of coram nobis relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000). To be entitled to a writ of error coram nobis, a petitioner must show that \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief,\u201d and that the error alleged \u201cinvolves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular or invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201c[C]oram nobis is not available in federal court as a means of attack on a state criminal judgment.\u201d <em>Theriault v. Miss., </em>390 F.2d 657, 657 (5th Cir.1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Young seeks a writ of error coram nobis vacating his state court convictions. Our law is clear, however, that coram nobis in federal court is not a vehicle for challenging those convictions. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Young\u2019s request for a writ of error coram nobis based on his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Young\u2019s petition for habe-as corpus and denying his Motion for Reconsideration is</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
