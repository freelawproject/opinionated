The district court determined, inter alia, that Carney failed to satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The Government has moved for summary dismissal because no certificate of appealability (COA) has issued or, alternatively, an extension of time to brief the merits. Because Carney filed his petition under \u00a7 2241, he need not obtain a COA to appeal its dismissal. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>258 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to challenge collaterally the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Carney has not briefed any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to show that his claims were based on a Supreme Court decision that established that he might have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, as required by <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). While pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), Carney has not raised any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for determining that he is not entitled to proceed pursuant to the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). Thus, any such arguments are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">For the first time on appeal, Carney argues that the Bureau of Prisons is in violation of the federal judgment and sentence because, after the imposition of his federal sentence, federal authorities improperly delivered him to state authorities to begin serving a subsequently imposed state sentence. Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we need not consider it. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1062, 181 L.Ed.2d 779 (2012). To the extent that Carney seeks to argue that <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011), enables him to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition, he is mistaken. <em>Bond </em>does not satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) because, inter alia, it does not establish that Carney may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">As Carney has not established that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. We dispense with further briefing. The Government\u2019s motion for summary dismissal and alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED. Carney\u2019s motion for release pending appeal also is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
