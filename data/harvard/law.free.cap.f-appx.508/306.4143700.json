SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Wendell Reeder appeals a summary judgment that Jamestown Insurance Company, RRG (\u201cJamestown\u201d), has no duty to defend or indemnify him in two underlying state-court lawsuits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">Reeder purchased, from Jamestown, commercial general liability policies that covered an \u201coccurrence\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201caccident\u201d \u2014 causing bodily injury, personal and advertising injury, or property damage. In November 2010, Reeder tendered to his insurance agent filings from two Texas state-court proceedings and stated his intention to \u201cfil[e] a claim against my liability insurance policy covering these lawsuits.\u201d Seeking to establish that it had no duty to defend or indemnify, Jamestown filed this declaratory-judgment action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. The district court granted summary judgment to Jamestown.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">In 2004, Reeder sued an array of business partners in Wood County, Texas, state court (the \u201cWood County suit\u201d). In March 2006, the Wood County defendants filed the first of numerous counterclaims against Reeder alleging a variety of causes of action. In the trial that followed, Reed-er took nothing but was found liable to several of the Wood County defendants; the trial court entered its amended final judgment in March 2008. Reeder appealed unsuccessfully to the Texas Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the Texas Supreme Court granted review and reversed, rendering a take-nothing judgment in Reeder\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-23\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-24\">While the Wood County litigation was wending its way through the state courts, some Reeder-affiliated entities sued several of the Wood County defendants in Red River County, Texas (the \u201cRed River County suit\u201d) The Red River County defendants filed a counter-petition that included a third-party claim against Reeder for fraudulently transferring property to avoid paying the Wood County judgment. The record contains no evidence concerning subsequent proceedings or establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the current status of the Red River County suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u2018using the same standard as that employed by the district court under Rule 56.\u2019 <em>Kerstetter v. Pac. Scientific Co., </em>210 F.3d 431, 435 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u2018if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Newman v. Guedry, </em>703 F.3d 757 (5th Cir.2012). Because federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, we look to the substantive law of the forum state, Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The district court found that Jamestown had no duty to defend or indemnify Reeder in Wood County, because \u201cnone of the counterclaims [by the Wood County defendants] fall within the definition of occurrence or raise any claim arising from property damage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm on the alternate ground, proffered by Jamestown in a separate motion for summary judgment, that Reeder\u2019s material breach of the policy\u2019s notice provision extinguished any duty to defend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, we have no need to reach the merits of whether Jamestown has a duty to indemnify Reeder in the Wood County suit, because intervening events have rendered the issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">Reeder\u2019s insurance policy required him to notify Jamestown \u201cas soon as practicable of any \u2018occurrence\u2019 ... which may result in a claim\u201d and to \u201c[i]mmediately\u201d send Jamestown \u201cany ... legal papers received in connection with the claim or \u2018suit\u2019.... \u201d Reeder did not tender notice to Jamestown until fifty-six months after the Wood County defendants had filed their first counterclaim and more than thirty-one months after the trial court had entered final judgment against Reeder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That delay was a breach of the notice provision as a matter of law. <em>See Klein v. Century Lloyds, </em>154 Tex. 160, 275 S.W.2d 95, 97 (1955). Jamestown, however, is excused from performance of its duty to defend only if it was \u201cactually prejudiced\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>by Reeder\u2019s delayed notice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In Texas, \u201c[t]he failure to notify an insurer of a default judgment against its insured until after the judgment has become final and nonappealable prej\u00fadices the insurer as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question whether an insured\u2019s failure to notify an insurer of an <em>appeal-able </em>final judgment is similarly prejudicial. Making an <em>Erie </em>guess,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we conclude that Reeder\u2019s delay prejudiced Jamestown.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u201c[I]f [Jamestown] had received notice\u201d while the Wood County suit was pending in the trial court, \u201cit could have undertaken [Reeder]\u2019s defense and minimized its insured\u2019s liability.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Reeder ultimately minimized his liability by successfully obtaining a reversal in the Texas Supreme Court. One of the purposes of a notice provision, however, is to allow an insurer \u201cto form an intelligent estimate of its rights and liabilities <em>before </em>it is obliged to pay.\u201d 13 Couch on Ins. \u00a7 186:22 (2003) (emphasis added). Reeder\u2019s choice to litigate the Wood County matter unilaterally for more than four years before notifying Jamestown prevented it from making such an estimate, from helping Reeder prevail in the trial court, or from exercising its option to settle with the Wood County defendants \u2014 perhaps for less than the cost of Reeder\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Because Reeder\u2019s delayed tender thwarted the recognized purposes of the notice provisions, <em>see Harwell, </em>896 S.W.2d at 174, Jamestown was actually prejudiced and had no duty to defend Reeder in Wood County.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The district court also concluded that Jamestown has no duty to indemnify in Wood County. During the pendency of this appeal, the Texas Supreme Court rendered its take-nothing judgment in Reed-er\u2019s favor. <em>See Reeder, </em>2012 WL 3800231, at *8. Reeder urges us to abstain from declaring rights and obligations .until all underlying state-court litigation is at an end. Bearing in mind the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, however, we conclude that the decision of the Texas Supreme Court is sufficiently final so as to render the indemnity issue moot, because \u201cthere is nothing ... to indemnify.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">The district court held that Jamestown had no duty to defend or indemnify Reed-er in the Red River County suit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">In determining whether there is a duty to defend, Texas courts follow the so-called \u201ceight-corners rule,\u201d under which \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined solely by the facts alleged in the [underlying] petition and the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Colony Ins. Co. v. Peachtree Constr., Ltd., </em>647 F.3d 248, 253 (5th Cir.2011). Although the pleadings are to be construed liberally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>in favor of coverage,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cthe duty to defend arises only when the facts alleged in the [underlying suit], if taken as true, would <em>potentially </em>state a cause of action falling within the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Northfield, Ins. Co. v. Loving Home Care, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 523, 528 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The policy insured Reeder against an \u201coccurrence,\u201d that is, an \u201caccident.\u201d The defendants in the Red River County suit accused Reeder only of <em>intentionally </em>initiating a fraudulent transfer of property to remove it from the reach the Wood County creditors. The district court concluded that those facts constitute allegations of an \u201cintentional act that cannot qualify as an occurrence,\u201d and Reeder does not contend otherwise. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that Jamestown has no duty to defend in the Red River County suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Reeder\u2019s chief complaint on appeal is that the district court erred by conflating the duties to defend and indemnify, which are \u201cdistinct and separate\u201d under Texas law. <em>D.R. Horton-Tex., Ltd. v. Market Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>300 S.W.3d 740, 743 (Tex.2009) (internal citations omitted). Whereas the duty to defend depends only on the \u201cfactual allegations the pleadings and the terms of the policy,\u201d the duty to indemnity \u201cdepends on the facts proven.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. Therefore, the absence of a duty to indemnify does not <em>necessarily </em>follow from the absence of a duty to defend: \u201c[I]t <em>may </em>be necessary to defer resolution of indemnity issues until after the underlying third-party litigation is resolved because coverage <em>may </em>turn on facts actually proven in the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745 (citing <em>Farmers Tex. Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Griffin, </em>955 S.W.2d 81, 84 (Tex.1997) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Where, however, <em>no </em>facts developed in an underlying suit can transform intentional conduct into an accident, \u201cthe same reasons that negate the duty to defend likewise negate any possibility the insurer will ever have a duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Griffin, </em>955 S.W.2d at 84). Because the Red River counter-plaintiffs allege <em>only </em>intentional conduct, no subsequent factual development can transform a fraudulent transfer into an \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(clarifying <em>Griffin). </em>Therefore, a declaratory judgment that Jamestown has no duty to indemnify Reeder in the Red River County suit is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
