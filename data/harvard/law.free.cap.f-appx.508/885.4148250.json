After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">The Attorney General, at his discretion, may adjust an applicant\u2019s status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien: (1) applies for adjustment of status, (2) is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States, and (3) has an immigrant visa immediately available to him at the time his application is filed. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if an alien satisfies the statutory requirements, the Attorney General may deny the application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. <em>Usmani v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 1147, 1151 (11th Cir.2007). In exercising this discretion, the Attorney General considers both significant equities and adverse factors. <em>See Matter of Aral, </em>13 I. &amp; N. Dec. 494, 495-96 (BIA 1970). While adjustment ordinarily will be granted in the absence of adverse factors, \u201c[wjhere adverse factors are present in a given application, it may be necessary for the applicant to offset these by a showing of unusual or even outstanding equities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Here, the IJ denied Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion based on Lanzas-Ra-mirez\u2019s criminal history for sex offenses, his discredited testimony denying any inappropriate conduct and his failure to accept responsibility for his actions, all of which together indicated that he might be a danger to society. Specifically, the IJ first noted Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s \u201cpositive equities,\u201d including his 21 years of continuous residence in the United States, compliance with the tax laws, steady employment, home ownership, close family ties, and the hardship to his wife and children, all U.S. citizens, if he were removed. The IJ then expressed concern about Lanzas-Ra-mirez\u2019s 1989 arrest for sexual battery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>lewd and lascivious acts upon minors and a 2000 arrest and conviction for exposing his sexual organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">In particular, in 1989, Lanzas-Ramirez was charged with one count of sexual battery and four counts of lewd and lascivious acts upon two girls under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1990, Lanzas-Ramirez entered a no contest plea to the four counts of lewd and lascivious acts and served five years\u2019 probation. In 2007, the Florida state court vacated Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s 1990 convictions because, prior to pleading guilty, he had not been advised of the possible deportation consequences. In 2000, Lan-zas-Ramirez was arrested for exposure of a sexual organ.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lanzas-Ramirez pled guilty to this charge and adjudication was withheld. The IJ stated that he did not believe he had received \u201chonest and candid testimony\u201d from Lanzas-Ramirez about these two arrests and the circumstances surrounding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The IJ acknowledged that Lanzas-Ra-mirez had pled no contest to the 1989 charges and that the resulting 1990 convictions were vacated seventeen years later because Lanzas-Ramirez had not been advised of the immigration consequences of these convictions. However, the IJ considered the 1989 arrest to be \u201cvery serious\u201d because it \u201cinvolved allegations that [Lan-zas-Ramirez] unlawfully and feloniously committed sexual battery on two different minors under the age of 12 years of age.\u201d The IJ discredited Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s hearing testimony, in which Lanzas-Ramirez denied any wrongdoing, noting inconsistencies between Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s claims, the arrest report, and the arresting officer\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The IJ stated that he \u201cwould have been more forgiving of\u2019 the 1989 offenses had Lanzas-Ramirez not been arrested again in 2000. The IJ noted that the state of Florida withheld adjudication on this charge, which constitutes a conviction for immigration purposes. The IJ discredited Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s testimony, in which Lanzas-Ramirez denied the 2000 incident and accused the arresting officer of being a racist who fabricated the 2000 charge. The IJ pointed out that Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s testimony was contradicted by a detailed arrest report and his conviction and that Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s own explanation was not believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">The IJ also expressed concern that Lan-zas-Ramirez had not accepted any responsibility for any inappropriate conduct or sought counseling or treatment \u201cto give to the Court some assurances that an incident of this nature will not repeat itself.\u201d The IJ stated he \u201cwas troubled by the fact that there were two different arrests with a considerable amount of time in between the two arrests and [he was] very troubled by the fact that both of these arrests are indicative of an individual that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>seeking some kind of counseling or treatment.\u201d In light of these stated concerns, the IJ denied adjustment of status as an exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, \u201cincluding the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that [Lanzas-Ra-mirez\u2019s] criminal history and lack of credible testimony outweighed his strong equities in this country....\u201d The BIA concluded that it was within the IJ\u2019s discretion to consider the circumstances surrounding Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s 1989 arrest, despite the fact that his 1990 convictions were now vacated, and to consider Lan-zas-Ramirez\u2019s lack of rehabilitation. The BIA emphasized that Lanzas-Ramirez \u201chad two separate incidents involving criminal conduct over a span of 11 years.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">As a threshold matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary decision to deny Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s application for adjustment of status. See INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Thus, to the extent that Lanzas-Ramirez argues that the IJ or the BIA incorrectly weighed the equities and adverse factors in his case, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Despite this jurisdictional bar, we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law and constitutional claims. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Thus, we review, as purely legal questions, Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s claims that the IJ: (1) impermissibly considered Lanzas-Ra-mirez\u2019s now-vacated 1989 no-contest plea; (2) failed to follow <em>Matter of Arreguin, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 38 (BIA 1995), by giving great weight to the 1989 arrest report;, and (3) improperly required treatment and proof of rehabilitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">The record does not support Lan-zas-Ramirez\u2019s argument that the IJ gave \u201cgreat weight to the fact that [Lanzas-Ramirez] <em>initially </em>pled no contest and that his conviction was not vacated until 17 years later.\u201d In fact, the IJ acknowledged both that Lanzas-Ramirez pled no contest and that his 1989 convictions were vacated seventeen years later because Lanzas-Ra-mirez was not advised of the immigration consequences of the convictions. The IJ further stated that, as a consequence, \u201cthere no longer is a conviction\u201d for immigration purposes. Despite these mitigating factors, the IJ nonetheless concluded, based on the arrest report and the police officer\u2019s deposition, that Lanzas-Ramirez did not testify truthfully about his actions during the 1989 incident. Thus, the IJ did not, as Lanzas-Ramirez claims, rely on the now-vacated guilty plea to conclude that Lanzas-Ramirez was in fact guilty of the charged offenses. <em>See Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1344-45, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that, although a conviction vacated because of a statutory or constitutional defect is \u201cno longer a \u2018conviction\u2019 for immigration purposes\u201d and a nolo contendr\u00e9 plea \u201ccan carry little or no probative weight,\u201d immigration officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>may still consider \u201cthe facts that led to the conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We also reject Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s claim that the IJ and the BIA failed to follow their own precedent (or this Court\u2019s precedent) by considering the 1989 arrest report. In <em>Matter of Arreguin, </em>the BIA stated that it was \u201chesitant to give substantial weight to an arrest report, absent a conviction or corroborating evidence of the allegations contained therein.\u201d 211. &amp; N. Dec. at 42. In that case, the government submitted an apprehension report alleging that the applicant attempted to smuggle aliens across the U.S. border. <em>Id. </em>The BIA concluded that it would give \u201clittle weight\u201d to the apprehension report because prosecution for alien smuggling was declined, the applicant denied any wrongdoing at her immigration hearing and there was no corroboration of the allegations in the apprehension report. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">This Court has also considered <em>Arreguin </em>and concluded that, although arrest reports are hearsay, they may be considered in immigration proceedings. <em>Garces, </em>611 F.3d at 1349-50. In so doing, we noted that in <em>Arreguin </em>the BIA \u201cimplicitly acknowledged ... reliability concerns\u201d when it decided \u201cto give \u2018little weight\u2019 to arrest reports that are not corroborated by other evidence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Billeke-Tolosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>385 F.3d 708, 712 (6th Cir.2004) (concluding the IJ erred in considering uncorroborated record of arrests for sexual misconduct involving children where the applicant was not convicted of such crimes and denied committing them).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Here, unlike in <em>Arreguin </em>and <em>Garces, </em>the IJ considered not only the 1989 arrest report, but also the deposition of the arresting police officer who investigated the allegations of sexual misconduct, interviewed the two victims and a witness (the mother of one of the victims) and had a Spanish-speaking officer interview Lan-zas-Ramirez. In the deposition, the officer described his investigation, including his interviews with the two victims. Thus, allegations in the 1989 arrest report were corroborated by other evidence, and the IJ and the BIA did not contravene <em>Arreguin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">We also find no legal error in the IJ\u2019s consideration of the underlying facts leading to Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s 1989 arrest. Allegations of criminal conduct, even absent a final conviction, may be considered for immigration purposes. <em>See Garces, </em>611 F.3d at 1345 (concluding that the fact that a conviction has been vacated \u201cfor whatever reason\u201d does not bar immigration officials from considering the facts that led to the conviction); <em>Henry v. INS, </em>74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996) (\u201c[Wjhile an arrest, without more, is simply an unproven charge, the fact of the arrest, and its attendant circumstances, often have probative value in immigration proceedings.\u201d); <em>see also Matter of Thomas, </em>211. &amp; N. Dec. 20, 23-25 (BIA 1995) (en banc) (\u201cIn examining the presence of adverse factors on an application for discretionary relief, this Board has found it appropriate to consider evidence of unfavorable conduct, including criminal conduct which has not culminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>in a final conviction for purposes of the Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Finally, there is no merit to Lan-zas-Ramirez\u2019s claim that the IJ <em>required </em>him to show rehabilitation. Rather, the IJ merely expressed concern that, in light of Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s unwillingness to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct, the IJ could not be sure that Lanzas-Ramirez was not a potential danger to society, and stated that he could not find rehabilitation if Lanzas-Ramirez did not accept responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Lanzas-Ramirez cites to no authority (and we could find none) to support his argument that rehabilitation is an impermissible factor to consider in deciding whether to grant an adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. In the context of granting other forms of discretionary relief, the BIA has concluded that rehabilitation is a permissible factor. <em>See Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 584-85 (BIA 1978) (listing \u201cproof of a genuine rehabilitation if a criminal record exists\u201d as a favorable consideration but stating that there is no \u201cinflexible\u201d test to guide agency discretion); <em>see also In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 299-300 (BIA 1996) (applying <em>Marin's </em>factors to \u00a7 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility because it also \u201cnecessarily involves at least one adverse consideration, specifically the criminal conviction or activity constituting the grounds of exclusion sought to be waived\u201d). Nothing in the INA, the agency\u2019s regulations or the BIA\u2019s precedent precludes the IJ from considering rehabilitation (or the lack thereof) in making discretionary adjustment-of-status determinations where, as here, there was evidence the alien had engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">In sum, to the extent Lanzas-Ramirez seeks review of the discretionary denial of his request for adjustment of status, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. With respect to Lanzas-Ramirez\u2019s legal claims, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">. Aliens like Lanzas-Ramirez who entered the United States without inspection generally are ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a) (limiting adjustment of status to aliens who were \"inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States\u201d). However, Lanzas-Ramirez falls under an exception to this bar because he was the beneficiary of a family-based visa petition filed on or before April 30, 2001. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). The parties do not dispute that Lanzas-Ramirez is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-6\">. According to the 1989 arrest report and the deposition of the arresting officer, the victims, two girls who were eight and seven years old, were swimming in the pool at a state park. The two girls told the officer that Lanzas-Ramirez asked them if they wanted to ride on his inflatable alligator. When Lanzas-Ra-mirez picked the girls up and placed them on the float, he pulled the girls' bathing suits away and touched their vaginal area with his fingers. When interviewed, Lanzas-Ramirez admitted picking the girls up, but denied fondling them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. According to the 2000 arrest report, an officer on foot patrol in a county park found Lanzas-Ramirez sitting in a pick-up truck facing the park where several women were jogging. As the officer approached the truck, he saw that Lanzas-Ramirez's pants and underwear were down and he was masturbating. When Lanzas-Ramirez tried to drive away, the officer pulled him over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">. The BIA also found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s finding that Lanzas-Ramirez was not credible and rejected Lanzas-Ramirez's claim that the IJ improperly relied on the deposition testimony of the arresting officer in the 1989 incident. Lanzas-Ramirez's petition to this Court does not challenge these rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. We review legal issues <em>de novo. Zheng </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review only the Board\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ's opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s analysis and conclusion that adjustment of status was not warranted as a matter of discretion, we review both the IJ's and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">. In <em>Garces, </em>we concluded that the arrest report could properly be considered, but was not sufficient to show that there was a \"reason to believe\u201d the alien engaged in drug trafficking, for purposes of INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C), because the arrest report contained only the officers' conclusions that the alien was involved in a cocaine deal and did not \"record[] their observations of facts sufficient to show guilt.\u201d <em>Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1349 (11th Cir.2010). Here, the 1989 arrest report does not suffer from these kinds of defects. The officer\u2019s sworn arrest narrative recounts in detail what the victims told the officer Lanzas-Ramirez did to them and what Lanzas-Ramirez said he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
