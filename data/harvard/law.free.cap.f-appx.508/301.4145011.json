He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion. The interlocutory order is immediately appealable. <em>See Robbins v. Maggio, </em>750 F.2d 405, 418 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Walters\u2019s case, however, does not raise complex legal or factual issues. Additionally, his pleadings indicate that he has the ability to present his case adequately, and there is no indication that he would be unable to investigate adequately. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Walters\u2019s request for counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir.1982). Because he has not shown that exceptional circumstances warrant the appointment of counsel, the motion is denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock Cnty., Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Walters also contends that the conditions of confinement were inhumane because he was deprived of necessary medications and that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. Because the district court has not entered a final, appealable order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation dismissing those claims, this court does not have jurisdiction over them. <em>See Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The order denying appointment of counsel is AFFIRMED. The motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. The appeal is DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
