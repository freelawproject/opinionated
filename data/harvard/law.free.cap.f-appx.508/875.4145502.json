Without the enhancement, he was subject to a ten-year statutory maximum for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He argues that he is actually innocent of the ACCA enhancement because, pursuant to the recent Supreme Court decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), his Illinois conviction for theft from a person no longer qualifies as a violent felony. We conclude that Taylor has not shown under \u00a7 2255 that he is entitled to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence are brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>900, 124 S.Ct. 258, 157 L.Ed.2d 181 (2008). A provision of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to challenge the legality of his detention by filing a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-4\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section inadequate or ineffective within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Rather, a petitioner\u2019s claim might meet the requirements of the savings clause only if: \u201c(1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). A prisoner must satisfy all three prongs of this test before the <em>Wofford </em>threshold is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">In an <em>en banc </em>decision, we recently addressed the issue of whether the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause permitted a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence, as opposed to his conviction, in a \u00a7 2241 petition when the \u00a7 2255(h) bar against successive \u00a7 2255 motions prevented him from raising that sentencing claim. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d 1293. We held that the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. However, we specifically declined to address whether the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause would authorize a federal prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition if a sentencing error resulted in a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The statutory maximum sentence for a conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is ten years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the ACCA authorizes an enhanced penalty, with a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, for a defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) and who \u201chas three previous convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA enhancement resulted in Taylor\u2019s receiving a 300-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The ACCA defines the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that \u201c(I) has as an element the use, at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>tempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The first clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is known as the \u201celements clause\u201d; the second half of the second clause is known as the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">In assessing whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA, we generally apply a \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking no further than the statutory definition of the offense and the judgment of conviction. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). When the statute is ambiguous \u2014 covering conduct that constitutes a violent felony, as well as conduct that does not \u2014 we may employ a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d and examine the facts underlying the conviction, but we do so only in order to determine the statutory basis for the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1336-37. In doing so, we may consult \u201cany charging documents, the written plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">At Taylor\u2019s July 29, 2005, sentencing hearing for his conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois reviewed Taylor\u2019s prior felony convictions for eligibility for enhancement under the ACCA. The district court determined that Taylor\u2019s 1989 conviction for theft from a person was a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Howze, </em>343 F.3d 919 (7th Cir.2003), where the court held that theft from a person under Minnesota\u2019s theft statute was a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The <em>Howze </em>court reasoned that theft from a person, like the enumerated crime of burglary in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), \u201centail[s] a risk that violence will erupt between the thief and the victim.\u201d 343 F.3d at 923. The risk of violence and injury posed by such confrontation was sufficient to bring theft from a person \u201cwithin the statutory definition\u201d of a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Taylor appealed his sentence to the Seventh Circuit, arguing that the district court erred in not considering a statement filed by the State\u2019s Attorney after he pleaded guilty that described the acts underlying his conviction as nonviolent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed Taylor\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>179 Fed.Appx. 957 (7th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 932, 127 S.Ct. 311, 166 L.Ed.2d 234 (2006). The court held that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statement was outside the scope of documents that courts could, per <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) consider in determining whether a crime was a violent felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ny under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 962. The court also held that the district court had properly relied on <em>Howze </em>and that there was \u201cno relevant distinction\u201d between the Minnesota provision at issue in <em>Howze </em>and Illinois\u2019 theft from a person provision. <em>Id. </em>at 961 n. 2. Taylor then filed two petitions for relief under \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the first and dismissed the second for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">In the years since the resolution of Taylor\u2019s direct appeal, the Supreme Court has issued several opinions analyzing whether a particular crime fell within the ambit of the ACCA\u2019s enhancement provision. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010); <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Taylor argues that the holdings of two of these opinions, <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Be-gay, </em>declassify theft from a person as a violent felony under the ACCA and that he was therefore sentenced to a term of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taylor argues that he is entitled to have his claim decided in a \u00a7 2241 petition because \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause should apply to sentencing claims such as his, the question left open in <em>Gilbert. </em>He further argues that he meets <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>requirements for accessing the savings clause because: 1) <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Begay </em>are retroactive decisions, 2) their holdings establish that theft from a person is not a violent felony and he is therefore actually innocent of the ACCA enhancement, and 3) <em>Howze </em>had previously squarely foreclosed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The government has conceded that the first and third prongs of <em>Wofford </em>are met, so we need not address those. Nor must we decide the <em>Gilbert </em>question of whether \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause applies to claims that a sentencing error resulted in a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. Even if we were to allow such sentencing claims, Taylor still could not satisfy <em>Wof-ford </em>\u2019s second prong because <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Begay </em>do not declassify theft from the person as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">First, <em>Johnson </em>is not applicable to Taylor\u2019s claim because it does not implicate the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, under which Taylor\u2019s offense was deemed a violent felony. In <em>Johnson </em>the Supreme Court held that the Florida felony offense of battery was not a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(I). <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 135-36, 145-46, 130 S.Ct. at 1268, 1274. The Court reasoned that, \u201cin the context of a statutory definition of <em>\u2018violent </em>felony,\u2019 the phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>means <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. Because the felony offense of battery in Florida encompassed <em>\u201cany </em>intentional physical contact, \u2018no matter how slight,\u2019\u201d the Court determined that the offense did not entail the violent force necessary to fall under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 130 S.Ct. at 1270 (citation omitted). The Court did not consider whether the offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and declined to remand the case for that issue to be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 141-43, 145-46, 130 S.Ct. at 1272, 1274; <em>see also United States v. Schneider, </em>681 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.2012) (noting that <em>\u201cJohnson </em>did not construe the residual clause at all\u201d); <em>Rozier v. United States, </em>701 F.3d 681, 683 (11th Cir.2012) (noting that the <em>Johnson </em>Court \u201cexplicitly refused to decide whether that offense was a crime of violence under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Though <em>Begay </em>does implicate the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, the decision still fails to assist Taylor. In <em>Begay, </em>the Court interpreted the list of enumerated crimes in the first clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) as having a limiting effect on the second clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 553 U.S. at 141-43, 128 S.Ct. at 1584-85. The Court concluded that the second clause did not cover all crimes that involved a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d but only those crimes that were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (citation omitted). The Court explained that all of the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes \u201ctypically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct\u201d and that this type of conduct \u201cis such that it makes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-45,128 S.Ct. at 1586 (quotations omitted). The Court distinguished \u201ccrimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson)\u201d from strict liability crimes such as the driving under the influence offense at issue in the case before it. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 128 S.Ct. at 1587. \u201cIn both instances, the offender\u2019s prior crimes reveal a degree of callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they also show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Three years later the Court recalibrated its <em>Begay </em>analysis in <em>Sykes v. United States. </em>The Court described <em>Begay </em>as \u201c[t]he sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of ACCA\u2019s residual clause in which risk was not the dispositive factor.\u201d <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2275. The Court called the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d phrase an \u201caddition to the statutory text\u201d and explained that it had been used in the context of analyzing \u201ca crime akin to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">This Court recently joined several other circuits in interpreting <em>Sykes </em>as limiting the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d test to offenses that are strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crimes. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 979 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012). Thus, after <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Chitwood, </em>\u201c[o]f-fenses that are not strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crimes qualify as crimes of violence under ... [the] residual clause if they categorically pose a serious potential risk of physical injury that is similar to the risk posed by one of the enumerated crimes. At least where the previous conviction required knowing or intentional conduct, it is enough if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>conviction was for a crime that generally creates as much risk of physical injury as one of the enumerated crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979 (citation omitted). This standard is not materially different from that applied by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Howze </em>to theft from a person, which is not a strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crime. <em>See Howze, </em>343 F.3d at 924 (explaining that the risk of injury posed by theft from a person was \u201cat least as likely (in the aggregate) as injury from burglary\u201d). For these reasons, <em>Begay, </em>as interpreted by <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Chitwood, </em>creates no change in the governing standard \u2014 the <em>Howze </em>standard \u2014 which was applied by the court which convicted and sentenced Taylor and the court which denied his direct appeal (i.e., the Northern District of Illinois and the Seventh Circuit). In other words, <em>Be-gay </em>simply does not apply to Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">In order to access relief under \u00a7 2241 via \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, a petitioner\u2019s claim must \u201crest upon a circuit law-busting, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Begay </em>do nothing to undermine the Seventh Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Howze </em>\u2014 i.e., the analysis applied at Taylor\u2019s sentence and on his direct appeal\u2014 that theft from a person is a violent felony under the ACCA. Therefore, \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause does not apply to Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">. Taylor's \u00a7 2241 petition is an attempt to circumvent the restrictions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) on successive petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The instant \u00a7 2241 petition was filed in the Southern District of Georgia (the district of his confinement), but he is challenging his 2005 sentence in the Northern District of Illinois. Taylor's direct appeal to the Seventh Circuit was unsuccessful, as were his subsequent \u00a7 2255 petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. The Illinois theft statute under which Taylor was convicted provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">A person commits theft when he knowingly: (a) Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner; ... and (1) Intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property; <em>...(e) </em>Sentence.... (4) Theft of property from the person not exceeding $300 ... is a Class 3 felony. 38 III. Comp. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 16-1 (West 1988). <em>In his </em>brief, Taylor states that he was convicted under the provision of the Illinois statute dealing with \"theft of property, other than a firearm, not from the person.\u201d The information in Taylor\u2019s theft case states that he \"knowingly obtained unauthorized control over property from the person of Christina Peterson\" and the transcript of his plea colloquy shows that he pleaded guilty to \"the offense of theft as charged in the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\">.

That motion challenged his sentence enhancement under <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 122 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). It was dismissed as an unauthorized successive petition. Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petitions were filed in the Northern District of Illinois, the district of his conviction.
