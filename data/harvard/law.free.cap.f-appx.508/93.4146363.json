Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bur. of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-27\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need only recite the facts necessary for our discussion. In his amended \u00a7 2241 petition, Parks alleges that in July 2011, while he was still housed in the Special Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d) at USP Vic-torville in Adelanto, California, he received notice of a hearing for his referral to the Special Management Unit (\u201cSMU\u201d). After his hearing on July 29, 2011, he was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>proved for placement in the SMU at USP Lewisburg, where he is currently confined. Parks challenges his placement in the SHU and his subsequent placement in the SMU, alleging that he was denied due process at his hearing and that he was placed in the SHU and SMU in retaliation for grievances he filed. Parks also alleges that the SMU program is unconstitutional, serves no penological purpose, and should be abolished. Finally, Parks asserts that his placement in the SMU violates his due process rights, that the SMU\u2019s conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated by mandatory disclosure of a psychology service curriculum.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">On February 6, 2012, Parks filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; he subsequently filed an amended \u00a7 2241 petition. On May 7, 2012, the District Court for the District of Columbia transferred Parks\u2019 petition to the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. On August 29, 2012, the District Court dismissed Parks\u2019 amended \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice to his right to file a <em>Bivens </em>action. Parks timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The District Court correctly determined that Parks\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition does not challenge the basic fact or duration of his imprisonment, which is the \u201cessence of habeas.\u201d <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 498-99, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). We have held that \u00a7 2241 \u201cconfers habeas jurisdiction to hear the petition of a federal prisoner who is challenging not the validity but the execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 241 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir.2001)). While \u201cthe precise meaning of \u2018execution of the sentence\u2019 is hazy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 242, we have defined execution to mean \u201cto \u2018put into effect\u2019 or \u2018carry out,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 243 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]o challenge the execution of his sentence under \u00a7 2241, [Parks] would need to allege that BOP\u2019s conduct was somehow inconsistent with a command or recommendation in the sentencing judgment.\u201d <em>Cardona v. Bledsoe, </em>681 F.3d 533, 537 (3d Cir.2012). Parks has failed to do so here because he has not alleged that the BOP\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with any express command or recommendation in his sentencing judgment. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that Parks\u2019 transfer does not give rise to a habeas claim and his claims, if any, may only be brought in a <em>Bivens </em>action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Parks\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. We express no opinion as to the merits, if any, of any civil rights claim Parks may choose to file based upon the facts asserted in his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
