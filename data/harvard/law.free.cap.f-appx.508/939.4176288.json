In his brief on appeal, Jean does not acknowledge that this appeal is of his motion for reconsider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>ation, and makes no argument regarding that motion. Rather, he argues that the District Court erred in ruling that the automatic stay was not in effect and, therefore, SunTrust did not have to move the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay. Jean argues that the automatic stay was in effect because he had not filed more than two bankruptcy petitions within the same year. We are not persuaded and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the determinations of law by a bankruptcy court and a district court, whether decided initially or in the latter\u2019s appellate capacity, and defer to the factual determinations of the bankruptcy court unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Davis, </em>314 F.3d 567, 570 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), a debtor who has filed for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy enjoys an automatic stay against actions to enforce, collect, assess or recover claims against the debtor or against property of the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a); <em>see also United States v. White, </em>466 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2006). However, \u00a7 362(c) sets out exceptions to the operation of the automatic stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(c). Section 362(c)(4)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-7\">(A)(i) if a single or joint case is filed by or against a debtor who is an individual under this title, and if 2 or more single or joint cases of the debtor were pending within the previous year but were dismissed, other than a case refiled under a chapter other than chapter 7 after dismissal under section 707(b), the stay under subsection (a) shall not go into effect upon the filing of the later case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-8\">(ii) on request of a party in interest, the court shall promptly enter an order confirming that no stay is in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(c)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">Contrary to Jean\u2019s argument, whether the automatic stay comes into effect upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not hinge on whether two cases have been filed within the year, but rather, whether two cases had been pending within one year. Because Jean had been a debtor in two prior cases that were both dismissed within the one-year period preceding the filing of the instant case, and neither of these prior cases was a Chapter 7 case dismissed pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b), the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(a) did not go into effect upon the filing of Jean\u2019s latest bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">We review a district court order denying a motion for reconsideration raised under Rule 59 for abuse of discretion. <em>Lockard v. Equifax, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir.1998). A legal claim or argument that is not briefed is deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). Jean\u2019s brief presents no argument regarding the denial of his motion for reconsideration; hence, he has abandoned this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
