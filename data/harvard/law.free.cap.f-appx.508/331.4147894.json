In 2012, Carrington filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that his ACCA sentence was invalid because two of his prior convictions for burglary of a habitation were \u201crelated cases\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 and that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the guidelines calculations. The district court denied Carrington\u2019s motion, determining that a Rule 60(b) motion was not proper in criminal proceedings and noting that Car-rington\u2019s allegations were without merit. The court acknowledged that it could have construed Carrington\u2019s motion as an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, but it declined to do so because it determined that such a motion would be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">On appeal, Carrington argues that the district court erred by not construing his motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion. He maintains that he could not have discovered the factual predicate of his claims before August 2011 and that he did not have access to the Sentencing Guidelines until he was released from state custody to a federal prison. Additionally, Carrington asserts that he is entitled to relief on the merits of his allegations. After reviewing the record and Carrington\u2019s arguments, we conclude that Carrington has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Neither has Carrington established any error in the district court\u2019s decision declining to consider the Rule 60(b) motion as an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
