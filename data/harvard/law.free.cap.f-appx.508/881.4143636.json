On appeal, Owens argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erroneously concluded that Owens\u2019s nonexertional limitations fell short of significantly affecting the occupational base, without obtaining the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). He further argues that, at a minimum, the ALJ failed to provide sufficient reasoning to permit a court to conclude that it conducted the proper legal analysis. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d and is such relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Nevertheless, the failure to apply the correct law or to provide the reviewing court with sufficient reasoning for determining that the proper legal analysis has been conducted mandates reversal. <em>Cornelius v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 1143, 1145-46 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179 (explaining that, when the ALJ fails to state with at least some measure of clarity the grounds for his decision, we will decline to affirm simply because some rationale might have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The Commissioner uses a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. The first three steps ask whether the claimant (i) is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity and (ii) has a severe impairment or combination of impairments (iii) that meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. The fourth step asks whether, based on an assessment of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>The RFC is that which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairments. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ must consider all of the evidence in the record in determining the claimant\u2019s RFC. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The final step asks whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform, given his RFC, age, education, and work experience. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. The Commissioner bears the burden at step five to show the existence of such jobs. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the ALJ has the obligation to develop a full and fair record with substantial evidence showing that there are specific jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Allen v. Sullivan, </em>880 F.2d 1200, 1201 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe ALJ must articulate specific jobs that the claimant is able to perform, and this finding must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere intuition or conjecture.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">There are two avenues by which the ALJ may determine whether a claimant has the ability to adjust to other work in the national economy: (i) by applying the 20 C.F.R. Part 404 Medical-Vocational Guidelines (the \u201cGrids\u201d); and (ii) by the use of a VE, an expert on the kinds of jobs an individual can perform based on his capacity and impairments. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1239-40. Exclusive reliance on the Grids is inappropriate when the claimant is unable to perform a full range of work at a given RFC. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. If the ALJ concludes that the claimant cannot perform a full range or unlimited types of work at the claimant\u2019s RFC given his exertional limitations, then the ALJ must consult a VE to determine whether there are sufficient jobs at the claimant\u2019s RFC within the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">If the ALJ concludes that the claimant can perform a full range or unlimited types of work at the claimant\u2019s RFC despite any exertional limitations, the ALJ next must determine to what extent the claimant\u2019s nonexertional limitations affect his ability to secure employment at the claimant\u2019s RFC in the national economy. <em>Id. </em>at 1242-43. If nonexertional impairments exist, the ALJ may use the Grids as a framework to evaluate vocational factors, but must also introduce independent evidence, preferably through VE testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>of the existence of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227; <em>Wolfe v. Chater, </em>86 F.3d 1072, 1077-78 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cAn ALJ\u2019s conclusion that a claimant\u2019s limitations do not significantly compromise his basic work skills or are not severe enough to preclude him from performing a wide range of light work is not supported by substantial evidence unless there is testimony from a [VE].\u201d); <em>Allen, </em>880 F.2d at 1201 (\u201cEven a mild mental impairment may prevent a claimant from engaging in the full range of jobs contemplated by the exertional category for which the claimant otherwise qualifies.\u201d (quotations and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Here, once the ALJ determined that Owens was unable to perform any past relevant work, the burden shifted to the Commissioner to show the existence of jobs in the national economy which, given Owens\u2019s impairments, he could perform. <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228. The ALJ concluded that, based on his exertional limitations, Owens retained the residual functional capacity to perform unskilled medium work and that his nonexertional limitations did not significantly limit his basic work skills at this level. However, despite the existence of nonexertional impairments, the ALJ did not introduce independent evidence to support this conclusion \u2014 whether by way of VE testimony or otherwise \u2014 articulating specific jobs in the national economy that Owens can perform, and therefore failed to develop a full and fair record with substantial evidence on this issue. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227; <em>Wolfe, </em>86 F.3d at 1077-78; <em>Allen, 880 </em>F.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The ALJ\u2019s next conclusion \u2014 that \u201cthe additional limitations have little or no effect on the occupational base of unskilled medium work\u201d \u2014 lacks sufficient clarity to allow a reviewing court to determine that the proper legal analysis was conducted. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179; <em>Cornelius, </em>936 F.2d at 1145-46. Even if we assume that the ALJ\u2019s vague reference to \u201cthe additional limitations\u201d was intended to refer to Owens\u2019s nonexertional limitations, there is no indication of which nonexertional limitations the ALJ considered in making this conclusion. Nor is there any indication of the reason or reasons why the ALJ arrived at this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The ALJ\u2019s final conclusion likewise lacks adequate reasoning to show that the proper analysis was conducted. The ALJ concluded, \u201cThe claimant\u2019s ability to understand, carry out, and remember simple instructions, use judgment in making work-related decisions, respond appropriately to supervision, co-workers and usual work situations, and[ ] deal with changes in a routine work setting does not substantially limit the occupational base.\u201d Even if we assume that the ALJ intended in this sentence to refer to Owens\u2019s limitations\u2014 as opposed to his abilities \u2014 the ALJ provided no explanation of how he arrived at this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">In sum, the ALJ failed to develop a full and fair record with substantial evidence showing that there are specific jobs in the national economy that Owens can perform, and to provide sufficiently clear reasoning to show that the proper legal analysis has been conducted. The magistrate therefore erred when he affirmed the decision of the ALJ. Accordingly, we vacate and remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
