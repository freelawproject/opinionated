Bourne, an African American woman, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer, the Broward County School Board, on her employment discrimination complaint that alleged racial discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2 and 2000e-3, and the Florida Civil Rights Act (FCRA), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(1), (7). In her complaint, Bourne alleged that her white coworker racially harassed her and created a hostile work environment and that the School Board did not take any action in response (Counts I and IV). Bourne also alleged that the School Board retaliated against her \u201cfor opposing the racially discriminatory and harassing behavior of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>co-worker\u201d by terminating her (Counts II and V). Bourne further alleged that the School Board retaliated against her for opposing her co-worker\u2019s behavior and filing a complaint with the Board\u2019s internal Department of Equal Educational Opportunities (EEO), in which she \u201ccomplain[ed] of the harassment ... and of retaliation in connection with her termination,\u201d by refusing to interview or hire her for a vacant position (Counts III and VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">On appeal, Bourne challenges the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the School Board on Counts I and IV on the ground that her claims were time-barred. Bourne argues she was entitled to equitable tolling of the applicable filing deadlines. Bourne also appeals the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the School Board on Counts III and VI on the ground that Bourne \u201cfailed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for her retaliation claims\u201d because \u201cshe did not engage in statutorily protected activity.\u201d Bourne argues that she did establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, under an alternative test, because she was fired after she filed a complaint to the School\u2019s Board\u2019s internal EEO office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence before the court shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact....\u201d <em>Haves v. City of Miami, 52 </em>F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this determination, we \u201cmake all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal decision on equitable tolling. <em>See Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The district court dismissed Bourne\u2019s racial discrimination/hostile work environment claims, Counts I and IV, as time-barred. Prior to filing a Title VII claim, such as Count I, a plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). That discrimination charge must be filed in a timely manner: within 180 days of the discriminatory act or, in some states including Florida, within 300 days \u201cif proceedings are instituted with the state agency.\u201d <em>See Thomas v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>764 F.2d 768, 769 (11th Cir.1985). Prior to filing a claim under the FCRA, like the one Bourne asserted in Count IV, a plaintiff must file formal charges with the EEOC or a state commission within 365 days of the alleged FCRA violation. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.11(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Bourne\u2019s last day at work was March 30, 2007. This is the last day that any discriminatory acts related to a hostile work environment could have taken place. Bourne did not file her charge of discrimination with the EEOC until March 31, 2008, 367 days later. Therefore, the charge was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">However, our inquiry does not end there. Title VTI\u2019s timely-filing requirement is non jurisdictional, so it may be subject to equitable tolling. <em>Zipes v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number><em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 398, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1132, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982). \u201c[T]raditional equitable tolling principles require a claimant to justify her untimely filing by a showing of extraordinary circumstances,\u201d such as fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment. <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1353, 1355 (11th Cir.2007). Under the equitable tolling doctrine, the time period to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC \u201cdoes not start to run until a plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that she was discriminated against.\u201d <em>Carter v. W. Publ\u2019g Co., 225 </em>F.3d 1258, 1265 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA plaintiff who asserts the applicability of equitable tolling bears the burden of proving that it is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Bourne has not sufficiently demonstrated that she did not know or reasonably should have known that she was discriminated against. <em>See Carter, </em>225 F.3d at 1265. Contrary to Bourne\u2019s argument, the fact that she had filed a complaint with the School Board\u2019s internal EEO in October 2007 does not prove that equitable tolling is appropriate. Instead, it factors against equitable tolling because it supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[tjhere is no genuine dispute that by the time Bourne was informed of her termination she was possessed of sufficient facts to bring a complaint for discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Neither has Bourne shown that she was not \u201cgenerally aware of her legal right to obtain redress.\u201d <em>See Stewart v. Booker T. Washington Ins., 232 F.3d 844, </em>853 (11th Cir.2000). Also, she has not offered any evidence suggesting that her late filing was the result of fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment. <em>See Carter, </em>225 F.3d at 1265. Therefore, equitable tolling does not apply and it was proper for the district court to grant summary judgment to the School Board on the grounds that Counts I and IV were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">The district court dismissed Bourne\u2019s retaliatory failure to hire claims, Counts III and VI, on the grounds that Bourne had not established a <em>-prima facie </em>case. In order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII and the FCRA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in an activity protected under Title VII, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1375 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Under Title VII and the FCRA there are two categories of protected activity: those activities that fit under the \u201copposition clause\u201d of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) and those activities that fit under the \u201cparticipation clause.\u201d <em>Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., </em>120 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.1997). The district court focused on whether Bourne\u2019s activity fit under the \u201copposition clause\u201d and determined that it did not. Bourne does not challenge this determination. And our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s determination that her activities were not protected on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Bourne argues that the district court erred by failing to consider whether her actions constituted \u201cprotected activity\u201d under the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d because her actions properly fit in that category. The participation clause protects an employee who \u201chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>under the relevant section. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Bourne\u2019s argument fails. Contrary to Bourne\u2019s argument, she cannot find refuge under the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d on the grounds that she had filed a complaint with the School Board\u2019s internal EEO office prior to submitting applications for the vacant positions. This Court has explained that the participation clause \u201cprotects proceedings and activities which occur in conjunction with or after the filing of a formal charge with the EEOC; it does not include participating in an employer\u2019s internal, in-house investigation, conducted apart from a formal charge with the EEOC.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Guess v. City of Miramar, </em>889 So.2d 840, 846-47 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) (discussing the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d in the context of a FCRA claim). At the time Bourne applied for the vacant positions, she had not yet filed a charge with the EEOC or otherwise instigated proceedings under the statute. Therefore, her conduct does not come under the \u201cparticipation clause.\u201d <em>See Total Sys. Servs., </em>221 F.3d at 1175 n. 2; <em>Guess, </em>889 So.2d at 846-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Because Bourne did not engage in statutorily protected activity, she did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. Therefore, it was proper for the district court to grant summary judgment in favor of the School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">. The district court also granted summary judgment in the School Board\u2019s favor on Counts II and V. Bourne does not appeal the ruling on these counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-6\">. Decisions construing Title VII apply when evaluating claims under the FCRA. <em>See Harper v.
