After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">In 2000, Banks pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess crack and powder cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Based on a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of IV, Banks had a guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and sentenced Banks to 325 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-19\">Banks appealed his sentence, and this court affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2011, Banks filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the drug quantity tables and lowered Banks\u2019s guidelines range to 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Banks requested that the district court apply the amended guidelines range and the same 35-month downward departure he previously received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, which would result in a 175-month sentence. The district court denied Banks\u2019s motion, and Banks filed a motion to reconsider, which the district court also denied because \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the seriousness of his offense, clearly demand a sentence that protects the public from him for a very significant period of time.\u201d This is Banks\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-20\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). Where, as here, the defendant was sentenced based on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the district court has discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The district court also \u201chas the discretion to decide whether to re-apply a downward departure [under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1]....\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 761 (11th Cir.1998). To decide whether a sentence reduction is appropriate, \u201cthe court must consider the factors listed in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe need ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Banks has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Banks sold crack cocaine and firearms to undercover government agents on multiple occasions, used his 15-year-old nephew to assist in the crime, and had a criminal history that included four offenses involving firearms, the most recent of which involved shooting and injuring two men. Banks argues that the district court abused its discretion by relying on his 13-year-old criminal history, but the district court was free to consider any information relevant to Banks\u2019s \u201cbackground, character, and conduct\u201d in evaluating the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; <em>see United States v. </em>Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010). And Banks\u2019s arguments concerning the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine do not suggest the district court abused its discretion in declining to reduce his sentence in this case based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81. The district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court did not abuse its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in rejecting Banks\u2019s motion based upon its evaluation of those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-17\">. <em>United States v.
