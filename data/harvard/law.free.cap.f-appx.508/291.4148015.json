Morin-Davila asserts that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a two-year term of supervised release, notwithstanding Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that supervised release \u201cordinarily\u201d should not be imposed \u201cin a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment.\u201d We review Morin-Davila\u2019s unpre-served claim of error for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The district court was aware of the provisions of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) because they were provided in the presentence report, which the court adopted. Contrary to Morin-Davila\u2019s claim that the court committed procedural error by failing provide any explanation for its imposition of supervised release, the court made statements at sentencing that addressed Morin-Davila\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the need for deterrence, specifically noting, \u201cThe last time you received a significant sentence and yet you\u2019re back here today.\u201d The district court stated that it imposed the term of supervised release \u201cgiven the seriousness of [Morin-Davila\u2019s] prior criminal convictions.\u201d Morin-Davila\u2019s argument that the supervised release term amounted to a departure is foreclosed by <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Morin-Davila also fails to show plain error with regard to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Although he correctly asserts that \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) advises that \u201cordinarily\u201d supervised release should not be imposed where, as here, the defendant is likely to be deported after imprisonment, \u201c[t]he court should, however, consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if the court determines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1. comment. (n.5). That is what the district court did in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
