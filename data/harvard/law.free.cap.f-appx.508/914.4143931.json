Because the district court correctly concluded it lacked authority to reduce Grant\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">A jury convicted Grant of possessing marijuana, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine with intent to distribute, along with two other charges, in 2006. At sentencing, the district court found Grant\u2019s sentencing guidelines range was 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Grant was responsible for 12.63 grams of crack cocaine, however, he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months, and the district court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequently, Grant filed a motion to reduce that sentence based upon the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA), Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372, and amendments to the sentencing guidelines. The district court denied that motion and this is Grant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions about its authority to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582. <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012). A court may modify an inmate\u2019s term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582 only in limited circumstances. None of those circumstances are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Grant contends Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines authorized the district court to reduce his sentence. But the district court could not have reduced Grant\u2019s sentence based upon Amendment 750 because he received a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, rather than one based upon the guidelines calculation for his offenses. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012). And Grant\u2019s contention that he is eligible for a sentence reduction based upon the FSA\u2019s alteration of what drug quantities correspond to which statutory minimum penalties is, likewise, squarely foreclosed by our precedent. The changes in the FSA to the statutory mandatory minimum sentences provide no foundation for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and do not permit a district court to reduce the sentence of a defendant sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377-78 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Grant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
