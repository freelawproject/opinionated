Biondo challenges the judgment against his affirmative defenses of abandonment, duress, and commercial frustration. Biondo also challenges the decision of the district court to strike his affidavit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">The Nguyens own and operate upscale hair and nail salons that serve alcohol to patrons. In 2006, Thanh created a mark containing the word \u201cTipsy\u201d to advertise the amenities available at the salon, and he incorporated the mark into the name of a new salon, the Tipsy Nail Spa &amp; Salon at Wellington Reserve (\u201cWellington Tipsy\u201d). Later, Thanh registered the Tipsy mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">Between the time that Thanh applied for and obtained exclusive rights to the Tipsy mark, the Nguyens agreed orally to sell Biondo a one-half interest in the Wellington Tipsy. Soon after Thanh acquired the mark, the business relationship between the Nguyens and Biondo deteriorated and the Nguyens agreed to sell their half interest in the salon to Biondo. Because the Nguyens and Biondo \u201cdispute[d] each other[\u2019s] ownership interest\u201d and had \u201cdetermined that it [was] not in their best interest to continue to operate the BUSINESS together,\u201d the Nguyens sold Biondo the full \u201crights[,] title and interest\u201d in the Wellington Tipsy. Paragraph 8 of the sales agreement provided that Biondo was allowed until March 11, 2011, \u201cto continue operating the BUSINESS using the name \u2018Tipsy\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthe right to the use of name \u2018Tipsy or any mark associated with that business name is not being purchased by [Biondo].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">Biondo violated the sales agreement. Biondo failed timely to pay weekly install<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ments to the Nguyens. Biondo also continued to use the word Tipsy in the name of his salon. On March 21, 2011, Biondo applied for a trademark to protect a logo comprised of the words \u201cTipsy Spa * Salon\u201d in conjunction with a martini glass containing a cherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The Nguyens sued Biondo for violations of the Lanham Act and the AntiCybers-quatting Act, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract. The Nguyens alleged that, after March 11, 2011, Biondo had continued to use the Tipsy mark or a mark that was confusingly similar in its business fagade, in print and television advertising, and on the internet. The Nguyens also alleged that Biondo had violated the Ngu-yens\u2019 ownership rights in the Tipsy mark; used the Tipsy mark or a counterfeit mark in a manner likely to cause confusion about the origin of the goods and services offered; \u201cregistered, traff\u00edc[ked] in, and use[d] a domain name, <em>www. Tipsy spa. </em>com[,] that [was] identical, confusingly similar, or dilutive of the \u2018Tipsy Mark\u201d; \u201ctraded on\u201d and profited from the \u201cvalue and goodwill\u201d in the Tipsy mark; and breached the sales agreement by using the \u201c \u2018Tipsy name and \u2018Tipsy Mark,\u201d failing to make installment payments, and misappropriating the Tipsy domain name. The Nguyens requested monetary and injunc-tive relief. The Nguyens later amended their complaint to include claims for trademark infringement and dilution under Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Biondo filed an answer that asserted several affirmative defenses. Biondo argued that he had rights to use the Tipsy mark; the Nguyens abandoned through \u201cnaked licensing\u201d their right to the mark; the Nguyens had breached the sales agreement; and he entered the agreement under duress. Biondo also filed a counterclaim for fraudulent procurement of a trademark, which he later withdrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Biondo was a contentious litigant. Bion-do was sanctioned for failing to comply with the rules of discovery and refusing to produce documents requested by the Ngu-yens. Later, Biondo refused to produce a witness for deposition. And, two days before the close of discovery, Biondo produced a journal that recorded his business dealings with the Nguyens. During a deposition taken soon after, Biondo testified that he could not recall the events recorded in the journal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The Nguyens and Biondo moved for summary judgment. The Nguyens argued that the obvious similarities in the Tipsy mark and Biondo\u2019s mark and evidence of actual confusion experienced by their respective customers established that Biondo had infringed on the \u201cTipsy\u201d mark. The Nguyens attached to their motion an affidavit from Catherine Hasson, the manager of Tipsy of Jupiter Spa and Salon, that patrons of the Jupiter Tipsy often scheduled their appointments mistakenly at the Wellington Tipsy and tried to pay for services with coupons or gift cards issued by the Wellington Tipsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Biondo argued for summary judgment on the two affirmative defenses of abandonment and duress asserted in his answer and based on a defense of commercial frustration not asserted in his answer. Biondo attached to his motion an affidavit in which he restated, nearly verbatim, the entries in his journal. Biondo also attached the affidavit to his response to the Nguyens\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">The Nguyens moved to strike Biondo\u2019s affidavit as a sham. The Nguyens described how Biondo had \u201cdisclaimed knowledge or recollection of\u2019 specific entries in his journal and later submitted an affidavit containing a verbatim copy of those entries. The Nguyens argued that Biondo\u2019s affidavit was not a \u201ccase of failed memory,\u201d but instead revealed Biondo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>\u201cattempt[ ] to obfuscate, conceal, and avoid testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The district court granted the Nguyens\u2019 motion to strike Biondo\u2019s affidavit by default under a local rule allowing a default in the absence of a response to a pretrial motion, S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(c), and alternatively, \u201con the merits.\u201d The district court found it inconceivable that Biondo could not during his deposition recall the events recorded in his journal because he had a \u201cvery bad memory,\u201d yet later prepare an affidavit that included wholesale excerpts from the journal. The district court refused to consider the affidavit on the grounds that \u201cBiondo either (1) remembered the events he recorded in his journal and intentionally failed to answer Plaintiff\u2019s questions during his deposition or (2) copied the entries into his affidavit even though he did not remember the events he recorded in his journal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The district court entered summary judgment for the Nguyens and against Biondo. The district court sustained the Nguyens\u2019 complaints of trademark infringement, violations of the Cybersquat-ting Act, dilution, and breach of contract, but rejected the Nguyens\u2019 complaint about unjust enrichment. And the district court ruled that Biondo\u2019s affirmative defenses of abandonment and duress failed for lack of evidence and as a matter of law and that his defense of commercial frustration was untimely. The district court awarded the Nguyens monetary damages and injunc-tive relief that prohibited Biondo from using the Tipsy mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">We apply two standards of review in this appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>the summary judgment in favor of the Nguyens. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). We review the decision to strike Biondo\u2019s affidavit for abuse of discretion. <em>Croom v. Balkwill, </em>645 F.3d 1240, 1253 n. 18 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Biondo challenges the summary judgment in favor of the Nguyens and the striking of his affidavit. Biondo argues that the evidence supports his affirmative defenses of abandonment, duress, and commercial frustration, and he argues, for the first time, that the district court should have employed a lesser sanction than striking his affidavit. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">The district court did not err in rejecting Biondo\u2019s affirmative defense of abandonment. An owner of a trademark may \u201cabandon[ ][his] mark through \u2018naked licensing,\u2019 or the failure to properly supervise [his] licensee\u2019s use of the mark,\u201d <em>Prof'l Golfers Ass\u2019n of Am. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>514 F.2d 665, 671 (5th Cir.1975), but a claim of abandonment turns on when the lack of supervision occurred. A licensee \u201cis estopped to contest the validity of the licensor\u2019s title during the course of the licensing arrangement,\u201d but \u201cafter [its] expiration,\u201d the licensee may \u201cchallenge the licensor\u2019s title on facts which arose after the contract has expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Biondo argued that Thanh abandoned the Tipsy mark between 2008 and early 2010, but when Biondo later signed the sales agreement on March 11, 2010, he expressly recognized that Thanh owned the mark. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe licensee has, by virtue of the agreement, recognized the holder\u2019s ownership.\u201d). After the agreement expired, Thanh sued Biondo for trademark infringement. Biondo\u2019s defense of abandonment fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">The district court also did not err in rejecting Biondo\u2019s defense of duress. To prove duress, \u201c[i]t must be shown (a) that the act sought to be set' aside was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>effected involuntarily and thus not as an exercise of free choice or will and (b) that this condition of mind was caused by some improper and coercive conduct of the opposite side.\u201d <em>City of Miami v. Kory, </em>394 So.2d 494, 497 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981). Biondo argued that he entered the sales agreement so that the Nguyens would dismiss an action seeking to enjoin Biondo from \u201crepeat violence.\u201d The Nguyens countered Biondo\u2019s defense of duress by establishing that their action was neither improper nor coercive. <em>See O\u2019Brien v. Federal Trust Bank, F.S.B., </em>727 So.2d 296, 298 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999). The Nguyens\u2019 petition for an injunction alleged Biondo had, on one occasion, threatened and then \u201chead butted\u201d Thanh and, on a second occasion, \u201cgrabbed [Thanh] and pushed him, causing a bruise on [his] shoulder.\u201d The Nguyens dismissed their action against Biondo approximately five months before he entered the sales agreement, and Biondo did not dispute the facts contained in the petition. Under Florida law, an agreement to dismiss even a criminal action in exchange for execution of a legal document does not constitute duress if the criminal action was legally justifiable. <em>Tyler v. Hill Bros., </em>127 Fla. 419, 173 So. 147 (1937); <em>Franklin v. Wallack, 576 </em>So.2d 1371 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991); <em>Norris v. Stewart, </em>350 So.2d 31 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977). Biondo failed to introduce any evidence that the Nguyens\u2019 action was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Biondo also contends that he established the affirmative defense of commercial frustration, but Biondo waived that defense by raising it for the first time in his motion for summary judgment. <em>See Latimer v. Roaring Toyz, Inc., </em>601 F.3d 1224, 1239 (11th Cir.2010) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c)). Biondo further argues that disputed issues of fact preclude summary judgment in favor of the Nguyens, but Biondo fails to identify what facts are in dispute or how they are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it struck Bion-do\u2019s affidavit. The district court was entitled, under local rule, to grant the motion to strike Biondo\u2019s affidavit by default, <em>see </em>S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(c), and the district court was entitled to disregard Biondo\u2019s affidavit as a \u201ctransparent sham,\u201d <em>Tippens v. Celotex Corp., </em>805 F.2d 949, 953 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cAn affidavit may ... be disregarded as a sham \u2018when a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact ... [and that party attempts] thereafter [to] create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 954 (quoting <em>Van T. Junkins and Assocs. v. U.S. Indus., </em>736 F.2d 656, 657 (11th Cir.1984)). During his deposition, Biondo refused to verify as \u201caccurate\u201d specific events he had recorded about his business dealings with the Ngu-yens, but less than one month later, Bion-do filed an affidavit stating that those events were accurate. And Biondo provided no explanation for the contradictory statements in his affidavit. Biondo argues, for the first time, that the discrepancy was attributable to a cold and that the district court should have imposed some sanction short of striking his affidavit, but we will not consider arguments that he failed to present to the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the Nguyens.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
