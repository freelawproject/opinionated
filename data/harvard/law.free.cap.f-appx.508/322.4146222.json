Hansen argues that the district court failed to consider his argument that the exhaustion requirement should have been excused in light of the state court\u2019s failure to act on his pending state habeas application for more than two years. He contends that the excessive delay has caused an absence of State corrective processes resulting in the denial of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-19\">A federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the petitioner \u201chas exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). The exhaustion requirement is excused \u201conly in those rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency mandate federal court interference.\u201d <em>Deters v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 789, 795 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cExceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency\u201d exist, and the exhaustion doctrine will not be applied, \u201cwhen the state system inordinately and unjustifiably delays review of a petitioner\u2019s claims so as to impinge upon his due process lights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noncompliance with the exhaustion doctrine is excused only if the inordinate delay is wholly and completely the fault of the State; the petitioner\u2019s hands must be clean. <em>Id. </em>at 796. In determining whether the delay is violative of due process, the following factors are examined: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the petitioner\u2019s assertion of his right; and (4) the prejudice to the petitioner on account of the delay. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-20\">Hansen\u2019s state habeas application has been pending for over two years, which exceeds the range we have previously considered excessive. <em>See Breazeale v. Bradley, </em>582 F.2d 5, 6 (5th Cir.1978); <em>St. Jules v. Beto, </em>462 F.2d 1365, 1366 (5th Cir.1972). Because the district court dismissed Hansen\u2019s petition for failure to exhaust state remedies before service on the Respondent, there has been no opportunity for factual development to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Hansen contributed to the delay or whether the delay is justifiable. Consequently, the district court\u2019s procedural determination is debatable, and Hansen\u2019s requests for a COA and to proceed IFP are granted. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Houser v. Dretke, </em>895 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The judgment dismissing Hansen\u2019s petition is vacated and remanded for further factual development regarding whether Hansen contributed to the delay and whether the delay in considering his state habeas application is justifiable. <em>See Dixon v. Florida, </em>388 F.2d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.1968). If Hansen did not contribute to the delay, and the delay is not justifiable, the district court is instructed to rule on the merits of the federal petition. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">COA and IFP GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
