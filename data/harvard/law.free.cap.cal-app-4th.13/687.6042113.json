J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">In this case, we conclude the felony of indecent exposure is a crime of moral turpitude, and a prior conviction for this crime is admissible \u201cwithout limitation\u201d for purposes of impeachment. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Appellant was found guilty of two counts of indecently exposing himself, for masturbating near women in movie theaters, and two counts of lewd conduct arising from the same events. He contends reversal is required because: (1) He was improperly impeached with evidence of a prior felony conviction\u2014since he claims the prior conviction, for indecent exposure, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>not involve moral turpitude; (2) two prior instances of indecent exposure at department stores were improperly adduced, in order to show wrongful intent in the latest incidents; (3) the trial court erred in admitting rebuttal evidence of a photograph, showing the clothing appellant was wearing at the time of arrest; and (4) the trial court erred in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We conclude a felony conviction for indecent exposure is a crime of moral turpitude which could be used to impeach appellant\u2019s testimony, and find no prejudicial abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. However, we agree a correction of appellant\u2019s sentence is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The relevant facts may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">One victim testified she went to see the movie \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d with women friends. The movie concerns the relationship between two women friends over the years, and the theater was occupied almost exclusively by women; it was only about one-quarter full.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Appellant sat down in a chair next to the victim and her friends, and began to masturbate. He had unzipped his pants and was stroking his penis; his chair was squeaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The victim got up to summon help. When she did so, appellant pulled his pants up to cover himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The victim spoke to the manager, who summoned the police. As the police arrived, they caught appellant running out of the theater.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The victim identified appellant. She recognized him as having been at the same movie, in the same theater, about a week before, when she went to see the movie for the first time. On that prior occasion, appellant had only attracted attention by his very hurried exit from the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Another victim testified she went with a woman friend to see the movie \u201cGhost.\u201d The movie is a romance in which a dead man returns from the afterlife to take care of his romantic partner. The theater was only about a quarter full. Appellant sat down in front of the victim just as the movie started; he took off his glasses and slouched down as if he were simply going to go to sleep during the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Appellant, however, began to look around at the women seated nearby. He looked at two women seated to his right; then he looked at the victim\u2019s friend; then he looked at the victim \u201cfor a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Appellant always had one hand down; he stared at the victim for \u201cwhat seemed like an eternity . . . Later, appellant put both hands down into his lap, and \u201cstarted convulsing.\u201d As the victim got up to leave, she saw that appellant had both hands \u201cwrapped around his penis going up and down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The police were summoned. Appellant left the theater, but then reentered through another door and sat down again. The police removed appellant from the theater. The victim identified him as the man who had been bothering her.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Appellant testified he had not been in the movie theater watching \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d; he had been jogging near the theater with a guy named \u201cJim\u201d\u2014 whose name he did not know and whom he never saw again after they jogged 10 miles together, ending at the parking lot of the theater\u2014then he was arrested just outside the theater. He was wearing cutoff shorts and a sweatshirt, for jogging.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Appellant testified he did go to see the move \u201cGhost\u201d after he went to his church that night for a meeting which did not occur; he was just rubbing an old injury to his back or leg during the movie. The trial court allowed appellant to be impeached with one conviction for an unspecified felony involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed rebuttal evidence of a photograph taken of appellant at the time of his booking after the incident during \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d; the photo showed appellant was not wearing the jogging sweats he testified about, and was instead wearing blue jeans with a zipper. On surrebuttal, appellant testified he told the arresting officer he was cold, and the officer gave him some pants to wear. This, however, contradicted the testimony of the officer, who said if appellant had complained of cold, he would have given him a blanket, because there were no extra clothes at the holding cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The trial court, pursuant to a pretrial motion by the prosecution, also allowed evidence of two similar incidents of indecent exposure involving appellant, to show wrongful intent to expose for the purposes of sexual arousal. In one incident, the victim was in the women\u2019s department at Macy\u2019s when she saw appellant facing her and masturbating; Ms face was \u201cscary\u201d; she reported the matter to the police, and identified appellant shortly after the incident as the man who had bothered her.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The other prior incident occurred at a Capwell\u2019s store. The victim, a young girl, was approached by appellant, who stood four to five feet away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>from her with his hand near his genitals and said, \u201c \u2018Would you suck this for me?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The jury convicted appellant on all charges. The trial court imposed a two-year total sentence. Appellant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We affirm the conviction, finding no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. However, we must correct the sentence in one minor particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">A. <em>Use of Felony Conviction for Impeachment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Appellant first complains of the trial court\u2019s ruling that he could be impeached with one of his prior felony convictions. He claims this ruling was error, because the prior conviction\u2014for felony indecent exposure\u2014did not involve \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d as that term has been used in defining the felonies which may be used for purposes of impeachment, under the opinion of Justices Kaus, Mosk, and Broussard in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111]. We conclude the prior conviction was properly admitted for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">We begin with the words of the California Constitution, which provides that: <em>\u201cAny </em>prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding . . . <em>shall </em>subsequently be used <em>without limitation </em>for purposes of impeachment . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (f) [subdivision (f)]), italics added.) If the plain terms of this constitutional mandate are applied, the prior felony conviction was properly admitted for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">1. <em>The Castro Problem</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Appellant, contending to the contrary, relies, however, upon the lead opinion of Justice Kaus in <em>Castro, </em>concurred in by two other justices. The law implicated by this reliance has a somewhat convoluted history.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 452-453 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1], the Supreme Court held that Evidence Code section 352<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (section 352) applied to evidence of prior convictions offered for impeachment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>that Evidence Code section 788 (permitting proof of felony conviction for impeachment purposes) was not exempted from the application of section 352, i.e., read together the two sections provided \u201cdiscretion to the trial judge to exclude evidence of prior felony convictions when their probative value on credibility is outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Thereafter, these <em>Beagle </em>guidelines were addressed by the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 97-99 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43]and a number of succeeding cases (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 307-308) in which abuse of discretion by trial courts in admitting such proof was found, inter alia, because of remoteness of the felony conviction, admitting the fact of a prior conviction without identifying the crime committed, admitting priors not bearing on truthfulness, admitting a prior of the same crime as that charged,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201c \u2018sanitizing]\u2019 \u201d prior convictions by identifying them with such phrases as \u201c \u2018felony involving theft\u2019 \u201d for a robbery conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barrick </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 115, 127 [187 Cal.Rptr. 716, 654 P.2d 1243].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The confusion and consternation these decisions created in the trial courts predictably led, on many occasions, to exclusion at trial of a great many prior felony convictions because of the uncertainty of what felony impeachment evidence could be safely allowed and how it was to be presented, i.e., in a \u201c \u2018sanitized\u2019 \u201d form or not. The practical result frequently was the refusal to admit such evidence altogether, for fear of reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The electorate responded to this situation by an initiative measure, Proposition 8 (the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights) which, inter alia, amended our constitution by the addition of subdivision (f), quoted above in pertinent part.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The questions presented the Supreme Court thereafter in <em>Castro </em>were these: (a) Was subdivision (f) to be literally interpreted so that <em>all </em>felony convictions were admissible for impeachment purposes? (b) After subdivision (f), are such admissible convictions confined to those necessarily involving moral turpitude?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In restricting admissibility of felony convictions to those involving moral turpitude, the lead opinion in <em>Castro </em>essentially concluded that the disavowal of any effect on the application of section 352, which is contained in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>28, subdivision <em>(d) </em>of article I of the California Constitution, left undisturbed the trial court\u2019s discretion to weigh the relevancy and prejudicial effect of prior felony convictions in determining their admissibility. The overriding restrictions applying to exercise of this discretion were these: \u201c[Subdivision (d), <em>as well as due process, </em>forbids the use of convictions of felonies which do not necessarily involve moral turpitude\u201d; such \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d however, was unrestricted \u201ceven if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 306, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Thus, a two-pronged rationale emerged from the lead opinion in <em>Castro </em>for this \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d rule. It was asserted, first, that federal due process standards necessarily limited impeachment to felonies involving moral turpitude; and second, that exclusion of felonies not involving moral turpitude was required as a matter of law because such felonies, when reviewed under standards of applicable judicial discretion under section 352, are \u201cmarginally relevant but prejudicial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In 1992, our Supreme Court recognized that the <em>Castro </em>federal due process rationale, for exclusion of felonies not involving moral turpitude, was undermined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Bock Laundry Machine Co. </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 504, 508-527, footnote 4 [104 L.Ed.2d 557, 563-576, 109 S.Ct. 1981], <em>Green </em>had construed then Federal Rules of Evidence, rule 609(a) (28 U.S.C.) as <em>requiring </em>admission for impeachment purposes of any conviction for a crime, punishment for which exceeded one year in prison. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 296, fn. 6 [14 Cal.Rptr. 418, 841 P.2d 938].) Thus, notions of federal due process no longer support the <em>Castro </em>decision, if they ever did. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">It is also significant that in <em>Castro </em>a four-justice majority explicitly or implicitly <em>rejected </em>the other rationale, of asserted marginal relevancy under section 352, for imposition of a \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d limitation on the admission of prior convictions for impeachment\u2014although the four justices were seriously divided in their various separate opinions on other points. Justice Grodin concurred in the affirmance of the conviction, since the plurality opinion found the supposed error was harmless; but he pointed out that the rationale invoked was at variance with the constitutional language allowing admission of \u201cany prior felony conviction . . . \u2018without limitation\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 319-320 (cone, and dis. opn. of Grodin, J.).) He suggested that the only question as to admission of a prior conviction was relevance for impeachment, although this question could in practice be the same as the question of whether the prior felony involved \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 322 (cone, and dis. opn. of Grodin, J.).) As Justice Grodin later said in his separate concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Collins </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 378, 396 [228 Cal.Rptr. 899, 722 P.2d 173], \u201cI thought this court was wrong in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>[citation], . . . and I still think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Then-Justice Lucas also concurred in <em>Castro, </em>supra, finding the prior conviction in question was properly admissible \u201c \u2018without limitation\u2019 \u201d to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony. (38 Cal.3d at pp. 322-323 (cone, and dis. opn. of Lucas, J.).) Chief Justice Bird and Justice Reynoso also rejected the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d test <em>{id. </em>at p. 323 (cone, and dis. opn. of Bird, C. J.)), finding it unworkable in practice: \u201cThe trial courts need clear guidance as to which felonies are admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness. Today\u2019s decision not only lacks that clarity but is an open-ended invitation to judicial chaos.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 336 (cone, and dis. opn. of Bird, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d limitation, questioned or implicitly rejected in <em>Castro </em>by four justices at that time, has not yet been explicitly disavowed by subsequent case law, in part because the felonies involved in most reported cases have been found to involve \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d Division Three of this district, per Justice Scott, noted the \u201csplintered\u201d nature of the court in <em>Castro, </em>and found no prejudicial error where the trial court ruled a defendant charged with robbery could be impeached with his four prior robbery convictions, admittedly crimes of moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at pp. 63, 66.) <em>Stewart </em>characterized the <em>Castro </em>lead opinion\u2019s statements concerning the manner of exercise of trial court discretion, as to impeachment by prior felony convictions, as mere \u201cdicta.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at pp. 64-65.) Thus, <em>Stewart, </em>while apparently disavowing the \u201cdicta\u201d of the <em>Castro </em>lead opinion, dealt with impeachment by conviction of felonies admittedly involving moral turpitude, and rationalized its result solely on an analysis of the lower court\u2019s section 352 discretion. \u201c[N]o opinion has value as a precedent on points as to which there is no agreement of a majority of the court. [Citations.] Therefore, lacking clear direction from the Supreme Court, we turn to settled principles generally applicable when a trial court has discretion to act [under section 352].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Stewart </em>was cited with approval by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 655 [7 Cal.Rptr. 564, 828 P.2d 705], wherein the trial court, <em>in limine, </em>prevented the proposed impeachment of a <em>prosecution </em>witness with a 1965 felony conviction for voluntary manslaughter (which the prosecution conceded was a felony \u201cnecessarily involving] moral turpitude\u201d) for purposes of subdivision (f). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654.) The trial court (parroting the language of the <em>Castro </em>\u201cdicta\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 306)) found the prior conviction \u201cmarginally relevant but highly prejudicial\u201d and excluded it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u201cunder [section] 352 primarily because of the remoteness of time.\u201d <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 655.) In addition to this implicit questioning of <em>Castro\u2019s </em>rationale by our Supreme Court in <em>Clair, supra, </em>and <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>and its explicit disavowal by this district in <em>Stewart </em>as mere \u201cdicta,\u201d it has also been criticized as \u201cso manifestly unworkable that it cannot be taken seriously by the trial and appellate courts\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bautista </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1, 8 [265 Cal.Rptr. 661] (cone. opn. of Kline, P. J.)), and has been construed into virtual desuetude by the adaptation of an abuse of discretion test on review. Finally, the federal Supreme Court, in <em>Green, supra, </em>has rejected <em>Castro\u2019s </em>federal due process rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The problem is obvious: A substantial body of authority has implicitly or explicitly questioned the precedential value of the <em>Castro </em>lead opinion in excluding impeachment by felonies not involving moral turpitude, despite the plain language of subdivision (f). \u201cWe recognize that [subdivision (f)] militates in favor of allowing a party to use <em>any prior felony conviction </em>to impeach any witness in any criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 655, italics added.) Those authorities, however, have generally rationalized their holdings on the second prong of the lead opinion in Castro\u2014whether the lower court\u2019s decision under section 352 to allow use of felonies involving moral turpitude constituted an abuse of <em>discretion\u2014not </em>by applying the plain language of subdivision (f) to admit <em>all </em>felonies for such purpose, including those <em>not </em>involving moral turpitude. (Subd. (f).) This state of affairs, objectively viewed, seems questionable in light of the provisions of subdivision (f) itself. The resulting approach\u2014of paying lip service to <em>Castro </em>while reaching diverse conclusions on an abuse of discretion analysis, and undercutting or ignoring the due process rationale of that case\u2014has not yet been reexamined by our Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in the present case, the result we would reach on considering the application of subdivision (f) is the same we would reach under the abuse of discretion prong of the lead opinion\u2019s rationale in <em>Castro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">2. <em>No Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We find no abuse of discretion here since even under the <em>Castro </em>\u201cmoral turpitude\u201d limitation\u2014although there is no California case precisely on point holding that indecent exposure is a crime of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d\u2014the trial court correctly ruled the prior conviction could be used for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Under the <em>Castro </em>limitation, a felony conviction need not directly involve dishonesty to be admissible; the conviction involves the required \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d if the felony is one which denotes \u201c \u2018readiness to do evil\u2019 \u201d and supports \u201c \u2018the general proposition that [a previously convicted defendant] is of <em>bad character </em>and unworthy of credit.\u2019 \u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 314, quoting Justice Holmes\u2019s decision in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad </em>(1884) 137 Mass. 77, 78, italics added by the <em>Castro </em>court.) This standard includes crimes which demonstrate <em>\u201cmoral depravity </em>other than dishonesty: child molestation, crimes of violence, torture, brutality and so on.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 315, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The crime of felony indecent exposure of which appellant was convicted requires a showing that appellant <em>\u201cwillfully </em>and lewdly\u201d exposed his genitals in a public place, or where there were other persons present to be offended. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314, subd. 1, italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A conviction, thus, requires proof that a defendant <em>intentionally </em>exposed himself <em>in a public place, </em>or offended or annoyed <em>others, </em>in order to bring about sexual arousal in himself or others. <em>(In re Smith </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 362, 364-366 [102 Cal.Rptr. 335, 497 P.2d 807].) \u201cAbsent additional conduct intentionally directing attention to his genitals for sexual purposes, a person, as here, who simply sunbathes in the nude on an isolated beach does not \u2018lewdly\u2019 expose his private parts within the meaning of section 314.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">This requirement of lewdness, which is needed for a conviction of indecent exposure in California, supplies the assurance that a conviction for indecent exposure is one which necessarily involves moral turpitude. \u201cThe separate requirement that the intent of the actor be \u2018lewd\u2019 is an essential element of tire offense .... [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 365.) \u201cAccordingly, a conviction . . . requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the actor not only meant to expose himself, but intended by his conduct to direct public attention to his genitals for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or affront.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366.) This intentional and lewd desire to corrupt or offend others, for purposes of one\u2019s own sexual desires, may aptly be described as a state of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">A person who intentionally and lewdly affronts strangers and members of the general public, with unwelcome and offensive sexual displays of his genitals, is a person of \u201cmoral depravity\u201d and \u201c \u2018bad character\u2019 \u201d with a \u201c\u2018readiness to do evil.\u2019\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 314-315.) We also observe in passing that indecent exposure only becomes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>felony in California through recidivism, i.e., indecent exposure is only a felony if the defendant has previously been convicted of the same or a similar sexual offense. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314.) Anyone guilty of recidivist sexual crimes is, by definition, a person with at least some \u201c \u2018readiness to do evil.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant wrongly relies upon a decision by the Court of Appeals of Virginia, <em>Chrisman </em>v. <em>Com. </em>(1986) 3 Va.App. 89 [348 S.E.2d 399]. <em>Chris-man </em>did not deal with impeachment for a felony requiring proof of lewdness and intentional exposure to others for the purposes of arousal; it dealt instead with a Virginia misdemeanor which apparently criminalized mere public nudity, since the court observed that Lady Godiva could have been convicted of this misdemeanor for riding through Coventry clad only in her hair\u2014even though her motives were chaste and pure, since she did so as a form of medieval charitable fund raising. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 404.) Appellant, however, is clearly no Lady Godiva.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Also, California is not Virginia. As interpreted by our Supreme Court <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366), the California felony in issue here is one which necessarily involves moral turpitude. There is no merit to appellant\u2019s contrary contention, whether based upon <em>Chrisman, supra, </em>or a strained reading of certain dicta in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rylaarsdam </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 13-14 [181 Cal.Rptr. 723], which held a homosexual who displayed his penis to an undercover officer in a movie theater could be guilty of indecent exposure, despite a claim that the defendant reasonably believed the officer was also a homosexual who would welcome such a display. The <em>Rylaarsdam </em>court properly observed that people who lewdly and intentionally expose themselves to others in movie theaters, for the purpose of sexual arousal of themselves or others, do so at their peril; it is not a defense to claim that the exposer reasonably believed the victim would also become aroused by the display (and, in fact, the lewd intent to arouse the observer may be an element of the offense). <em>Rylaarsdam </em>does not support appellant\u2019s suggestion that indecent exposure is a strict liability offense, which does not entail lewd intent and moral turpitude. <em>In re Smith </em>holds directly to the contrary. (Cf. also <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>State </em>(1926) 33 Okla.Crim.App. 434 [244 P. 208] [An aged recluse who bathed near an open window which could be seen from an adjoining property did not violate a similar Oklahoma statute, since he was not guilty of \u201cindulgence in lust\u201d toward his neighbor.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Under California law, the offense of felony indecent exposure, a crime of moral turpitude, was properly used to impeach appellant\u2019s testimony. Nor do we perceive any abuse of discretion by the trial court; we note the conviction was not unduly remote or unduly recent; and the trial court did not allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>jury to know that the prior felony conviction was for indecent exposure, the same crime charged here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickle </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 140, 172 [284 Cal.Rptr. 511, 814 P.2d 290] [There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of a \u201csanitized\u201d lewd conduct felony conviction for impeachment, where the jury was not told the nature of the offense.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">B. <em>Appellant\u2019s Remaining </em>Contentions<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The sentence is corrected to show that the 30-day sentences imposed for lewd conduct are stayed.

J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-14\">Section 352 provides: \u201cThe court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The trial court need not suppress prior convictions simply because they are identical to the crime charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 59, 66 [215 Cal.Rptr. 716].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"><em>Barrick </em>was decided after the passage of Proposition 8 establishing article I, section 28 of the California Constitution, discussed post; but Proposition 8 did not govern in <em>Barrick </em>because the trial had preceded its passage.
