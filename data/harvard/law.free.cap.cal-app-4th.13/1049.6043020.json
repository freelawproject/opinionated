The condition required the appellant, convicted of shoplifting beer from a supermarket, to wear an outer garment bearing a bold, printed statement of his status as a felony theft probationer. The requirement applied whenever the probationer was outside his actual living quarters. In the unpublished portion of the opinion we further hold that the trial court deprived appellant of his due process right to written notice that he was charged with having violated the probation condition and that the court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for continuance of the probation revocation hearing. We reverse the order revoking probation and the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On December 5,1989, appellant Russell Allen Hackler pleaded guilty to a single count of petty theft with a prior robbery conviction (Pen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code, \u00a7 666). He also admitted a prior prison term enhancement allegation (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Hackler and another man were apprehended when each took two 12-packs of beer from a store without paying for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">On January 2, 1990, the court offered Hackler a grant of probation for three years with certain conditions. Hackler accepted the offer, so the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed him on probation. Because Hackler was then incarcerated for parole violation, the probation conditions were to take effect when he was released in April. The conditions included 118 days in jail (satisfied with 118 days of presentence credit); a requirement that Hackler report to the court daily until such time as he found employment; a directive that Hackler attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings thrice weekly; and finally, a requirement that Hackler wear as an outer garment a court-supplied T-shirt whenever he was outside his home during the first year of probation. That T-shirt stated on the front, \u201cMy record plus two six-packs [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] equals four years,\u201d and on the back, \u201cI am on felony probation for theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On August 7, 1990, Hackler\u2019s probation officer filed with the court a charge that Hackler had violated his probation in that he had been charged with two counts of burglary allegedly occurring on July 7 and July 9, 1990. He requested that Hackler\u2019s probation be revoked. The following day, Hackler appeared and denied the allegations. A hearing was set for August 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>At the August 21 hearing, Hackler\u2019s attorney asked Judge Howard Broad-man, who had accepted the plea and granted probation, to disqualify himself, or, in the alternative, for a continuance so that Hackler could formally move for disqualification based on actual prejudice. The request was denied, the judge maintaining that he was not biased and pointing out that the request was untimely. Hackler\u2019s request that the matter be heard at or near the time of the trial of the burglary charge was likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">After hearing some of the evidence regarding the alleged burglaries, the court, on its own motion, arraigned Hackler for violating the T-shirt condition. Hackler, through his attorney, expressly refused to waive the filing of a certificate and affidavit of probable cause by the probation officer. Over appellant\u2019s objection the court announced it would hear the T-shirt violation matter upon concluding the hearing on the burglary charges. After hearing the remainder of the evidence regarding the noticed violations, the court concluded that Hackler violated his probation through participation in at least one burglary. It then received additional evidence regarding the T-shirt condition and likewise concluded Hackler violated this condition by appearing in the hallway outside his apartment without his T-shirt. The court set the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On September 6, 1990, the court imposed a four-year prison sentence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> consisting of the upper term of three years for the section 666 conviction and a one-year enhancement for the prison prior. A $500 restitution fine was also ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Hackler\u2019s timely appeal is from both the order revoking probation and the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">I. <em>The T-shirt condition was unreasonably overbroad and invalid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Hackler challenges validity of the T-shirt condition on grounds it is vague, overbroad, and not reasonably related to the goal of rehabilitation. Respondent first responds that Hackler waived his challenge by failing to appeal from the order granting probation and by failing to assert the challenge at the probation revocation hearing. We initially consider the waiver issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">A. <em>Waiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Respondent relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 715 [178 Cal.Rptr. 188] to support its waiver claim. In <em>Mitchell </em>the defendant, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Hackler, was convicted of violating section 666. He was sentenced to a three-year prison term but execution of sentence was suspended and probation granted on the condition that Mitchell, an alcoholic, promise to abstain from intoxicating beverages and submit to treatment with Antabuse. The conditions were imposed with Mitchell\u2019s full knowledge and consent, and he did not appeal from the judgment of conviction. After he was found to have been in violation of probation due to \u201cnumerous violations of the condition requiring him to totally abstain from the use of alcohol\u201d (125 Cal.App.3d at p. 718), Mitchell appealed, \u201cclaiming his probation may not be revoked for violating a condition, abstinence, which his alleged alcoholic disease made him constitutionally unable to abide by. Again, <em>this should have been raised at sentencing. He asked for probation, and knowingly agreed to accept the precise term of probation of which he now complains. In addition, Mitchell did not raise this argument at the revocation hearing, and it need not be reviewed here.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 719, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">To the extent <em>Mitchell </em>is construed as holding that the defendant\u2019s having agreed to the probation condition in the trial court bars his attacking its validity on appeal, the holding is contrary to established law. <em>(In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 767, 776 [83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1374, 1377 [277 Cal.Rptr. 444]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiddoo </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 922, 926-927 [275 Cal.Rptr. 298].)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The second expressed basis for the <em>Mitchell </em>court\u2019s conclusion that a challenge to the probation condition\u2019s validity was not cognizable on appeal from the order of revocation\u2014that it was not raised during the revocation hearing\u2014might be applicable here.  Hackler did not clearly assert, at the revocation hearing, the grounds of challenge now raised on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we will conclude that his failure to raise the issue in the trial court did not constitute a waiver. There are two reasons for our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">First, Hackler was not given any advance written notice that the hearing would involve the T-shirt condition,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and his request for a continuance was denied. He was forced to a hearing on that issue with virtually no time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>preparation of legal challenges to the probation condition. We cannot find waiver when denial of a party\u2019s due process right to notice may have prevented him from formulating and advancing the legal arguments presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Second, the principal reason for the rule that a party is deemed to waive points not raised in tibe trial court is that the trial court should be given an opportunity to correct the error or abuse. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) That reason does not apply here because the trial court itself raised the validity of the T-shirt condition and welcomed an appellate ruling on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cThe Court: . . . And for the purposes of finding out the validity of that sentence, I would like to find out whether or not that\u2019s a valid thing that we can do and so I would like to arraign him on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I don\u2019t [know] whether he wore the shirt or didn\u2019t, if he\u2019s guilty of the violation of probation or not. But, one thing as a Judge I would like to know is whether or not that\u2019s a valid condition of probation. I would like to have a hearing on that if, in fact, he did violate it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if he has violated his probation by not wearing his T-shirt, then I want\u2014if the evidence is sufficient, and I so find, I presume you\u2019re going to appeal this decision or someone is going to appeal this decision. And that condition of probation is something that the Court of Appeals [mc] ought to look at. And that\u2019s the only way to have that issue properly framed to the Court of Appeals <em>[sic].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The court\u2019s comments clearly indicate that, in its mind, the issue of the validity of the condition was joined and ripe for appellate review. We conclude that Hackler was thus relieved of any obligation to expressly preserve the issue himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">That brings us to the remaining basis upon which respondent claims waiver\u2014Hackler\u2019s failure to attack the order granting probation by direct appeal or by petition for a writ of habeas corpus. As noted, respondent relies only on <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d 715. The <em>Mitchell </em>court never referred to the defendant\u2019s failure to appeal from the order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>probation as a ground for finding waiver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither did it engage in any analysis or reasoning supporting a conclusion that appellate challenges to probation conditions may be made only in a direct attack upon the order granting probation. Furthermore, the <em>Mitchell </em>\u201cholding\u201d of waiver was equivocal, at best, because the appellate court went on to consider and discuss the validity of the challenged probation condition, concluding it had been properly imposed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 719-720.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">We are not aware of any case squarely holding that the validity of probation conditions may be raised only by direct appeal upon the order granting probation. On the other hand, our research reveals that California appellate courts have frequently considered the validity of probation conditions, sometimes striking them, even in the absence of an appeal from the original probation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Dominguez </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 623 [64 Cal.Rptr. 290] is the seminal California case on the issue of invalid probation conditions. The <em>Dominguez </em>court articulated a three-pronged standard for judging probation conditions <em>(id. </em>at p. 627) which was expressly adopted by the Supreme Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545].) <em>Dominguez </em>has been cited in scores of subsequent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\"><em>Dominguez </em>came to the appellate court procedurally in the same manner as this case. There was a judgment of conviction, an order granting probation, a subsequent order revoking probation, and an appeal from the latter order. In that appeal the court found the challenged probation condition invalid, ordered it stricken from the order granting probation, and reversed the orders revoking probation and executing judgment. (256 Cal.App.2d at p. 629.) A similar result was reached in <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeman </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 596 [339 P.2d 202], (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 738 [80 Cal.Rptr. 335] [probation condition considered on appeal from order revoking probation; validity upheld].)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldberg </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 601 [119 Cal.Rptr. 616], the defendant was placed on probation in 1968 subject to certain conditions. Probation was purportedly revoked for a violation in 1970, but the court then reinstated it on the original terms and conditions. Apparently the defendant did not appeal from either order. In 1974 the court denied the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>request to eliminate a condition that he not drive a motor vehicle during the 10-year probationary period. He appealed from the order denying his request. The appellate court found the condition was invalid under the applicable provision of the Vehicle Code and reversed. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 603-604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In <em>In re White </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 141 [158 Cal.Rptr. 562], this court considered an application for habeas corpus challenging the validity of a probation condition. The application was filed <em>after </em>probation was revoked for the defendant\u2019s violation of the condition, and there is no indication an appeal was taken from the original order granting probation. This court found the condition invalid and ordered that it be eliminated or modified. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 152; see also <em>In re Robert M. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 812 [209 Cal.Rptr. 657] [condition to juvenile court probation order held invalid after two separate findings of failure to comply; writ relief granted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In some cases, the validity of a probation condition has been attacked in a subsequent criminal proceeding. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 827 [143 Cal.Rptr. 184], the defendant was on probation from a municipal court conviction for petty theft. Probation was subject to various \u201cnarcotics conditions\u201d including that the defendant submit to a search without a warrant at any time. The defendant\u2019s premises were later searched pursuant to that condition, heroin was discovered, and the defendant was charged with its possession. After his motion to suppress evidence was denied, he pleaded guilty and appealed. The appellate court reversed, holding that the suppression motion should have been granted because the search condition imposed in the earlier case was not reasonable under the circumstances of the petty theft conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 838-840; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 759 [97 Cal.Rptr. 302, 488 P.2d 630] [search condition in previous case; probation order held valid].)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Orders granting probation have been directly appealable since 1951. (\u00a7 1237, subd. (a).) In each of the cases cited the defendant thus could have directly attacked the probation condition by appeal, and because the defendant failed to do so the same waiver contention now made by respondent could have been advanced. None of those cases indicates that a claim of waiver was asserted, so they do not stand as direct authority on the waiver issue. Still, the sheer number of cases indicates an appellate court practice to reach the merits of challenges to probation conditions regardless of how the issue comes to the court. In the absence of clear authority to the contrary, we will follow that practice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">B. <em>Merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\"><em>A </em>court granting probation is authorized by statute to impose \u201creasonable conditions, as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>may be done, that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law, for any injury done to any person resulting from that breach, and generally and specifically for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1203.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\u201cAlthough it is well established that courts have broad discretion to impose restrictive conditions to foster rehabilitation and to protect public safety <em>(In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 767, 776 []) that discretion is not boundless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 827, 831-832 [].) The statutory authority of Penal Code section 1203.1 which furnishes and limits the power which the court may exercise is further circumscribed by constitutional considerations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where a condition of probation requires a waiver of constitutional rights, the condition must be narrowly drawn. To the extent it is overbroad it is not reasonably related to a compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation and is an unconstitutional restriction on the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 759, 768 [].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burden </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1279 [253 Cal.Rptr. 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The condition imposed here impinged on Hackler\u2019s inalienable right to privacy guaranteed by the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.) Thus, it is subject to the \u201cmust be narrowly drawn\u201d standard enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The purpose of probation is rehabilitation. (See 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Punishment for Crime, \u00a7 1622, p. 1934; <em>In re Peeler </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 483, 488-489 [72 Cal.Rptr. 254].) Here, though, the court revealed its true intent was to brand Hackler and expose him to public ridicule and humiliation, rather than to facilitate his rehabilitation. The court told Hackler that by accepting the condition he would \u201cbecome a Hester Prin <em>(sic)\"</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for one year. The court also characterized the order as \u201cgoing back to some extent to the era of stocks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">When it offered Hackler probation the court below told him, on the one hand, that it wanted \u201cto turn you around,\u201d and ordered that he \u201ccome to court each morning until you get employment.\u201d On the other hand, the court severely compromised Hackler\u2019s chances of finding employment by imposing the T-shirt condition. Prospective employers are unlikely to have a favorable impression of a job applicant who must publicly advertise his status as a felony theft probationer. Although the court told Hackler it would reconsider the T-shirt requirement <em>after </em>Hackler found employment, it made clear that he must first get a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Is there any excuse that this Court is going to accept from you for not wearing the T-shirt?</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: If I go get a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\u201cThe Court: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: I need to make other arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">\u201cThe Court: Until you come back to this courtroom and I specifically give you permission [not] to wear it, there is no excuse. Okay. If you get a job and your job requires you wearing a uniform or something like that, then I would reconsider it. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>McDowell </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 807 [130 Cal.Rptr. 839], a purse snatcher was given probation with the following condition: \u201c[D]efendant is not to go out of his house unless he is wearing shoes with leather soles and metal taps on the soles and heels.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 813.) He appealed from the conviction and probation order, asserting that the condition amounted to cruel and unusual punishment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">\u201c. . . Appellant argues that by imposing this condition the court is saying, in essence, \u2018You are a purse snatcher and others must always know of your presence,\u2019 and that the condition is tantamount \u2018to hanging a sign around the appellant\u2019s neck that says, \u201cI am a thief.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Appellant makes no showing that all, most or many persons who wear leather soles with metal taps are thieves or are thought to be thieves by the public. His argument that he is somehow identified as a thief by this term of probation is totally unsupported.\u201d (59 Cal.App.3d at p. 812.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">Here, the court below did precisely what the <em>McDowell </em>court hinted was impermissible: it literally hung a sign around Haclder\u2019s neck publicly identifying him as a thief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">\u201c[A] condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">The conduct required here (advertising on Hackler\u2019s chest and back his status as a convicted thief) may relate to the crime for which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>convicted and arguably has some bearing on future criminality. The relationship is so incidental, however, that we cannot find it reasonable. If followed, the condition would probably make it more difficult for Hackler to continue shoplifting. But he was not just required to wear the shirt at times and places where shoplifting might be a possibility. Rather, the court ordered that Hackler wear the shirt at <em>all </em>times while he was outside his actual living quarters. Clearly, the condition could adversely affect Hackler\u2019s ability to carry on activities having no possible relationship to the offense for which he was convicted or to future criminality. The condition was unreasonably overbroad and as such was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">II.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The order revoking probation and the judgment of sentence are reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Best, P.

After the court announced its ruling, Hackler\u2019s counsel requested clarification and argued that \u201cwhen you live in an apartment complex, your house usually includes not only your personal residence where you\u2019re staying, but the common areas like the hallways to and from the outside of the building, and any laundry room facility.\u201d That argument, which the court below noted and rejected, forms the basis for Hackler\u2019s appellate contention that the probation condition was vague and overly broad. Hackler did not, however, expressly argue that the condition was not reasonably related to the rehabilitative goal of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We conclude, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, that the failure to give written notice was a deprivation of Hackler\u2019s due process rights. (See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>(1972) 408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>U.S. 471, 488-489 [33 L.Ed.2d 484, 498-499, 92 S.Ct. 2593]; <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 778, 782 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 661-662, 93 S.Ct. 1756].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In <em>Mitchell </em>the appellant also raised sentencing issues in his appeal from the order revoking probation.

(125 Cal.App.3d at p. 718.) That holding is not applicable here, however, because Hackler\u2019s sentence, unlike that in Mitchell, was not imposed until <em>after </em>the order revoking probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">See Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1049.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
