By name, the four defendants are David James Farrow (David), Douglas Gregory Farrow (Douglas), David Wayne Jackson (Jackson) and Keith Benjamin Fletcher (Fletcher).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In general terms, all four defendants were charged by a three-count information that set forth allegations of first degree residential robbery, residential burglary and assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. The information also set forth numerous sentence enhancement allegations as against each of the defendants. The defendants appeal from the judgments entered below upon the jury guilty verdicts and sentence enhancement allegation true findings that were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">On appeal, the defendants have raised the following contentions:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1) The trial court prejudicially erred in failing to conduct further proceedings to inquire into the possibility of juror misconduct, which possibility was revealed for the first time in connection with David\u2019s motion for a new trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1610\">*1610</page-number>and further erred in failing to grant the other defendants\u2019 request for a continuance of the hearing on the motion for a new trial to enable them to further investigate the purported juror misconduct for the purpose of determining whether newly discovered evidence would be an additional meritorious ground for the motion; (2) three instances of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct occurred during the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument; (3) the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to give requested jury instructions concerning vandalism and trespass as lesser related offenses of the burglary charge; (4) the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to instruct sua sponte on the defense theory of \u201cclaim of right\u201d; (5) the trial court erred in using the appellate \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard in ruling on one of the bases for the motion for a new trial\u2014an asserted insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction on count III; (6) the trial court erred under Penal Code section 654 in imposing sentence on both the burglary count and the assault count and not staying execution of the sentences imposed on the assault count; (7) the convictions of first degree burglary and first degree robbery must be modified to convictions in the second degree inasmuch as the jury was not instructed as to the degrees of those crimes or that it was its (the jury\u2019s) duty to fix the degrees of those crimes (as a consequence of which the jury did not expressly fix the degrees of the same in the first degree); (8) the trial court erred by failing to state reasons (as to two of the defendants) for imposing consecutive sentences with respect to the assault convictions; (9) the imposition of $5,000 restitution fines was not supported by the evidence and the amount of the fines was excessive; (10) the trial court erred by failing to instruct sua sponte with CALJIC No. 2.02; and (11) (with respect to Fletcher) the trial court erred by failing to strike certain \u201cprior prison term\u201d sentence enhancements once those enhancements had been \u201cused\u201d to impose an upper term of imprisonment with respect to the burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We shall conclude that the judgments entered below must be modified by staying execution of certain portions of the sentences which were imposed in accord with section 654 of the Penal Code. As so modified, we shall affirm those judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Statement of Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Late in the evening of October 17, 1990, Mary Katschman (Katschman) and her boyfriend, Adam Eddy (Eddy), were at home and playing darts at Katschman\u2019s Apple Valley residence. Katschman\u2019s two daughters, a three-year-old and a four-month-old, were also there at the residence. Katschman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1611\">*1611</page-number>was waiting for her ex-husband (Bass) to come by and give her a ride over to a friend\u2019s house. The front door to the house was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Katschman noticed a strange car slowly pull up in front of the driveway to her home, and she shut and locked the front door. Peering through the peephole in the front door, Katschman noticed David and another man (later identified in court as Fletcher) approach the front door. At the same time, Eddy was watching David and Fletcher through a window located in one of the home\u2019s bedrooms. While looking through the bedroom window, Eddy saw the shadow of a third man (later identified in court as Jackson) standing in front of Katschman\u2019s garage door, swinging a baseball bat \u201clike a baton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">When David reached the front door, he said something to the following effect: \u201cCome on. Open the door up. I drove a long way. I\u2019m really tired. I want some shit.\u201d Katschman assumed that David was referring to drugs, because he had on a previous occasion asked her for some drugs. Katschman told David (as she had on the previous occasion) that she didn\u2019t \u201cdo that anymore.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">While all of this was happening, Bass arrived at Katschman\u2019s home. As Bass approached Katschman\u2019s front door, David started yelling at him. David, Fletcher and Jackson all started walking toward Bass. The three men then \u201cjumped\u201d Bass.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At Katschman\u2019s direction, Eddy telephoned \u201c911\u201d and then handed the telephone over to her to report the altercation. After briefly describing the situation to the \u201c911\u201d operator, Katschman got disconnected from \u201c911.\u201d She immediately took her older daughter into a back bedroom to have her (the daughter) stay with the baby daughter. While this was occurring, Eddy went and looked out of another bedroom window to see if anyone was still in the front yard, but he did not see anyone there. Bass then telephoned Katschman to tell her that he had escaped from the men chasing him, that he was telephoning from a neighbor\u2019s house and that the men were \u201ccoming back\u201d to Katschman\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Eddy went to the bathroom and opened a window, at which point he heard footsteps approaching the house. Focusing on the footsteps, he observed \u201cfour guys diagonally cutting through our yard armed.\u201d By \u201carmed,\u201d Eddy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1612\">*1612</page-number>meant \u201cwith baseball bats.\u201d He called to Katschman, \u201cHere they come.\u201d Katschman started to run toward the back bedroom in which her two daughters were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Before Katschman could reach her daughters, she heard her front door being forced open. The next thing she was aware of was that David and Fletcher were standing immediately behind her in the central hallway and David was asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s the dope?\u201d Katschman responded by stating that she did not have any drugs. Fletcher appeared to be carrying a \u201cstick or something.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jackson then came into Katschman\u2019s view in the central hallway, swinging a baseball bat and saying, \u201cOkay. Where\u2019s the stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Fletcher turned into the bedroom on the other side of the hallway, the bedroom in which Eddy was located, and turned on a light in that room. Jackson entered the bedroom in which Eddy was located, swung his bat and broke the light that Fletcher had just turned on. Katschman then heard Jackson demanding money from Eddy and heard Eddy \u201cscreaming\u201d: \u201cQuit hitting me with the bat. Cool out. Quit hitting me with the bat.\u201d While Jackson was assaulting Eddy, Fletcher returned to the bedroom in which Katschman and her two children were located, approached Katschman with the small souvenir bat in his hand and demanded that she tell him \u201cwhere the dope was.\u201d Fletcher then told Katschman \u201cthat they were going to tear [Katschman\u2019s] house apart, and if they found any [drugs] they were going to pulverize [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Eddy had also heard the front door being forcibly opened. To Eddy, it sounded as if the door was being kicked open, and then Eddy was aware of \u201cfour guys rushing down the hallway yelling and screaming.\u201d David was in the front of the foursome; Fletcher was behind David and Jackson was third in line in the hallway. Eddy noticed that the fourth person in the foursome had a gun in his hands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jackson was swinging a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Jackson entered the bedroom where Eddy was by that time located by knocking back the bedroom door with his bat and putting a hole in the door. Eddy had a baseball bat in his hands for self-defense, but he dropped it because he did not want to get into a \u201cbat fight\u201d with Jackson. Jackson began to hit Eddy in the legs with his bat. Eddy fell to the ground on his back and began to fend off Jackson\u2019s blows with the balls of his feet. Jackson was \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d: \u201cWhere\u2019s all your dope. Give me all your money.\u201d Douglas, who was standing in the hallway with a rifle in his hands, told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1613\">*1613</page-number>Jackson to \u201ccalm down.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Eddy gave his wallet to Jackson, but Jackson threw it back to Eddy and told him to take the money out of the wallet. Eddy did so, and gave the money in his wallet ($68) to Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">At this moment, a deputy sheriff and a sergeant from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department (Cusemano and Williams, respectively) arrived at the Katschman residence. The two of them had been dispatched to the Katschman residence in response to the \u201c911\u201d call reporting the attack on Bass. As the officers exited their patrol cars, they could hear yelling and the sound of something being broken coming from the residence. The condition of the door and door frame indicated to the officers that the front door had been forcibly opened.The officers decided to make a \u201ctactical entry\u201d (weapons drawn) into the residence\u2014which they proceeded to do, with Williams kicking the door fully open and entering the residence first.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The first person the officers saw was Douglas, who was standing at the junction of tire front room and the bedroom hallway. Douglas was holding a rifle in his hands.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The officers disarmed Douglas and Williams placed him on the floor of the front room. Cusemano then proceeded down the hallway and, in turn, confronted David, Fletcher and Jackson and individually escorted each of those three intruders back to Williams in the front room.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">On November 8, 1990, an information was filed by the People against the four defendants charging each of them with (a) one count of first degree residential robbery with respect to taking personal property from the immediate presence of both Eddy and Katschman, (b) one count of residential burglary with respect to the Katschman residence (identified in the information as being occupied by Eddy) and (c) one count of assault with a deadly or dangerous weapon (a baseball bat) or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury with respect to Eddy. The information also charged various sentence enhancement allegations against each of the four defendants. (The particulars of the charges and enhancement allegations are set forth in greater detail below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">On January 2, 1991, a jury trial was commenced in the matter. The People\u2019s case-in-chief adduced evidence which comports with the factual description of the events set forth above. None of the defendants testified on their own behalf. The only defense witness called by any of the defendants was Terry Fletcher (Terry), Fletcher\u2019s brother. Terry was called by Douglas and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1614\">*1614</page-number>(a) Approximately one month before the date of the incident in question, he (Terry) had gone with David to the Apple Valley residence of a \u201cLiz.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\">(b) David had taken a rifle (which looked just like the one introduced into evidence at the trial) with him when he went to Liz\u2019s residence. David intended to use the rifle, together with some money, as a sort of \u201cdown payment\u201d for a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">(c) Terry had remained outside in his vehicle when David went inside Liz\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">(d) When David returned to Terry\u2019s vehicle, he no longer had the rifle, having left it at Liz\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">(e) The rifle in question was (or looked exactly like) the \u201cfamily rifle\u201d of the Farrow family, to which any member of the Farrow family would have had access if it was located at the Farrow residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">On January 9, 1991, the jury returned guilty verdicts and sentence enhancement allegation true findings as to all matters which had been submitted to it for determination. The next day, in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true all but one of the sentence enhancement allegation \u201cpriors\u201d which had been alleged by the People as against David and Fletcher (the one exception being a \u201cprior prison term served\u201d sentence enhancement allegation which had been alleged against Fletcher). In summary, the guilty verdicts and sentence enhancement allegation true findings which were returned against the four defendants were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">(1) As to David:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-10\">(a) One count of first degree residential robbery (count I) (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211 &amp; 212.5, subd.

(a)(1)) and findings that he (David) had twice previously served a separate prison term for the commission of a felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">(2) As to Douglas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">(a) One count of first degree residential robbery (count I) (\u00a7\u00a7211 &amp; 212.5, subd. (a)) and findings (i) that in the commission of said offense he (Douglas) personally used a firearm within the meaning of sections 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1) and 12022.5, subdivision (a) and (ii) that a principal in said offense was armed with a firearm within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">(b) One count of residential burglary (count II) (\u00a7 459) and the same sentence enhancement findings as were found true with respect to count I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">(c) One count of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (count III) (\u00a7 245, subd.

The trial court immediately thereafter proceeded to sentence the defendants in accord with the guilty verdicts and true findings which previously had been returned. The four defendants were sentenced as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">(1) David was sentenced to a total term of eighteen years in state prison, consisting of the following: (A) With respect to count II (residential burglary)\u2014(i) an upper base term of six years, (ii) two consecutive five-year \u201cprior serious felony conviction\u201d sentence enhancements (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and (iii) a consecutive one-year \u201cprincipal armed with a firearm\u201d sentence enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)); and (B) with respect to count III (assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury)\u2014a consecutive one-year term (one-third the three-year midterm). Execution of all of the other sentence terms which were imposed by the trial court with respect to count I, as well as the other sentence enhancement terms which were imposed with respect to counts I and III, were stayed. The trial court also imposed a $5,000 restitution fine on David.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">(2) Douglas was sentenced to a total term of nine years in state prison, consisting of the following: (A) With respect to count II (residential burglary)\u2014(i) a middle base term of four years and (ii) a consecutive four-year midterm sentence enhancement for \u201cpersonal use of a firearm\u201d (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)); and (B) with respect to count III (assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury)\u2014a consecutive one-year term (one-third the three-year midterm). Execution of all of the other sentence terms which were imposed by the trial court with respect to count I, as well as the other sentence enhancement terms which were imposed with respect to counts I and III, were stayed. The trial court also imposed a $5,000 restitution fine on Douglas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">(3) Jackson was sentenced to a total term of seven years in state prison, consisting of the following: (A) With respect to count II (residential burglary)\u2014(i) a middle base term of four years, (ii) a consecutive one-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1617\">*1617</page-number>\u201cprincipal armed with a firearm\u201d sentence enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd.

Execution of all of the other sentence terms (including sentence enhancement terms) which were imposed by the trial court with respect to count I were stayed. The trial court also imposed a $5,000 restitution fine on Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">(4) Fletcher was sentenced to a total term of eleven years in state prison, consisting of the following: (A) With respect to count II (residential burglary)\u2014(i) An upper base term of six years, (ii) a consecutive one-year \u201cprincipal armed with a firearm\u201d sentence enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)) and (iii) three consecutive one-year \u201cprior prison term served\u201d sentence enhancements (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)); and (B) with respect to count III (assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury)\u2014a consecutive one-year term (one-third the three-year midterm). Execution of all of the other sentence terms which were imposed by the trial court with respect to count I, as well as the other sentence enhancement terms which were imposed with respect to counts I and III, were stayed. The trial court also imposed a $5,000 restitution fine on Fletcher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Each of the four defendants thereafter filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Additional facts will be referred to, as needed, in the discussion which follows. We will address the issues raised on appeal in the order in which those issues can be resolved most efficiently and logically.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Alleged Instructional Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">The defendants contend that the trial court committed four instances of reversible error by failing or refusing to instruct the jury in a particular manner. We will here discuss three of the instances identified by the defendants and conclude that none of these three instances requires redress by this court. We will address the fourth asserted instructional error (concerning the degree of the burglary and robbery convictions) in a different context later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1618\">*1618</page-number>A. <em>Allegedly Erroneous Failure to Give Requested Instructions Concerning Lesser Related Offenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Fletcher\u2019s counsel requested the trial court to instruct the jury as to the offenses of vandalism (\u00a7 594) and trespass (\u00a7 602.5\u2014trespass into a noncommercial dwelling house) as lesser related offenses to the charged residential burglary. Counsel for David and counsel for Jackson joined in this request, but counsel for Douglas did not. The trial court denied the request, stating: \u201cThe two crimes that you desire to have given are not necessarily related or included in the charged crimes, so the court is going to deny the request.\u201d All four defendants assign this denial as reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">While a resolution of this issue as it relates to David, Fletcher and Jackson requires a somewhat lengthy discussion and analysis, it does not insofar as it relates to Douglas.  <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055] (hereinafter cited simply as Geiger), the cornerstone authority upon which virtually the entire construct of California law concerning the giving of \u201clesser related\u201d instructions is built, states unequivocally: \u201cSince <em>sua sponte </em>instructions would conflict with the defendant\u2019s right to notice of the charges, there is no obligation to instruct on related offenses in the absence of a request by the defendant for such instructions.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 530.) Inasmuch as trial counsel for Douglas did not request instructions on the lesser related offenses of trespass and vandalism, the trial court was not obligated to give the same and Douglas will not be heard to complain that the trial court erred by refusing to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">That leaves us, then, to address the issue at hand as it relates to David, Fletcher and Jackson. To do so, we turn once again to <em>Geiger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1619\">*1619</page-number><em>Geiger, </em>in general terms, described \u201cthe circumstances in which a defendant is entitled to instructions on related, but not necessarily included, offenses\u201d in the following manner: (1) . . the first prerequisite to receiving instructions on lesser related offenses must be the existence of some basis, other than an unexplainable rejection of prosecution evidence, on which the jury could find the offense to be less than that charged\u201d; (2) \u201cSecond, the offense must be one closely related to that charged and shown by the evidence. . . . Although some evidence offered by the People or the defendant may indicate that the defendant has committed a crime other than that charged, instructions regarding that crime need not be given unless the evidence is also relevant to and admitted for the purpose of establishing whether the defendant is guilty of the charged offense\u201d; and (3) \u201cFinally, the instructions must be justified by the defendant\u2019s reliance on a theory of defense that would be consistent with a conviction for the related offense. Thus, the instruction need not be given if the defense theory and evidence reflect a complete denial of culpability as when the defense is alibi, or the only issue is identity, unless the defendant argues that the evidence at most shows guilt only of the related offense.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at pp. 531-532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Importantly, immediately following the above description of limiting \u201ccircumstances,\u201d \u201cfactors\u201d or \u201ccriteria,\u201d the <em>Geiger </em>opinion set forth the following caveat and guideline: \u201cWe cannot, of course, anticipate all of the varied circumstances in which instructions on related offenses may be requested. We do not foreclose the possibility that experience will teach that these criteria are over- or underinclusive. In doubtful situations, however, the determinative factor should be whether the option to convict a defendant of a related offense is reasonably necessary to insure that the jury is afforded the opportunity to decide all material issues presented by the evidence in accord with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, where denial of that opportunity might undermine the reasonable doubt standard.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 532, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The first and third <em>\u201cGeiger </em>criteria\u201d are relatively easily applied in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">(1) With respect to the \u201cfirst <em>Geiger </em>criterion,\u201d there was an evidentiary basis upon which the jury could have concluded that the defendants had committed trespass and vandalism rather than burglary. The sole felonious intent upon which the prosecution based its theory of burglary (that is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1620\">*1620</page-number>sole felonious intent at the time of entry into Katschman\u2019s residence), and the sole basis upon which the prosecuting attorney argued the matter to the jury, was the intent to commit a robbery. However, throughout the trial and during their closing argument, defense counsel cast doubt on the credibility of this theory of the case by pointing out (indeed, by focusing on) the fact that, insofar as the trial evidence showed, the money that was allegedly taken from Eddy by Jackson was never recovered or otherwise accounted for\u2014 notwithstanding the fact that Williams and Cusemano took Jackson into custody literally within moments of his allegedly having taken the money from Eddy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\n                   Further, the evidence at trial revealed another possible intent, other than robbery, for the defendants\u2019 having entered the Katschman residence: A desire to commit trespass and vandalism as an outpouring of anger over having been turned away after they (the defendants) had driven a long way to consummate a drug purchase.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">(2) With respect to the \u201cthird <em>Geiger </em>criterion,\u201d the giving of instructions on trespass and vandalism as lesser related offenses to the charged burglary would have been entirely consistent with the defense theory put forward by each of the defendants. All of the defendants argued to the jury that there had been no robbery\u2014hence, there had been no intent to commit a robbery upon entering the Katschman residence\u2014hence, there had been no burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">It is the second of the <em>Geiger </em>criteria\u201d\u2014i.e., that the uncharged, lesser related offense be \u201cclosely related to that charged and shown by the evidence\u201d \u2014that is the most difficult to clearly assess and apply in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The difficulty arises, however, not from the evidence which is peculiar to this case but, rather, from the fact that the \u201cclosely related\u201d criterion itself has become obfuscated by the reported California opinions which have discussed and applied it. In large part, this obfuscation is a result of an \u201cunreflective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1621\">*1621</page-number>reliance\u201d which has been inappropriately placed on some of <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>phraseology by certain appellate courts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, cases which have discussed and applied the \u201cclosely related\u201d <em>Geiger </em>criterion have oftentimes inappropriately focused and relied on the following statement in <em>Geiger. </em>\u201cThe [lesser related offense] is related to [the charged offense] <em>since it is made an offense to protect the same societal </em>interest\u2014security of property\u2014as [the charged offense].\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 532, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">In order to understand the improper emphasis and \u201cunreflective reliance\u201d which some courts have placed on <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>\u201csame societal interest\u201d phrase, it is important to understand where that phrase came from and the context in which <em>Geiger </em>had reference to it. In examining ex forum opinions which had held \u201cthat instructions on uncharged related offenses must also be given if it would be fundamentally unfair to deny the defendant the right to have the court or jury consider the \u2018third option\u2019 of convicting the defendant of the related offense\u201d (Geiger, 35 Cal.3d at p. 520), <em>Geiger </em>referred at length to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitaker </em>(D.C. Cir. 1971) 447 F.2d 314 (hereinafter cited simply as <em>Whitaker). </em>Among the <em>Whitaker </em>passages quoted by <em>Geiger </em>is the following: \u201c \u2018A more natural, realistic and sound interpretation of the scope of \u201clesser included offense,\u201d in line with our own views on the subject, is that defendant is entitled to invoke Rule 31(c) when a lesser offense is established by the evidence adduced at trial in proof of the greater offense, with the caveat that there must also be an \u201cinherent\u201d relationship between the greater and lesser offenses, i.e., <em>they must relate to the protection of the same interests, </em>and must be so related that in the general nature of these crimes, though not necessarily invariably, proof of the lesser offense is necessarily presented as part of the showing of the commission of the greater offense. This latter stipulation is prudently required to foreclose a tendency which might otherwise develop towards misuse by the defense of such rule. In the absence of such restraint defense counsel might be tempted to press the jury for leniency by requesting lesser included offense instructions on every lesser crime that could arguably be made out from any evidence that happened to be introduced at trial.\u2019 (447 F.2d at p. 319, fn. omitted.)\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Geiger, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 521, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">When <em>Geiger </em>articulated the second of the \u201ccriteria\u201d constraining the giving of \u201clesser related instructions,\u201d it made reference once again to <em>Whitaker, </em>only to reject any rigid application of <em>Whitaker\u2019s </em>\u201cinherent relationship\u201d standard. It said: \u201cThe District of Columbia Circuit and the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1622\">*1622</page-number>adopting the <em>Whitaker </em>approach have limited instructions to those on offenses having an \u2018inherent relationship\u2019 with the charged offense in order to prevent \u2018abuse\u2019 by defendants seeking to appeal to the jury\u2019s sense of mercy by requesting instructions on every offense that is arguably shown by the evidence. We agree that the right to instructions on related offenses is not without limit. The purpose of the rule, <em>however, </em>serves to define its limits.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 531, italics added.) Interestingly, though, when <em>Geiger </em>actually applied its three-fold \u201ccriteria\u201d to the facts of that case, it seemed to implicitly \u201cturn back\u201d to <em>Whitaker's </em>\u201cinherent relationship\u201d standard, which standard <em>included </em>the \u201csame societal interest\u201d consideration. <em>(Geiger, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 532; see <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Several subsequent opinions have \u201cunreflectively relied\u201d on <em>Geiger's </em>\u201csame societal interest\u201d factor as a virtual sine qua non for establishing the existence of <em>Geiger's </em>\u201cclosely related\u201d criteria for the giving of instructions on lesser related offenses:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">(1) <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 36, 47 [212 Cal.Rptr. 873]: \u201cAttempted possession of cocaine is not closely related to the charge of armed robbery.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Blevins </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1413, 1416-1417 [270 Cal.Rptr. 172], the court stated: \u201cIn setting forth that requirement [the \u201cclosely related\u201d requirement] the Supreme Court in <em>Geiger </em>explained that it was not necessary for the offenses to have an \u2018inherent relationship\u2019 as that terminology had been defined in <em>[Whitaker] </em>.... Instead, while agreeing \u2018that the right to instructions on related offenses is not without limit\u2019 [citation], the court found the limits in the purpose of the rule. ...[][] <em>In other words, the second prerequisite is established when the evidence offered by either side [which would support the giving of instructions on a lesser related offense] is relevant to and was admitted for the purpose of establishing whether the defendant is guilty [vel non] of the charged offense.\"{ </em>(Bracketed phrases and italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We are of the view that <em>Blevins </em>has correctly stated the proper interpretation of <em>Geiger's </em>\u201csecond criteria\u201d and that <em>Boyd, Santos, Hill, </em>and <em>Araujo </em>are incorrect in finding a \u201csame societal interest\u201d criterion, factor, prerequisite or test in <em>Geiger. </em>We reach this conclusion in recognition of (i) the fact that the actual wording of <em>Geiger's </em>\u201cclosely related\u201d criterion (at p. 531 of that opinion) focuses on <em>the evidence adduced at trial to establish whether the defendant is guilty of the charged offense,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (ii) the fact that the analytical underpinnings of <em>Geiger </em>themselves involve an <em>evidentiary </em>orientation rather than a theoretical sociological approach. In this latter regard, we once again note that the <em>Geiger </em>opinion itself identified \u201cthe <em>determinative </em>factor\u201d in deciding whether to give instructions on lesser related offenses as the need \u201cto insure that the jury is afforded the opportunity to decide <em>all material issues presented by the evidence </em>in accord with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 532, fn. 12, italics added in both quoted phrases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">An excellent example of the application of this \u201crelevant evidence analysis\u201d principle is found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Araujo, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 700\u2014 notwithstanding that opinion\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the \u201csame societal interest\u201d factor was a part of the \u201cclosely related\u201d criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">In <em>Araujo, </em>the defendant was charged with residential burglary. Included in the prosecution\u2019s evidence was testimony that the defendant had visited friends in a truck matching the description of a truck which had been stolen from the burglarized residence. Defense counsel requested an instruction on joyriding (\u00a7 499b) as a lesser related offense. The trial court refused to give a joyriding instruction, and the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court in this regard. Importantly, the Court of Appeal noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1624\">*1624</page-number>\u201cIt is true that the prosecution used evidence of the joyriding episode for purposes of proving residential burglary. Appellant\u2019s act in driving the Vegas\u2019 pickup truck to Valley Springs served to link him with the burglary because the truck\u2019s keys had been left by the Vegas inside their house and because one of the people accompanying him was in possession of some of the stolen property. However, these aspects of the joyriding incident relate to the burglary only circumstantially and not in any direct way.\u201d (10 Cal.App.4th at p. 705.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Key to Araujo\u2019s distinction between a \u201ccircumstantial relation\u201d of evidence and a \u201cdirect relation\u201d of evidence is that court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence of the joyriding incident was relevant to the <em>charged </em>offense, burglary, <em>only </em>to the extent that it permitted the jury to infer that the defendant had entered the Vegas\u2019 residence with felonious intent (to take the truck keys and personal property). Thus, insofar as the charged burglary was concerned, the \u201cevidence of joyriding\u201d was actually relevant to the issues of the case only to the extent that it constituted \u201cevidence of residential entry with felonious intent.\u201d That is, the \u201cevidence of joyriding,\u201d simply as \u201cevidence of joyriding,\u201d was <em>not </em>relevant to the issues of the case. Viewed in this manner, the evidence in question in <em>Araujo </em>did not establish that the charged burglary and the joyriding were \u201cclosely related\u201d crimes\u2014and the requested instruction would have been properly refused for that reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The situation thus presented by numerous courts having incorrectly interpreted <em>Geiger </em>as mandating a \u201csame societal interest\u201d test for determining whether a charged offense and an uncharged, lesser related offense are \u201cclosely related\u201d is analogous in significant respects to the situation which presented itself to our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 489 (hereinafter cited as <em>Thomas) </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 577, 831 P.2d 1159] (hereinafter cited as <em>Perez). </em>In <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Perez, </em>our Supreme Court found it necessary to \u201credirect\u201d those appellate courts which, in reviewing whether the evidence in a case supported a finding that a murder had been committed with premeditation and deliberation, had been applying a threefold \u201ctest\u201d set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942] in a rigid, formulaic manner. In response to this interpretation of <em>Anderson, Thomas </em>stated: \u201cUnreflective reliance on <em>Anderson </em>for a definition of premeditation is inappropriate. The <em>Anderson </em>analysis was intended as a framework to assist reviewing courts in assessing whether the evidence supports an inference . . . .\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 517.) This was followed in <em>Perez </em>by these two statements: (1) \u201cThe <em>Anderson </em>guidelines are descriptive, not normative.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 1125); and (2) \u201cIn identifying categories of evidence bearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1625\">*1625</page-number>premeditation and deliberation, <em>Anderson </em>did not purport to establish an exhaustive list that would exclude all other types and combinations of evidence that could support a finding of premeditation and deliberation. . . . The <em>Anderson </em>factors, while helpful for purposes of review, are not a sine qua non to finding first degree premeditated murder, nor are they exclusive.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We conclude that the three criteria set forth in <em>Geiger </em>with respect to the giving of instructions on lesser related offenses were intended by our Supreme Court to be used and applied in the same general manner as the three <em>Anderson </em>factors were intended by our Supreme Court (as per <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Perez) </em>to be used and applied with respect to findings of premeditation and deliberation\u2014as general, descriptive guidelines useful in the analysis and evaluation of evidence. (This is, perhaps, especially true of <em>Geiger's </em>\u201cclosely related\u201d criterion.) We find particular support for this conclusion in the tenor of the language used by our Supreme Court in the previously quoted footnote 12 of <em>Geiger </em>(35 Cal.3d at p. 532): \u201cWe cannot, of course, anticipate all of the varied circumstances in which instructions on related offenses may be requested. We do not foreclose the possibility that experience will teach that these criteria are over- or underinclusive. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">And here, then, lies our considered explanation for <em>Geiger's </em>use of <em>Whitaker\u2019s </em>\u201csame societal interest\u201d language in the context of its discussion of whether the crimes there in issue were \u201cclosely related\u201d\u2014after earlier having apparently dismissed that approach by giving deference to <em>Whitaker </em>only to the extent of saying: \u201cWe agree that the right to instructions on related offenses is not without limit.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 531.) <em>Geiger </em>was not saying that a finding of the \u201csame societal interest\u201d is <em>necessary </em>to a finding that two crimes are \u201cclosely related\u201d\u2014but only that a consideration of \u201csocietal interest\u201d is, or can be, a useful concept for a trial court (or an appellate court) to employ in analytically \u201cdouble checking\u201d whether the evidence shows two crimes to be \u201cclosely related.\u201d For example: (1) If the two crimes in question clearly address tiie \u201csame societal interests,\u201d then perhaps it will behoove the court to consider, somewhat more closely than the evidence would otherwise superficially seem to require, the question of whether those crimes are \u201cclosely related\u201d; and (2) In a similar vein, if two crimes appear superficially to be \u201cclosely related\u201d but clearly address disparate \u201csocietal interests,\u201d then perhaps the apparent \u201ccloseness\u201d of the crimes needs further examination. The concept of \u201csame societal interest\u201d is a <em>tool </em>for looking at the question of whether two crimes are \u201cclosely related\u201d\u2014but the <em>critical factor </em>which underlies that question is whether the <em>evidence </em>establishes the requisite \u201ccloseness\u201d of the two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">It remains to apply this understanding of <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>\u201cclosely related\u201d criterion to the facts of this case. Here, the charged burglary and the lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1626\">*1626</page-number>related offenses of trespass and vandalism <em>are </em>\u201cclosely related.\u201d First, the evidence which would have established the trespass (the forcible entry through the front door) also established the entry element of the charged burglary. Second, the evidence which would have established the vandalism (the damaged front door/door frame, the damaged bedroom door and the broken light) also established, at least in part, the force/fear element of the charged robbery\u2014which robbery, in turn, served as the basis of inferring the felonious intent element of the charged burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Given all of the above, the trial court did err in refusing to give the requested instructions on trespass and vandalism as lesser related offenses to the charged burglary.  Reaching that conclusion, however, does not end the matter: \u201c[T]he error \u2018is not prejudicial if \u201cit is possible to determine that... the factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions. . . .\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668, 690-691 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weathington </em>(1991) 231 Cal.

In order to have returned convictions on charges of trespass and/or vandalism but acquittals on the charged burglary, the jury would have had to have concluded that one of the two following scenarios had been established by the evidence: (1) There never was a robbery\u2014and, thus, the defendants had no felonious intent to commit a robbery when they entered the Katschman residence; or (2) The defendants had no felonious intent to commit a robbery when they entered the Katschman residence\u2014but one or more of the defendants formed the intent to commit a robbery once they were inside the residence and the other defendants at that point in time decided to aid and abet the commission of the \u201cafterthought robbery.\u201d Given the jury\u2019s return of guilty verdicts on the charged robbery, the jury clearly rejected the first of the above scenarios\u2014and <em>no </em>rational juror, given the extremely condensed time frame within which the events in question occurred and the unequivocal testimony concerning the behavior of the defendants as they entered the Katschman residence, could have found the second of the above scenarios to have been established by the evidence adduced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Inasmuch as the trial court\u2019s error in refusing to instruct on the lesser related offenses of trespass and vandalism was not prejudicial, we will not reverse the burglary convictions because of such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1627\">*1627</page-number>I.

While this was done for Fletcher, the record clearly reveals that it was not done for David.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b901-19\">See footnote 12, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Douglas argues that, inasmuch as the instructions which were given below were given uniformly as to all four defendants, he should be able to maintain the same arguments on appeal as the other defendants. We reject Douglas\u2019s argument for the simple reason that we are not inclined to blithely disregard an unequivocal, relevant legal principle declared by our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Douglas also contends, in a somewhat cursory manner, that it would have been futile for him to have requested instructions on the \u201clessers\u201d here in question because the request for those instructions by the other defendants had been denied by the trial court. This contention is plainly contradicted by the record. The trial court did not deny the request to instruct on trespass and vandalism as lesser related offenses of the charged residential burglary until well after everyone had been given ample opportunity to join in the motion and present argument on the same to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Finally, we note that David\u2019s motion for a new trial, in which Douglas joined, did assert the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on trespass and vandalism as lesser related offenses to the charged residential burglary as one of the grounds for a new trial. This \u201cafter the fact\u201d joinder, however, can hardly be deemed compliance with <em>Geiger's </em>requirement that instructions on \u201clesser relateds\u201d be requested by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">On a related matter, we do not mean our rather peremptory dismissal of Douglas\u2019s contention on this issue to suggest that we view Douglas\u2019s counsel as having been in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1619\">*1619</page-number>professionally incompetent in not having joined with the other counsel in requesting instructions on vandalism and trespass as \u201clessers\u201d to the charged residential burglary. It may well be that Douglas\u2019s counsel, for sound tactical reasons, wished to present Douglas\u2019s case to the jury on an \u201call or nothing\u201d basis as to that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">This attack on the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case applies equally, although not as forcefully, to the possibility that the felonious intent attending the defendants\u2019 entry into Katschman\u2019s residence was the intent to steal drugs, not money. The defense strategy was to attack the credibility of Katschman and Eddy <em>generally.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">It is irrelevant that we might find this \u201calternative explanation\u201d weak and unconvincing: \u201cWe recognize . . . [that] a defendant\u2019s right to instructions does not turn on the court\u2019s assessment of the strength of the evidence, or on whether there is a conflict in, rebuttal to, or impeachment of the People\u2019s evidence.\u201d (Geiger, 35 Cal.3d atp. 531; see also [concerning the related subject of giving instructions on \u201clesser included\u201d offenses] <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1461, 1465, [280 Cal.Rptr. 609] and authorities cited therein.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">We note that the trial court seemed to rely primarily on this \u201csecond <em>Geiger </em>circumstance\u201d in refusing to instruct on trespass and vandalism. The trial court specifically refused to give the instructions on the basis of its conclusion that those lesser related offenses were not \u201cnecessarily related or included in the charged crimes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The phrase \u201cunreflective reliance\u201d is taken from <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 517 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101].

A reading of the manner in which this incident unfolded demands the assault be separately punished. There is not logical justification for this act of clemency by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">The problem with my position is that I have failed to garner one more vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">The petitions of both respondent and appellants for review by the Supreme Court were denied June 3, 1993.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
