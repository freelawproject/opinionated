In the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, the trial court found that Defendant placed Plaintiff in fear of imminent serious bodily injury and continued harassment by \"charg[ing]\" Plaintiff in her car, trying to run Plaintiff over, continuing to call and text Plaintiff after being released on bond for the criminal charges that resulted from the incidents, and threatening to kill her. The trial court also found that Defendant had tried to commit suicide in 1995, threatened suicide \"two years ago,\" and that Defendant \"states he doesn't want to live without her.\" In addition to concluding that Defendant had committed acts of domestic violence against Plaintiff, the trial court determined that his conduct required that he surrender his firearms as authorized by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(a). Pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, Defendant surrendered two firearms to the Wayne County Sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 16 April 2012, based on the conduct that led to the issuance of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, Defendant pled guilty to communicating threats and misdemeanor stalking. Defendant was sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 16 April 2012, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff's DVPO action, concluding that Plaintiff had failed to prove grounds for issuance of a regular DVPO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After completing his probation, on 13 August 2014, Defendant filed a motion for return of his firearms pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(f). The matter came on for hearing before Judge Charles P. Gaylord, III on 25 August 2014. The trial court made only three findings of fact in the order, which was a form order on AOC-CV-320, Rev. 2/14, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The defendant filed a motion to return weapons surrendered pursuant to a domestic violence protective order entered on (date) 01/11/2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4.

Thus, the only question was whether Defendant was disqualified by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the hearing, the parties presented only legal arguments regarding whether Defendant was disqualified by federal law based upon Defendant's two convictions for communicating threats and misdemeanor stalking from 16 April 2012. No evidence was presented at the hearing other than the April 2012 judgments for misdemeanor stalking and communicating threats as reflected in the trial court's finding no. 5: \"The Court finds this is an offense involving assault or communicating a threat, and the defendant had a personal relationship as defined by G.S. 50B-1(b) with the victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the trial court's order did not clearly identify any legal basis for denying Defendant's motion, the Judge's comments when he announced his order in open court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   along with the fact that the only arguments presented focused on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , imply\n   that the court denied the motion based upon that federal statute, which prohibits anyone who has been \"convicted in any court of a 'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' \" from possessing a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, the trial court could not consider any outside documents to determine whether Defendant's conviction for communicating threats constitutes a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" And in fact, the record does not indicate that the trial court considered any additional documents or other evidence other than the judgment itself. Accordingly, Defendant's conviction for communicating threats does not constitute a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" and does not preclude Defendant from owning or possessing firearms under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similarly, Defendant's conviction for misdemeanor stalking also fails to qualify as a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" Section 14-277.3A(c) (2013) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A defendant is guilty of stalking if the defendant willfully on more than one occasion harasses another person without legal purpose or willfully engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person without legal purpose and the defendant knows or should know that the harassment or the course of conduct would cause a reasonable person to do any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) Fear for the person's safety or the safety of the person's immediate family or close personal associates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) Suffer substantial emotional distress by placing that person in fear of death, bodily injury, or continued harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under the categorical approach and looking solely at the elements of the crime, misdemeanor stalking does not necessarily involve the: (1) use of physical force; (2) attempted use of physical force; or (3) threatened use of a deadly weapon. Furthermore, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the crime of misdemeanor stalking is divisible, no possible iteration of the crime includes these elements. Therefore, the modified categorical approach is inapplicable, and this Court may not look to other documents to see whether the underlying conduct that gave rise to Defendant's conviction could implicate the \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\" a necessary showing for a crime to constitute a \"misdemeanor crime[ ] of domestic violence\" under\n   <em>\n    Castleman.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, neither of Defendant's convictions constitutes a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" and federal law, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9), does not preclude Defendant from having or possessing a firearm, even if Defendant and Plaintiff were in a \"personal relationship\" as defined by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-1(b). Therefore, the trial court erred in ordering that Defendant was not entitled to have his firearms returned on this basis, and we reverse the trial court's order and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court should hold a hearing to determine if the parties' circumstances have changed since the prior hearing in such a way that Defendant would now be disqualified from return of weapons for any of the reasons specifically listed in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1, and if not, the trial court should enter an order for return of the weapons.
