Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The appellants in this case are Virginia Fuel Corporation (\"Virginia Fuel\") and James C. Justice Companies, Inc. (\"Justice Companies\"); the appellee is Lambert Coal Company (\"Lambert\n   \"). On June 21, 2010, Virginia Fuel and Lambert entered into an agreement by which Virginia Fuel agreed to acquire certain assets owned by Lambert (the \"Agreement\"). The specific assets to be acquired were identified on Exhibit \"A\" to the Agreement as a mining permit described as \"Permit No. 1101673-Dark Hollow Strip Mine\" and two coal leases described as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Lambert Land, LLC (\"LL\") coal-only and Heartwood Forestland (HFL) surface over the LL coal which the royalty together is from 8-10% on 1.1 million tons and the adjacent Alpha Coal (\"Alpha\") fee property at 8% (approx. 400,000 tons).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (The LL lease shall be referred to as the \"Lambert Land Lease\"; the Alpha Coal lease shall be referred to as the \"Alpha Lease\"; the Lambert Land Lease and the Alpha Lease shall be referred to collectively as the \"Leases\".) The purchase price for the assets sold under the Agreement was $2,500,000. Two hundred thousand dollars of the purchase price was paid as a deposit upon the execution of the Agreement and was credited at closing to the portion of the purchase price allocated to the mining permit. The Agreement further provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The balance of the [p]ayment, will be royalty for the coal mined under the Alpha [L]ease and the [Lambert Land] Lease, Lambert being a \"sublessor\" under IRC \u00a7 631, payable monthly at the rate of $2.00 per ton of coal mined, with a minimum monthly royalty of $40,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Agreement provided that \"[a]s soon as possible after signing this letter of [i]ntent, the parties shall negotiate the Assignment and Assumption Agreements, which shall contain customary provisions, conditions, representations, warranties, and terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties.\" Despite Lambert's and Virginia Fuel's undertaking \"in good faith ... [to] use their best efforts to negotiate the Assignment and Assumption Agreements\" there is no evidence in the record before us that any such assignment and assumption agreements were executed by Lambert and Virginia Fuel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Closing under the Agreement occurred on July 13, 2010. On that date, Lambert and Virginia Fuel entered into a security\n   agreement (the \"Security Agreement\"), whereby Virginia Fuel, as \"Borrower,\" granted to Lambert, as \" Lender,\" a security interest in the mining permit, along with Virginia Fuel's inventory and accounts receivable, in order to secure Virginia Fuel's obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price under the Agreement. The Security Agreement provided that \"[f]or purposes of default in payment of royalty under the Agreement, payments shall be deemed delinquent if not received by [Lambert] on or before the 15th of the month following the month in which the mineral is mined for purposes of computing the royalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also on July 13, 2010, Justice Companies executed a \"Guaranty of Payment and Performance\" (the \"Guaranty\") pursuant to which Justice Companies guaranteed Lambert's obligations under the Agreement, including the payment in full of the $2,300,000 deferred purchase price due under the Agreement. The Guaranty provided, in a recital, that \"pursuant to the Agreement, [Lambert] extends credit to [Virginia Fuel] to be repaid by the mining of coal under DMLR Permit 1101673....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Virginia Fuel began mining coal in accordance with the mining permit and the Leases. Virginia Fuel made most of the payments required under the Agreement until March 2013. After March 2013, Virginia Fuel stopped making the minimum monthly payment of $40,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lambert filed suit against Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies on August 13, 2013. In its complaint, Lambert alleged that Virginia Fuel continued to mine coal pursuant to the mining permit and the Leases, but that Virginia Fuel had not made the minimum monthly payments of $40,000. Lambert alleged that it had demanded payment from Virginia Fuel, but that Virginia Fuel had not cured the default. Accordingly, Lambert accelerated the balance due under the Agreement. Lambert sought judgment against Virginia Fuel under the Agreement and Justice Companies under the Guaranty for the balance due of $1,001,706.94, plus costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to the complaint, Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies filed an answer and grounds of defense in which they denied that they were obligated to Lambert for the unpaid purchase price and asserted the affirmative defense of \"credit and/or offset\" in an amount equal to the coal that Lambert \"represented it was\n   providing to [Virginia Fuel], but did not provide\" or \"was not able to provide\" because \"the coal was not available for [Virginia Fuel] as had been represented and agreed by [Lambert].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies also filed a counterclaim against Lambert in which they alleged causes of action for breach of contract and constructive fraud. After Lambert filed a plea in bar alleging that the fraud count was barred by the statute of limitations, that claim was nonsuited. The breach of contract count of the counterclaim sought damages of $359,000, representing the \"pro rata coal tonnage value from the Agreement which contained a $2.3 million purchase price for 1.5 million tons of coal when in fact there are only approximately 1.269 million tons of coal contained within the [Lambert Land] Lease and the Alpha Lease, collectively.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 27, 2014, Lambert's demurrer to the breach of contract\n   claim was sustained, with leave to amend within 14 days. Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies elected not to amend their counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response to requests for admission, Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies admitted that Virginia Fuel had paid $1,298,293.06 of the deferred purchase price of $2,300,000 under the Agreement. Thus, Virginia Fuel conceded that it had not paid the balance of $1,001,706.94, which was the amount of Lambert's ad damnum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lambert moved for summary judgment on its complaint alleging Virginia Fuel's breach of the Agreement and Justice Companies' breach of the Guaranty. Lambert argued that there was no dispute about the amount of the deferred purchase price that remained unpaid. Further, Lambert argued, Virginia Fuel's and Justice Companies' defense of \"credit/and or offset\" was in effect a defense of recoupment, which failed as a matter of law because Lambert made no material misrepresentations as to the amount of mineable coal under the Leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies opposed summary judgment, arguing that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Lambert negligently represented the amount of coal tonnage contained within the Leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 20, 2014, Lambert noticed its motion for summary judgment for a hearing on September 3, 2014. On August 26, 2014, five business days before the scheduled hearing, Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies propounded their first discovery requests to Lambert. On September 2, 2014, the day before the hearing, Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies moved for a continuance of the hearing based on both Lambert's failure to respond to the discovery requests and the pendency of their renewed counterclaim, which they filed on August 7, 2014, without obtaining prior leave of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The circuit court denied the request to continue the hearing on Lambert's motion for summary judgment. The renewed counterclaim was dismissed because it had been filed without leave of court. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Lambert, ruling that there was no genuine issue of any material fact in the case. The circuit court ruled that Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies were \"unable to move forward with their Constructive Fraud/Negligent Misrepresentation Counterclaim due to their failure to seek leave from the [c]ourt.\" Therefore, the \"pleadings, admissions, and interrogatories show that no material fact is in dispute and summary judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies appealed. We granted three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.

If that coal could not be mined, then the obligation to pay royalties ceased.\" Further, \"[e]ven the minimum royalty payment [of $40,000] [was] to be paid from 'coal mined' under the [L]eases.\" Alternatively, Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies contend that the Agreement is ambiguous and, therefore, the parties should have been afforded the opportunity to introduce parol evidence to enable the factfinder to determine the parties' intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lambert responds that \"payment of the deferred purchase price was not tied to mining coal because the [p]urchase Agreement did not require [Virginia Fuel] to mine any coal.\" Lambert observes that, pursuant to the interpretation advocated by Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies, if Virginia Fuel decided not to mine any coal, Lambert would not be entitled to any portion of the deferred purchase price. Lambert asserts that such a result would be \"patently absurd.\" Further, Lambert maintains that the term \"minimum\n   monthly royalty\" means \"an unconditional covenant or guarantee of payment regardless of the circumstances or conditions encountered during the mining process, the economic feasibility of continued mining, or the remaining quantity of mineable and merchantable coal.\" In Lambert's view, the payment of the deferred purchase price was tied to the minimum monthly royalty and not to the mining of coal. We agree with Lambert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under the Agreement, Virginia Fuel purchased Lambert's rights under the mining permit and Lambert's rights as lessee under the Leases. The transaction was structured\n   as an outright sale and not as a lease or sublease. In effect, Virginia Fuel purchased the right to step into Lambert's position as the operator under the mining permit and as lessee under the Leases. The sales price for the assignments was established as $2,500,000, with $200,000 paid upon signing of the Agreement and the balance of $2,300,000 paid over time, but at a minimum monthly amount of $40,000 until paid in full. No provision of the Agreement excused Virginia Fuel's payment of the minimum monthly payment if the coal available proved to be less than expected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The provisions of the Security Agreement make clear that Virginia Fuel was required to pay the deferred purchase price regardless of the amount of coal mined. The Security Agreement was given to secure payment of \"all indebtedness.\" \"Indebtedness\" was defined as including the $2,300,000 deferred purchase price payable under the Agreement. The Agreement required payment of a \"minimum monthly royalty of $40,000.\" Virginia Fuel would be in default if the royalty due under the Agreement was not paid by the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the coal was mined for the purpose of computing the royalty. Upon default, Lambert had the option of declaring that all of the indebtedness, including principal and interest, was immediately due and payable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly, under the Guaranty, Justice Companies unconditionally and absolutely guaranteed \"full and prompt\" payment to Lambert of the \"Indebtedness,\" which was defined as including the $2,300,000 deferred purchase price under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, reading the Agreement, the Security Agreement, and the Guaranty together,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is manifest that the obligation of Virginia Fuel to pay both the deferred purchase price and the minimum monthly royalty was not dependent on the amount of available, mineable coal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Virginia Fuel's and Justice Companies' reading of the Agreement that both the minimum monthly payment and the royalty of $2.00 per ton were only payable out of mineable coal creates an untenable result. Under that argument, if no coal was ever mined, no payment would be due to Lambert other than the initial $200,000 allocated to the value of the permit. There was no provision in the Agreement that the mining permit or the Leases would revert back to Lambert if Virginia Fuel never mined any coal, or mined less coal than necessary to result in payment in full of the deferred purchase price of $2,300,000. It is illogical to assume that Lambert would have sold the right to mine what it estimated to be 1.5 million tons of coal for payment of no more than $200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Home Creek Smokeless Coal Co. v. Combs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2044780\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/204/561/\">\n    204 Va. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20S.E.2d%20399\">\n    132 S.E.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), Virginia Fuel and Justice argue that the use of the term \"royalty\" in the Agreement imposes on Virginia Fuel a duty to mine coal. Thus, they argue, Lambert would always be paid something until the mine was exhausted. Virginia Fuel and Justice Companies misread\n   <em>\n    Home Creek Smokeless Coal.\n   </em>\n   In that case, we opined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The general rule of interpretation, and the one consonant with reason, is that where the only consideration for a mining lease is the royalty on coal actually mined, the lessee must operate with reasonable diligence, and failing in this, must surrender the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20S.E.2d%20399\">\n    132 S.E.2d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, as in the present case, \"the royalty on coal actually mined was not the only consideration. There was [also] a substantial minimum royalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20S.E.2d%20399\">\n    132 S.E.2d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that circumstance, we held, the coal lease was not forfeited by the lessor's failure to mine as long as the minimum royalty payments were made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20S.E.2d%20399\">\n    132 S.E.2d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, under the holding of\n   <em>\n    Home Creek Smokeless Coal,\n   </em>\n   Virginia Fuel had no implied duty to mine coal because the\n   Agreement required minimum monthly royalty payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Lambert advances the only reading of the Agreement that is not strained, illogical, or contrary to reason. Given that there was no obligation of Virginia Fuel to mine any coal, the amount of $40,000 represented the minimum payment due to Lambert each month regardless of whether Virginia Fuel mined any coal. If Virginia Fuel elected to mine coal, it might owe more than $40,000 if the coal mined exceeded 20,000 tons. In that event, Virginia Fuel would be required to pay $2.00 for every ton mined over 20,000 tons. The provision of the Security Agreement that payment was due on the fifteenth day of the month \"following the month in which the mineral is mined for purposes of computing the royalty\" did not mean that if no coal was mined, no payment was due. Instead, that provision simply established that the amount due-either $40,000 or more-would be computed based on operations during the calendar month, with payment due on the fifteenth of the next month. If no coal was mined in a given month, or if the amount of coal mined was 20,000 tons or less, the minimum payment would be due. If more than 20,000 tons was mined in the month, the royalty would be calculated and payment due by the fifteenth of the next month. Payments were due until Lambert received the full $2,300,000 deferred purchase price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our conclusion that Virginia Fuel was not excused from payment of the deferred purchase price because the coal present was less than it expected is supported by case law from other jurisdictions.

Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848257\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/158/606/\">\n    158 Pa. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20A.%20236\">\n    28 A. 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1893), two lessees\n   entered into a lease to mine coal on the plaintiff's land for a period of ten years. The lessees agreed to mine a minimum of 10,000 bushels a year and pay plaintiff a royalty of one half cent per bushel. If they mined less than 10,000 bushels, the lessees agreed to pay the minimum royalty of $50 per year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20A.%20236\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20A.%20236\">\n    at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether under a lease or an asset purchase agreement, when the payment due to the lessor or landowner is expressed as a minimum monthly royalty, the party mining the mineral is not excused from payment if the mineral is of insufficient quantity to be profitably mined in quantities adequate to pay the royalties due.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Robert Tucker Donley, The Law of Coal, Oil &amp; Gas in West Virginia &amp; Virginia \u00a7 120 (1951) (distinguishing minimum royalty payments from minimum tonnage requirements and noting that, if the agreement contains minimum tonnage requirements, the obligor may be excused from payment under a defense of impossibility of performance when the mine is depleted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Summarizing, we hold that the circuit court did not err when it granted summary judgment to Lambert on its complaint.

We agree with Lambert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Agreement provided that the assets of Lambert to be sold to Virginia Fuel pursuant to the Agreement included \"certain mining leases as set out in attached Exhibit 'A'.\" With respect to the Lambert Land Lease, Exhibit \"A\" stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Coal Leases will be assigned to [Virginia Fuel].

It is clear from the Agreement that the parties intended to enter into separate \"Assignment and Assumption Agreements, which shall contain\n   customary provisions, conditions, representations, warranties, and terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties.\" No such agreements are part of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We agree with Lambert, that Exhibit \"A\" served merely to identify the assets subject to the sale, and that the reference to \"8-10% on 1.1 million tons\" was an expression of estimated royalty percentages payable to owners of the coal in addition to the payments due to Lambert under the Agreement, and not a representation or warranty that 1.1 million tons of coal were on the Lambert Land Lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Again, our conclusion is supported by case law from West Virginia.
