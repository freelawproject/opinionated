One evening in October 2012, both of the victim's housemates were out of town, and she had gone to bed feeling sick. Vasquez and Valentin broke in through a window of the townhouse carrying backpacks, one of which contained a \"wolf knife.\" J.A. at 403. They began stealing property belonging to the victim's housemates. They then entered the victim's bedroom. She awoke as Vasquez held a large knife to her throat. Valentin\n   stood by the bedroom door, also holding a knife, and blocked the exit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Vasquez demanded cash. When the victim said she had none, Vasquez stated, \"[W]ell then you're going to die.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121. The victim pleaded with them to take her wallet, credit cards, and a game console. Pressing the knife to her back, Vasquez led the victim around the bedroom to retrieve these items. After collecting the victim's belongings, Vasquez ordered her to undress. He then pushed her to the floor and demanded that she \"suck him off,\" or he would kill her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123. She complied. As Vasquez forced her head down, she began choking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a few minutes, Vasquez put the knife again to her back and pushed her to the bed. With the knife \"right in front of me,\" the victim testified, Vasquez raped her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125. He later demanded she also have sex with Valentin. Vasquez directed her to \"suck him off again\" while Valentin attempted to penetrate her from behind.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127. While the victim performed fellatio on Vasquez for a second time, Valentin unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate her anus and vagina from behind. During this attempt, Valentin threatened the victim, saying, \"[D]on't turn around, I'll kill you if you turn around.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some point, Vasquez got up and left the bedroom. Valentin closed the bedroom door and locked it, leaving the victim alone with him. While displaying his knife, Valentin pushed the victim back on the bed and raped her vaginally. Vasquez returned to the bedroom, led the victim to the bathroom at knifepoint, and made her perform fellatio on him a third time. He repeatedly struck her in the head with the blunt end of the knife and slapped her in the face. Vasquez then said he wanted anal sex. He ran his knife across her back and along her flank area. Vasquez attempted to rape her anally but could not successfully penetrate. Valentin watched from the doorway, continuing to block any attempt by the victim to escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Vasquez thereafter led the victim through other rooms of the townhouse looking for more things to steal. As Valentin took stolen property out through a window, Vasquez once again forced the victim to perform oral sex on him. He forcibly pushed his penis into her throat, choking her for several minutes. Vasquez afterwards turned her around and raped her anally with his penis and with another object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Still armed with a knife, Vasquez then pulled the victim toward the window and told her that she would have to leave with them. Valentin pushed Vasquez away from the victim. Before leaving, Vasquez approached the victim with the knife, \"jab[bed] it at [her] stomach,\" and warned her that they would \"come back with thirty guys and kill [her]\" if she called the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Police arrested Vasquez and Valentin that same night.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They had in their possession the property stolen from the townhouse. They made various self-incriminating statements to the police and made similar inculpatory remarks to each other. Valentin admitted to breaking into the townhouse, stealing property, and raping the victim at knifepoint. \"What fun is raping a bitch,\" he said, \"and running?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 314. Reflecting on the episode, Valentin concluded: \"We're sixteen and we're getting tried as an adult [sic]. Should have killed that bitch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 318-19. Vasquez also confessed to the sexual crimes. Concluding that he would likely be found guilty, Vasquez said he would simply \"apologize for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 319.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The juvenile and domestic relations court transferred the prosecution of both defendants to the circuit court, where the grand jury returned twenty-two felony indictments against Vasquez and seventeen against Valentin. At their joint trial, Vasquez and Valentin made various motions to strike. One of their arguments, relevant to the armed-with-a-deadly-weapon element of the indictments for breaking and entering, was that the evidence was insufficient to prove that either Vasquez or Valentin possessed a knife at the time they entered the townhouse. They asserted \"an alternate hypothesis of\n   innocence that all the knives involved ... were acquired ... once the two parties went into the apartment in general.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 409. The trial court denied most of the motions to strike\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and found Vasquez guilty on eighteen indictments and Valentin guilty on twelve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court ordered the preparation of presentence reports and victim-impact statements. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court received extensive information addressing the brutality of the crimes and their effect on the victim. The court also learned that Vasquez was on juvenile probation at the time of the offenses and that, in the weeks prior to these crimes, Valentin had committed multiple other nighttime break-ins of other occupied homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court rejected the suggestion that the crimes were in any way unplanned or spontaneous. \"These were each individual crimes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 620, the court explained, committed at knifepoint by two \"young predator[s]\" in a \"careful and calculated\" manner over an extended period of time,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 619. The court stated that it considered Vasquez to be slightly more culpable than Valentin, but both were guilty of \"absolutely heinous criminal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 628. The court also considered Valentin's lack of genuine remorse, evidenced by his post-arrest conversation showing Valentin \"laughing\" with Vasquez about their crimes and musing that it would have been better if they had just \"killed the fucking bitch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 319, 629.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court imposed multiple term-of-years sentences, which, in the aggregate, equaled 283 years for Vasquez, with 150 years suspended, and 148 years for Valentin, with 80 years suspended. The suspended sentences reduced the active incarceration time to 133 years for Vasquez and 68 years for Valentin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between the two defendants and their total of thirty convictions, each conviction received an average of 6.7 years of active incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Vasquez and Valentin filed petitions for appeal with the Court of Appeals, challenging the constitutionality of their sentences and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions for breaking and entering while armed with a deadly weapon. In per curiam orders, the Court of Appeals denied Vasquez's petition in its entirety and denied Valentin's petition regarding issues before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We awarded an appeal to both defendants, consolidated their cases for decision, and now affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. CRUEL &amp; UNUSUAL-AGGREGATE TERM-OF-YEARS SENTENCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Vasquez and Valentin argue on appeal, as they did in the trial court, that their sentences should be judicially declared cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has developed \"two\n   strands of precedent\" to determine whether a criminal sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Neither Vasquez nor Valentin was convicted of a single crime accompanied by a life-without-parole sentence. Vasquez was found guilty of eighteen separate crimes, including forcible vaginal and anal rape, breaking and entering while armed with a deadly weapon, forcible fellatio, forcible sodomy, abduction, and robbery. Valentin was found guilty of twelve similar crimes. Between the two of them, the average per-crime sentence was 6.7 years of active incarceration. The only reason that the aggregate sentences exceeded their life expectancies was because they committed so many separate crimes.

We thus agree with the Sixth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, and the seven dissenters of the Ninth Circuit:\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   does not apply to aggregate term-of-years sentences involving multiple crimes, and we should not declare that it does.

Equally so, in cases like those now before us where\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   does not apply, the Commonwealth-through the lawmaking power of the General Assembly-has the opportunity to explore additional ways of calibrating the just aims of the criminal justice system to the unique circumstances of juvenile offenders, particularly in cases in which juveniles commit nonviolent crimes and demonstrate a level of genuine contrition suggesting a realistic hope of rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Our holding implies no views and takes no sides in the policy debates that may take place during the legislative process. As we have often said, the legislature is the \"author of public policy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Woodley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643810\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/560/#p490\">\n    290 Va. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643810\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/560/#p490\">\n    777 S.E.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (2015) (citation omitted).

The sentencing record demonstrates that these crimes were the culmination of a series of planned burglaries and escalating violations of the law. Indeed, the incident was itself a series of depraved personal attacks, during the course of which there were multiple opportunities to withdraw. Further, Vasquez, in particular, has failed to take advantage of the opportunities previously afforded him by the juvenile justice system. For these reasons, the sentences are wholly appropriate for crimes as wantonly evil as those recited in the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I write separately because I respectfully disagree with the Court's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

I believe that\n   <em>\n    Graham's\n   </em>\n   prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juveniles who commit non-homicide offenses does apply to a term-of-years sentence that constitutes a de facto life sentence imposed in a single sentencing event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, our precedent precludes reversing the Court of Appeals even after applying\n   <em>\n    Graham.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Angel v.

Along with the Ninth Circuit, and five state courts of last resort that have examined the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   to a term of years equivalent to a de facto life sentence without the possibility of parole, I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court stated, \"The present case involves an issue the Court has not considered previously: a categorical challenge to a\n   <em>\n    term-of-years sentence.\"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
