CLARK, JJ., joined.</judges>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">We accepted a question certified to this Court from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee to clarify the operation of the statute of limitations for discriminatory pay claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act. After considering the arguments of the parties and the applicable authority, we hold that a claim of discriminatory pay may be brought at any time within one year that a plaintiff has received discriminatory pay and that backpay is available for the duration of the unequal pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-21\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">The facts as stated in the federal district court\u2019s certification order include the following. Plaintiff Paula P. King Booker (\u201cBooker\u201d) went to work for the Boeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Company, d/b/a Boeing-Oak Ridge Company (\u201cBoeing\u201d), as an hourly employee in 1982. In 1989, she was promoted to a salaried managerial position in \u201cSupply Chain Management\u201d and has remained in essentially the same position ever since. In 1997, she discovered that she was being paid less than her male peers. On August 10, 1998, Booker filed an internal equal employment opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) complaint. Lacking satisfactory resolution, on July 2, 1999, Booker filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). On May 1, 2001, Booker filed this lawsuit in Anderson County Chancery Court seeking relief under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, Tennessee Code Annotated sections 4-21-101 to -1004 (2005) (\u201cTHRA\u201d), including backpay to 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The case was removed to the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Among the disputed issues before that court is whether the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations permits Booker to recover backpay to 1989, when she became a manager, or only to 2000, one year prior to the date she filed her lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">To aid in resolving the dispute, the district court certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">Whether a discriminatory salary \u201cceases\u201d within the plain meaning of the Tennessee Human Rights Act\u2019s statute of limitations when it ends, or whether it \u201cceases\u201d when the alleged discriminatory act should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of a duty to assert his or her rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We accepted the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The THRA\u2019s statute of limitations provides, \u201c[a] civil cause of action under this section shall be filed in chancery court or circuit court within one (1) year after the alleged discriminatory practice ceases-\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d) (2005). Booker argues that the \u201calleged discriminatory practice\u201d in this case, unequal pay based on gender, began in 1989 and had not yet ceased as of the time she filed her lawsuit. Thus, Booker argues that the THRA permits her to recover backpay to 1989. Boeing argues that each unequal paycheck Booker received was a separate and discrete discriminatory act such that Booker may only recover back-pay for paychecks received within one year of the date she filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">We note at the outset that the certified question as articulated by the district court does not capture the full dispute between the parties regarding the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations. The question as certified essentially asks whether a plaintiffs relief may be limited if she fails to file suit upon learning of a discriminatory practice, even though the discriminatory practice may not yet have \u201cceased.\u201d In other words, must a plaintiff file her suit within one year of her discovery of an allegedly discriminatory practice to recover damages for the entire practice, or does she have until one year after the discriminatory practice ceases? In this case, Booker became aware of the pay disparity in 1997 but did not file her suit until 2001. If the discovery rule operates to make her suit for relief to 1989 untimely, she would be limited to seeking relief for only the year prior to the date she filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">The question as certified assumes that pursuant to the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine, unequal pay is a single discriminatory practice under the THRA rather than a series of discrete discriminatory acts. Boeing argues, however, that in light of recent federal case law this Court should hold that the continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable to pay discrimination cases. Therefore, Boeing argues that under no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>circumstances should Booker be permitted to seek backpay for any period longer than one year prior to the date she filed suit. Booker argues that this Court should modify the continuing violation doctrine, but that it should hold that it is applicable to pay discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>Continuing Violation Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The continuing violation doctrine essentially allows a plaintiff to bring a claim for discriminatory conduct that occurs outside the limitations period if the discriminatory conduct is sufficiently related to conduct occurring within the limitations period. <em>Spicer v. Beaman Bottling Co., </em>937 S.W.2d 884, 889 (Tenn.1996). The doctrine affects both the jurisdiction of a court to hear a charge of discrimination and the remedies the court may impose; it allows a court to assert jurisdiction over a charge of discrimination occurring outside the limitations period and also permits the court to fashion a remedy extending beyond the limitations period. <em>Gandy v. Sullivan County, </em>24 F.3d 861, 864 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>Thelma A. Crivens, <em>The Continuing Violation Theory and Systemic Discrimination: In Search of a Judicial Standard for Timely Filing, </em>41 Vand. L.Rev. 1171, 1172 (1988). In the context of an unequal pay claim, the continuing violation doctrine would operate to \u201clink\u201d all related instances of unequal pay into a single practice, such that a suit for unequal pay could seek redress and backpay for all the violations, including those that occurred outside the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The continuing violation doctrine was developed by federal courts interpreting federal anti-discrimination statutes, particularly Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Berry v. Bd. of Supervisors of L.S.U., </em>715 F.2d 971, 979 (5th Cir.1983). Because \u201cthe stated purpose and intent of the [THRA] is to provide for execution within Tennessee of the policies embodied in the federal anti-discrimination acts,\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 888 (citing Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4 \u2014 21\u2014101(a)(1) (1991 Repl.)), this Court approved the continuing violation doctrine in <em>Spicer. </em>We observed in <em>Spicer </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">Courts have recognized ... only two narrowly limited instances in which the continuing violation doctrine applies. The first category arises where there is some evidence of <em>present </em>discriminatory activity giving rise to a claim of a continuing violation, for example where an employer continues to presently impose disparate work assignment[s] <em>or pay rates </em>between similarly situated employee groups. Key to establishing this exception is proof that at least one of the forbidden discriminatory acts occurred within the relevant limitations period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">The second category of \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d arises where there has been a longstanding and demonstrable policy of discrimination such as an established and repeated pattern of paying men more than women. To constitute such an established pattern, the plaintiff must clearly demonstrate some \u201coverarching policy of discrimination,\u201d and not merely the occurrence of an isolated incident of discriminatory conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-11\"><em>Spicer </em>at 889-90 (citations and footnotes omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">As these examples illustrate, perhaps the most important factor supporting use of the continuing violation doctrine in employment discrimination cases is the fact that \u201cmany discriminatory acts cannot be viewed as discrete incidents, and often unfold rather than occur, making it difficult to precisely pinpoint the time when they take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889 (citation omitted). As this statement implicitly recognized, the doctrine does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cdiscrete incidents\u201d or individual acts of discrimination. Rather, the continuing violation doctrine applies when the discriminatory acts take place over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Noting that \u201capplication of the continuing violation doctrine is not always clear and simple,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 889, we adopted the doctrine as articulated by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Berry. Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890. The <em>Berry </em>formulation, which was the majority rule at the time we decided <em>Spicer, </em>looks to three factors to determine whether the alleged discriminatory acts are a series of individual violations or are part of a single continuing violation. The first factor is whether \u201c \u2018the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them_\u2019 \u201d <em>Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890 (quoting <em>Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 981). The second factor is \u201c \u2018frequency,\u2019 \u201d considering whether the alleged acts are \u201c \u2018recurring (e.g., <em>a bi-weekly </em>paycheck) or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment deeision[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The third factor is \u201c \u2018degree of permanence.\u2019 \u201d This factor asks whether the \u201c \u2018act ha[s] the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her <em>rights....\u2019\u201d Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is the interplay of this third factor with the plain language of the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations that the district court\u2019s certified question seeks to clarify. That is, is a suit only timely once the plaintiff should be aware of her rights, as provided in the <em>Berry </em>rule, or is the suit timely as long as the discriminatory practice has not yet \u201ccease[d],\u201d as provided in the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations, Tennessee Code Annotated section 4-21-311(d)?</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>The THRA\u2019s Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">As originally enacted, the THRA did not contain a statute of limitations. <em>See </em>1978 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 748, \u00a7 2. Courts applied to THRA claims the one-year statute of limitations for \u201c[cjivil actions for compensatory or punitive damages, or both, brought under the federal civil rights statutes\u201d set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 28-3-104(a)(3). <em>See Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890 n. 6; <em>see also Bennett v. Steiner-Liff Iron &amp; Metal Co., </em>826 S.W.2d 119, 121 (Tenn.1992). In 1992, the General Assembly amended the THRA to add a statute of limitations. 1992 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 1027, \u00a7 8. The statute states that suits must be filed \u201cwithin one (1) year after the alleged discriminatory practice ceases-\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">We noted in <em>Spicer </em>that the THRA\u2019s then-newly-enacted statute of limitations \u201capparently incorporates the continuing violation exception....\u2019\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890 n. 6. Thus, our holding in <em>Spicer </em>that the continuing violation doctrine is applicable to claims brought under the THRA was of limited import for claims brought after the effective date of the legislation creating the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations, because we recognized that the Legislature intended to make the continuing violation doctrine available to claims brought after that date. We reiterated in <em>Weber v. Moses, </em>938 S.W.2d 387 (Tenn.1996), that \u201c[t]he [THRA] statute of limitations ... adopts the \u2018continuing violation exception\u2019 which we judicially adopted and explained fully in <em>Spicer.\u201d Id. </em>at 391 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">Shortly after our decision in <em>Spicer, </em>we addressed the proper framework for analyzing the THRA\u2019s new statute of limitations in <em>Weber. </em>In <em>Weber, </em>the plaintiff alleged that he was terminated from his job because he refused to follow his em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ployer\u2019s racially-diseriminatory hiring policy. The plaintiff was orally informed of the termination in early August of 1992, the termination was effective on August 31, 1992, and the plaintiff received written notice of termination on or after September 1, 1992. The plaintiff filed suit on August 31, 1993. 938 S.W.2d at 388-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We held that because the statute of limitations directs that suits be filed within one year of when the \u201calleged discriminatory practice ceases ... we must first identify the alleged discriminatory practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. The Court identified the discriminatory practice in <em>Weber </em>as the decision to terminate the plaintiff, rather than the termination itself. Therefore, the Court stated that the next step was to \u201cdetermine the date on which the discriminatory practice ended,\u201d or ceased. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff argued that the discriminatory practice did not cease until he received written notice of his termination, on or after September 1, 1992. The defendant employer argued that the discriminatory practice ended on the date in early August when the plaintiff was orally advised of the decision to terminate his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The Court agreed with the employer and held that the suit was barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Looking to analogous cases decided under federal law, we emphasized that \u201ca discriminatory termination ceases and is complete[] when the plaintiff is given unequivocal notice of the employer\u2019s termination decision, even if employment does not cease until a designated date in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391-92. We explained that, \u201c \u2018the proper focus is on the time of the <em>discriminatory act </em>not the point at which the <em>consequences </em>of the act become painful/ \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391 (quoting <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981)). <em>Weber </em>was consistent with <em>Spicer\u2019s </em>recognition that the continuing violation doctrine does not apply to discrete acts. Where the alleged discriminatory practice is a discrete act, such as the decision to terminate an employee, the continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable to extend the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations. A discrete discriminatory act \u201cceases\u201d as of the time it occurs, not as of the time the consequences of the act cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>The United States Supreme Court\u2019s Morgan Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">In 2002, the United States Supreme Court clarified that under federal law, the continuing violation doctrine is likewise not applicable to extend Title VII\u2019s statute of limitations where a plaintiff alleges \u201cdiscrete incidents\u201d of discrimination. In <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), the plaintiff alleged that he had been subjected to discrete acts of discrimination and retaliation based on race in violation of Title VII. He also alleged that he had been subjected to a racially hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 104,122 S.Ct. 2061. Many of the discriminatory acts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint occurred outside Title VII\u2019s 300-day limitations period for filing a charge. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that pursuant to the continuing violation doctrine, the plaintiff could \u201csue on claims that would ordinarily be time barred so long as they either are \u2018sufficiently related\u2019 to incidents that fall within the statutory period or are part of a systematic policy or practice of discrimination that took place, at least in part, within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 122 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The Supreme Court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The Court did not explicitly approve or disapprove the use of the continuing violation doctrine. Rather, relying on Title VII\u2019s prohibition of unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ful employment \u201cpractices,\u201d the Court drew a distinction between hostile environment claims, which are \u201ca series of separate acts that collectively constitute one \u2018unlawful employment practice,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdiscrete acts\u201d of discrimination, which constitute a single, identifiable prohibited \u201cpractice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114-17,122 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The Court explained that in the case of hostile environment claims, \u201c[p]ro-vided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 122 S.Ct. 2061. The Court explained that hostile environment claims \u201care different\u201d because \u201c[tjheir very nature involves repeated conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 122 S.Ct. 2061. The Court therefore reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am5Z\">A hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one \u201cunlawful employment practice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l). The timely filing provision only requires that a Title VII plaintiff file a charge within a certain number of days after the unlawful practice happened. It does not matter, for purposes of the statute, that some of the component acts of the hostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period. Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 117,122 S.Ct. 2061. In other words, a hostile environment claim is not made timely by linking the \u201ccomponent acts\u201d together through the continuing violation doctrine. Rather, the hostile environment constitutes one unified, unlawful employment practice, and filing is timely as long as some act contributing to the hostile environment occurs within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In contrast, the Court held that where the alleged discriminatory practice is a \u201c[discrete act[] such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire,\u201d each alleged act of discrimination must be evaluated independently to determine whether it occurred within the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061. The Court did not define a \u201cdiscrete discriminatory act\u201d beyond offering examples of what might be a discrete act. The Court also explained, in response to the plaintiffs argument that Title VIPs use of the term \u201cpractice\u201d envisions an ongoing course of conduct rather than a discrete act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">We have repeatedly interpreted the term \u201cpractice\u201d to apply to a discrete act or single \u201coccurrence,\u201d even when it has a connection to other acts. For example ... in <em>Bazemore v. Friday, </em>478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986) (per curiam), a pattern-or-practice case, when considering a discriminatory salary structure, the Court noted that although the salary discrimination began prior to the date that the act was actionable under Title VII, \u201c[e]ach week\u2019s paycheck that delivered] less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395,106 S.Ct. 3000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 122 S.Ct. 2061. In sum, <em>Morgan </em>essentially rendered the continuing violation doctrine irrelevant to claims under federal discrimination law, dividing the universe of discriminatory practices into hostile environment claims and discrete acts of discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Since <em>Morgan, </em>a number of federal courts have held that pay discrimination claims involve \u201cdiscrete acts\u201d of discrimination such that plaintiffs are limited to recovering damages for only the discriminatory acts occurring within the limitations period. <em>See, e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>421 F.3d 1169, 1182-83 (11th Cir.2005) (each discriminatory decision setting pay is a discrete act); <em>Hildebrandt v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>347 F.3d 1014, 1027 (7th Cir.2003) (each discriminatory paycheck is a discrete act). Indeed, some federal courts so held before the <em>Morgan </em>decision. <em>See, e.g., Pollis v. New Sch. for Soc. Research, </em>132 F.3d 115, 119 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201ca claim of discriminatory pay is fundamentally unlike other claims of ongoing discriminatory treatment because it involves a series of discrete, individual wrongs rather than a single and indivisible course of wrongful action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Because it essentially eliminated the continuing violation doctrine, <em>Morgan </em>is of limited use to us in interpreting the THRA, since the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations incorporates the continuing violation exception. TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d); <em>Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890 n. 6. <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>holding does not change the plain language of the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations. As we have observed, however, we have previously determined that, like Title VU\u2019s statute of limitations, the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations does not operate to extend the limitations period on discrete acts of discrimination. <em>Weber, </em>938 S.W.2d at 391-92. The question we must resolve, therefore, is whether, under Tennessee law, pay discrimination is a series of discrete acts, or whether it is a continuing discriminatory practice that is actionable until it ceases.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\n<em>Is Discriminatory Pay a Continuing Violation under the THRA?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Boeing argues that because the THRA is meant to conform to Title VII, this Court should adopt the federal courts\u2019 reasoning that discriminatory pay is not a continuing violation. Booker argues that although Tennessee courts use federal civil rights law as a guide, this Court is not bound by federal civil rights law where the language of the THRA compels a different result. Specifically, Booker argues that because the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations provides that suits must be filed within one year of when the \u201calleged discriminatory practice <em>ceases,\u201d </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d) (emphasis added), we should not adopt the federal courts\u2019 severe restriction of the continuing violation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Although Boeing is correct that the purpose of the THRA is to \u201c[pjrovide for execution within Tennessee of the policies embodied in the federal Civil Rights Acts,\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-101(a)(l) (2005), as we have discussed, \u201cwe are neither bound by nor restricted by the federal law when interpreting our own anti-discrimination laws.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>48 S.W.3d 698, 705 (Tenn.2000); <em>see also Phillips v. Interstate Hotels Corp. No. L07, </em>974 S.W.2d 680, 683-84 (Tenn.1998) (same). Therefore, we will not apply the reasoning and conclusions of federal civil rights decisions where doing so would conflict with the THRA. At least one other state court has declined to follow <em>Morgan </em>strictly where plaintiffs allege claims under state laws prohibiting discrimination. <em>See, e.g., Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal, USA Inc., </em>36 Cal.4th 1028, 1057, 32 Cal.Rptr.3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (declining to apply <em>Morgan </em>to state-law retaliation claim because doing so \u201cwould mark a significant departure from the reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>and underlying policy rationale of our previous cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Moreover, the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations is fundamentally different than Title VII\u2019s statute of limitations. Title VII provides that a charge of discrimination must be filed within a set period \u201cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice <em>occurred.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C.2000e-5(e)(l) (emphasis added). The THRA provides that a suit must be filed \u201cwithin one (1) year after the alleged discriminatory practice <em>ceases.\u201d </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311(d) (emphasis added). Boeing argues that the difference between the words \u201coccurred\u201d and \u201cceases\u201d is immaterial, arguing that any practice that has already \u201coccurred\u201d must by definition have \u201cceased.\u201d However, Boeing\u2019s argument ignores the fact that \u201ccease\u201d and \u201coccurred\u201d have entirely different meanings. To \u201ccease\u201d means \u201cto bring or come to an end; stop; discontinue.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d ed.1980). \u201cOccurred,\u201d on the other hand, means \u201cto take place; happen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201coccurred\u201d connotes and contemplates a single instance, whereas \u201cceases\u201d connotes and contemplates an ongoing course of conduct. In stating that a claim must be brought within one year of the time a practice \u201cceases,\u201d as we have explained, the Legislature incorporated the continuing violation exception into the statute of limitations. Therefore, rather than accepting the federal courts\u2019 limitation on the continuing violation doctrine, we must conduct our own analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Boeing argues that pay discrimination is not a continuing violation because each payment is a discrete discriminatory act that \u201cceased\u201d at the time the payment was made. In our view, however, a discriminatory pay rate is not a discrete act in the same sense that a termination or a denial of promotion is a discrete act. Something is \u201cdiscrete\u201d if it is \u201cseparate and distinct; not attached to others; unrelated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Payments of a salary are not \u201cdistinct or unconnected.\u201d Rather, they are part of an ongoing course of conduct. We do not hold that a single discriminatory paycheck does not constitute a discriminatory act. It does. But in our view, a discriminatory pay rate, whether it occurs for two weeks, two years, or more, constitutes precisely the type of continuing violation envisioned by the Legislature in enacting the THRA\u2019s statute of limitations. Indeed, we recognized as much in <em>Spicer </em>when we cited as an example of a continuing violation, \u201can employer [who] continues to presently impose disparate work assignment or <em>pay rates.\u201d </em>937 S.W.2d at 889 (emphasis added). A discriminatory pay rate is actionable until it \u201cceases.\u201d It does not cease each time an employee receives a paycheck. Rather, it ceases when the employer brings the employee into parity with his or her peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Under the continuing violation doctrine as adopted in <em>Spicer, </em>a plaintiff must bring suit when the discriminatory \u201c \u2018act ha[s] the degree of permanence which should trigger [the] employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights-\u2019\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>937 S.W.2d at 890 (quoting <em>Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 981). If this \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applies to pay discrimination claims, then it would not matter, for purposes of the statute of limitations, whether the discriminatory conduct had \u201cceased\u201d or not. Once the discriminatory pay rate had \u201ctriggered]\u201d the employee\u2019s awareness of a duty to assert his or her rights, then the statute would be tolled. We agree with Booker that this rule is incompatible with the plain language of the THRA. A discriminatory pay rate \u201cceases\u201d when it ends, not when the employee\u2019s awareness of it should alert him or her to assert his or her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>We overrule <em>Spicer </em>to the extent that it imposed a \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d on continuing violation claims. However, we note that employers may still invoke equitable doctrines such as laches and estoppel to limit claims in cases where an employee has slept on his or her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">After considering the applicable authority and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that discriminatory pay is a continuing violation under the THRA. We further conclude that a plaintiff may seek backpay for the duration of the practice, until it \u201cceases,\u201d although equitable doctrines may bar some or all of the plaintiffs relief. Costs of the appeal shall be assessed to the appellee, the Boeing Company, d/b/a Boeing-Oak Ridge Company.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. Although we approved the continuing violation doctrine in <em>Spicer, </em>we held that the plaintiff in that case could not invoke it because the evidence did not show that any instances of discrimination had occurred within the one-year limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 890-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"><em>. Morgan </em>did, however, save the question of what effect its holding would have on pattern- and-practice claims, noting that \"none are at issue here.\u201d 536 U.S. at 115 n. 9, 122 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2061. Likewise, Booker does not allege a pattern-or-practice claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
