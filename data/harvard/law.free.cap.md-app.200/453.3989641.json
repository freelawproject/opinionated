Reeside (\u201cEstate\u201d), in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, against appellant, Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (\u201cWSSC\u201d). On January 11, 2010, Erie filed a motion to enforce settlement. Following a hearing on February 2, 2010, the court denied Erie\u2019s motion. This interlocutory appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Erie presents a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">Did the circuit court err by failing to enter an order enforcing the parties\u2019 settlement agreement and/or permitting the case to proceed to trial after a substituted agreement had been reached?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">According to the Estate\u2019s complaint, \u201c[o]n or about July 6, 2003, WSSC sewage pipes backed up causing raw sewage to flood\u201d Jeanne R. Reeside\u2019s basement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The flood damaged \u201c \u2018family heirlooms,\u2019 including, but not limited to, photographs, films, documents and miscellaneous personal property.\u201d The Estate claimed that WSSC \u201cauthorized Ralph Reeside, one of the personal representatives of the Estate, to have the Personal Property cleaned and/or restored at an organization ... operating under the name of \u2018Document Reprocessors.\u2019 \u201d In its brief, the Estate alleges that \u201cWSSC failed and/or refused to pay for any clean up and/or remediation ... [and the Estate was] forced to pursue reimbursement ... against their home owners\u2019 insurance company \u2014 Erie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On September 26, 2007, WSSC and the Estate attended a mediation session. According to the Estate, \u201cWSSC made a monetary offer to settle\u201d during that meeting. On October 2, 2007, counsel for the Estate sent an e-mail to counsel for Erie and WSSC, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">I have informed the assignment clerk of the settlement, and stet\u2019d the case for thirty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">Heather [WSSC\u2019s attorney]' \u2014 please make the check a two party check payable to \u201cDocument Reprocessors and The Estate of Jeanne Reeside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">On October 10, 2007, the court stayed the case \u201cfor a period of 30 days\u201d stating that \u201cfailure to file the joint line of dismissal within 30 days will result in this case being dismissed without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">By e-mail dated October 17, 2007, counsel for WSSC informed the Estate that \u201cthe check and release\u201d would arrive by mail. On October 26, 2007, counsel for the Estate responded by stating that \u201c[t]he settlement agreement and release are not acceptable as written.\u201d Counsel for the Estate also asked WSSC to make six changes, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>1. The Estate is not releasing and/or settling with Erie. The Estate has agreed to dismiss the pending lawsuit as to both WSSC and Erie, with prejudice. The Estate is not giving any sort of blanket release to Erie. The Estate has settled with and is releasing WSSC only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">2. The proposed settlement is with WSSC only. The Estate is not agreeing to pay any monies to Document Reprocessors over and above what the Estate will pay Document Reprocessors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">4. Your request that the Estate defend and indemnify WSSC is totally unacceptable and must be eliminated. Please see my general comments above. Obviously, I disagree with you on this. The clause is narrowly drawn and is standard in releases of this type.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On November 6, 2007, the Estate e-mailed WSSC to inquire about the \u201cstatus of the revised settlement agreement.\u201d WSSC responded that same day and stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi\">Generally, with any settlement, WSSC wants to end its exposure on a particular matter for all time. The indemnification clause is therefore crucial. This clause is narrowly drafted in that it just applies to situations in which the Estate would sue another party and then that party would bring us in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">On Thursday, November 8, 2007, counsel for the Estate informed WSSC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">Again, for the reasons previously stated, Mr. Reeside and his sisters will not sign the settlement agreement with Erie. The estate did not settle with Erie. There will be no indemnity of WSSC. That has never been any part of any agreement. There will be no promises as to what Document Reprocessors will or will not do. Please make ALL of the previously requested changes, or Monday I will request that the clerk put this case back on trial track.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">On Wednesday, November 14, 2007, WSSC replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">Again, as with any settlement, WSSC wants to end the matter entirely and avoid being brought into future law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>suits. Therefore, I cannot make the changes that you have suggested. I suggest that we get the mediator involved again to try and work something out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">That same day, the Estate answered: \u201cNo. Tomorrow I am requesting this matter be put back on the trial track.\u201d On April 22,2008, the court reinstated the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On January 11, 2010, Erie filed a motion to enforce settlement and for costs. On February 2, 2010, the court held a hearing, during which the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">THE COURT: ... All right. I have read the motion with respect to the settlement issue and I still don\u2019t know what the settlement was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">Was there a document? Was there something in writing which articulated what the terms of the settlement was when it went to mediation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">[THE ESTATE]: No, Your Honor. That\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AID\">THE COURT: All right. So, [Erie],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">[ERIE]: ... There is a writing of an e-mail from plaintiffs own counsel cited in their opposition which indicates the agreement was to dismiss Erie with prejudice....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">THE COURT: Where is there anything in writing that says WSSC, that Erie is out of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">[ERIE]: It\u2019s in plaintiffs opposition, Your Honor----He actually cites it in the text.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">THE COURT: Once. But then in other places it\u2019s a complete opposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">THE COURT: Was there something in writing done at the mediation session?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">[THE ESTATE]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">THE COURT: So, you have in one sentence, [The Estate has agreed to dismiss the pending lawsuit as to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>WSSC and Erie with prejudice,] is that what you\u2019re basing your motion on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[ERIE]: Well yes, Your Honor, and the whole factual background. That was the agreement. The agreement was to dismiss Erie with prejudice----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">THE COURT: Okay. There\u2019s nothing in writing in these emails are, there\u2019s no accord anywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">[ERIE]: Your Honor, all we\u2019re seeking to enforce is what has been stipulated as to agreed to, dismissing Erie with prejudice. We don\u2019t want a release....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t look like it was agreed to\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The court then proceeded to hear from each party\u2019s counsel regarding the mediation. Counsel for the Estate stated that there was no resolution reached at the end of the mediation. When asked whether the claim against Erie was to be dismissed with prejudice, counsel for the Estate stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">A Well, that was if we settled with WSSC and we did not end up settling with WSSC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">Q ... So, you represented in this e-mail that the Estate has agreed to dismiss the pending lawsuit as to both WSSC and Erie with prejudice, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">A On the condition that WSSC paid us money, and didn\u2019t require the indemnification clause, didn\u2019t require us to pay money to Document Reprocessors, and didn\u2019t require us to settle and release with Erie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Counsel for WSSC related the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">Q At any point did you insist that Erie had to be part of any release, as a take it or leave it proposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">A If I recall, it was preferable that we have a release involving all parties, but that, before we could get to that issue that, the settlement negotiations or the settlement terms, the discussions or e-mails back and forth with [counsel for the Estate], it broke down over the indemnification issue. So, we really never got to the issue about Erie and being a part of the release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">A Or agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Thereafter, the court ruled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">The parties were, was if this case settled between WSSC and the Estate, Erie was going to get out. But since it didn\u2019t settle between WSSC and the Estate, Erie is still in it. So there wasn\u2019t any blanket agreement to Erie that Erie was going to get out without paying money. Erie was on the coattails of a settlement with WSSC. And since there never was a concrete agreement as they say, the devil is in the details. Erie doesn\u2019t get the, doesn\u2019t get the benefit. There was never [ ] an agreement that Erie can tag onto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">So the motion to enforce the settlement agreement ... is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">On February 26, 2010, Erie filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Erie argues that \u201cthe circuit court erred by failing to enter an order enforcing the parties\u2019 settlement agreement and/or permitting the case to proceed to trial after a substituted agreement had been reached.\u201d According to Erie, \u201c[t]he plain language of the communications between counsel demonstrates the existence of the agreement,\u201d or \u201csubstituted contract.\u201d Erie further contends that the \u201crepresentations\u201d made by the Estate constituted a \u201cjudicial admission\u201d and, therefore, the court should have dismissed the Estate\u2019s claim against Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The Estate responds by arguing that \u201cthe basic requirements of a contract were not present to form a settlement contract.\u201d Specifically, the Estate avers that \u201cthe parties never mutually agreed to [certain] terms, and they never stated with reasonable certainty what they had undertaken.\u201d We agree with the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">\u201cSettlement agreements are enforceable as independent contracts, subject to the same general rules of construction that apply to other contracts.\u201d <em>Maslow v. Vanguri, </em>168 Md.App. 298, 316, 896 A.2d 408 (2006) (citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201c \u2018As long as the basic requirements to form a contract are present, there is no reason to treat such a settlement agreement differently than other contracts which are binding.\u2019 \u201d <em>David v. Warwell, </em>86 Md.App. 306, 310, 586 A.2d 775 (1991) (quoting <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 219, 406 A.2d 922 (1979)). \u201c[W]here the contract is fair, reasonable and certain,\u201d a court of equity can decree specific performance. <em>Excel Co. v. Freeman, </em>252 Md. 242, 246, 250 A.2d 103 (1969) (citations omitted). \u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Maslow, supra, </em>168 Md.App. at 317, 896 A.2d 408 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 919 A.2d 700 (2007), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">It is universally accepted that a manifestation of mutual assent is an essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract. <em>See Creel v. Lilly, </em>354 Md. 77, 101, 729 A.2d 385, 398 (1999); <em>Eastover Stores, Inc. v. Minnix, </em>219 Md. 658, 665, 150 A.2d 884, 888 (1959). Manifestation of mutual assent includes two issues: (1) intent to be bound, and (2) definiteness of terms. <em>See </em>CORBIN ON CONTRACTS [ ] \u00a7 2.8, p. 131. Failure of parties to agree on an essential term of a contract may indicate that the mutual assent required to make a contract is lacking. <em>See Safeway Stores v. Altman, </em>296 Md. 486, 489-90, 463 A.2d 829, 831 (1983); <em>Klein v. Weiss, </em>284 Md. 36, 63, 395 A.2d 126, 141 (1978). If the parties do not intend to be bound until a final agreement is executed, there is no contract. <em>See Eastover Stores, Inc., </em>219 Md. at 665, 150 A.2d at 888; <em>Peoples Drug Stores v. Fenton, </em>191 Md. 489, 494, 62 A.2d 273, 275-76 (1948). <em>See also </em>CORBIN ON CONTRACTS, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.9, p. 151; 1 RICHARD A. LORD, WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS \u00a7 4:8, p. 302 (Rev. ed.1990); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 27 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al2\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, 919 A.2d 700 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In this case, no final agreement was ever executed. At the end of the mediation session, the mediator did not prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>anything in writing that stated the terms to which WSSC and the Estate had agreed. In fact, further discussion regarding outstanding issues continued by way of e-mails between counsel for all the parties. The Estate made clear to WSSC that it would not agree to at least three essential terms included in the proposed written settlement agreement. As such, mutual assent required to make a contract was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Erie argues that the Estate made a judicial admission when its counsel stated in an e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">The Estate is not releasing and/or settling with Erie. <em>The Estate has agreed to dismiss the pending lawsuit as to both WSSC and Erie, with prejudice. </em>The Estate is not giving any sort of blanket release to Erie. The Estate has settled with and is releasing WSSC only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">As counsel for the Estate explained, that statement was made \u201con the condition that WSSC paid us money, and didn\u2019t require the indemnification clause, didn\u2019t require us to pay money to Document Reprocessors, and didn\u2019t require us to settle and release with Erie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">With the mediation proceedings as a frame of reference, counsel for the Estate was simply listing the specific provisions to which the Estate had agreed and not agreed during the mediation. The Estate agreed to dismiss its case against Erie <em>only </em>if it reached a settlement with WSSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">As counsel for WSSC put succinctly, \u201cbefore we could get to [issues involving Erie], the settlement negotiations or the settlement terms ... broke down over the indemnification issue.\u201d The court correctly concluded that, \u201csince it didn\u2019t settle between WSSC and the Estate,\u201d Erie could not be dismissed from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Finally, Erie cites <em>Clark, supra, </em>286 Md. at 214-18, 406 A.2d 922, and argues that it entered into a \u201csubstituted contract\u201d with the Estate. Thus, Erie contends that the Estate cannot maintain any further action \u201cupon the original claim, and only the new contract can be the subject of any pursuit.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>argument fails because, as we previously explained, no contract of any type was ever formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\">.
