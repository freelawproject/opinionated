Washington with the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d). MIA determined that appellee, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, failed to notify Washington of an increase in his premium, and, therefore, violated the insurance laws of Maryland. Following a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) reversed MIA\u2019s determination. MIA filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The circuit court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Insurance Commissioner for Maryland, appellant, presents the following questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">1. Whether State Farm was required to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 12-106 of the Maryland Insurance Article when State Farm attempted unilaterally to increase Washington\u2019s premium, during the coverage term, after \u201cdiscovering\u201d during the underwriting period that the insured had been in several accidents despite the fact that he had fully disclosed these accidents on his insurance application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">2. Whether State Farm violated \u00a7 27-614 of the Insurance Article when it unilaterally increased Washington\u2019s premium without providing him with the statutorily required 45-days written notice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">For the reasons outlined below, we shall affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">On August 6, 2007, Washington met with a State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company agent to obtain automobile and renter\u2019s insurance. The application for automobile insurance listed a 2005 Hyundai Elantra and provided Washington\u2019s vehicular accident history. The agent reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>application and determined, based on Washington\u2019s accident history, that he was ineligible for coverage through State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. However, Washington was eligible for coverage through a subsidiary, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. The agent quoted Washington a premium rate of $1,401.46 for a six month policy. Washington accepted the quote and tendered an initial payment of $233.57. The agent then issued an insurance binder that stated, \u201c[t]he Premium shown ... must be in compliance with the Company\u2019s rules and rates and is subject to revision.\u201d Both parties understood that an insurance policy would be issued at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The agent submitted Washington\u2019s application to the company\u2019s underwriting department. A comprehensive loss underwriting exchange (\u201cCLUE\u201d) report was generated and verified Washington\u2019s disclosure of two accidents. After reviewing the CLUE report, it was determined that Washington was \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201cat fault\u201d for those accidents. Although Washington was eligible for coverage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the agent had failed to consider the two accidents, and, thus, quoted an inaccurate premium rate. Appellee\u2019s underwriting guidelines provided that a 90% surcharge needed to be added to Washington\u2019s base rate. Appel-lee thereafter issued a six month policy with a premium of $2,512.62 and retroactively charged Washington for the additional premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On August 30, 2007, appellee received information that Washington may have been responsible for only one of the accidents. Appellee adjusted Washington\u2019s premium because he was subject to a 30% surcharge with only one at-fault accident. In the interim, Washington\u2019s renter\u2019s insurance was issued, which entitled him to a 10% multi-line discount. After both adjustments, the six month premium was retroactively reduced to $1,603.20, with monthly payments of $267.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>On October 24, 2007, Washington filed a complaint with MIA. In the complaint, Washington alleged that appellee \u201c[r]aised premium without explanation &amp; can\u2019t give one. No notice given.\u201d On September 19, 2008, following an investigation, MIA concluded that appellee failed to provide written notice of an increase in Washington\u2019s premium at least 45 days before its effective date, and, therefore, violated Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supplement), \u00a7 27-614 of the Insurance Article (\u201cInsur.\u201d). In its determination, MIA disallowed the premium increase, and noted that after appellee had verified Washington\u2019s accident history, it had the option to cancel his insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On October 15, 2008, appellee challenged MIA\u2019s determination and requested a hearing. MIA referred the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) to issue \u201cfinal findings of fact, final conclusions of law, and a final order.\u201d MIA also requested that specific attention be directed to Insur. \u00a7\u00a7 12-106 and 27-614. On May 1, 2009, MIA filed a motion for summary decision, asserting appellee failed to issue a notice of premium increase to Washington. On May 7, 2009, a hearing was held and the ALJ noted that MIA had not timely filed its motion. In response, MIA requested that its motion be treated as a motion for judgment at the close of appellee\u2019s case. During the hearing, appellee argued that it did not violate the insurance code because it could not cancel Washington\u2019s insurance once it discovered the rating error. Appellee further explained that Washington was still eligible for coverage, albeit at an increased premium. Appellee next argued that a binder was a separate contract from a policy and ceased to exist when the policy was issued. In that regard, appellee asserted that it was not required to follow the notice procedure of Insur. \u00a7 27-614 because the increase in premium was effective upon issuance of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">MIA contended that appellee should have provided Washington notice of the premium increase pursuant to Insur. \u00a7 27-614. MIA also argued that appellee should have canceled, and re-issued, Washington\u2019s policy with the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>premium since there was no mechanism set forth in Insur. \u00a7 12-106 to increase the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">On June 19, 2009, OAH concluded that Washington met appellee\u2019s underwriting standards; therefore, upon discovering the error, appellee was obligated to adjust the premium to comply with its established rating plan. OAH also noted that there was no \u201cincrease in premium\u201d because Insur. \u00a7 27-614 does not treat the terms \u201cbinder\u201d and \u201cpolicy\u201d as synonymous. The decision further noted that the alternatives suggested by MIA were unlawful because, pursuant to Insur. \u00a7 27-216, appellee could not have provided notice to Washington and continued to collect incorrect premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On July 21, 2009, MIA filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. A hearing was held on February 22, 2010, and MIA argued that Washington should have been notified of the premium increase, or appellee should have canceled and reissued the policy with the correct premium. MIA further argued that the uncodified language of House Bill 760 (\u201cHB 760\u201d) demonstrates Insur. \u00a7 27-614 is applicable to binders because HB 760 created that section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Appellee responded that the legislative language applied equally to Insur. \u00a7\u00a7 27-618 and 27-614, and that there was no mention in Insur. \u00a7 27-614 of binders. Moreover, because Insur. \u00a7 27-613 referenced a specific type of binder, appellee argued that the legislative language did not dictate Insur. \u00a7 27-614 applied to binders. Appellee then argued that Washington was given notice of a possible change in his premium when he accepted the binder. Appellee explained that Washington accepted the language in that contract indicating the premium was subject to change when he accepted the binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court affirmed OAH\u2019s decision. In its decision, because MIA failed to argue there was a violation of Insur. \u00a7 12-106, the court limited its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ruling to Insur. \u00a7 27-614, and found that the terms \u201cbinder\u201d and \u201cpolicy\u201d were not interchangeable. The court noted that there was a \u201cdistinction to be considered by this court with respect to those terms[,]\u201d and cited <em>Flester v. The Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>269 Md. 544, 307 A.2d 663 (1973), which held that a binder is a preliminary contract of insurance that gives temporary protection until the issuance of a formal policy. The court then concluded that there was no violation of Insur. \u00a7 27-614 because it applied to policies and not binders. Appellant noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Maryland Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571-72, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), Judge Eldridge outlined the proper standard for review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">(quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)) (Internal citations and footnotes omitted); <em>see also Hill v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>415 Md. 231, 239, 999 A.2d 1019 (2010); <em>Maryland Transp. Auth. v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002); <em>Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495, 769 A.2d 912 (2001); Md.Code (2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">As a preliminary matter, we address appellant\u2019s argument that the term \u201crisk\u201d includes the premium rate and, thus, Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d) requires cancellation when an underwriting investigation reveals that \u201cthe <em>risk </em>does not meet the underwriting standards of the insurer.\u201d (Emphasis provided in brief). Appellee argues that this issue was not preserved for appeal because appellant is raising a new issue. Moreover, appellee asserts that the issue was not preserved for review because MIA\u2019s September 19, 2008 determination failed to render a finding that there was a violation of Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d), and MIA acknowledged before the circuit court that it was not alleging a violation of Insur. \u00a7 12-106. We agree with appellee and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In its September 19, 2008 determination, MIA found that appellee violated Insur. \u00a7 27-614(c). MIA, however, did not find a violation of Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d). Instead, MIA noted that pursuant to Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d), appellee had <em>\u201cthe option </em>to cancel\u201d Washington\u2019s binder. (Emphasis added). During the February 22, 2010 hearing, MIA also conceded that appellee did not violate Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that regard, wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>er there was a violation of Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d) was not preserved for review. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 106, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009) (even arguments of constitutional dimensions, if not raised at trial, are not preserved for appellate review); <em>Thomas v. Corso, </em>265 Md. 84, 108-09, 288 A.2d 379 (1972) (an argument not raised in the court below is not preserved for appellate review); <em>see also Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 460 A.2d 61 (1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 742 A.2d 508 (1999) (appellant may not present a claim for the first time on appeal); <em>C.S. Bowen Co. v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>36 Md.App. 26, 35, 373 A.2d 30 (1977) (an issue is properly before an appellate court only if it was properly presented to the trial court and decided by it in the first instance).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Nevertheless, we note that an insurer is not required to cancel a binder or policy when an underwriting investigation reveals that the risk does not adhere to the underwriting standards of the insurer. Insur. \u00a7 12-106(d) provides that \u201c[a]n insurer may cancel a binder or policy during the underwriting period if the risk does not meet the underwriting standards of the insurer.\u201d (Emphasis added). The inclusion of the word \u201cmay\u201d demonstrates that an insurer has discretion when deciding whether to cancel a binder or policy during the underwriting period. Thus, even though the argument was not preserved for review, we disregard the appellant\u2019s argument that cancellation is required when an underwriting inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tigation reveals that \u201cthe <em>risk </em>does not meet the underwriting standards of the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Appellant next argues that Insur. \u00a7 27 \u2014 614(c)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201crequires that insurers send their policyholders 45-days notice of any \u2018increase in <em>the total premium for a policy\u2019 </em>of private passenger automobile liability insurance.\u201d (Emphasis provided in brief). Citing the legislative amendment that added the term \u201ctotal\u201d to policy premium, appellant explains that the Legislature carefully contemplated the language of Insur. \u00a7 27-614(c)(1), and decided to make advanced notice of premium increases mandatory for all increases in \u201ctotal policy premiums for consumer auto policies.\u201d In support, appellant cites Section 3 of HB 760, which eventually became Insur. \u00a7 27-614, and states: \u201cthis Act applies to <em>all </em>private passenger motor vehicle liability binders and policies____\u201d (Emphasis provided in brief). Appellee counters that appellant\u2019s interpretation of Insur. \u00a7 27-614(c)(l) does not consider the argument that there was no policy in existence, or, moreover, a premium for a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Given the parties\u2019 contentions, and OAH\u2019s decision, we must determine whether the Legislature intended Insur. \u00a7 27-614(c)(l) to apply to binders. In addressing this issue, we adhere to the well-known and oft-recited canons of statutory interpretation. \u201c[0]ur primary goal [when analyzing a statute] is always to \u2018discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision....\u2019\u201d <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>408 Md. 336, 351, 969 A.2d 971 (2009) (quoting <em>Barbre v.

State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727 (2004). In that regard, we \u201cmust always be cognizant of the fundamental principle that statutory construction is approached from a \u2018commonsensical\u2019 perspective. Thus, we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\u201cStatutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 124 n. 13, 896 A.2d 320 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439 (2005). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel, </em>408 Md. at 351, 969 A.2d 971 (citations omitted); <em>see also Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003). However, if ambiguous, we may go beyond plain meaning of the statute and ascertain the purpose of the statute \u201cby examining the Legislature\u2019s statement of a statute\u2019s purposes, [or] other \u2018external manifestations\u2019 or \u2018persuasive evidence\u2019 indicating the legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

We believe the omission of the word \u201cbinders\u201d was purposeful. HB 760 created Insur. \u00a7 27-605.1, which was redesignated as Insur. \u00a7 27-614,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and reshaped Insur. \u00a7 27-605. Insur. \u00a7 27-605.1 was primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>comprised of the former Insur. \u00a7 27-605, which in relevant part, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">(a) In this section, \u201cincrease in premium\u201d and \u201cpremium increase\u201d include an increase in the premium for any coverage on a policy due to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">(1) a surcharge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(2) retiering or other reclassification of an insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">(3) removal or reduction of a discount</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">Insur. \u00a7 27-605(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">When HB 760 created Insur. \u00a7 27-605.1, which was re-designated as Insur. \u00a7 27-614, it deleted the phrase \u201cany coverage on\u201d in subsection (a). The deletion of \u201cany coverage on\u201d demonstrates that Insur. \u00a7 27-614 is not applicable to binders because the phrase could reasonably be interpreted to refer to insurance binders. HB 760, moreover, does not contain any reference to binders. The former Insur. \u00a7 27-605 included references to both policies and binders, but when Insur. \u00a7 27-605.1, re-designated as Insur. \u00a7 27-614, was created, HB 760 neglected to include binders like the former Insur. \u00a7 27-605 did.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Additionally, the re-designation of the former Insur. \u00a7 27-605 to Insur. \u00a7 27-613 in HB 570 explains the non-codified language of Section 3 of HB 760, which addresses binders and policies. Section 3 states that \u201cthis Act applies to all private passenger motor vehicle liability <em>binders and policies </em>issued or renewed on or after the effective date of this Act.\u201d (Emphasis added). The \u201cAct\u201d referenced in Section 3 was the former Insur. \u00a7 27-605, which originally included references to binders and policies, but was re-designated as Insur. \u00a7 27-613. The re-designation to Insur. \u00a7 27-613 <em>clearly </em>demonstrates that the non-codified language is not applicable to Insur. \u00a7 27-614.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">On a separate note, the content of Insur. \u00a7 27-614\u2019s notice requirement also precludes it from applying to binders. As part of its consumer protection, Insur. \u00a7 27-614 requires an insurer to include a comparison between the premium for the current policy period and the renewal policy period in its premium increase notice. An insured who has only been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>issued a binder would not have a current or renewal policy period that could be compared and included in a premium increase notice. Moreover, the distinction between binders and policies in Insur. \u00a7 12 \u2014 106(h), which states that \u201ca binder is no longer valid after the policy as to which it was given is issued[,]\u201d demonstrates that Insur. \u00a7 27-614 is not applicable to binders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In sum, we conclude that OAH\u2019s decision was correct because \u201cbinders\u201d and \u201cpolicies\u201d are distinct terms that are not interchangeable. Insur. \u00a7 27-614, which only references policies, cannot be interpreted to apply to binders, and as such, is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
