Code Ann., Crim. Law (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 3-203 (assault in the second degree); C.L. \u00a7 9-408(b) (resisting arrest); and C.L. \u00a7 10-201(c)(2) (disorderly conduct). The case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City following appellant\u2019s request for a jury trial. Prior to trial in the circuit court, appellant filed a motion to discharge his lawyer. The court denied the motion without prejudice and held that appellant could renew the motion at trial. On the first day of trial, prior to jury selection, appellant renewed the motion to discharge his attorney. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The jury convicted appellant of second-degree assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment, with credit for time served. Appellant noted a timely appeal and presented the following questions for review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">I. When the trial judge found that the Appellant had not presented meritorious reasons for his request to discharge counsel and that Appellant was therefore not entitled to the appointment of new counsel, did he violate Maryland Rule 4-215(e) in failing to inform the Appellant that he could nonetheless discharge his counsel and proceed <em>pro se </em>if he chose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">II. Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in failing to give a missing witness instruction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>For the following reasons, we answer both questions in the negative and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">On July 29, 2009, at approximately 5:05 p.m., Detective Austin Sailor, of the Baltimore City Police Department, was working in plain clothes capacity in an unmarked vehicle near the 2300 block of Harford Road in Baltimore City, Maryland. Detective Sailor was traveling with two other detectives northbound on Harford Road and made a left turn onto Cliftview Avenue. At that time, Detective Sailor saw approximately seven to eight people standing near the intersection of Har-ford Road and Cliftview Avenue. Detective Sailor testified, as follows, as to his observations of the group:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">At that point, while watching the group of people I observed that some green currency from somewhere began flying in the air. I observed an African American female bend down to pick up someone\u2019s currency. At that time, the gentleman stood up in front of that female, yelled, give him that money. The female stood up and I observed the male strike her in the face with the left hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Detective Sailor identified appellant in court as the person who struck the female. Detective Sailor testified that at the time of the incident, appellant was \u201c[v]ery angry[,] [v]ery aggressive.\u201d Detective Sailor described the incident, stating that appellant was \u201csignificantly larger\u201d than the female, and testified that he \u201cobserved the Defendant take a boxer\u2019s type stance. He pulled back 'with his left hand, popped back and struck her with an overhand left to the right-side of the jaw.\u201d The female fell to the ground after being struck. Detective Sailor saw the woman crying and holding her jaw with her right hand. He observed scratches and bruising on her face. Detective Sailor testified that the female declined medical treatment. Detective Sailor testified that when being placed under arrest, appellant struggled, and it took three detectives to place him on the ground, handcuff and arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Detective Chris Merino of the Baltimore City Police Department, who was riding with Detective Sailor on July 29, 2009, corroborated Detective Sailor\u2019s account of the incident. Detective Merino testified that as they turned the corner onto Cliftview Avenue, he heard shouting, saw appellant \u201c[a]ngry\u201d and \u201c[u]pset,\u201d and heard him say \u201cgive him that money.\u201d Detective Merino testified that appellant was facing a female at the time, and within less than a minute, Detective Merino saw appellant \u201cstrike the female in front of him.\u201d Detective Merino testified that appellant hit the female in the mouth area with a closed fist. Detective Merino stated that when he and two other detectives went to place appellant under arrest, appellant \u201cbecame a little tense, he tensed up, kind of resisted a little bit[,]\u201d and the three detectives were able to handcuff him and place him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Appellant testified on his own behalf that, on the date and time in question, he had just finished work and was standing at the bus stop on Harford Road when \u201c[pjolice come up and grabbed [him].\u201d Appellant testified that the officers asked him for identification and he showed them his identification as well as a green parole card.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant testified that at that point, he was arrested. Appellant testified that the police officers claimed he had robbed someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">In a letter addressed to the trial court prior to trial, appellant moved to dismiss his attorney. Appellant alleged that his attorney was conspiring with the prosecutor and was not properly defending him. The trial court denied the motion, but indicated that on the day of trial, appellant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>renew the motion. On the day of trial, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed the request and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7n\">[PROSECUTOR]: State of Maryland vs. Jerome Pinkney, 809247030. Lauren Polk for the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Brandon Thornton, Your Honor. Mr. Pinkney is here, and we\u2019re at a point where Mr. Pinkney is petitioning the court to discharge the service of the Public Defender. Your Honor, he is not speaking to me and he does not wish to stand with me at the trial table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGB\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Pinkney, you need to stand at the trial table, because your case has been called whether Mr. Thornton is representing you or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: State\u2019s ready, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">THE COURT: Now, very quickly Mr. Pinkney. What\u2019s the problem with Mr. Thornton in your eyes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">THE COURT: What problem do you have with Mr. Thornton representing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me. I asked him something last time. You asked me, what did I say? He said, nothing, like you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">THE COURT: Have you hired an attorney, Mr. Pinkney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJR\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">THE COURT: All right. Well, Mr. Thornton is the attorney you had from the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Are you able to talk with him about your case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Two minutes ain\u2019t ample time to talk to nobody about no case. The only time I\u2019ve seen him is when I come in here. He talked to me for about two minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Thornton, have you had time to prepare for trial in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we don\u2019t have any witnesses. It is what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">THE COURT: Have you reviewed what the State has in discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">THE COURT: Mr. Pinkney, are there any witnesses to this event that you\u2019ve identified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">THE DEFENDANT: What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">THE COURT: Have you identified any witnesses to this alleged event?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">THE DEFENDANT: On my behalf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">THE COURT: Yeah, beside from you obviously. Have you identified anyone who might serve as a witness in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">THE DEFENDANT: No. I haven\u2019t had nobody been here (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">THE COURT: In this situation, Mr. Pinkney, there isn\u2019t a whole lot to prepare for the case, beside from being familiar with the police reports, for Mr. Thornton to be ready to cross examine the officers and then to talk with you; and I don\u2019t want you to say anything about the incident. But, to talk with you about your version of the events and whether there\u2019s a possibility that you\u2019re going to testify in the case. But, there\u2019s not a whole lot to prepare in the case other than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">You\u2019ve written me a letter that says, you think that Mr. Thornton is working with the State, but I don\u2019t understand what the basis for that would be. I see Mr. Thornton frequently. He tries cases before me. He does so very ably. I don\u2019t understand what the issue is with Mr. Thornton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">THE DEFENDANT: He got a motion \u2014 he filed for motion of discovery. He thinks it\u2019s going to take \u2014 he gets the State burden and wants the discovery. He never gave no pretrial investigation of the crime scene, no. (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-14\">THE COURT: There is no \u2014 if there are no other witnesses, there\u2019s nothing to investigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-15\">THE DEFENDANT: It\u2019s a (inaudible) somebody was here. He never went to see \u2014 to talk to the person who was there that I took a hit of (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>THE COURT: All right. I\u2019m not satisfied that there\u2019s any basis for you to discharge Mr. Thornton as your Counsel. He\u2019s assigned by the Public Defender\u2019s Office and that\u2019s the \u2014 a very capable attorney that you got to represent you in this case. Counsel, is this case ready for trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred under Md. Rule 4-215(e) by failing to inform him that he could discharge his counsel and proceed <em>pro se. </em>Recognizing that the trial court \u201cgave [him] an opportunity to air his grievances with respect to his assigned counsel,\u201d appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to give him \u201cthe option of representing himself after ensuring that [he had] been advised of the pitfalls of self-representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In contrast, the State responds that the trial court properly complied with Md. Rule 4-215(e) and that, \u201c[u]nder the facts of this case, the trial court was not required to advise [appellant] of the right to proceed <em>pro se.\u201d </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this case, appellant does not dispute that he was given an opportunity to explain the reasons he wanted to discharge his attorney. Instead, appellant\u2019s primary contention is that, after the trial judge found those reasons to be unmeritorious, the trial judge was required to inform him that he could discharge counsel and proceed <em>pro se. </em>In disagreement \"with appellant, we conclude that Md. Rule 4-215(e) does not require that a trial judge advise a defendant of the option of proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">A defendant in a criminal prosecution has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and the corresponding right to reject that assistance and represent himself. <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>408 Md. 515, 529-30, 970 A.2d 908 (2009). As the Court of Appeals has stated, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the accused not only the right to be represented by counsel, but also the right to make his own defense without the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Gregg v. State, </em>377 Md. 515, 548, 833 A.2d 1040 (2003) (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(1975)); <em>accord State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 626-27, 870 A.2d 217 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">As to the implementation and protection of the right to counsel, Md. Rule 4-215(e) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(1)-(4)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">(Footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cWhen interpreting the Maryland Rules, we look to the ordinary rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>King v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>407 Md. 682, 698, 967 A.2d 790 (2009) (citation omitted). The plain language of Md. Rule 4-215(e) imposes upon the trial court the responsibility not to permit discharge of counsel unless the defendant is informed of the possibility that trial will proceed with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. Where a trial court finds no meritorious reason for the requested discharge of counsel and does not permit the discharge, Md. Rule 4-215(e) does not impose an obligation on the trial court to inform the defendant of the option to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Md. Rule 4-215(e) states if the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without advising that the trial will proceed with the defendant unrepresented. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of Md. Rule 4-215. Md. Rule 4-215(a)(4) provides that the court shall conduct an inquiry under section (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if the defendant indicates a desire to waive counsel. Thus, where the trial court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request and does not permit discharge of counsel, under a plain reading of Md. Rule 4-215(e), there is no requirement that the trial court advise the defendant of the right to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In <em>Gonzales, </em>408 Md. at 531-32, 970 A.2d 908, the Court of Appeals analyzed Md. Rule 4-215 and stated as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>582 A.2d 803, 806 (1990) (\u201cAllowing a defendant to specify the reasons for his request is an integral part of the Rule and cannot be dismissed as insignificant.\u201d). Next, the trial court must make a determination about whether the defendant\u2019s desire to discharge counsel is meritorious. <em>Moore v. State, </em>331 Md. 179, 186-87, 626 A.2d 968, 971-72 (1993) (indicating that the record must be sufficient to reflect that the trial court actually considered the merit of the defendant\u2019s explanation for wanting to proceed without counsel); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 679, 687, 747 A.2d 759, 764 (2000) (holding that a judge did not comply with the dictates of Maryland Rule 4-215(e) when the judge did not \u201cask the defendant why he wishfed] to discharge counsel, give careful consideration to the defendant\u2019s explanation, and then rule whether the explanation offered [was] meritorious\u201d). Finally, as we explained in <em>Williams v. State, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Under the Rule, when a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered in his or her case, the court must provide the defendant an opportunity to explain why the defendant wishes to discharge that attorney. <em>Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 273,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Where the trial judge finds a defendant\u2019s reasons to be meritorious, he must grant the request and, if necessary, give the defendant an opportunity to retain new counsel. When a defendant makes an unmeritorious request to discharge counsel, the trial judge may proceed in one of three ways: (1) deny the request and, if the defendant rejects the right to represent himself and instead elects to keep the attorney he has, continue the proceedings; (2) permit the discharge in accordance with the Rule, but require counsel to remain available on a standby basis; (3) grant the request in accordance with the Rule and relieve counsel of any further obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">321 Md. 266, 273, 582 A.2d 803, 806 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Prior to <em>Gonzales, </em>the Court of Appeals explained in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 425, 676 A.2d 513 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">If the reason is meritorious, the court must permit dismissal, continue the case if necessary, and warn the defendant that he or she may be required to proceed pro se if new counsel is not engaged by the next trial date. If the reason for dismissal is not meritorious, however, the court must engage in a third-level inquiry. The court may still permit dismissal of counsel, but only after warning the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the possibility he or she will proceed pro se if substitute counsel is not secured. The court may also reject the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss counsel if the reason is not meritorious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In light of the Court\u2019s comment in <em>Williams, </em>321 Md. at 273, 582 A.2d 803, that, \u201c[w]hen a defendant makes an unmeritorious request to discharge counsel, the trial judge may ... deny the request and, if the defendant rejects the right to represent himself and instead elects to keep the attorney he has, continue the proceedings[,]\u201d <em>Williams </em>merits discussion. In <em>Williams, </em>the Court held that the trial court\u2019s failure to allow the defendant to explain his reasons for seeking to discharge his counsel before denying the request was reversible error. The Court reasoned that the trial court was unable to determine whether the defendant\u2019s reasons for wanting to discharge counsel were meritorious or not because the trial court did not allow the defendant to explain the reasons. The issue before the Court in <em>Williams </em>was whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the defendant to state his reasons for wanting to discharge his attorney was reversible error. The Court\u2019s discussion of the options a trial judge has when a trial judge determines \u2014 based on the defendant\u2019s explanation \u2014 that the defendant\u2019s reasons for seeking to discharge his counsel was unnecessary to the holding, and therefore dicta. We recognize that strict compliance with Md. Rule 4-215 is required; however, no reported Maryland case has directly held that a trial judge must advise a defendant of his right to proceed <em>pro se </em>after finding the defendant\u2019s reasons for discharging his counsel are unmeritorious. We are not convinced on the strength of the language in <em>Williams </em>to read this requirement into Md. Rule 4-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">It is the defendant\u2019s burden to assert the right to proceed <em>pro se.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[W]hen an accused desires to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>himself he must assert that right, and its grant is conditioned upon a valid waiver of the right to assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 266, 523 A.2d 597 (1987) (emphasis added); <em>see also Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 119, 486 A.2d 163 (1985) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court and other courts throughout the nation have thus sought to protect the right to counsel unless the defendant properly asserts his right to represent himself. The assertion of this right is conditioned upon a valid waiver of the right to assistance of counsel.\u201d). As this Court has recognized, there is a \u201cfinely calibrated balance between the conflicting and mutually exclusive right to counsel and right to self-representation.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 242, 934 A.2d 1059 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 Md. 614, 943 A.2d 1245 (2008) (citations omitted). We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Of two mutually exclusive rights, the one that you will retain if you waive nothing is self-evidently the preferred alternative. Every additional requirement imposed by the rules increases the likelihood that the preferred right, that of counsel, will not be lost. By inverse proportion, however, it decreases the likelihood that the non-preferred right of <em>pro se </em>representation will be successfully invoked. Such implementing rules, to be sure, may better <em>protect the defendant, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>but only in the sense that the unspoken premise of the rulemakers is that the best way to protect the defendant is to burden, and thereby to discourage, the option of <em>pro se </em>representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 243, 934 A.2d 1059 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Under Md. Rule 4-215(e), once a trial court determines that a defendant\u2019s reasons for wanting to discharge counsel are unmeritorious and do not permit the discharge, the court may deny the request without affirmatively informing the defendant of the possibility to proceed <em>pro se. </em>In this case, appellant did not seek to proceed <em>pro se </em>or raise the issue of self-representation in any manner. In fact, as the State notes, in the written request filed prior to trial, appellant ends by asking \u201cthe court to find me Legal Counsel.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Appellant contends the circuit court erred in refusing to give a missing witness instruction as to the woman involved failing to testify at trial. Prior to appellant testifying, defense counsel requested the missing witness instruction and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">THE COURT: I will not give the instruction with respect to the victim. The instruction calls for someone who is peculiarly within the power of a party to produce and there\u2019s nothing that makes the victim peculiar within the power of the State to produce in the case. They obviously \u2014 you\u2019ve gotten testimony that they identified her. They could have summoned her. They could have asked for body attachment and, so on, but that\u2019s true of any witness. This is not a chemist. This is not some particular witness who is employed by the State. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to give that instruction with respect to the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Defense counsel asked to present further argument and the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It is a witness that the State\u2019s witnesses identified. It was through the State\u2019s witnesses that that witness\u2019s information was provided and outside of her name, there\u2019s no other information provided except for her name. There\u2019s no date of birth and it\u2019s not even clear that the address that\u2019s provided is the correct address. So the officers or the individuals who identified the witness, they were in the best position to garner that information at the time; and whether the information was good information with regard to producing this witness for court. It\u2019s still in question because the witness is (indiscernible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">THE COURT: You have the exact same tools as the State has to produce a civilian witness. There\u2019s nothing that makes that witness peculiar within the power of the State, that the instruction allows the jury to draw an adverse inference against the State if they find that the witness \u2014 if there\u2019s no explanation for the witness\u2019s absence. It\u2019s not an appropriate instruction under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATn\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there is lapse. There is no explanation for the witness\u2019s absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t even trigger unless the witness is peculiarly within the power of the State to produce. This was someone who was in custody and the State had failed to transport them. If this was someone who was employed by the State or the State otherwise had a particular power to produce her but that\u2019s not the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019ll just note for the record my exception to that instruction not being given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2r\">THE COURT: All right. I note that the State asked for the same instruction. Does the State want it given in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: No, Your Honor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in refusing to give the missing witness instruction regarding the witness because the identity of the witness was in the State\u2019s control, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>and therefore, the State was in the best position to secure the witness\u2019s presence at trial. Conversely, the State responds that the trial judge \u201cproperly denied the request to give the missing witness instruction on the ground that the record did not show that the -witness was peculiarly available to the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The missing witness instruction is set forth in Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction Criminal (\u201cMPJI-CR\u201d) 3:29 (2007) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">You have heard testimony about _, who was not called as a witness in this case. If a -witness could have given important testimony on an issue in this case and if the witness was peculiarly within the power of the [State] [defendant] to produce, but was not called as a witness by the [State] [defendant] and the absence of that witness was not sufficiently accounted for or explained, then you may decide that the testimony of that witness would have been unfavorable to the [State] [defendant],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of a requested jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Janey v. State, </em>166 Md.App. 645, 666, 891 A.2d 355, <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 725, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006). This Court has explained: \u201cThere is an abuse of discretion Vhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peterson v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 563, 584, 10 A.3d 838 (2010) (quoting <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 604, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000) (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110 (1997))).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">In <em>Woodland v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 503, 510, 490 A.2d 286, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 96, 497 A.2d 819 (1985), we held that \u201cthe missing witness rule applies where (1) there is a witness, (2) who is peculiarly available to one side and not the other, (3) whose testimony is important and non-cumulative and will elucidate the transaction, and (4) who is not called to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A \u201crelationship\u201d between a party and a witness in the missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>witness instruction context generally refers to a \u201cfamily relationship, an employer-employee relationship, and, sometimes, a professional relationship.\u201d <em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 134-35, 333 A.2d 45 (1975) (quoting Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 45 (rev. 6th ed. P. Herrick 1973)). \u201cUnderlying this principle is the realization that despite a party\u2019s theoretical ability to subpoena the witness\u2019s testimony, there is a practical concern that certain relationships may engender a very strong bias which would undermine the utility of that witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 50, 633 A.2d 867 (1993). As such, the rule looks toward addressing the bias engendered by feelings of love, friendship, or loyalty. In this case, there was no relationship between the witness and the State. A police officer took the witness\u2019s name and had no further contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Here, there is no indication that the witness was peculiarly available to the State and not to the defense. In support of the argument that the witness was peculiarly available to the State, appellant relies on the following testimony during the cross-examination of Detective Merino:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, at some point as part of this incident, the name of this female was obtained. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>[DETECTIVE MERINO]: It was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Her address was obtained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[DETECTIVE MERINO]: I believe so, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">This record, however, does not support appellant\u2019s contention that the witness was solely available to be called by the State. The witness\u2019s name appears in the Statement of Charges and the Statement of Probable Cause which were provided to the defense during discovery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As such, the identity of the witness was equally available to appellant and the State; therefore, the missing witness instruction was not warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The record is devoid of any attempt by appellant to seek or secure the victim\u2019s presence as a witness. This Court has previously concluded that a witness was not peculiarly available to the State where there was no showing that the defendant had exhausted the avenues available to produce the witness. <em>Bing Fa Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 112, 403 A.2d 819 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1076, 100 S.Ct. 1024, 62 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980). Appellant, in this case, has not identified any efforts or attempts on his part to bring the woman identified in the charging document as a witness. Indeed, the trial court observed that appellant had the \u201cexact same tools as the State ha[d] to produce a civilian witness.\u201d Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s decision not to give the missing witness instruction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

In <em>Cost, </em>417 Md. at 380-81, 10 A.3d 184, the Court of Appeals held that a missing evidence instruction should have been given where evidence, which \"was highly relevant\u201d to the defendant\u2019s case, was \"destroyed while in State custody.\u201d In <em>Cost, </em>the defendant, an inmate at a State correctional facility, was convicted of reckless endangerment for allegedly stabbing another inmate. 417 Md. at 365, 368, 10 A.3d 184.
