Intended to provide a remedy for injured railroad workers, the FELA \u201chovers ambivalently between workers\u2019 compensation law and the common law of negligence. It is neither, but it partakes of characteristics of both.\u201d <em>CSX v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 129, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004). This case calls us to consider the roles that two basic concepts of negligence law, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and proximate cause, play in FELA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Donzel M. Page filed suit against his former employer, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\u201cAmtrak\u201d), seeking recompense for a work-related injury. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted summary judgment in Amtrak\u2019s favor. Page has appealed and presents two issues, which we have consolidated and reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">In an action based upon the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Amtrak on the basis that Page presented no evidence that Amtrak breached any duty to him and that any negligence on Amtrak\u2019s part was not the proximate cause of his injuries?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>We conclude that Page presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, from which a fact-finder could reasonably infer that Amtrak was negligent and that physical injury was a foreseeable result of that negligence. While the relationship between Amtrak\u2019s negligence and Page\u2019s injuries may not satisfy the common law requirements for proximate causation, a plaintiff in a FELA action need only prove that \u201c \u2018employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury....\u2019\u201d <em>CSX Transp. v. McBride, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2630, 2638 n. 2, 180 L.Ed.2d 637 (2011) (quoting <em>Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957)). Page has met this unexacting threshold. Therefore, we will vacate the judgment entered on Amtrak\u2019s behalf and remand this case to the circuit court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We set out the facts in the light most favorable to Page, as the non-moving party to the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Reiter v. Pneumo Abex, </em>417 Md. 57, 67, 8 A.3d 725 (2010). We first look to Page\u2019s deposition which provides the following information.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">On February 22, 2007, Page, a police officer employed by Amtrak, was on duty near the information desk in Pennsylvania Station in Baltimore, Maryland. At approximately 5:00 pm, Page was approached by an Amtrak passenger who informed Page that a baggage cart was lying on a track adjacent to a passenger platform on the lower level of the terminal. Page\u2019s duties included removing obstructions from the railroad tracks within the terminal. Page, accompanied by Charles Harris, an Amtrak customer service employee (a \u201cRed Cap\u201d), went to the passenger platform to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">At about the time they reached the lower level of the terminal, Page and Harris learned that there was an inbound train scheduled to arrive on the track that was blocked by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>baggage cart. Harris made an emergency call on his radio to the train\u2019s engineer and the train stopped approximately 60 feet from the cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">When Page arrived on the passenger platform, he observed that the train was unable to unload its passengers because of the track blockage. Page walked to the point of the platform closest to the cart, sat down on its edge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and dropped onto the ballast adjacent to the track. In his deposition, he estimated that his feet were \u201cbetween four and five feet\u201d above the ballast when he dropped down. Page landed \u201ca little off balance\u201d and felt pain in his left hip. He pushed the cart off the tracks and walked back along the tracks to a set of stairs leading up to the platform. The train then pulled into position and disembarked its passengers onto the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The layout of the platform was such that there were stairs at one end of the platform and a ramp at the other to provide access to the track. The stairs and the ramp were each about 100 yards from Page\u2019s location when he dropped off the platform. Page testified that he did not take the time to use the stairs or the ramp because he \u201cwanted to get the patrons off the train in a timely fashion\u201d to avoid a train delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At the end of his shift, Page filed a report about the incident. At that time, he declined medical attention. By the following day, Page\u2019s symptoms had worsened and he sought medical treatment. His physical condition continued to deteriorate and, as a result of the injury, Page eventually became unable to perform his duties for Amtrak.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">When deposed, Harris, the Red Cap, stated that he had been employed as a Red Cap by Amtrak for 26 years. When describing the carts, Harris explained that they are \u201ctypical push cart[s]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that have signs on them indicating that they are for Amtrak employee use only. Most of the carts have a cable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that Amtrak employees could wrap around fixed structures on the platform or within the building to keep the public from using the carts. Harris stated that the use of, and responsibility for, the baggage carts is restricted to Amtrak employees. Typically the carts are used by Red Caps or baggage handlers to assist in luggage handling. However, all Amtrak employees are permitted to use the carts. While there is no formal or uniform procedure for monitoring the carts, Amtrak\u2019s custom is that the employee using the cart is responsible for monitoring the cart. It is against Amtrak practice and policy to leave carts unattended on passenger platforms. Harris stated that, while Amtrak does not permit non-employees to use baggage carts, \u201cpeople being people, a lot [of] time[ ] they do take carts and they do use carts.\u201d Harris testified that carts end up on the tracks at Pennsylvania Station \u201cmaybe three to four times a year.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On October 10, 2008, Page filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Amtrak under the provisions of the FELA. In his complaint, Page asserted that Amtrak negligently failed to provide a reasonably safe workplace and that this negligence was a cause of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">After the conclusion of written discovery and depositions, Amtrak filed a motion for summary judgment based on two grounds. First, Amtrak argued that, in order to recover, a \u201cFELA plaintiff is required to prove traditional common law elements of negligence: breach, foreseeability, and causation.\u201d Amtrak asserted that, because Page had no direct evidence as to how the baggage cart happened upon the track, Page had no evidence of Amtrak\u2019s breach of duty. In addition, Amtrak argued that, because \u201cPage\u2019s decision to jump to the tracks clearly constitutes contribution or voluntary activity ... the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is not applicable in this case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Second, Amtrak contended that \u201cPage\u2019s careless choice to jump to the tracks, instead of using a safe route, was the sole proximate cause of his injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In response, Page argued that, under the FELA, Amtrak was liable if any negligence on its part played any role in producing his injuries. The FELA requires that employers take reasonable precautions to provide employees with a safe workplace. According to Page, Amtrak\u2019s failure to take reasonable precautions to manage the baggage carts resulted in a baggage cart lying on a live track, thereby creating an unsafe workplace. Because Page injured himself while performing his duty of retrieving the cart from the track, Amtrak\u2019s negligence played some role in causing his injuries. Page further notes that his alleged contributory negligence, if any, is not a bar to recovery under the FELA. Page concluded that, as soon as he presented evidence of Amtrak\u2019s duty, Amtrak\u2019s breach of that duty and his own resulting injuries, a jury issue was created under the FELA and summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">After a hearing on September 23, 2009, the circuit court granted Amtrak\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Amtrak. The court stated in a written order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">There is no evidence that negligence by the Defendant was a cause of Plaintiffs injuries because there is no evidence that Defendant breached any duty or that any breach was the cause of Plaintiffs injuries. The doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not apply because Plaintiff was not without fault in causing his injuries. There is no evidence that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonably safe place to work or that his fellow employees were negligent in that they failed to adequately secure the baggage cart which Plaintiff was attempting to retrieve. There is no evidence that an appearance of the baggage cart on the tracks was the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiffs injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>I. The FELA</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In order to put the parties\u2019 contentions into proper focus, we will briefly review the pertinent provisions of the FELA. This is well-ploughed ground in Maryland because the FELA and related statutes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have been the subject of several recent decisions by this Court and the Court of Appeals. <em>See Collins v. Nat'l R.R., </em>417 Md. 217, 230-41, 9 A.3d 56 (2010), <em>cert dismissed, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1811, 179 L.Ed.2d 673 (2011); <em>Haischer, </em>381 Md. at 125-28, 848 A.2d 620 (interpreting the Federal Boiler Inspection Act); <em>CSX v. Bickerstaff, </em>187 Md.App. 187, 206-08, 978 A.2d 760 (2009); <em>Norfolk S. Railway Corp. v. Tiller, </em>179 Md.App. 318, 322-26, 944 A.2d 1272 (2008); and <em>CSX v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 128-46, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">As Judge Moylan explained for this Court in <em>Miller, </em>the FELA, originally enacted in 1906, is a remedial statute intended to modify common law rules of negligence in actions brought by employees of railroads to recover for injuries suffered in the course of their employment. 159 Md.App. at 129-30, 858 A.2d 1025. The Act, and the cases interpreting it, have created a substantive federal body of law pertaining to the allocation of risk between a railroad and its employees. <em>Collins, </em>417 Md. at 231 n. 10, 9 A.3d 56 (\u201c \u2018As a general matter, FELA cases adjudicated in state court are subject to state procedural rules, but the substantive law governing them is federal.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>St. Louis </em>S.W. <em>Ry. Co. v. Dickerson, </em>470 U.S. 409, 411, 105 S.Ct. 1347, 84 L.Ed.2d 303 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The purpose of the statute was, in Justice Douglas\u2019s striking phrase, \u201cto put on the railroad industry some of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and lives which it consumed in its operations.\u201d <em>Wilkerson v. McCarthy, </em>336 U.S. 53, 68, 69 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>413, 93 L.Ed. 497 (1949) (concurring opinion). To that end, the FELA, an initially enacted and by subsequent amendment, abolished certain common law defenses otherwise available to employers, such as assumption of risk,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the fellow servant doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and contributory negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 133-36, 858 A.2d 1025. What was less clear, at least initially, was the degree to which the Act modified common law rules of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In a common law negligence action, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s breach of duty was both a factual and a legally cognizable (or proximate)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> cause of the plaintiffs injury. In contrast, the FELA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several States ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce ... for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>injury or death <em>resulting in whole or in part </em>from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence in its ... track, roadbed ... or other equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Earlier Supreme Court decisions construing \u00a7 51 of the FELA were not consistent as to whether proof of proximate cause was necessary for a plaintiffs recovery. <em>Compare O\u2019Donnell v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; E. Ry. Co., </em>338 U.S. 384, 394, 70 S.Ct. 200, 94 L.Ed. 187 (1949) (\u201c[P]laintiff was entitled to a[n] . .. instruction ... which rendered defendant liable for injuries proximately resulting therefrom.\u201d) (applying Federal Safety Appliance Act), <em>and Davis v. Wolfe, </em>263 U.S. 239, 243, 44 S.Ct. 64, 68 L.Ed. 284 (1923) (\u201c[A]n employee cannot recover ... if the [employer\u2019s] failure ... is not a proximate cause of the accident ....\u201d) (applying Federal Safety Appliance Act), <em>with Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Huxoll, </em>245 U.S. 535, 537, 38 S.Ct. 187, 62 L.Ed. 455 (1918) (Instruction that railroad was liable if negligence contributed \u201c \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 \u201d to accident was consistent with the FELA.). The Supreme Court clearly set forth the appropriate causation standard for FELA cases in <em>Coray v. S. Pac. Co., </em>335 U.S. 520, 523-24, 69 S.Ct. 275, 93 L.Ed. 208 (1949) and <em>Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In <em>Coray, </em>the plaintiff brought an action under the FELA and the Federal Safety Appliance Act, which provided that certain safety violations by railroads constituted negligence <em>per se. </em>The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the railroad, the Utah Supreme Court affirmed the trial court and the Supreme Court reversed. The Utah Supreme Court held that the railroad\u2019s negligence, which caused the brakes to malfunction in a train, was not the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death (which resulted when a motorized rail car he was operating collided with the train). In commenting on this analysis, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The Utah Supreme Court ---- discussed distinctions between \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the legal sense, deemed a sufficient cause to impose liability, and \u201ccause\u201d in the \u201cphilosophic sense,\u201d deemed insufficient to impose liability. It considered the stopping of this train to have been a cause of decedent\u2019s death in the \u201cphilosophic sense\u201d in that the stopping created \u201ca condition upon which the negligence of plaintiffs\u2019 intestate operated,\u201d one perhaps of many causes \u201cso insignificant that no ordinary mind would think of them as causes.\u201d The court added, however, that the stopping [of the first train] \u201cwas not the legal cause of the [collision] .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\"><em>The language selected by Congress to fix liability in cases of this kind is simple and direct. Consideration of its meaning by the introduction of dialectical subtleties can serve no useful interpretative purpose. The statute declares that railroads shall be responsible for their employees\u2019 deaths \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d from defective appliances </em>such as were here maintained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>Coray, </em>335 U.S. at 523-24, 69 S.Ct. 275 (emphasis added). <em>Coray </em>involved both the Federal Safety Appliance Act and the FELA. <em>Rogers </em>expanded <em>Coray\u2019s </em>holding to claims based solely on the FELA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In <em>Rogers, </em>the employee worked on a \u201csection gang\u201d maintaining track beds. His assignment on the day in question was setting fire to weeds growing close to the tracks. A draft created by a passing train caused the smoldering weeds to flare up. Retreating from the fire, Rogers stepped backwards and was injured when he slipped and fell from a walkway running alongside the track. He contended that the railroad negligently failed to maintain safe footing for line maintenance workers. <em>Rogers, </em>352 U.S. at 502-03, 77 S.Ct. 443. A jury verdict in his favor was reversed by the Missouri Supreme Court on the basis that the evidence did not support the award. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 77 S.Ct. 443. We are concerned with an alternative ground for the Missouri court\u2019s holding, which was that Roger\u2019s own conduct was \u201cat least as probable a cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>his mishap as any negligence\u201d of the railroad. <em>Id. </em>at 505, 77 S.Ct. 443. The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">The [Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s] opinion may also be read as basing the reversal on another ground, namely, that it appeared to the court that the petitioner\u2019s conduct was at least as probable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the respondent, and that in such case there was no case for the jury.... The Missouri court\u2019s opinion implies its view that this is the governing standard by saying that the proofs must show that \u201cthe injury would not have occurred but for the negligence\u201d of his employer, and that \u201cthe test of whether there is causal connection is that, absent the negligent act the injury would not have occurred.\u201d1 J <em>That is language of proximate causation which makes a jury question dependent upon whether the jury may find that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\"><em>Under this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.n </em>It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, including the employee\u2019s contributory negligence.1 J Judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played <em>any </em>part at all in the injury or death.[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 77 S.Ct. 443 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Supreme Court reaffirmed the appropriate standard for causation in FELA actions in <em>McBride. </em>In doing so, it held that the <em>Coray/Rogers </em>standard continues to displace common law rules of proximate causation in FELA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">McBride, a locomotive engineer, filed a FELA action to recover for a work-related injury. At trial, the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>requested a jury instruction that, in order to prevail, the plaintiff was required to show that the employer\u2019s negligence was \u201ca proximate cause of the injury,\u201d as well as another instruction explaining the concept of proximate cause. 131 S.Ct. at 2635. Instead, the trial court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u201cDefendant \u2018caused or contributed to\u2019 Plaintiffs injury if Defendant\u2019s negligence played a part \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Supreme Court granted the railroad\u2019s petition for cer-tiorari to consider whether the causation instruction was proper in FELA cases. <em>Id. </em>at 2636. Before the Court, CSX raised two principle contentions. First, it argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">the <em>Rogers </em>\u201cany part\u201d test displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contributory negligence or other \u201cmultiple causes.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>\u201cdid not address the requisite directness of a cause,\u201d hence that question continues to be governed by restrictive common-law formulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2637 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Writing for the majority, Justice Ginsburg, joined by four other justices, rejected this argument, noting that <em>\u201cRogers </em>instructed that \u2018the test of a jury case [under FELA] is simply whether ... employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2638 n. 2. (quoting <em>Rogers, </em>352 U.S. at 506, 77 S.Ct. 443). In addition, Justice Ginsburg stated that <em>\u201cRogers </em>is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of the FELA causation standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority\u2019s analysis explicitly confirmed that considerations of traditional, common law rules of proximate causation play no role in assessing liability under the FELA. <em>Id. </em>at 2639-2640.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">As a second ground for reversal, CSX contended that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>proximate causation ... is a concept fundamental to actions sounding in negligence. The <em>Rogers </em>\u201cany part\u201d instruction opens the door to unlimited liability, ... inviting juries to impose liability on the basis of \u201cbut for\u201d causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2641.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In response to this concern, Justice Ginsburg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">\u201c[Rjeasonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d... is indeed \u201can essential ingredient of [FELA] <em>negligence.\u201d ... </em>Thus, \u201c[i]f a person has no reasonable ground to anticipate that a particular condition ... would or might result in a mishap and injury, then the party is not required to do anything to correct [the] condition.\u201d11 If negligence is proved, however, and is shown to have <em>\u201cplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the </em>injury,\u201dn then the carrier is answerable in damages even if \u201cthe extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred\u201d was not \u201c[p]robable\u201d or \u201cforeseeable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUM\">Properly instructed on negligence and causation, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their \u201ccommon sense\u201d in reviewing the evidence ..., juries would have no warrant to award damages in far out \u201cbut for\u201d scenarios.

We will now turn to the merits of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In order to prevail in a FELA claim, a plaintiff must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">First, that the defendant is a railroad engaged in interstate commerce;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Second, that the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant in interstate commerce, acting in the course of his employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">Third, that the defendant or one of its employees or agents was negligent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Fourth, that such negligence played a part, no matter how slight, in bringing about an injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">5 L. Sand <em>et al, </em>Modern Federal Jury Instructions-Civil P 89.02, pp. 89-38, 89-40 (2010); <em>see also McBride, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2639-40 (similar instructions approved by every federal circuit that reviews FELA judgments); <em>Collins, </em>417 Md. at 251, 9 A.3d 56 (\u201cA prima facie case of negligence under FELA is based on the common law elements in accordance with federal law: duty, breach, foreseeability, and causation.1-]C ]\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The circuit court granted summary judgment in Amtrak\u2019s favor because it concluded that Page failed to present sufficient evidence to create a jury issue on the third and fourth elements of the cause of action. The circuit court\u2019s <em>ratio decidendi </em>was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">1. Page was not able to show negligence on Amtrak\u2019s part because he had no direct evidence as to how the cart ended up on the tracks and, because he was at fault, a fact-finder would be barred from inferring negligence on Amtrak\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">2. Even assuming that Amtrak was negligent, the \u201cappearance of a baggage cart on the tracks was [not] the actual and proximate cause of [Page\u2019s] injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">We will discuss each ground in turn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Page contends that Amtrak had a duty to provide a safe workplace and that it breached its duty by failing to properly control its baggage carts. Conceding that he does not know how the baggage cart ended up on the track, Page asserts that a jury could reasonably infer from the circumstances that either an Amtrak employee negligently (i) allowed the cart to roll from the platform onto the tracks or (ii) failed to maintain supervision and control over the cart, thus permitting a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>employee to do the same. In other words, his position is that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>would permit the jury to conclude that the baggage cart would not have ended up on the track without some fault on Amtrak\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Amtrak presents various theories as to why summary judgment was appropriate, all of which revolve around the following themes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">1. Amtrak did not breach a duty to Page because it took reasonable steps to secure the baggage carts and, in any event, Page\u2019s injuries were not a foreseeable consequence of any breach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">2. Page\u2019s reliance on circumstantial evidence to prove a breach of duty was unwarranted because the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is inapplicable in this case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">3. Amtrak\u2019s negligence, if any, was not the proximate cause of Page\u2019s injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">We will address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\"><em>A. The Existence of Duty </em>\u2014 Foreseeability</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">A railroad has a \u201ca non-delegable duty to provide [employees] with a safe place to work.\u201d <em>Brown v. CSX Transp., </em>18 F.3d 245, 249 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Shenker v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., </em>374 U.S. 1, 7, 83 S.Ct. 1667, 10 L.Ed.2d 709 (1963); <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v. Thomas, </em>198 F.2d 783, 786 (4th Cir.1952)). Amtrak contends that it did not breach this duty because it took reasonable precautions to protect employees from harm and that it \u201cmay not be held liable if it had no reasonable way of knowing that the hazard which caused Page\u2019s injury existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The evidence in the record as to the steps Amtrak took to secure carts comes from the deposition testimony of Page and Harris. From it, one can reasonably infer that Amtrak recognized that unattended baggage carts were potentially problematic because: (1) Amtrak provided locking cables on some, but not all, of the carts so that Amtrak employees could secure them when they were not using them; (2) Amtrak had a policy, even if informally promulgated, prohibiting employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>from leaving the carts unattended; and (3) each employee using a cart was responsible for monitoring the cart to prevent unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">If the specific cart in question lacked a securing cable, Amtrak is responsible for the failure to provide it. If that cart had a cable but was not locked through the oversight of an Amtrak employee, Amtrak is nonetheless responsible, as the fellow servant doctrine is not a defense in FELA actions. <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 560 n. 2, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 129 L.Ed.2d 427 (1994); <em>Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 137, 858 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">However, a breach of duty, by itself, is insufficient to establish negligence. <em>McBride </em>reminds us that a plaintiff must also establish that the harm to a person was a foreseeable consequence of the breach. \u201cIf a person has no reasonable ground to anticipate that a particular condition ... would or might result in a mishap and injury, then the party is not required to do anything to correct [the] condition.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2643 (quoting <em>Gallick, </em>372 U.S. at 118, 83 S.Ct. 659). As Judge Moylan explained for this Court in <em>Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201c[fjoreseeability does not require the employer to have anticipated the plaintiffs injury in the precise manner in which it occurred. It is sufficient if the employer could reasonably foresee that <em>an </em>injury might occur. In a close case, the FELA action should be allowed to proceed to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">159 Md.App. at 221, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Elston v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>74 P.3d 478, 482 (Colo.App.2003) (emphasis in original)); <em>Green v. River Terminal Ry. Co., </em>763 F.2d 805, 808 (6th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe test of foreseeability does not require that the negligent person should have been able to foresee the injury in the precise form in which it in fact occurred. Rather, it is sufficient if the negligent person might reasonably have foreseen that an injury might occur.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The record, taken in the light most favorable to Page, establishes that unauthorized persons used baggage carts at Pennsylvania Station on multiple occasions and that unattend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ed carts wound up on tracks at the station three or four times a year. From this evidence, a fact finder could infer that Amtrak should have foreseen the possibility of harm, either by a cart\u2019s collision with a person, injuries caused when a train stopped unexpectedly to avoid a cart or, as here, when an employee was injured in the course of removing the cart from the track. Amtrak need not have foreseen Page\u2019s specific injury. It was enough that Amtrak reasonably should have foreseen that an injury to a person could have resulted from the unattended carts. <em>See Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 221, 858 A.2d 1025.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>B. Evidence of Breach of Duty </em>\u2014 Res <em>Ipsa Loquitur</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Amtrak asserts that Page\u2019s own conduct was the sole cause of his injury and that, because there was direct evidence, in the form of Page\u2019s own testimony, as to how he was injured, Page\u2019s reliance on circumstantial evidence to show a breach of duty was unwarranted and the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">As Judge James Eyler recently explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Normally, a plaintiff must provide evidence of a defendant\u2019s specific conduct, which can be by direct or circumstantial evidence, or both. <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>is a rule of circumstantial evidence and an exception to the above requirement. When applicable, it permits an inference of actionable negligence in some unspecified way based on circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>evidence of events, even though the plaintiff was unable to prove a specific act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Romero v.

Dobbs, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 154 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">At common law, the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cwhen a thing which causes injury, without fault of the injured person, is shown to be under the exclusive control of the defendant, and the injury is such as in the ordinary course of things does not occur if the one having such control uses proper care, <em>[res ipsa loquitur </em>] affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of an explanation, that the injury arose from the defendant\u2019s want of care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\"><em>Jesionowski v. Boston &amp; Maine R.R., </em>329 U.S. 452, 456, 67 S.Ct. 401, 91 L.Ed. 416 (1947) (quoting <em>San Juan Light &amp; Transit Co. v. Requena, </em>224 U.S. 89, 98-99, 32 S.Ct. 399, 56 L.Ed. 680 (1912)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em>Jesionowski </em>is the landmark Supreme Court decision regarding the proper application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in FELA claims. The case involved a claim arising out of a train derailment in which the employee was killed. The derailment was caused either by the employee\u2019s failure to throw a manually operated rail switch at the correct time or by the mechanical failure of a nearby switch. After the accident, both switches were found to be in working order. There was no direct evidence as to the specific cause but some circumstantial evidence suggested that the employee had been negligent. <em>Jesionowski, </em>329 U.S. at 453-54, 67 S.Ct. 401. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was available to the employee\u2019s estate to prove negligence. The Court held that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">[i?es <em>ipsa loquitur </em>] has rigidly defined prerequisites, one of which is that, to apply it, the defendant must have exclusive control of all the things used in an operation which might probably have caused injury. Here the railroad did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>not have exclusive control of all probable causative factors, since deceased had some immediate control over switching and signaling. \u201cExclusive control\u201d of all probable causative factors, the [lower] court reasoned, means that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>cannot be applied even though those non-exclusively controlled factors are clearly shown to have had no causal connection with the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">We cannot agree. <em>Res ipsa loquitur, </em>thus applied, would bar juries from drawing an inference of negligence on account of unusual accidents in all operations where the injured person had himself participated in the operations, even though it was proved that his operations of the things under his control did not cause the accident. This viewpoint unduly restricts the power of juries to decide questions of fact....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Thus, the question here really is not whether the application of the rule relied on fits squarely into some judicial definition, rigidly construed, but whether the circumstances were such as to justify a finding that this derailment was a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. We hold that they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Derailments are extraordinary, not usual, happenings. When they do occur, a jury may fairly find that they occurred as a result of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 456-57, 67 S.Ct. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>Jesionowski </em>instructs that the pertinent question in FELA cases is not whether the facts \u201cfit[ ] squarely into some judicial definition, rigidly construed, but whether the circumstances were such as to justify a finding ... [of] ... negligence.\u201d Analogizing to <em>Jesionowski, </em>baggage carts do not, as a matter of routine, end up on train tracks. Interpreting the facts most favorably to Page, there is evidence that Amtrak\u2019s policy was that carts were not to be left unattended by the employees, that the railroad provided locking devices for some but not all carts and that, nonetheless, \u201cpeople being people, a lot [of] time[ ] they do take carts and they do use carts.\u201d There was sufficient evidence in the record for a fact finder to infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Amtrak had a duty to properly control the use of the carts and that Amtrak breached that duty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Amtrak claims that Page cannot avail himself of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>because \u201che was not without fault in causing his injuries.\u201d This argument is not persuasive. Even at common law, the possibility of contributory negligence does not necessarily bar recourse to <em>res ipsa loquitur; </em>instead, a plaintiffs \u201cown negligence, along with that of anyone else for whom the defendant is not responsible, [must] be ehminated so as to complete the basis for an inference that the negligence of which the thing speaks is probably that of defendant.\u201d <em>Stos-kin, </em>256 Md. at 713-14, 262 A.2d 48 (quoting 2 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts \u00a7 19.8 (1956) at 1093). Page was not at fault in the chain of events of resulted in the cart\u2019s being pushed onto the track because he had nothing to do with it. Amtrak\u2019s argument focuses on the wrong end of the series of events leading to Page\u2019s injury. In addition, <em>Jesionowski </em>makes it clear that the traditional strictures upon the availability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>do not apply in FELA cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>C. Proximate Cause </em>\u2014 Contributory <em>Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">As an alternative ground for its decision, the circuit court concluded that there was \u201cno evidence that an appearance of the baggage cart on the tracks was the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiffs injuries.\u201d As we have discussed above, the doctrine of proximate causation plays no role in determining whether a railroad is hable for an employee\u2019s injuries. The applicable test in a FELA case is \u201c \u201cwhether ... employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>McBride, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2638 n. 2 (quoting Rogers, 352 U.S. at 506, 77 S.Ct. 443). In this context, two decisions, both of which <em>McBride </em>indicates were correctly decided, are instructive in demonstrating how attenuated the chain of causation may be in a FELA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Richards v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>330 F.3d 428, 431, 437 (6th Cir.2003), a train stopped suddenly because of an apparent malfunctioning of the brake system in a car. Plaintiff, the conductor, was responsible for inspecting each car\u2019s brake system in these situations, a process that required him to crouch down and examine the underside of each car. While so doing, he slipped and injured his back. <em>Id. </em>at 431. The District Court granted the railroad\u2019s motion for summary judgment because \u201cthe subsequent slip and injury bears too tenuous a connection\u201d to the brake failure. <em>Id. </em>The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that \u201c[cjourts ... should focus on whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the [railroad\u2019s negligence] played <em>any </em>part, even the slightest, in bring about the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Schumpert, </em>270 Ga.App. 782, 783-86, 608 S.E.2d 236 (2004), a part of a train car\u2019s coupling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>system called a \u201cknuckle\u201d became accidently disengaged through the negligence of Lusk and fell to the ground. Schumpert was nearby and came over to assist her. Knuckles weigh 90 pounds and replacing one is a job for two persons. Knowing that Lusk was pregnant, Schumpert undertook to perform the task by himself. He picked up the knuckle to return it to its proper place and, in so doing, injured his back. <em>Id. </em>at 783, 608 S.E.2d 236. The Georgia Court of Appeals held that sufficient causation existed because the \u201cnegligence that led to the fallen knuckle can be seen as playing a part, \u2018even the slightest,\u2019 in producing Schumpert\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786, 608 S.E.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In its brief, Amtrak presents a variation of the proximate cause argument made by the employers in <em>Richards </em>and <em>Schumpert. </em>Specifically, Amtrak contends that Page\u2019s \u201cdecision to jump from the platform ... was the sole cause of his injury.\u201d While Amtrak asserts that Page acted unreasonably in dropping drop down from the platform, \u201c \u2018it can nearly always be said that with greater care the employee could have avoided an accident that occurred under circumstances over which he was likely to have greater control than his master.\u2019 \u201d Miller; 159 Md.App. at 136, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting Reginald Parker, <em>FELA or Uniform Compensation for All Workers, </em>18 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 208, 209 (1953)). Contributory negligence may reduce, but does not bar, recovery under the FELA. <em>Norfolk S. Ry. v. Sorrell, </em>549 U.S. 158, 166, 127 S.Ct. 799, 166 L.Ed.2d 638 (2007) (\u201cUnder ...

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the non-movant, we hold that there is evidence from which a fact finder could conclude that Amtrak was negligent and that Amtrak\u2019s negligence played <em>a part </em>in producing Page\u2019s injuries. Whether Page acted unreasonably in dropping down from the platform instead of using the stairs, and the degree to which Page\u2019s fault, if any, contributed to his injuries, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>questions for the jury. \u201cReasonable care and cause and effect are as elusive [in FELA cases] as in other fields.

Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984)____\"What we ... mean by the word \u2018proximate,\u2019 \u201d one noted jurist has explained, is simply this: \"[Bjecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.\u201d <em>Palsgraf v.

Maryland adheres to the concept of proximate cause as an element of a negligence action. <em>See, e.g., Pittway </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>409 Md. 218, 243-44, 973 A.2d 771 (2009); <em>Barclay v.

As examples of what it deemed to be examples of impermissible \"but for\u201d causation, CSX directed the Court to <em>Richards v. Consol.

However, Justice Ginsburg stated that the \"causal link in these cases is hardly farfetched.\u201d <em>McBride </em>at 2641 n. 9. The degree of causation between the railroads\u2019 negligence and the employees\u2019 injuries in <em>Richards </em>and <em>Schumpert </em>is analogous to that in the case before us and we will discuss these cases later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">.

In its brief, Amtrak cites two cases, <em>Brown v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>18 F.3d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1994) and <em>Mullahon v. Pac. R.R., 64 </em>F.3d 1358, 1364 (9th Cir.1995), to support its contention that, to survive summary judgment, Page was required to show more than a \"mere scintilla\u201d of evidence in support of his claim. In <em>Brown, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff must demonstrate \" 'substantial evidence' \u201d of negligence before a FELA case can be submitted to the jury. 18 F.3d at 248. <em>Brown, </em>however, appears to be the exception, not the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In <em>Mullahon, </em>a summary judgment case, the Court stated that \"courts have applied a rule very much like the \u2018scintilla rule\u2019 to FELA cases. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>FELA cases, \u2018it is only necessary that the jury's conclusion be one which is not outside the possibility of reason on the facts and circumstances shown.\u2019 \u201d 64 F.3d at 1363-64 (citations omitted). <em>Mullahon </em>offers no support to Amtrak\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">To the extent that the other Circuits have ruled on the issue, they have not followed <em>Brown. See Aparicio, </em>84 F.3d at 810 (A \"Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act plaintiff [must] present more than a scintilla of evidence in order to create a jury question on the issue of employer liability, but not much more.\u201d); <em>Hines v.

Amtrak also contends that the testimony of Page\u2019s expert witness, Walter Rockey, eliminates the possibility of Amtrak's negligence and that, under the principle of estoppel by admission, Page is bound to maintain the same position. We do not agree with Amtrak\u2019s characterization of Rockey's testimony. Rockey testified that Amtrak employees are responsible for keeping the carts under their control or otherwise secured. While Rockey agreed that Amtrak violated no known regulation by leaving the carts unlocked, thereby suggesting a lack of negligence <em>per se, </em>he at no point eliminated the possibility of negligence in general. In fact, in Rockey\u2019s deposition, Amtrak's own counsel stated \u201cI think [that] we might all agree [the carts] should be locked or secured if they\u2019re going to remain [on the platform level] for any length of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\">. We are not suggesting that <em>Jesionowski </em>is applicable outside of the FELA context. <em>See Stoskin v.

Amtrak\u2019s reliance on <em>Stillman v. Norfolk &amp; </em>W. <em>Ry. Co., </em>811 F.2d 834, 837 (4th Cir.1987) to support its <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>argument is not persuasive. Stillman was operating a forklift when it ceased operating. Stillman then placed himself under the blades and attempted to disengage a chain from them. The blades fell on him, injuring him. <em>Id. </em>at 836. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was inapplicable because Stillman exercised some degree of control over the forklift and its blades. The analysis in <em>Stillman </em>is not consistent with those of other courts which have considered similar questions. <em>See, e.g., Dugas v. Kansas City S. Ry. Lines, </em>473 F.2d 821, 826 (5th Cir.1973) (Freight car door fell on employee, a car-cleaner, when he opened the door to clean the car. \u201d[T]he teachings of <em>Jesionowski </em>mandate the rejection\u201d of the railroad\u2019s argument \"that by opening the boxcar door Dugas was at least in partial control of the instrumentality whence came the injuries, thus defeating the application of the res ipsa doctrine.\u201d); <em>Robinson v.
