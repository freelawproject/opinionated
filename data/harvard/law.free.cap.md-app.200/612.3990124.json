Bryan Miller, appellant, received approval from the Historic Preservation Commission of the City of Annapolis (the \u201cCommission\u201d) to build a porch with wood columns. Instead, he installed fiberglass columns. The Commission then rejected his application for an after-the-fact Certificate of Approval to permit him to keep the fiberglass columns. He appealed to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which affirmed the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">On appeal to this Court, Mr. Miller presents several questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have consolidated and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">1. Did the Commission err in evaluating the Millers\u2019 application pursuant to guidelines for \u201crehabilitation\u201d rather than \u201cnew construction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">2. Did the Commission exceed its authority in enacting a guideline that deems the use of fiberglass columns \u201cnot acceptable?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">STATUTORY BACKGROUND \u2014 PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC SITES</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Maryland General Assembly enacted the Historic Area Zoning Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), Md.Code. (1957, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-8.17, with the stated purpose to \u201cpreserve sites, structures, and districts of historical, archeological, or architectural significance and their appurtenances and environmental settings.\u201d \u00a7 8.01.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 8.03(a)(1) provides for local governments to establish a historic preservation commission, and \u00a7 8.06(a)(1) directs municipalities to \u201cadopt guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction design for designated sites, structures, and districts that are consistent with those generally recognized by the Maryland Historical Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Pursuant to the Act, any individual seeking to \u201cconstruct, alter, reconstruct, move, or demolish a site or structure located within\u201d a designated historic district must apply for permission from the local historic preservation commission in certain circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.05(a). These circumstances involve a project that will result in \u201cany exterior changes ... which would affect the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the site or structure, any portion of which is visible or intended to be visible from a public way.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The Act limits the local Commission\u2019s grant of authority to review \u201conly the exterior features of a structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.07. With respect to the type of review given to proposed plans, the Act provides that a \u201chistoric preservation commission shall strictly judge plans for sites or structures determined by research to be of historic, archeological, or architectural significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.08(a). There is an exception, however. Section 8.08(b)(2) provides that a local commission may not strictly judge plans involving \u201cnew construction,\u201d and must instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>apply a lenient standard, \u201c[ulnless the plans seriously impair the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the surrounding site or structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Pursuant to its authority under the Act, the Annapolis City Council established the Commission and granted it authority to review applications for Certificates of Approval for exterior changes to historic buildings. Annapolis City Code \u00a7 21.08.060 (2009). With respect to the level of the Commission\u2019s review, the guidelines provide, consistent with Art. 66B, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">The Commission shall be strict in its judgment of plans for landmarks, sites or structures determined by research to be of historic, cultural, archaeological, or architectural significance. The Commission shall be lenient in its judgment of plans for landmarks, sites or structures of little historic, cultural, archaeological, or architectural significance, or of plans involving new construction, unless in the Commission\u2019s judgment such plans would seriously impair the historic, cultural, archaeological, or architectural significance of surrounding landmarks, sites or structures. The Commission is not required to limit construction, reconstruction, or alteration to any one period of architectural style.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u00a7 21.56.060(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The Annapolis City Code includes a definition of \u201cnew construction,\u201d as well as other terms relevant to this appeal. These definitions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">\u201cNew construction\u201d shall mean construction which is characterized by the introduction of new elements, sites, buildings, or structures or additions to existing buildings and structures in historic districts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u201cReconstruction\u201d shall mean the process of reproducing, by new construction, the exact form and detail of a vanished structure, or part thereof, as it appeared at a specific period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\u201cRehabilitation\u201d shall mean the act or process of returning a property or building to usable condition through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>repair, alteration, and/or preservation of its features which are significant to its historical, architectural, and cultural values.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21.56.020.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The City Code authorizes the Commission to \u201cadopt and utilize in its review of applications rehabilitation and new construction design guidelines and criteria for designated landmarks, sites, structures, and districts which are consistent with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior\u2019s [Standards for [Rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21.08.060(E)(7). Pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted a document titled: <em>Building In the Fourth Century: Annapolis Historic District Design Manual </em>(1994, revised 2007) (the \u201cDesign Manual\u201d), which sets forth the criteria under which the Commission evaluates applications for Certificates of Approval. Section D, entitled \u201cGuidelines to Preserve and Protect Structures and their Components,\u201d expressly adopts the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation, <em>see </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.3 (1995), \u201c[ejxcept where more stringent requirements are stated in these guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Several guidelines address porches and the materials to be used. Guideline D.23 recognizes the significance of a porch, stating that, \u201c[f]or many vernacular buildings, the front porch is the most important visual and decorative building element in front of a simple building block.\u201d It states: \u201cIt is important that surviving porches retain their original form and materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Addressing the materials to be used to replace or add new elements, guideline D.28 specifically states: \u201cUse of contemporary synthetic or fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>acceptable,\u201d and \u201c[mjaterials that seek to replicate historic elements such as contemporary synthetic fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns should be avoided.\u201d Even for new buildings, guideline D.28c discourages the use of fiberglass, stating: \u201cMaterials that seek to replicate historic elements such as contemporary synthetic fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns should be avoided, as well as the use of aluminum, engineered wood, and or vinyl or plastic siding and trim along with cementitious synthetic wood products.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Mr. and Ms. Miller are the owners of a home at 114 Market Street, located within the City of Annapolis Historic District. When the home originally was constructed between 1903 and 1908, a single-story porch was attached. The porch subsequently was torn down, and it was replaced with a brick stoop. The Millers learned of the existence of the porch through research, and they endeavored to reconstruct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">On August 15, 2005, the Millers submitted to the Commission a request for permission to replace the original front porch. They described the project as follows: \u201cReplace original front porch with wood elements and brick base. Construct Screening wall in driveway area with 4\u2019 brick columns &amp; wrought iron screen.\u201d With respect to the columns on the porch, the Millers represented that the project would include: \u201cTapered wood columns with a 10 inch diameter and a profile to match the old photographs.\u201d The objective was to reconstruct the porch that existed when the property was first built between 1903 and 1908. The Commission approved the application on September 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Construction commenced. In 2006, the builder hired to construct the porch recommended that Mr. Miller use fiber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>glass instead of wood to build the porch columns. Without seeking a new Certificate of Approval from the Commission, Mr. Miller allowed the builder to install fiberglass columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In a letter dated October 15, 2007, the Commission informed Mr. Miller that it had learned that the columns installed on his porch \u201cdeviate[d] from the Certificate of Approval\u201d issued by the Commission. The Commission advised Mr. Miller that his options at that point were either to install the columns the Commission had previously approved or to submit an application for approval of an after-the-fact installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On November 13, 2007, the Millers submitted to the Commission another Application for Certificate of Approval. His description of the project was as follows: \u201cApplication for after-the-fact installation of porch columns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On January 8, 2008, the Commission held a hearing on the Millers\u2019 application. Ms. Miller testified that she and her husband had made a number of improvements to their property at 114 Market Street since 1996, largely in an effort to restore it to its original appearance. The Millers initially intended to build an exact replica of the original porch that was attached to the house when it was first constructed in approximately 1908, using an old photograph they had found. Because of various agency requirements, however, significant modifications were required. The porch was constructed in 2006 and painted in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Mr. Miller explained why fiberglass columns, rather than wood columns, were used in the construction of the porch. He stated that Steve Park, the builder, suggested using fiberglass instead of wood because of \u201cserious maintenance problems caused by wood rotting.\u201d Additionally, the design of the porch had been modified to bring the porch into compliance with requirements of Public Works. In particular, a metal column was being added, which required the builder to split the wood to accommodate the metal column. Fiberglass, in contrast, would accommodate the metal column more easily. Mr. Miller believed that the fiberglass columns would be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the well-maintained wood columns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and would \u201ccause no harm to the historic district.\u201d Accordingly, he decided to approve Mr. Park\u2019s suggestion to use fiberglass instead of wood to build the columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Mr. Miller testified that he did not seek approval from the Commission after deciding to switch the building materials for the columns because the project had already been delayed by Public Works, and he did not want any further delays, particularly because winter was approaching. He further stated that, when the project was in progress, he was unaware that the Commission\u2019s guidelines listed fiberglass as an unacceptable building material for the exterior of buildings in downtown Annapolis. Mr. Miller assured the Commission that, had he been aware of the guidelines, he would not have used fiberglass, and he asserted that he had not, at any time, attempted to conceal that he had not used wood columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Mr. Miller concluded his testimony by explaining why he believed he should not have to replace the fiberglass columns. Initially, he argued that the fiberglass columns were \u201cindistinguishable from well maintained wood columns.\u201d Moreover, he asserted that fiberglass is a \u201ccompatible material for new construction\u201d pursuant to the Commission\u2019s guidelines. Finally, he noted that his neighbors had complimented the columns on several occasions and commented that they looked like they were made from wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Mr. Park, who built the porch, explained why he recommended that Mr. Miller use fiberglass instead of wood for the porch columns. He stated that the base of a wood column is a common place for rotting and attracts insect infestation. Fiberglass columns, by contrast, do not rot or attract insects. Mr. Park opined that \u201cwood columns are inferior\u201d to fiberglass columns, and the quality of wood presently used to build such columns is far below what would have been used when the porch originally was constructed around 1908. He attributed the decline in the quality of wood to changes in practices in the lumber industry, in particular, the use of fast growing species of trees to comply with environmental and endangered species laws. Mr. Park described the fast growing wood as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>far less rot resistant than species that previously were more popular. He also described wood columns as \u201chav[ing] a greater tendency to warp and twist when split and reinstalled,\u201d which would have been problematic because Public Works required a metal beam that would need to be covered by a column. Mr. Park testified that the fiberglass columns were visually identical to wood columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Mr. Tom Davies, the architect who designed the Millers\u2019 porch, similarly explained the problems with rotting that are associated with wood columns. He testified to the problem with using wood columns given the steel column required by Public Works. He explained that exterior wood columns require ventilation to ensure that the wood expands and contracts at an even rate and to prevent moisture build up inside the column, but the required steel column would block the ventilation inside a wood column, preventing the natural expansion and contraction of the wood. Mr. Davies concluded that using fiberglass was the most practical means to accommodate the steel column.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Patricia Blick, Chief of Historic Preservation for the City of Annapolis, suggested that the Commission reject Mr. Miller\u2019s application. Although noting that the \u201cporch project did not remove the historic fabric\u201d because the original porch had been removed, Ms. Blick stressed that the original application that had been approved by the Commission specified that wood columns would be installed, and Commission guideline D.28, regarding the use of contemporary materials, states that the use of fiberglass columns is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Ms. Blick emphasized that, although the Commission had adopted the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation, it had the authority to enact stricter historic preservation standards, provided that they were consistent with the Secretary\u2019s standards. She quoted one of the Secretary\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation, which states: \u201cDeteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>color, texture, and other visual qualities, and where possible, materials.\u201d Ms. Blick described the following four circumstances in which substitute materials may be used: \u201c(1) the unavailability of historic materials; (2) the unavailability of skilled craftsman; (3) inherent flaws in the original materials; and (4) code required changes.\u201d She stated that none of these exceptions applied to Mr. Miller\u2019s application, and she urged the Commission to reject Mr. Miller\u2019s application and require the installation of wood columns.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Richard Bierce, an architectural consultant, submitted a brief comment echoing Ms. Blick\u2019s conclusions. Jennifer Orri-go, representing the Historic Annapolis Foundation, concurred with Ms. Blick\u2019s conclusions, citing concern regarding \u201cthe precedent setting nature of [Mr. Miller\u2019s] application.\u201d She further noted that the Commission\u2019s guidelines specifically identified fiberglass as an unacceptable building material.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Dan Sams, who lived in Mr. Miller\u2019s neighborhood, testified that the fiberglass columns on Mr. Miller\u2019s porch are identical in appearance to wood columns. He stated that, although he \u201cfrequently turn[s] in perceived violations to the [Commission],\u201d he never reported Mr. Miller\u2019s columns because he never perceived a violation of the Commission\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Mr. Sams, an administrator of federal and state tax incentives for the State of Maryland, testified that, had Mr. Miller applied for a tax incentive or an easement for the porch project, he would have applied the standards for reconstruction, not rehabilitation, in reviewing the application because \u201cthis was an entirely new construction and there was no historical material.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He maintained that, \u201c[i]n the absence of ... historic materials ... the objective ... in reconstruction is to recreate the appearance of the historic building for interpretive purposes.\u201d Although Mr. Sams acknowledged that traditional materials are always preferred, he stated that, \u201cin some instances[,] substitute materials may be used if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>are able to convey the same visual appearance.\u201d Fiberglass columns, he concluded, \u201cconvey the same visual appearance as the smooth wood column.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Commission next heard from Kathleen Davies, who read a letter written to the Commission by Carter Gibson, Mr. Miller\u2019s next-door neighbor. Mr. Gibson\u2019s letter described the fiberglass columns as \u201cvery tasteful, handsome, and very practical,\u201d and he described the porch as \u201ca welcome addition to the neighborhood.\u201d Mr. Davies observed that \u201ca large part of the maintenance on the building[s] in the historic district is the repair and replacement of porch columns,\u201d and he opined that \u201cit is time to allow more modern materials as long as the look and feel of the finished product doesn\u2019t change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Gilbert Renault, a former chairperson of the Commission, challenged Ms. Blick\u2019s conclusion that, by requiring Mr. Miller to install wood columns, the Commission merely would be enforcing its high standards. He explained that it was not possible to \u201cget columns made out of 19th century lumber anymore,\u201d and therefore, he urged the Commission to consider which material gives a better appearance, the lumber currently available, which he characterized as \u201cvastly inferior to 19th century wood,\u201d or fiberglass. Mr. Renault argued that fiberglass gave a better appearance. He further testified that the Millers\u2019 porch project \u201cwas completely new construction,\u201d and that Mr. Miller did his \u201cbest to reproduce everything perfectly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">At the conclusion of testimony, the commissioners shared their views. Chairperson Sharon Kennedy described Mr. Miller\u2019s presentation as \u201cinteresting\u201d but \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d agreeing with Ms. Blick that the appropriate standard of review for the application was the standard of rehabilitation. She stated that the Commission\u2019s decisions were required to be \u201cpredictable, transparent, and consistent.\u201d She expressed the view that approval of fiberglass would run contrary to precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Commissioner Mariah McGunigle spoke next, voicing her opposition to Mr. Miller\u2019s application. She maintained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>good quality wood was still available and that rotting and deterioration could be delayed by inserting a \u201cshort [ ] baluster\u201d beneath the column. She also expressed concern about \u201cfiberglass on a street that has high level pedestrian activity\u201d because pedestrians would be able to touch it as they walked by. Ms. McGunigle stated that \u201chaving something that\u2019s a replaceable material that low to the public eye is concerning for me,\u201d and she opined that Mr. Miller\u2019s application did not meet the Commission\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Kim Finch, another commissioner, stated that she believed Mr. Miller\u2019s porch project to be reconstruction because the original porch had not been in existence for a long time. She stated that the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Reconstruction should apply, and that use of contemporary materials would be appropriate in this case because the project was aimed at reconstructing a historic feature, not preserving a historic feature itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Other commissioners expressed the view that approving Mr. Miller\u2019s application would establish a bad precedent, and it would permit the use of contemporary materials, which \u201cis expressly prohibited in the guidelines.\u201d Commissioner Ginger Doyel questioned whether the fiberglass might be a more appropriate building material than wood to construct porch columns because the 19th century wood was no longer available, but she ultimately opposed Mr. Miller\u2019s application because approving fiberglass columns \u201cwould jeopardize the [CJommission\u2019s need to be predictable, transparent, and consistent in its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Commissioner Shelley Rentsch expressed support for Mr. Miller\u2019s application. Although she agreed that there was quality wood available that could be used on the porch project, she viewed the project as new construction, not rehabilitation, given railing height changes necessitated by the Annapolis City Code. Ms. Rentsch stated that, although a \u201ctrained eye\u201d might, over time, be able to notice that the columns were made of fiberglass and not wood because the fiberglass columns would age more slowly, she concluded that the porch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201ccontributed] to the quality of the street scape.\u201d Moreover, she interpreted guideline D.28 to provide some latitude for using substitute materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Before ordering the official vote on Mr. Miller\u2019s application, Chairperson Kennedy noted that, even if the Commission viewed the porch project as new construction, provision D.28c of the Commission\u2019s guidelines states that fiberglass should be avoided in projects seeking to replicate historical elements. She then ordered a vote, and the Commission rejected Mr. Miller\u2019s application by a vote of four-to-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On February 5, 2008, Mr. Miller filed a Notice of Appeal and Petition for Judicial Review of the Commission\u2019s January 8, 2008, decision rejecting his request for approval of \u201cfiberglass columns on his front porch that had been installed instead of wooden columns.\u201d On February 25, 2008, the Commission filed a Notice of Intention to Participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">On June 25, 2008, Mr. Miller filed a Memorandum in Support of Petition for Judicial Review. He argued that the Commission over-stepped its authority by banning fiberglass in the Historic District, that \u201cthe failure of the [Commission] to write an opinion makes the decision impossible to sustain,\u201d and that \u201cit is bad public policy to require inferior materials in the [Historic [District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On July 28, 2008, the Commission filed its answer to Mr. Miller\u2019s Petition for Judicial Review. It defended its decision on three grounds: (1) the decision was \u201cbased on sound preservation principles,\u201d and \u201c[t]he use of non-traditional materials is inconsistent\u201d with those principles; (2) the Commission \u201cacted within the scope of its authority under State and Local law\u201d; and (3) the decision was supported by substantial evidence. The Commission urged that, in the event that its findings were \u201cdeemed insufficient to support its conclusion,\u201d the court should remand, not reverse, its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">On August 8, 2008, Mr. Miller filed his reply memorandum. He maintained that, because the Commission did not issue a written opinion when it rejected his application, the circuit court was left to guess the rationale for the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>decision. He argued that, \u201cwithout findings of fact and conclusions of law it is impossible to discern what preservation principles were applied,\u201d and the court had no basis to review the Commission\u2019s decision. Mr. Miller further argued that the Commission exceeded the scope of its authority by adopting a guideline that deemed fiberglass \u201cunacceptable\u201d because State law empowered it merely to review materials for compatibility. On August 26, 2008, the circuit court remanded the matter to the Commission \u201cfor the issuance of written findings of facts and conclusions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">On October 14, 2008, Commissioners Rentsch and Finch issued a memorandum setting forth the opinion of the minority of the Commissioners regarding the Millers\u2019 application. They stated that standards for \u201creconstruction,\u201d as opposed to \u201crehabilitation,\u201d applied to the new porch addition. They set forth the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Reconstruction, which provide, in pertinent part, that when \u201c[r]econ-structing a non-surviving building ... substitute materials may be used as long as they re-create the historical appearance.\u201d The minority opinion concluded that, because the \u201ccolumns installed do convey the appearance of the historic building and as no part of the original porch was existent at the time of reconstruction, requiring that wood be the only acceptable material goes beyond the most specifically related guidelines\u201d promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior for the reconstruction of historic buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On November 11, 2008, the Commission adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the Millers\u2019 application. The Commission\u2019s findings of fact were as follows: (1) Mr. Miller\u2019s home is a \u201chistoric structure, located in the C-l Conservation Residence District under the Annapolis Zoning Code\u201d; (2) the residence \u201cwas constructed between 1903 and 1908,\u201d and it initially \u201chad a full width covered front porch, which was removed at some later date and replaced by a more contemporary narrow set of brick steps\u201d; (3) evidence of the nature of the original porch came from several sources, including \u201ctwo early photographs, \u2018ghosts\u2019 of pilasters, which were revealed when shingles were removed from the front of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>house,\u201d and a 1908 insurance map, which showed the outline of a one-story porch; (4) Mr. Miller used fiberglass columns in constructing the porch, rather than wood columns \u201cas authorized in the initial Certificate of Approval\u201d; and (5) \u201c[a]s constructed ... the columns look similar to painted wooden columns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Commission then found, \u201cas a matter of law, that the weight of the evidence supports denial of [the Millers\u2019] application.\u201d The Commission discussed its decision to deny the application as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">The applicants did not meet their burden of proof that the use of fiberglass material on columns of a replacement porch is \u201cgenerally compatible\u201d with 114 Market Street and the surrounding area. A decision to approve the use of fiberglass in the case would be contrary to the Annapolis Code, the [Commission] Guidelines, the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, and prevailing preservation practices for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">A. 114 Market Street, constructed between 1903 and 1908, is an existing historic building in the Annapolis Historic District and thus the application for the Certificate of Approval to use fiberglass materials for columns on a replacement porch to that building is subject to strict scrutiny. The project is not \u201cnew construction\u201d within the meaning of the code, which is defined under \u00a7 21.56.020 of the Annapolis Code as \u201cconstruction which is characterized by the introduction of <em>new </em>elements, sites, buildings, or structures or additions to existing buildings and structures in historic districts,\u201d because the project involved the <em>replacement </em>of a once-existing porch. But for the fact that the project involved the replacement of a once-existing porch, the project would not have been approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">B. Pursuant to \u00a7 21.08.060, which governs the authority of the [Commission], and \u00a7 21.56, which governs approval of changes to historic districts, the standard of review is not whether fiberglass is more durable than wood or whether a difference between fiberglass or wood is discernible to the naked eye. Rather, the [Commission] is charged with de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ciding whether the use of fiberglass materials is consistent with its design guidelines and the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standard[s] of Rehabilitation. The [Commission! Guidelines D.28 through D.28c and Rehabilitation Standard No.6 make clear that the use of traditional materials is preferable. They provide that contemporary materials are \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and \u201cshould be avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">C. Departure from these directives is not justified in this case. Specifically, the [Commission] finds unpersuasive the Applicants\u2019 argument and supporting testimony, that fiberglass must be permitted in this case because wood is an inferior product, where good, quality wood is available; methods can be used to prolong the life of wood; the Applicants\u2019 contractor admitted that he had not used wood in 20 years; and only one column requires an interior, steel lolly post. The [Commission] also finds unpersuasive Applicants\u2019 argument and supporting testimony, that fiberglass must be permitted in this case because fiberglass is identical in appearance to wood, where authenticity is at stake, discernable differences between wood and fiberglass will appear over time because materials age differently, and the columns are located in a highly visible location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">D. The [Commission] finds that approval of fiberglass would thwart the [Commission\u2019s] mandate \u201cto preserve and promote the preservation and appreciation of historic sites, structures and districts for the education and welfare of the citizens of the City,\u201d see Annapolis Code \u00a7 21.56.010(C), by undermining its ability to preserve the city\u2019s resources by requiring the use of traditional materials in future cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On December 9, 2008, Mr. Miller again filed an appeal to the circuit court. He argued that the Commission acted beyond the scope of its authority when it \u201cimpose[d] a ban on fiberglass columns on a newly or reconstructed porch,\u201d and he asserted that the fiberglass \u201ccolumns as installed are compatible and should be approved.\u201d Finally, Mr. Miller argued that \u201cit is unsound policy to mandate inferior materials in the Annapolis Historic District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>On April 17, 2009, the Commission filed its response, explaining that the Millers\u2019 home was \u201ca historic building and thus was subject to strict scrutiny.\u201d It determined that Mr. Miller\u2019s project should be considered a \u201creplacement of a once-existing porch,\u201d governed by rehabilitation standards. Pursuant to the rules on the rehabilitation of buildings with historic significance, \u201ccontemporary material is \u2018not acceptable\u2019 and \u2018should be avoided.\u2019 \u201d Instead, wood, which had been approved in Mr. Miller\u2019s original proposal, would be a more appropriate material. The Commission emphasized that it was entitled \u201cconsiderable deference by a reviewing court\u201d because of the \u201cspecialized nature\u201d of its work, and it asserted that it acted well within the scope of its authority. The Commission denied banning any materials from the Annapolis Historic District, and it dismissed Mr. Miller\u2019s assertion that fiberglass was compatible with other construction in the Annapolis Historic District as baseless and unsupported by law or credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">On February 17, 2010, the circuit court heard argument on Mr. Miller\u2019s appeal. Counsel for Mr. Miller argued that the porch project was new construction, and the Commission should have reviewed Mr. Miller\u2019s application for compatibility, a more lenient standard than the Commission applied when it utilized the strict standard of review intended for rehabilitation. She further argued that the Commission\u2019s action indicated that it had banned fiberglass, which it lacked the authority to do under the enabling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In support of her argument that the porch project represented new construction, counsel argued that the Commission\u2019s rehabilitation guidelines refer to \u201creplacing an element,\u201d but \u201c[a] porch is a structure.\u201d Counsel maintained that the project must be considered new construction because \u201cit cannot be identical to the old porch because ... we do not have the specifications,\u201d and \u201cthe building codes have changed,\u201d preventing the Millers from building an exact replica of the original porch. She concluded by arguing that it was bad policy to require individuals to use \u201cinferior materials particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>larly for new construction because new construction should use the materials that are standard in the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Counsel for the Commission argued that the porch project constituted reconstruction, noting that reconstruction is defined as \u201cthe process of reproducing by new construction the exact form and detail of a vanished structure or part thereof as it appeared at a specific time.\u201d New construction, by contrast, \u201capplies to buildings and structures that are put on existing unapproved lots or additions to existing buildings,\u201d such as an addition to a house. Because the porch was a \u201cvanished structure,\u201d the Commission appropriately determined the porch project to be a reconstruction, and it had the authority to utilize a strict standard of review when considering Mr. Miller\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Counsel argued that the Commission reviewed Mr. Miller\u2019s application adhering to the appropriate legal standards, including those issued by the Secretary of the Interior, which encourages individuals to repair, not replace, deteriorated historic features and to aim to match materials when possible. He further noted that, although the Commission was required to implement guidelines consistent with those issued by the Secretary of the Interior, it was authorized to impose stricter standards. Counsel maintained that the Commission\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and he urged the court to uphold its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Counsel also disputed the assertion that the Commission had banned fiberglass. He argued that, although the Commission\u2019s regulations state that fiberglass should be avoided, the Commission had the authority to permit fiberglass in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The court issued its decision from the bench, affirming the Commission\u2019s ruling denying the application. It found that the Commission did not exceed its statutory authority or employ an unlawful review procedure. Noting that the Commission\u2019s technical expertise was entitled to deference, it stated that the decision was supported by \u201ccompetent material and substantial evidence\u201d and was not \u201carbitrary and capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cious.\u201d The court agreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that wood was available to build the columns, that a skilled craftsman would be able to install the columns, and that the Commission was justified in denying Mr. Miller\u2019s after-the-fact application to install fiberglass columns. The same day, the circuit court issued an order affirming the decision of the Commission denying Mr. Miller\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Appellate review of an administrative agency\u2019s determination \u201cgenerally is a \u2018narrow and highly deferential inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seminary Galleria, LLC v.

He asserts two grounds of error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">First, he argues that the Commission erred in evaluating his application pursuant to guidelines for \u201crehabilitation\u201d rather than \u201cnew construction.\u201d This is significant because, as indicated, the Annapolis City Code provides that the Commission should be \u201cstrict in its judgment of plans\u201d of historic significance, but projects involving \u201cnew construction\u201d should be afforded \u201clenient\u201d review, unless in \u201cthe Commission\u2019s judgment such plans would seriously impair the historic, cultural, archaeological, or architectural significance of surrounding landmarks, sites or structures.\u201d \u00a7 21.56.060(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Mr. Miller characterizes his application as a proposal for reconstruction, and he argues that \u201c[rjeconstruction is part of new construction.\u201d He emphasizes that, when he initially submitted his application to the Commission, \u201cthere was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>porch,\u201d and there was nothing \u201cleft of the original porch to be repaired or to match.\u201d Finally, he posits that, even if the Commission correctly evaluated his application under rehabilitation standards, these standards provide that a replacement feature match original materials \u201cwhere possible,\u201d and, in his case, \u201c[e]xact replication was not possible because of current building code requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Second, Mr. Miller argues that the Commission \u201cdoes not have authority to ban a certain class of materials if they are compatible in a reconstruction.\u201d He contends that, although the Commission \u201cmay review materials for compatibility,\u201d it exceeded its authority \u201cin enacting a guideline that deems the use of fiberglass columns \u2018not acceptable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The Commission argues that it acted \u201cwithin the scope of its authority in declining to approve [Mr.] Miller\u2019s after-the-fact application for a Certificate of Approval to substitute fiberglass for previously approved wood as the material for the columns of his front porch.\u201d It argues that it properly applied strict review of Mr. Miller\u2019s application for two reasons. First, it argues that \u201cnew construction\u201d applies to projects introducing elements or structures that never existed, whereas Mr. Miller\u2019s application sought to replicate a previously existing structure, which fell within the definition of \u201creconstruction.\u201d The Commission states that Mr. Miller described the project in his initial application as a reconstruction, not new construction, noting that he included a picture of the porch originally attached to his home, which he sought to reconstruct \u201cin exact form and with exact material,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>wood. Second, the Commission argues that, even if the porch project was new construction, Mr. Miller\u2019s after-the-fact application was subject to strict review because \u00a7 21.56.060(D) of the Annapolis City Code allows strict review of new construction if the Commission believes it \u201cwould seriously impair the historic, cultural, archeological, or architectural significance of the City of Annapolis Historic District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">With respect to Mr. Miller\u2019s argument that the Commission exceeded its authority in imposing a ban on the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>fiberglass, the Commission denies that a ban exists. It argues that it has authority to determine if fiberglass is compatible with its historic district, and that it is entitled to deference in its finding in this case that it was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">A. Characterization of Porch Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We address first Mr. Miller\u2019s contention that the construction of the porch was \u201cnew construction\u201d pursuant to Annapolis City Code \u00a7 21.56.060. Although the parties agree that the porch project was reconstruction, they disagree whether reconstruction properly can be construed as new construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In determining the appropriate standard of review for the issue whether Mr. Miller\u2019s porch project qualified as new construction, we find instructive the analysis in <em>Singley v. County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County, </em>178 Md.App. 658, 943 A.2d 636, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 114, 956 A.2d 202 (2008). In that case, the Frederick County Board of Appeals granted a special exception to a company to use its property for a commercial greenhouse/nursery. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 943 A.2d 636. This Court discussed the proper standard of review for the Board\u2019s determination whether the property constituted a \u201ccommercial greenhouse and nursery\u201d that would be entitled to a special exception. <em>Id. </em>at 674-76, 943 A.2d 636. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">Statutory construction is an issue of law. <em>Del Marr v. Montgomery County, </em>397 Md. 308, 315 [916 A.2d 1002] (2007). When interpreting the meaning of part of a county or local zoning code, we attempt to ascertain the intention of the drafters from the plain meaning of the words of the ordinance and we apply the canons of statutory construction when necessary to elucidate the meaning of the language. The Court of Appeals made clear in <em>Marzullo [v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169 (2001)] that, \u201cwith regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d [ ] (citing <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-97 [684 A.2d 804] (1996)); <em>see also Angelini v. Harford County, </em>144 Md.App. 369, 373 [798 A.2d 26] (2002). Thus, \u201cthe expertise of [an] agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d <em>Mar-zullo, supra, </em>366 Md. at 172 [783 A.2d 169].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">In the case at bar, the Board\u2019s decision that Sugarloafis proposed use of the Property is a \u201cCommercial Greenhouse and Nursery,\u201d is a mixed question of law and fact that, under the dictates of <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, supra, </em>we review by applying a deferential standard that respects the Board\u2019s expertise in interpreting and applying the Code it administers. Accordingly, the question we must answer on review is whether the qualification vel non of the proposed use of the Property as a \u201cCommercial Greenhouse and Nursery\u201d is fairly debatable, that is, whether a reasoning mind could reasonably find that the proposed use indeed meets that qualification; and if so, whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 943 A.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Similarly, in the present case, the Board\u2019s decision that the porch project was not new construction is a mixed question of law and fact. Pursuant to the analysis set forth in <em>Singley, </em>we will address whether a reasoning mind could find that the construction of the porch was not new construction, and if so, \u201cwhether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the [Commission\u2019s] finding on that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676, 943 A.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We answer those questions in the affirmative. As explained below, whether Mr. Miller\u2019s porch project constitutes new construction is fairly debatable, and the record contains substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">As indicated, the relevant terms at issue here are defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cNew construction\u201d shall mean construction which is characterized by the introduction of new elements, sites, buildings, or structures or additions to existing buildings and structures in historic districts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\u201cReconstruction\u201d shall mean the process of reproducing, by new construction, the exact form and detail of a vanished structure, or part thereof, as it appeared at a specific period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cRehabilitation\u201d shall mean the act or process of returning a property or building to usable condition through repair, alteration, and/or preservation of its features which are significant to its historical, architectural, and cultural values.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Annapolis City Code \u00a7 21.56.020.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">To be sure, as Mr. Miller argues, the definition of reconstruction includes the term new construction. As the Commission notes, however, the definition of \u201cnew construction\u201d in the Annapolis City Code requires \u201cthe introduction of new elements ... or structures or additions to existing buildings.\u201d \u00a7 21.56.020. Here, Mr. Miller was not introducing a new element; he was seeking to replace an original porch that had been removed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, Mr. Miller, in his initial application to build the porch, described the project as reconstruction, not new construction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s decision, that the porch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>project was not new construction and was subject to strict review, was not arbitrary or capricious, and it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">B. Ban on Fiberglass</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Mr. Miller\u2019s second contention is that the Commission acted beyond its authority by imposing a ban on the use of fiberglass in the Annapolis Historic District. He asserts that the \u201cplain language of [Commission Guideline] D.28 is a ban,\u201d but the Commission\u2019s authority is limited to review of materials for compatibility and does not permit a ban of materials. Moreover, he argues that the evidence produced at the January 8, 2008, hearing proved that the fiberglass columns were compatible with the wood columns installed on neighboring porches.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Commission argues that \u201c[t]here is no ban on the use of fiberglass.\u201d It notes that Mr. Miller never argued at the January 8, 2008, hearing that the Commission had improperly banned the use of fiberglass, and \u201c[t]he word \u2018ban\u2019 was never used\u201d in the deliberations of the Commission during or after the hearing. The Commission maintains that it has \u201ca limited degree of flexibility to allow substitute materials for historic materials,\u201d but it was not appropriate in this case because Mr. Miller\u2019s \u201cporch was on the front facade of [his] house and, therefore, very visible to pedestrian traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Initially, a review of the record confirms the Commission\u2019s assertion that Mr. Miller did not argue before the Commission, as he does on appeal, that guideline D.28 was an impermissible ban on the use of fiberglass in a porch column. Accordingly, this contention is not preserved for our review. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Weller, </em>390 Md. 115, 129, 887 A.2d 1042 (2005) (\u201cWe do not allow issues to be raised for the first time in actions for judicial review of administrative agency orders entered in contested cases because to do so would allow the court to resolve matters <em>ab initio </em>that have been committed to the jurisdiction and expertise of the agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>cy.\u201d) (quoting <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Md. 1, 32, 803 A.2d 460 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Even if the issue was preserved, however, Mr. Miller\u2019s contention would be without merit. Three guidelines in the Design Manual address the use of substitute building materials. Guideline D.28 provides: \u201cUse of contemporary synthetic or fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns is not acceptable .... Materials that seek to replicate historic elements such as contemporary synthetic fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns <em>should be avoided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Guideline D.28b states: \u201cMaterials used in building additions should be compatible with materials used on the existing building and should be appropriate to the style and consistent with the character of the original building.\u201d Guideline D.28c provides: \u201cMaterials used on new buildings should be appropriate to the scale and character of surrounding structures. Materials that seek to replicate historic elements such as contemporary synthetic fiberglass moldings, trim, and columns <em>should be avoided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">These guidelines direct that contemporary materials \u201cshould\u201d be avoided. They do not provide that the materials \u201cshall\u201d be avoided. With respect to the difference between the terms \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cshall,\u201d we find the analysis in <em>Caudill v. Judicial Ethics Comm., </em>986 S.W.2d 435, 438 (Ky.1998) (Stephens, C.J., concurring), instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">In comparing the definitions of should versus shall, it becomes evident that their meanings, while similar, are indeed distinct. Should is used to express duty, obligation, necessity, propriety, or expediency. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2104 (3rd ed. unabridged 1993). Shall is used to express a command or exhortation. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary at 2085. <em>Should, while definitely strongly encouraging a particular course of action, is permissive. </em>Shall requires a particular course of action and accordingly, is mandatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">(Emphasis added). <em>Accord Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 63, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (\u201c \u2018When the Legislature commands that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>something be done, using words such as \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d rather than \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould,\u201d the obligation to comply with the statute or rule is mandatory.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 82, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The Commission\u2019s guidelines here, which use the word \u201cshould,\u201d strongly discourage the use of contemporary substitute materials, but it is still permitted. The Commission determined, however, that a deviation from its preference for the use of traditional material would be inappropriate in this case. Specifically, the Commission observed: (1) \u201cgood, quality wood is available\u201d; (2) \u201cmethods can be used to prolong the life of wood\u201d; (3) \u201conly one column requires an interior, steel lolly post\u201d; and (4) \u201cdiscernable differences between wood and fiberglass will appear over time because materials ages differently, and the columns are located in a highly visible location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Thus, even if the issue was preserved, the record does not support Mr. Miller\u2019s contention that the Commission exceeded its authority in imposing a ban on fiberglass. He states no meritorious claim for relief in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The Commission\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Miller\u2019s application for an after-the-fact Certificate of Approval to permit him to keep the fiberglass columns installed on his reconstructed porch was supported by substantial evidence in the record and was not premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision affirming the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\">. The questions presented, as they appear in Mr. Miller's brief, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">1. Did the [Commission] err when it evaluated the application under guidelines for rehabilitation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">2. Did the [Commission] exceed its authority by banning fiberglass in new construction or reconstruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">3. Is it good public policy to mandate inferior materials in reconstruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-13\">4. Did the [Commission\u2019s] concern with setting precedent by approving fiberglass columns in the Historic District lead to an erroneous decision?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-14\">. Mr. Miller\u2019s third question asks the Court to evaluate the Commission\u2019s \"public policy\u201d regarding the use of substitute materials in the Annapolis Historic District. Such a question is not appropriate for judicial review, and we will not address i1. <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 36, 944 A.2d 1122 (2008) (\" \u2018declaration of public policy is normally the function of the legislative branch of government\u2019 \") (quoting <em>Felder v. Butler, 292 </em>Md. 174, 183, 438 A.2d 494 (1981)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. The parties agree that the Millers\u2019 home is in the Annapolis Historic District.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. The Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation include the following standards for replacement of deteriorated features:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjhD\">Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9i\">36 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.3(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\">. The guidelines were revised in 2007, and the provisions related to the use of fiberglass were added at this time. Mr. Miller notes that this was after he had erected his columns. Because the application that is the subject of this appeal was submitted after the guidelines were revised, however, they are the relevant guidelines for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>a significant issue in this case involved whether the porch was new construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. The Commission noted that, \"[bjut for the fact that the project involved the replacement of a once-existing porch, the project would not have been approved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">. We note that the Annapolis City Code consistently refers to construction and reconstruction as separate actions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 21.56.060(E)(2) (\"unless the Commission is satisfied that the proposed construction, alteration, or reconstruction will not materially impair the historic, cultural, archaeological, or architectural significance of ... structure, the Commission shall reject the application\u201d); \u00a7 21.56.040(A) (\"Before a person may undertake the construction, alteration, reconstruction, rehabilitation ... of a ... structure within a designated historic district ... the person ... shall file an application for a certificate of approval with the Commission for permission.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
