(\u201cDMJM\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding payment for services performed in connection with the expansion of the Baltimore County Detention Center. The County and DMJM entered into a contract in which DMJM was appointed as the \u201c[ajrchitect to provide professional architectural/engineering services in connection with a project to construct an addition and associated parking structure at the Baltimore County Detention Center\u201d (the \u201cProject\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County filed suit against DMJM in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County alleging breach of contract and negligence, and DMJM filed a Counterclaim and an Amended Counterclaim seeking payment for services under the \u201cbase contract\u201d and for \u201cadditional services.\u201d A jury awarded damages in favor of DMJM, including payment for the additional services. The County noted this timely appeal and raised two issues, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erroneously denied Baltimore County\u2019s Motion for Judgment at the conclusion of the trial with respect to DMJM\u2019s claim for additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>services, because there was no contract amendment approved by the County Council for those services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">II. Whether DMJM\u2019s counterclaim for additional services was barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Md. Ann.Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 lA(c)?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ans\">DMJM filed a cross-appeal and raised one issue, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">I. Did the trial court err in refusing to submit to the jury the issue of pre-judgment interest on [DMJMj\u2019s counterclaim for unpaid fees; and did the trial court improperly usurp the role of the jury by making its own fact-based ruling denying [DMJM] any pre-judgment interest, whether on the base contract award or additional services?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We answer the County\u2019s first question in the affirmative, and answer DMJM\u2019s question in the negative. As such, we shall reverse, in part, and affirm, in part, the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">On December 18, 2000, the parties entered into the Department of Public Works Agreement for Architectural Services (the \u201ccontract\u201d) which appointed DMJM as the architect to provide professional architectural/engineering services in connection with the Project. Under the contract, DMJM was to be paid $4,516,779.16. As to changes in the work or services to be performed and payment, the contract provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\"><em>ARTICLE I </em>\u2014 CHANGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">4.1 The County may, at any time, by written order, make changes within the general scope of this agreement in the services or work to be performed. If such changes cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>an increase or decrease in the Architect\u2019s cost of, or time required for, performance of any services under this Agreement, whether or not changed by any order, an equitable adjustment shall be made and this Agreement shall be modified in writing accordingly. Any claim of the Architect for adjustment under this clause must [be] asserted in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the Architect of the notification of changes unless the County grants a further period of time before the date of final payment under this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">4.2 No services for which an additional compensation will be charged by the Architect shall be furnished without the written authorization of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\"><em>ARTICLE 7 </em>\u2014 PAYMENT <em>(COST PLUS PROFIT)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">7.2 Direct Labor Costs, as used herein, shall be actual salaries paid to productive employees before tax and other deductions and does not include overhead expenses, administrative support time, payroll taxes, workmen\u2019s compensation and/or other insurances summary of the total Professional Fee and Other Direct Costs. This amount shall not exceed a total value of <em>Four Million Five Hundred Sixteen Thousand, Seven Hundred Seventy-Nine and 16/100 Dollars ($1,516,779.16) </em>unless authorized by properly executed amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">There shall be no interchangeability between the Upset Limit for Professional Fee and the Upset Limit for Other Direct Costs unless there is an approved amendment to the agreement. Such amendment may be approved by the County Administration if there is no increase in the total contract price under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">7.11 Final payment to the Architect shall be made upon completion and acceptance of the professional services specified under the terms of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>ARTICLE 21 </em>\u2014 SPECIAL <em>CAUSES</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">21.1 Council Approval: The Architect covenants that this Agreement is subject to and in compliance with provisions of Section 715 of the Baltimore County Charter, Article VII, title, \u201cBudgetary and Fiscal Procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On September 19, 2005, the parties entered into an \u201cAmendment to [the] Contract\u201d increasing the contract payment from the original contract price of $4,516,779.16 to $4,785,752.36. The amendment was signed by the President of DMJM, the Administrative Officer of the County and the Baltimore County Council Chairman. The Amendment was approved for legal form and sufficiency by an Assistant County Attorney, and was reviewed and approved by the Director of the Office of Budget and Finance for the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On January 20, 2006, the County filed a two-count complaint against DMJM in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County alleging that DMJM breached the contract and negligently performed architectural/engineering services resulting in damages to the County in the amount of five million dollars. DMJM filed an Answer and Counterclaim. In the Counterclaim, DMJM alleged breach of contract and sought an award of $800,000 in unpaid fees and interest under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">On April 16, 2008, the County filed an amended complaint, and DMJM filed an answer. The County propounded interrogatories including interrogatory number five which directed: \u201cItemize and show how you calculate any contractual damages claimed by your Counterclaim, and describe any non-economic damages claimed by you.\u201d On August 18, 2008, DMJM filed supplemental answers to interrogatories, including a supplemental answer to interrogatory number five, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">DMJM\u2019s claim for unpaid Architectural and Engineering base services is based on time expended. The time records and invoices have, or will be, produced to Baltimore County and are incorporated by reference. The amount owed for base contract services is $782,577.78. A summary of additional services claimed is attached to these Supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tal Answers and totals $1,633,060.30 for a total counterclaim of $2,415,638.08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">(Emphasis added). Attached to the supplemental answers to interrogatories, DMJM provided a spreadsheet which contained five categories, A, B, C, D, and E, titled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">A. Original A/E Services Agreement and Agreement Modification^)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">B.

Pending, Not Submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Under category A, \u201c[o]riginal A/E Services Agreement and Agreement Modification(s),\u201d DMJM listed the contract amount as amended on September 19, 2005, $4,785,752.36. Under the remaining categories, DMJM listed the following amounts as \u201cProposal Amounts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">B.

DMJM filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Following a hearing, the trial court granted DMJM\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to counts three, four, five, and six of the County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Third Amended Complaint. As a result, only count one (Breach of Contract) and count two (Negligence) of the Third Amended Complaint remained for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">On February 20, 2009, in a document titled \u201cSecond Supplemental Answers to Interrogatories,\u201d DMJM claimed damages totaling $2,173,714.37. Attached to the Second Supplemental Answers to Interrogatories was a spreadsheet listing five categories, A, B, C, D, and E, containing the same titles as those in the spreadsheet attached to DMJM\u2019s August 18, 2008, Supplemental Answers to Interrogatories. The amounts identified under each category were, however, different. Under category A, \u201c[original A/E Services Agreement and Agreement Modification(s),\u201d DMJM listed the unpaid contract amount claimed as $782,577.78. Under the remaining categories, DMJM listed the following amounts as \u201cProposal Amounts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">B. Submitted, Negotiated, But No Contract Modification Executed: $288,518.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">C.

Pending, Not Submitted Before County Filed Lawsuit: $999,453.06.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The spreadsheet contained an additional category, \u201cF,\u201d titled \u201cSubtotal, Additional Services,\u201d and under \u201cProposal Amount\u201d DMJM listed $1,391,136.59. On the spreadsheet, DMJM listed the following totals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">Total Earned Fees: $6,176,888.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">Total Paid Fees: $4,003,174.58</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">Total Unpaid Fees: $2,173,714.37.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">This spreadsheet was also attached to the County\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and admitted into evidence at trial as the County\u2019s Exhibit 173A.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">On April 21, 2009, DMJM filed an Amended Counterclaim for breach of contract, seeking an award of $2,175,000 in unpaid fees, and payment of prejudgment and postjudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>interest. On April 24, 2009, the County filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support thereof, requesting that the trial court dismiss DMJM\u2019s claim for additional services on the following two grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">(1) DMJM\u2019s Amended Counterclaim against Baltimore County was deficient as a matter of law because DMJM claimed damages for additional services above its base contractual amount, and the Maryland Annotated Code, the Baltimore County Charter, the Baltimore County Code, and well established Maryland case law prohibit contractual claims against local governments for any amounts above the amount set forth in the written contract approved by the governing body of the local government; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">(2) DMJM\u2019s Amended Counterclaim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Md.Code Ann. Art. 25A, \u00a7 1A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">DMJM filed an Opposition, and following a hearing, the trial court denied the County\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On May 1, 2009, the County filed Motions <em>in limine </em>seeking, in part, to preclude evidence of damages in excess of the contract amount. Specifically the County sought to preclude DMJM from introducing evidence of the claim for additional services. The circuit court denied the County\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">A trial was held from June 1, 2009, to July 10, 2009. At trial, DMJM introduced into evidence an amended spreadsheet which purported to explain the claim for $2,159,077.79 in total unpaid fees, including the request for $1,471,498.95 for additional services. The spreadsheet, admitted at trial as DMJM\u2019s Exhibit 506, contained the same five categories, A, B, C, D, and E, as the spreadsheet attached to DMJM\u2019s first and second supplemental answers to interrogatories, and the County\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, titled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>A.

Submitted, Informally Authorized, No Contract Modification Executed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">E. Pending, Not Submitted Before County Filed Lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Under category A, \u201c[o]riginal A/E Services Agreement and Agreement Modification(s).\u201d DMJM listed the \u201cUnpaid Contract Balance\u201d as $687,578.84. Under the remaining categories, DMJM listed the following amounts as \u201cProposal Amounts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">B. Submitted, Negotiated, But No Contract Modification Executed: $288,976.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">C.

Pending, Not Submitted Before County Filed Lawsuit: $1,007,533.75.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">The spreadsheet contained category \u201cF,\u201d titled \u201cSubtotal, Additional Services,\u201d and under \u201cProposal Amount\u201d listed $1,471,498.95. On the spreadsheet, DMJM listed the following totals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">Total Earned Fees: $6,257,251.31</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">Total Paid Fees: $4,098,173.52</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">Total Unpaid Fees: $2,159,077.79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">At trial, Edward P. Blades, a Budget Analyst with the Office of Budget and Finance, testified that as of February 23, 2004, Baltimore County had already paid DMJM $4,098,000 under the contract. Blades testified that if he had received a request for payment above the amended contract amount, he could not have authorized the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-19\">At the end of its case in Chief, the County moved for judgment as to DMJM\u2019s claim for additional services, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the reasons set forth in the County\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The trial court denied the motion for judgment. At the conclusion of DMJM\u2019s case and at the conclusion of all of the evidence, the County renewed the motion for judgment on the same grounds. The trial court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">DMJM requested a Jury Instruction on Prejudgment Interest, and the trial court refused to give the instruction. The requested instruction read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">The purpose of prejudgment interest is to compensate an aggrieved party for the loss of the use of the sum found due it and the loss of income from such funds. Prejudgment interest is allowable as a matter of right when the obligation to pay and the amount due had become certain and definite by a specific date prior to the judgment so that the effect of the debtor\u2019s withholding payment was to deprive the creditor of the use of the fixed amount as of a known date. If you find that the County deprived DMJM of a definite sum on either its contract and/or additional services, you may, but are not required to, award prejudgment interest from the date upon which you determine the County\u2019s obligation to pay, and the amount, were certain. Your decision on whether to award prejudgment interest must be based on your view of equity and justice appearing between the parties and a consideration of all the circumstances in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">After giving the jury instructions, the trial court at a bench conference asked counsel: \u201cEach party wish[es] to adopt and incorporate by reference all arguments advanced before I gave the instructions, is that correct?\u201d All counsel agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The jury found that DMJM had not breached the contract with the County, and that DMJM had not been negligent in rendering architectural/engineering services to the County. The jury found that the County breached the contract and awarded DMJM $1,653,600.88 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">On July 27, 2009, DMJM submitted a Memorandum in Support of Prejudgment Interest. The County filed an oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sition. On August 10, 2009, the County filed a Notice of Appeal and on August 20, 2009, DMJM filed a Notice of Appeal. On September 4, 2009, DMJM filed a Motion to Revise Judgment and to Strike [the County]\u2019s Notice of Appeal. On September 11, 2009, the trial court entered an Order denying DMJM\u2019s Request for Award of Prejudgment Interest, and denying DMJM\u2019s Motion to Revise the Judgment and to Strike [the County\u2019s] Notice of Appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On August 12, 2010, during the pendency of the appeal, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and Partial Release, in which the County agreed to pay DMJM\u2019s \u201cclaim for base contract services in the amount of $687,579.00, plus 10% post-judgment interest calculated from July 14, 2009, to August 14, 2010, (13 months), for a total of $762,066.72, in full and final satisfaction of DMJM\u2019s claim for said base contract services and for all post-judgment interest on that part of the judgment.\u201d The parties agreed that on appeal they would \u201cnot raise any issues that challenge or otherwise question the portion of the judgment for base contract services in the amount of $687,579.00, the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of DMJM on certain counts, or the jury verdict in favor of DMJM on Baltimore County\u2019s affirmative claims.\u201d The County reserved its right \u201cto challenge the remainder of the judgment for additional services in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>$966,022.00 and to oppose DMJM\u2019s claims for prejudgment interest on the entire amount of the Counterclaim judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>(A) Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The parties dispute the applicable standard of review. The County points out that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally subject to <em>de novo </em>review. The County contends, however, that a different standard governs the denial of a motion for summary judgment that is followed by a trial. The County argues that the correct standard of review in the latter scenario is whether the party moving for judgment at the conclusion of evidence in the trial is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the record as it stands at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">DMJM argues that the standard of review is <em>de novo </em>and that review is extremely narrow, with the appellate court limited to review of purely legal issues. DMJM argues that the County\u2019s proposed standard of review suggests that we review legal issues <em>de novo, </em>as well as, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. DMJM argues that the issue of sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict is not before this Court, and we are precluded from consideration of evidence introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">It is well settled that, \u201c[t]his Court utilizes a <em>de novo </em>standard to analyze questions regarding a circuit court\u2019s interpretation of statutory provisions. Although the factual determinations of the circuit court are afforded significant deference on review, its legal determinations are not. Where the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, we must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Powell v. Breslin, </em>195 Md.App. 340 (2010), <em>cert. granted, </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The standard of review that governs appellate review of the denial of a motion for judgment after trial was explained by the Court of Appeals in <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 472, n. 4, 615 A.2d 611 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">Given that a circuit court has the discretion to deny a motion for summary judgment, even though the record on summary judgment would support grant of the motion at that time, the correct mode of analysis here is to determine whether the party moving for judgment at the conclusion of trial is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the record as it stands at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In ruling on a motion for judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-519 in a jury trial, \u201c[t]he trial judge must consider the evidence, including the inferences reasonably and logically drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. If there is any evidence, no matter how slight, legally sufficient to generate a jury question, the motion must be denied.... \u201d <em>Barrett v. Nwaba, </em>165 Md.App. 281, 289, 885 A.2d 392 (2005) (citations and internal quotations omitted) (emphasis omitted). \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment under the same analysis used by the trial court. In other words, we assume the truth of all credible evidence on the issue, and all fairly debatable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 885 A.2d 392 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>(B) The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The County argues that the trial court erroneously denied its Motion for Judgment at the conclusion of the trial as to DMJM\u2019s claim for additional services because there was no written contract amendment approved by the County Council obligating the County to pay for the services. The County explains that any amendment to the contract was required by Article 4 and Article 21.1 of the contract to be in writing and approved by the County Council, and the Council did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>approve an amendment for the payment of the claimed additional services. The County points out that an examination of the captions in DMJM\u2019s spreadsheets demonstrate that DMJM was aware of the need for an amendment for the additional services to obligate the County for payment of the services, and was aware that the Council did not execute such an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The County maintains that three legal reasons compel the conclusion that the trial court erred in denying its motions for judgment: (1) the plain meaning of the contract; (2) the plain meaning of the applicable Baltimore County Charter and Baltimore County Code (\u201cB.C.C.\u201d) sections; and (3) relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">First, the County argues that the contract language itself provides that any changes to the contract shall be made by written modification and that no compensation for additional services will be charged without authorization of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Second, the County contends that a county or municipality may make a contract only in the manner prescribed by the legislature, and \u201cif the essential formalities are lacking, the contract is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d The County argues that Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 715, \u00a7 402, \u00a7 508 and B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10-2-304, 10-2-306, 10-2-107, \u201cset forth the process which must be complied with in obtaining requisite \u2018approval and proper execution of the contract documents\u2019 so as to form a legally binding contract with Baltimore County.\u201d The process, as described by the County, is that: (1) County Council approval is required; (2) the County Executive or the County Administrative Officer is required to sign any contract on behalf of the County; and (3) the Director of Budget and Finance must first certify that funds for the designated purpose are available. The County points out that DMJM and the County previously entered into a properly executed contract amendment, thus proving DMJM was aware of the need for a properly executed contract amendment, and participated in the amendment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Third, relying primarily on <em>Alternatives Unlimited, Inc. v. New Baltimore City Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs., </em>155 Md.App. 415, 425, 843 A.2d 252 (2004), the County argues relevant case law establishes the proposition that \u201ca governmental entity, unlike a private corporation may never have an obligation imposed upon it to expend public funds except in the formal manner expressly provided by law.\u201d The County contends that those who contract with governmental agencies in Maryland are deemed to be on notice of the applicable procedures and requirements and the risk of non-compliance with these requirements and procedures is \u201cborne on the other party, not the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In contrast, DMJM argues that the County is bound to pay for the additional services as the B.C.C. expressly allows changes to existing contracts without the formal approval of the County Council, and that under the B.C.C. only \u201cpurchase orders\u201d and \u201ccontracts\u201d as a whole can be void <em>per se </em>so as to create \u201cno obligation or liability.\u201d DMJM contends that, in general, counties are bound by their contracts and the additional services DMJM performed on the project in this case were within the ambit of the approved contract and the changes clause therein. DMJM maintains the County\u2019s assertion of non-liability for the additional services is subject to estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Notwithstanding DMJM\u2019s positions, for the reasons below, we agree with the County that the contract language, the Baltimore County Charter and B.C.C., and relevant case law mandate reversal and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">(1) The Contract Language</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The plain language of the contract required written authorization from the County Council to obligate the County for payment of the additional services. Appellate courts take \u201can objective approach to contract interpretation, according to which, unless a contract\u2019s language is ambiguous, we give effect to that language as written without concern for the subjective intent of the parties at the time of formation.\u201d <em>Ocean Petroleum, Co. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 86, 5 A.3d 683 (2010) (citing <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>700 (2007)). When interpreting a contract, we are confined to \u201cthe four corners of the agreement,\u201d and we \u201cascribe to the contract\u2019s language its \u2018customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d 700; <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). We do not consider the subjective intent of the parties, rather we consider \u201cthe perspective of a reasonable person standing in the parties\u2019 shoes at the time of the contract\u2019s formation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d 700). As such, \u201cthe true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. The language of a contract is only ambiguous if, when viewed from this reasonable person perspective, that language is susceptible to more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 5 A.3d 683 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In this case, Article 4.1 of the contract states that: \u201cThe County may, at any time, by written order, make changes within the general scope of this agreement in the services or work to be performed.\u201d (Emphasis added). Article 4.1 provides that: \u201cIf such changes cause an increase or decrease in the Architect\u2019s cost of, or time required for, performance of any services under this Agreement, whether or not changed by any order, an equitable adjustment shall be made and this Agreement shall be modified in writing accordingly.\u201d Article 4.1 also states that: \u201cAny claim of the Architect for adjustment under this clause must [be] asserted in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the Architect of the notification of changes unless the County grants a further period of time before the date of final payment under this agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On appeal, DMJM has identified no word or phrase in Article 4.1 which it alleges to be ambiguous. The plain meaning of the clause is clear and unambiguous \u2014 the County, by written order could make changes in the work or services to be performed by DMJM. If those changes caused an increase or decrease in the cost of the contract, an equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>adjustment would be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly. Any adjustment claims sought by DMJM, under Article 4.1 were required to be asserted in writing within thirty (30) days of DMJM\u2019s receipt of notification of changes by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Article 4.2 of the contract states in simple and unambiguous language that: \u201cNo services for which an additional compensation will be charged by the Architect shall be furnished without the written authorization of the County.\u201d (Emphasis added). DMJM has identified no language in Article 4.2 which it contends is unclear or subject to dual interpretation. It is clear that the phrase \u201cno services\u201d contained in Article 4.2 extends beyond the changes in services or work potentially made by the County pursuant to the written order referenced in Article 4.1, and includes any and all services for which DMJM might seek additional compensation. The meaning of Article 4.2 is clear \u2014 DMJM could charge for no additional services without written authorization of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Article 7.2, relating to payment of the direct labor costs,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides: \u201cDirect Labor Costs ... shall not exceed a total value of <em>Four Million, Five Hundred Sixteen Thousand, Seven Hundred Seventy-Nine and 16/100 Dollars ($h,516 779.16) </em>unless authorized by properly executed[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] amendment.\u201d (Footnote added). Once more when faced with the plain meaning contention of the County, DMJM has identified no ambiguous language in Article 7.2 which permits the amount payable under the contract to exceed $4,516,779.16, absent a properly executed amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Article 7.2 is clear \u2014 without an amendment to the agreement signed by the parties, the cost of the contract to the County could not be greater than $4,516,779.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Article 21.1, entitled \u201cSpecial Causes, Council Approval,\u201d states that DMJM by entering into the contract \u201ccovenants that this Agreement is subject to and in compliance with provisions of \u00a7 715 of the Baltimore County Charter, Article VII, title, \u2018Budgetary and Fiscal Procedures.\u2019 \u201d Charter \u00a7 715 provides that: \u201cAny contract, must be approved by the county council before it is executed if the contract is: ... For services for a term in excess of two years or involving the expenditure of more than $25,000 per year or such amount or term as may be set by legislative act of the county council.\u201d By a plain reading of Article 21.1 and Charter \u00a7 715, in signing the contract, DMJM agreed that any contract for services lasting more than two years or for a cost of more than $25,000 per year must be approved by the County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Under the objective approach to contract interpretation, the inquiry as to the meaning of the language of the contract is restricted to the four corners of the agreement, and as such, the customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning of the language of the contract is assigned to it. <em>Ocean Petroleum, Co., </em>416 Md. at 86, 5 A.3d 683. In this case, the language of the contract is unambiguous \u2014 that is, the language is not susceptible to more than one meaning \u2014 when viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the parties. Based on a plain reading of the document, in simplest terms, DMJM did not comply with the procedures outlined under the contract for seeking compensation for additional services. There is no merit to DMJM\u2019s position that the contract allowed for the County to be obligated to pay for additional services beyond those authorized by a properly executed written amendment, approved by the County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>(2) Charter and B.C.C. Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The plain meaning of the relevant provisions of the Baltimore County Charter and the B.C.C. support the conclusion that an enforceable contract amendment required approval by the County Council. As discussed above, Article 21.1 of the contract provides that DMJM agreed to comply with Charter \u00a7 715, titled, \u201c[appropriation control and certification of funds.\u201d In pertinent part, Charter \u00a7 715 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">No office, department, institution, board, commission, or other agency of the county government shall, during any fiscal year, expend or contract to expend any money or incur any liability or enter into any contract which by its terms involves the expenditure of money, for any purpose, in excess of the amounts appropriated or allotted for the same general classification of expenditure in the budget for such fiscal year or in any supplemental appropriation as hereinabove provided. No such payment shall be made nor any obligation or liability incurred, except for small purchases in an amount less than one hundred dollars, or such amount as may be set by legislative act of the county council, unless the director of finance shall first certify that the funds for the designated purpose are available. Any contract, verbal or written, made in violation of this section shall be null and void, and if any officer, agent or employee of the county shall knowingly or willfully violate this provision, such action shall be cause for his removal from office by a majority of the total number of county council members established by this Charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Nothing in this section or elsewhere in this Charter shall prevent the making of contracts of lease or contracts for services providing for the payment of funds at a time beyond the fiscal year in which the contracts are made, provided that the nature of such transactions reasonably requires the making of such contracts.

B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304, titled, \u201cCertification by the Director of Budget and Finance,\u201d states that: \u201cAn order for purchases of services or commodities estimated to exceed $1,000 may not be issued until the Director of Budget and Finance shall first certify that funds for the designated purpose are available.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-306, specifically titled, \u201cContracts\u201d provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">(a) <em>In general. </em>Except as otherwise provided by law, all contracts, including professional capital improvement services contracts, shall be signed on behalf of the county by the County Executive[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] or the County Executive\u2019s designee approved by the County Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">(b) <em>Contracts of $25, 000 or less.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">(1) (i) The County Executive may delegate the authority to sign contracts of $25,000 or less to the Director of Budget and Finance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">(ii) On receiving the delegation authorized under sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, the Director may delegate the authority to sign contracts of $25,000 or less to a designee as evidenced by a written designation signed by the Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">(2) Unless otherwise provided in the Purchasing Manual, a contract of $25,000 or less shall also be signed by the Director of the Department or office initiating the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">(c) <em>Contracts formalities. </em>All contracts shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(1) Forwarded to the Director of Budget and Finance for certification in accordance with \u00a7 715 of the Charter, a copy of which shall be retained by Director; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">(2) Approved by the County Attorney[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] in accordance with \u00a7 508 of the Charter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">(Emphasis added) (italics in original) (footnotes added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-107, titled, \u201cUnauthorized Purchases\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(1) Except as provided in this title, a county officer or employee may not order the purchase of any commodities, services, or professional capital improvement services except under the requirements and conditions of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">(2) A purchase order or contract made contrary to the provisions of this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">(i) Shall be of no effect and void; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(ii) Creates no obligation or liability for the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">We find the plain meaning of Charter \u00a7 715 and the B.C.C. sections to be clear and unambiguous. The sections require contracts to be approved by the County Council. Once more, DMJM has identified no words or phrases in the relevant Charter and B.C.C. sections that it contends are unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Mindful of DMJM\u2019s contention that approval by the County Council was not required for an amendment to the contract, we will explore the legislative history of Charter \u00a7 715, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304 and \u00a7 10-2-306. The legislative history of Charter \u00a7 715, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304 and \u00a7 10-2-306 supports the conclusion that it was indeed the intent of the County Council that its approval be required for binding contracts with the County for services involving the expenditure of more than $25,000 per year and for amendments to those contracts. The discernable legislative history of \u00a7 715 reveals that the Charter section was enacted in 1978, by Bill No. 86, 1978, \u00a7 1, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>was amended in 1982 by Bill No. 117,1982, \u00a7 1, and in 1990 by Bill No. 129,1990, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In 1978 by Bill No. 86, Charter \u00a7 715 was enacted with the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>Any contract must be approved by the county council before it is executed if the contract is: (1) for the purchase of real or leasehold property where the purchase price of the property is in excess of $5,000; (2) for the lease of real or leasehold property ...

Bill No. 49-96, \u00a7 7 stated that one of its purposes was to explain the \u201cduties, functions, responsibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ties and authorities of the offices, departments and personnel of the Baltimore County government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The legislative history of Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 715, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304 and \u00a7 10-2-306 clearly demonstrates that the County Council\u2019s intent was to create a process by which County Council approval is required prior to the execution of a contract for services involving a term in excess of two years or the expenditure of more than $25,000 per year or such amount as may be set by legislative act of the County Council. There is no indication that the County Council intended to exempt, from the County Council approval requirement, contract amendments where services exceed a cost of $25,000 or the two year duration. When Charter \u00a7 715 was enacted in 1978, in Bill No. 86, the County Council explicitly stated that the purpose of Bill No. 86 was to provide the Council advance notice of all capital projects exceeding $25,000. Charter \u00a7 715 also provides that no office, department, board, commission, or agency of the County can contract to expend funds without the Director of Finance first certifying that the funds for the designated purpose are available. B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-306 requires compliance with Charter \u00a7 715 stating that all contracts must be sent to the Director of Budget and Finance for certification that the County has the funds available.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Since 1978, the Charter has required County Council approval of contracts, and hence notice, of capital projects exceeding $25,000 per year, as well as, certification from the Director of Budget and Finance that the funds are available for such projects. To interpret Charter \u00a7 715, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304 and \u00a7 10-2-306, as not applying to contract amendments which exceed $25,000 per year or two years in duration would allow entities to contract with the County for one amount, approved by the County Council, and later amend the contract price in excess of $25,000 without County Council approval and certification from the Director of Budget and Finance that the funds are available, thereby circumventing the County Council approval process. This could not have been the intent of the County Council. The plain meaning of Charter \u00a7 715, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-304 and \u00a7 10-2-306 and their legislative histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ry support the conclusion that the County Council intended its approval as a requirement for all capital projects exceeding $25,000 per year or a term in excess of two years, including contracts and contract amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Relying on B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504, DMJM wrongly contends that the B.C.C. \u201cexpressly allows changes to existing contracts without formal approval of the County Council.\u201d We find no merit to DMJM\u2019s position. B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">(a) <em>Changes </em>\u2014 Capital <em>improvement contract. </em>If it becomes necessary to modify the plans and specifications for an ongoing capital improvement contract to an extent which will require an additional expenditure of more than 20% of the contract bid price, in the aggregate, the Director of Public Works promptly shall prepare and submit through the County Administrative Officer to each member of the County Council a report explaining:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">(1) The changed or additional construction, within the scope of the contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">(2) The costs of the change; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(3) The reasons for the change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">(b) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Professional <em>capital improvement services contract. </em>If a professional capital improvement services contract previously approved by the County Council requires an increase over the original contract price, the Director of Public Works promptly shall prepare and submit through the County Administrative Officer to each member of the County Council a report explaining:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">(1) The change in the professional capital improvement services contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">(2) The costs of the change; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">(3) The reasons for the change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">(c) <em>County may proceed after 7 days. </em>If, after 7 days after the date the report is actually delivered to the Council members, the County Administrative Officer has not received notice from any Council member to the contrary, the Department of Public Works may proceed with the change in plans or amend the professional services contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(Emphasis in original). Pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504(b), where a professional capital improvement services contract previously approved by the County Council requires an increase in cost over the original contract price, the Director of Public Works shall prepare a report, which is submitted to each member of the County Council. In the report, the Director of Public Works is required to explain: (1) the change in the professional capital improvement services contract; (2) the costs of the change; and (3) the reasons for the change. B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504(c) provides that \u201c[i]f after 7 days after the date of the report is actually delivered to the Council members, the County Administrative Officer has not received notice from any Council member to the contrary, the Department of Public Works may proceed with amending the professional services contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The plain meaning of B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504 requires that notice be provided to the County Council of changes in capital improvement services contracts that exceed the original contract price. The legislative history of B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504, contained in Bill No. 125-94, \u00a7 1, 1994, reveals that the section was enacted in 1988. According to its legislative history B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504 was enacted \u201c[for] the purpose of amending the purchasing law to provide for reporting to the county council an increase in a professional services contract.\u201d Bill No. 125-94, \u00a7 1, 1994. Based on the plain meaning of B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504, and an examination of its legislative history, B.C.C. \u00a7 10-2-504 does not allow changes to existing contracts, which increase the contract price without notice to and the acquiescence of the County Council.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(3) Relevant Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Relevant case law supports the conclusion that the County may contract only by the method prescribed by the legislature.

Citing <em>Gontrum, </em>182 Md. at 375, 35 A.2d 128, the Court explained that: \u201cThe rule is firmly established that one who makes a contract with a municipal corporation or administrative agency is bound to take notice of the limitations of its powers to contract.\u201d <em>Hanna, </em>200 Md. at 57, 87 A.2d 846.

Moylan, Jr. explained the rationale of <em>Gontrum:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">The overarching principle of <em>Gontrum </em>is that a governmental entity, unlike a private corporation, may never have an obligation imposed upon it to expend public funds except in the formal manner expressly provided by law. There is no exemption from this rule because of any apparent authority of one of its agents to bind the governmental entity. There is imposed on any party dealing with the governmental entity, moreover, an absolute responsibility 1) to know the limitations on the powers of the agent to contract on behalf of the governmental entity and 2) to be familiar with and bound by \u201cthe power of the particular officer or agency to make the contract\u201d in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Judge Moylan explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">The basic principle for which <em>Gontrum </em>stands is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>public f\u00edsc,[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] and thereby the public itself, is to be protected, by stringent procurement procedures not only against outside parties, such as Alternatives, but even against its own agents and employees, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">A municipal corporation cannot be held liable for the unauthorized acts of its agents although done officii col-ore, without some corporate act of ratification or adoption; and, from consideration of public policy, it seems more reasonable that an individual should occasionally suffer from the mistakes of public agents or officials, than to adopt a rule, which, through improper combinations and collusion, might be turned to the detriment and injury of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\"><em>[Gontrum,] </em>182 Md. at 376 [35 A.2d 128] (emphasis supplied).

Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>166 Md.App. at 41, 887 A.2d 64, we held that a trial court did not err in finding a settlement agreement between the Commission and Baltimore City void, as the agreement was beyond the power of the officials to enter when they had not followed prescribed procedures. In that case, the Commission proceeded against the City on a complaint that parts of a city building were not wheelchair accessible. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 887 A.2d 64. City officials negotiated a settlement embodied in a Consent Judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 887 A.2d 64. The Commission sought to have the City held in contempt, but the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>found the settlement agreement to be void and unenforceable because mandatory processes under the City\u2019s charter had not been followed in reaching the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 887 A.2d 64. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision we explained that: \u201cIt is well settled that a county or municipality can make a contract only in the manner prescribed by the legislature.... This rule is strict; if the municipality\u2019s charter provisions are not precisely followed during the contracting process, the contract is <em>ultra vires, </em>or outside the power of the municipal corporation to make, and void <em>ab initio.\u201d Id. </em>at 41-42, 887 A.2d 64 (emphasis in original) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We rejected the Commission\u2019s argument that the settlement agreement is valid despite the failures to abide by the Charter. In doing so, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">Maryland appellate courts have repeatedly stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">No principle of the law relating to municipal corporations is more firmly established than that those who deal with their agents or officers must, at their peril, take notice of the limits of the powers of both the municipality and of those who assume to act as its agents and officers; and <em>in no State has this principle been more frequently applied or more rigidly enforced than in Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 42, 887 A.2d 64 (quoting <em>AltevTiatives Unlimited, Inc., </em>155 Md.App. at 427, 843 A.2d 252) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Under the analysis required by the precedents discussed above, it is clear that the absence of a written contract amendment approved by the County Council is dis-positive of DMJM\u2019s claim for payment of additional services\u2014 the County cannot be obligated under a contract unless the contract is executed in the formal manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">DMJM bases its argument that counties are bound by their contracts to the same extent as private entities on <em>Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 671 A.2d 1 (1996). In <em>Revere, </em>341 Md. at 383, 671 A.2d 1, the Court of Appeals held that a settlement agreement incorporated into a court order between a county and a private company was a final judgment that was valid and enforceable. The County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>sought to void the agreement alleging fraud, contending that the agreement exceeded the County\u2019s authority. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 671 A.2d 1. The Court reasoned that \u201ccases have recognized certain unusual and narrowly limited situations when final judgments based on consent of the parties, although not subject to revision under rules like Maryland Rule 2-535, have been deemed non-preclusive or subject to collateral attack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 671 A.2d 1. In this vein, the Court discussed <em>Kelley v. Town of Milan, </em>127 U.S. 139, 8 S.Ct. 1101, 32 L.Ed. 77 (1888), stating that \u201cunder the <em>Kelley </em>principle the act of placing a settlement agreement made by a local government in the form of a court judgment, ... will not cure the lack of fundamental power in the governmental entity to make the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 671 A.2d 1. In <em>Revere, </em>the Court found that the substance of the agreement was not clearly <em>ultra </em>vires,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and as such the Court concluded that the scope of <em>Kelley </em>need not be addressed. 341 Md. at 382-83, 671 A.2d 1. The Court noted that it would \u201cassume <em>arguendo, </em>that it would have been proper to vacate the settlement agreement and judgment ... if the agreement were clearly <em>ultra vires.\u201d Id. </em>at 383, 671 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>DMJM ignores crucial differences between the facts of <em>Revere </em>and the present situation. In <em>Revere, </em>there was an executed contract, in the form of the settlement agreement, granting Revere the use of billboards, contrary to Montgomery County\u2019s zoning regulation, which was incorporated into a court order. In <em>Revere, </em>the Court engaged in an analysis of whether the settlement agreement entered into and incorporated in a court order was made in the method prescribed by law, and determined that the agreement was not <em>ultra vires. </em>As such, the Court of Appeals found the agreement valid. In <em>Revere, </em>the Court stated, \u201c \u2018as long as the execution of the contract [is] within the power of the governmental unit,\u2019 the local government is answerable in damages for breaching that contract.\u201d 341 Md. at 385, 671 A.2d 1 (citation omitted). In <em>Revere, </em>to be sure, the Court also stated: \u201c[U]nder Maryland law counties and municipalities are normally bound by their contracts to the same extent as private entities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 671 A.2d 1. This statement, however, was made in the context of counties being bound by contracts properly made in the method prescribed by law and not <em>ultra vires. </em>The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Revere </em>does not conflict with the precedent set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Gontrum </em>in 1943, and reiterated by Judge Moylan in <em>Alternatives Unlimited, Inc., </em>in 2004, and, as such, does not change our analysis in this case\u2014 the County cannot be bound by a contract unless the contract is executed in the formal manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">(4) Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">DMJM contends that \u201ccounties asserting that a contract is void are subject to estoppel.\u201d DMJM argues that \u201cMaryland law has allowed equitable estoppel to be asserted against governmental entities when \u2018both parties to the transaction have acted and proceeded as if all preliminary formalities and regulations [have] been complied with, and rights have attached.\u2019 \u201d DMJM argues that compliance with Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the contract is subject to the principles of waiver, estoppel, or modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The County responds that DMJM\u2019s counterclaim alleged only a breach of contract. The County contends that DMJM failed to raise the doctrine of estoppel at trial. As such, the County argues that it is too late for DMJM to raise the issue of estoppel as this issue was not raised in the circuit court. As to the merits in this case, the County contends that \u201cthere is no ambiguity with respect to Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 715.\u201d Charter \u00a7 715 requires County Council approval for amendments to a professional services contract for amounts above $25,000 and, as such, the doctrine of estoppel is inapplicable. We agree with the County on all of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Preliminarily, we conclude that DMJM has failed to preserve the issue of estoppel for appellate review. Maryland Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d). DMJM failed to raise the issue of estoppel when the County filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. In DMJM\u2019s Opposition to the County\u2019s motion, DMJM argued that the additional services were within the ambit of the contract and payment for the additional services did not require formal modification of the contract.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At trial, the County made a motion for judgment at the end of its case-in-chief, and renewed this motion at the conclusion of DMJM\u2019s case and at the end of all the evidence. The County stated that its request for judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>was based on the same arguments set forth in its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. DMJM responded to the County\u2019s motion, made at the conclusion of DMJM\u2019s case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">[DMJM COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I believe that in our Opposition to the Motion For Summary Judgment, we laid out the reasons why. This contract has [a] changes clause. There is no debate [that] the contract was validly entered [ ] into by the County and by DMJM. The County\u2019s motion is not well founded and in fact it\u2019s an issue of fact for the Jury to determine what if any additional moneys DMJM is due for services provided under this contract. It\u2019s a straight issue of fact, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">DMJM failed to argue estoppel in its Opposition to the County\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and, at trial, when opposing the County\u2019s motion for judgment. \u201cA contention not raised below either in the pleadings or in the evidence and not directly passed upon by the trial court is not preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>Zellinger v. CRC Dev. Corp., </em>281 Md. 614, 620, 380 A.2d 1064 (1977) (citation omitted). We conclude, DMJM has not preserved the issue of estoppel for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Alternatively, as to the merits, we conclude that the doctrine of estoppel is inapplicable in this case. Equitable estoppel is an \u201cequitable remedy.\u201d <em>Alternatives Unlimited Inc., </em>155 Md.App. at 463, 843 A.2d 252. Municipal corporations are not exempt from application of equitable estoppel principles; however, \u201cin practice we have applied the doctrine more narrowly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, n. 1, 843 A.2d 252. Although we acknowledged in <em>Alternatives Unlimited, Inc. </em>that equitable estoppel may apply against municipalities, we qualified this statement, explaining: \u201c[Ejquitable estoppel is not applicable when the limited authority of a public officer has been exceeded, or was unauthorized or wrongful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gregg Neck Yacht Club v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 775, 769 A.2d 982 (2001)). The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Inlet Associates v. Assateague House Condominium Assoc., </em>313 Md. 413, 437, 545 A.2d 1296 (1988), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Of course, no principle is better settled than that persons dealing with a municipality are bound to take notice of limitations upon its charter powers. Consequently, \u201c[e]v-eryone dealing with officers and agents of a municipality is charged with knowledge of the nature of their duties and the extent of their powers, and therefore such a person cannot be considered to have been deceived or misled by their acts when done without legal authority.\u201d Therefore, the doctrine of equitable estoppel \u201ccannot be ... invoked to defeat the municipality in the enforcement of its ordinances, because of an error or mistake committed by one of its officers or agents which has been relied on by the third party to his detriment.\u201d In the same vein, McQuillin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 29-104c states that estoppel cannot make lawful a municipal action which is beyond the scope of its power to act or is not executed in compliance with mandatory conditions prescribed in the charter. In other words, the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be invoked to defeat a municipality\u2019s required adherence to the provisions of its charter simply because of reliance upon erroneous advice given by an official in excess of his authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">(Internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">DMJM contends that in contract cases where damages are sought, prejudgment interest is discretionary with the trier of fact and the trial court erred in failing to give the requested instruction on prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> DMJM ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>gues that it was entitled to have the issue of prejudgment interest submitted to the jury as the amounts sought were specific and liquidated. DMJM contends that the refusal to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The County contends the trial court properly denied DMJM\u2019s request for prejudgment interest after it erroneously admitted, over objection, DMJM\u2019s Exhibit 532, a summary of proposed prejudgment interest. The County argues \u201cthat the principal amount upon which the claim for prejudgment interest was calculated was not a liquidated sum.\u201d The County maintains that the trial court properly determined as a matter of law that DMJM was not entitled to prejudgment interest and that the issue of prejudgment interest should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In this case, DMJM asked the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of prejudgment interest. \u201cWe apply the abuse of discretion standard of review when considering a trial judge\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction.\u201d <em>Collins v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>417 Md. 217, 228 (2010), <em>cert. dismissed, - </em>U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1811, 179 L.Ed.2d 673 (2011). DMJM requested that the trial court instruct the jury on prejudgment interest, in part, as follows, \u201cyou may, but are not required to, award prejudgment interest from the date upon which you determine the County\u2019s obligation to pay, and the amount, were certain.\u201d In order to address DMJM\u2019s contention \u2014 that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to instruct the jury on prejudgment interest \u2014 we must first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>analyze the circumstances under which a trial court is required to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201c[PJrejudgment interest as a matter of right is the exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>Ver Brycke v. Ver Brycke, </em>379 Md. 669, 702, 843 A.2d 758 (2004). There are three rules regarding prejudgment interest: (1) as a matter of right\u2014 prejudgment interest is allowed as a matter of right when \u201cthe obligation to pay and the amount due [have] become certain, definite, and liquidated by a specific date prior to judgment so that the effect of the debtor\u2019s withholding payment was to deprive the creditor of the use of a fixed amount as of a known date\u201d; (2) absolute non-allowance \u2014 \u201cwhere the recovery is for bodily harm, emotional distress, or similar intangible elements of damage not easily susceptible of precise measurement, the award itself is presumed to be comprehensive, and pre-judgment interest is not allowed\u201d; and (3) if the case falls in between the as of right and absolute non-allowance, \u201cprejudgment interest is within the discretion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Buxton v. Buxton, </em>363 Md. 634, 656-57, 770 A.2d 152 (2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Maryland appellate courts have not considered whether a trial judge erred in failing to submit to the jury, as the trier of fact, the issue of prejudgment interest in a breach of contract case where the award falls between the circumstances of prejudgment interest as a matter of right or clear disallowance. In this case, it is undisputed that DMJM was not entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of right. Prejudgment interest, however, would not have been absolutely disallowed on DMJM\u2019s breach of contract claim, assuming the jury entered a verdict in its favor. The question is whether the trial judge erred in not submitting the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury prior to the verdict. Specifically, we must address whether the trial court was required to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury, prior to the verdict, in a breach of contract action, where there was a dispute as to: (1) whom damages would be awarded \u2014 whether damages would be awarded in favor of the County\u2019s claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>negligence or breach of contract or in favor of DMJM\u2019s claim for breach of contract; (2) the amount of damages, if any owed; and (3) when the damages occurred. After reviewing relevant case law, we answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In tort cases, prejudgment interest has been disallowed on the theory that the amounts sought were not due and owing until judgment, and the prevailing party was not deprived of the use of the interest. <em>Id. </em>at 656-57, 770 A.2d 152. The Court of Appeals has previously held \u2014 in a case in which the plaintiff sought recovery for real estate commissions sales and damages for tortious interference and for conspiracy to interfere with his alleged real estate listing contract \u2014 that where there is a dispute as to the amount of damages, the damages do not become liquidated until the verdict, fixing the amount. <em>Taylor v. Wahby, </em>271 Md. 101, 113, 314 A.2d 100 (1974). In <em>Taylor, </em>271 Md. at 103, 314 A.2d 100, the appellee, a real estate broker, sued several parties for real estate commissions of a property sale for which he was responsible. The trial court determined that \u201cinasmuch as both the interference with the contracts and the conspiracy to interfere with them were effective and complete when the [property was deeded to the buyer], interest should be allowed on the real estate commissions due [appellee] ... and should be calculated from the dates of the respective deeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 314 A.2d 100. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court, indicating that the case upon which the trial judge relied \u201cinvolved a chattel having a readily ascertainable market value and in regard to which the plaintiffs were required to pay out substantial sums over a period of years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 314 A.2d 100. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">In the instant case, however, there was a dispute in regard to the amount of damages so far as the commissions were concerned. In addition, various other factors might well have been considered by the lower court in determining the amount of compensable damages. The amount of damages thus did not become liquidated until the verdict of the court, sitting as a jury, fixed the amount. In short, the claim was unliquidated and not reasonably ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>tainable until the verdict, so that the usual tort rule in regard to unliquidated claims for damages applies, <em>i.e., </em>that interest runs from the time of the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court remanded the case to the trial court to adjust the interest to run from the time the judgment was rendered. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 314 A.2d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Wartzman v. Hightower Prods., Ltd., </em>53 Md.App. 656, 668, 456 A.2d 82 (1983), after a jury trial, the appellee filed a cross-appeal alleging that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to permit the jury to consider prejudgment interest on the jury\u2019s award of reliance damages. In that case, \u201cHightower filed suit alleging breach of contract and negligence for [Wartzman\u2019s] failure to have created a corporation authorized to raise the capital necessary to fund [a] venture. At the trial, Hightower introduced into evidence its obligations and expenditures incurred in reliance on the defendant law firm\u2019s creation of a corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 456 A.2d 82. The trial court instructed the jury that in order to find liability, the plaintiff must prove three things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">First, the employment of the defendants in behalf of the Plaintiff and the extent of the duties for which the Defendants were employed; secondly, that the Defendants neglected the duties undertaken in the employment and, thirdly, that such negligence resulted in and was the proximate cause of loss by the Plaintiff, that is that the Plaintiff was deprived of any right or parted with anything of value in reliance upon the negligence of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 666, 456 A.2d 82. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Hightower in the amount of $170,508.43, and on appeal, Hightower argued that the trial court erred in failing to present the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 668, 456 A.2d 82. Finding no error, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">Applicable Maryland law provides that where a claim is for unliquidated damages, interest may run from the date of the judgment, but not before. <em>Affiliated Distillers </em>[v. <em>R.W.L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Wine &amp; Liquor Co.], </em>213 Md. 509, 132 A.2d 582, (1957), <em>Taylor v.

Refusal to permit the jury to consider prejudgment interest, therefore, was not an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 668-69, 456 A.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In <em>Republic Ins. Co. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>92 Md.App. 528, 530-31, 608 A.2d 1301 (1992), the plaintiff sought to recover under a performance bond issued by Republic. After a jury trial, Prince George\u2019s County appealed the trial court\u2019s denial to award prejudgment interest. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 608 A.2d 1301. We found no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to award prejudgment interest, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">Ordinarily, prejudgment interest is a matter that rests in the discretion of the trier of fact. <em>First Virginia Bank v. Settles, </em>322 Md. 555, 562-565, 588 A.2d 803 (1991). While interest is recoverable as of right in actions on bonds for a liquidated sum of money, <em>Atlantic States Construction Co. v. Drummond &amp; Co. Inc., </em>251 Md. 77, 85, 246 A.2d 251 (1968), Republic\u2019s obligation under the performance bond was not liquidated until the time judgment was entered against it. Accordingly, it was within the circuit court\u2019s discretion to deny interest to the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In <em>Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., </em>174 Md.App. 681, 772, 923 A.2d 971 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>403 Md. 367, 942 A.2d 722 (2008), although the issue of prejudgment interest was submitted to the jury, this Court reversed the jury\u2019s award of prejudgment interest, concluding that Pulte failed to present evidence at trial warranting an award of prejudgment interest. Pulte, a builder, sued several defendants, including Parex, on various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 697, 700-01, 923 A.2d 971. Before trial, Pulte reached a settlement agreement with all defendants, except Parex. <em>Id. </em>at 704-05, 923 A.2d 971. At trial, the jury was given a special interrogatory, providing: \u201cIn the event you have found that any damages are due Pulte Home Corporation, do you find that Pulte homes has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it should be awarded further damages for pre-trial interest?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708, 923 A.2d 971. The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question, and the trial judge calculated prejudgment interest against Parex. <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 923 A.2d 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Parex appealed and argued that the trial court erred by accepting the jury\u2019s finding that Pulte was entitled to prejudgment interest, and by awarding pre-judgment interest based on the jury\u2019s finding that Parex was liable for $50,000 in damages as to each of twenty-three homes. <em>Id. </em>at 770, 923 A.2d 971. Speaking through Judge Arrie W. Davis, we reversed the award of prejudgment interest, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">In this case, Pulte\u2019s entitlement to pre-judgment interest was not a matter of right but rather was within the discretion of the jury as fact finder. Because the only claims that went to the jury were the assigned breach of implied warranty claims of Coronado and CSS, it was essential that, in exercising its discretion to award pre-judgment interest, the jury determine whether Parex\u2019s \u201cobligation to pay and the amount due had become certain, definite, and liquidated by a specific date prior to judgment,\u201d and if so when that payment should have been made. <em>Buxton, </em>363 Md. at 656 [770 A.2d 152], Pulte[ ] posits that Parex became obligated to pay Coronado and CSS on the date the consent judgments against them were entered, and that the trial court correctly calculated the pre-judgment interest from \u201cPulte\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>date of payment.\u201d Even assuming that there was one single date of payment for repairs to all twenty-three homes for which the jury determined damages, Pulte\u2019s position is untenable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">Clearly, Parex has consistently denied liability for any portion of the damages. The fact that Coronado and CSS settled with Pulte and permitted the entries of consent judgments against them could not render Parex\u2019s obligation to pay the applicators \u201ccertain, definite, and liquidated\u201d by any \u201cspecific date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dispute as to liability was legitimate, and it denied Coronado and CSS \u2014 and therefore Pulte \u2014 an absolute right to interest and left the matter to the discretion of the fact-finder. <em>See Gordon [v. Posner</em>], 142 Md.App. [399,] 438 [790 A.2d 675, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">The jury determined that Pulte, as assignee of Coronado and CSS, was entitled to pre-judgment interest. As we explained in Part IV of our discussion of Parex\u2019s cross-appeal, however, Pulte presented no evidence to the jury regarding the settlement. Although ample evidence was presented from which the jury could determine that Coronado and CSS were liable to Pulte for the damages to the relevant homes, the jury was never told when, if ever, Coronado and CSS paid Pulte for repairs, or how much, if anything, they paid. There was simply no basis for the jury\u2019s decision that Coronado and CSS \u2014 and thus Pulte \u2014 \u25a0 were entitled to interest for the loss of income from funds paid out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 771-72, 923 A.2d 971 (footnote omitted). This Court reasoned that although evidence of the settlement agreements reached prior to trial could form the basis for a jury to find that the sum due to Pulte was certain by a specific date, no such evidence was before the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 772, 923 A.2d 971. The lack of evidence of the settlement agreements left Parex\u2019s obligation to pay Pulte unliquidated and uncertain. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In a case such as this, following the principles drawn from the authorities discussed above, we hold that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>breach of contract damages are unliquidated or not reasonably ascertainable until the verdict, a party is not entitled to a discretionary determination on the issue of prejudgment interest by the jury, prior to the verdict in the case. Prior to the verdict in this case, the amount of damages, if any, due DMJM was not liquidated or reasonably ascertainable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The counts submitted to the jury included the County\u2019s breach of contract and negligence claims against DMJM, and DMJM\u2019s Counterclaim for breach of contract against the County. DMJM\u2019s Exhibit 532, in support of prejudgment interest, consisted of fifty-six (56) invoices spanning from January 8, 2001, to November 1, 2005. The Exhibit specified that the County sent checks in response to forty-one (41) of these invoices spanning from March 1, 2001 to February 23, 2004. The spreadsheet indicated that the County had not paid for the remaining fifteen (15) invoices listed. Based on this information, DMJM calculated fifty-six (56) different amounts owed as prejudgment interest, ranging from $0 to $57,125.49. The County contended, in part, that some amounts were not paid at certain times due to offsets claimed by the County.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Any amount due and owing DMJM was not reasonably ascertainable or liquidated until the verdict. As a result, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury prior to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">After reviewing the jury instruction and the evidence, namely DMJM\u2019s Exhibit 532, we do not believe the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction was an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>discretion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The instruction above advised the jury it could award prejudgment interest from \u201cthe date upon which you determine the County\u2019s obligation to pay and the amount were certain.\u201d The instruction implied there was a single date upon which the County became obligated to pay a single specific amount. DMJM provided as a basis of its prejudgment interest claim a spreadsheet listing various amounts and dates on which these amounts were due, rather than one amount due at one specific time. Although DMJM wrote in its reply brief to this Court, \u201c[its] claim, which consisted of various separate additional service items along with the undisputed base contract balance, was indeed capable of ascertainment at all relevant times,\u201d the requested instruction did not convey this concept to the jury. The requested jury instruction inadequately explained that DMJM sought prejudgment interest for different amounts due at different times. The requested jury instruction did not address how the jury was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>determine prejudgment interest in the face of the County\u2019s contention that certain amounts were not paid at certain times due to offsets claimed by the County. We conclude that the decision not to instruct on prejudgment interest prior to the verdict was proper as the damages amount was not liquidated or reasonably ascertainable until the verdict, and the requested instruction was not consistent with the evidence generated at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Having addressed the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury, prior to verdict, the question becomes whether the trial court erred in not submitting the issue to the jury, after the jury returned the verdict awarding DMJM $1,653,600.88. On return of the verdict, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">THE COURT: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, that concludes the process of the taking of the verdict. If you will step back into the Jury room, I\u2019ll be back in just a minute to have a chat with you and then release you. Thank you for your service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">* H* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">[DMJM\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, before we leave, in light of the Jury\u2019s decision on the breach of contract claim by DMJM against the County, Your Honor had reserved the prejudgment interest issue. In the intervening time period between now and whenever, is there anything we need to do or is that simply going to be something you are going to do as part of entering the verdict in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aic\">THE COURT: I would ask for a memo on that from you and if [the County\u2019s counsel] chooses to respond, he may, with updated calculation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Once the jury returned the verdict, DMJM did not renew the request that the issue of prejudgment interest be submitted to the jury, but rather, asked if this was something the court would do as part of entering the verdict in the case. In response, the trial judge asked for a memorandum from DMJM. At no point after the verdict did DMJM ask the trial court to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>As such, we find that DMJM has not preserved for our review the question of whether the trial court was required to submit the issue of prejudgment interest to the jury after return of the verdict.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY DENYING THE COUNTY\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT IS REVERSED, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DMJM IN THE AMOUNT OF $966,022.00 FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED AS TO THE DENIAL OF PREJUDGMENT INTEREST; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE/CROSS-APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">.
