On March 14, 2010, appellant moved the children from Maryland to South Carolina without informing appellee. After the Circuit Court for Caroline County issued an ex parte order awarding appellee sole custody of the children, appellee traveled to South Carolina and retrieved the children. Thereafter, two hearings were held before the circuit court \u2014 an emergency hearing on April 9, 2010, and a merits hearing on July 22 and July 27, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Following the merits hearing, the circuit court awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of the children to appellee, with visitation granted to appellant. This appeal arises from orders of the court regarding: (1) the appointment of the children\u2019s best interest attorney as the \u201ctie-breaker\u201d to resolve any future disagreements between the parties regarding their children; (2) the payment of the best interest attorney\u2019s outstanding legal fees; (3) the best interest attorney\u2019s authority to decide how to apportion her legal fees between the parties in future disputes; and (4) the payment of appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">I. Did the circuit court err by designating the minor children\u2019s best interest attorney as the \u201ctie-breaker\u201d decision-maker if the parties cannot reach a mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>agreement on future disputes regarding the minor children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">II. Did the circuit court err in holding the parties jointly and severally liable for the outstanding legal fees of by the minor children\u2019s best interest attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">III. Did the circuit court err by delegating authority to the minor children\u2019s best interest attorney to apportion between the parties any legal fees that she incurs in resolving future disputes regarding the minor children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">IV. Did the circuit court err by ordering appellant to pay appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">For the forgoing reasons, we shall affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The parties are the parents of two minor children, Brandon, born on November 13, 1994, and Jacob, born on October 4, 1996. The parties were divorced on June 25, 2001. In an order filed on December 17, 2003, the circuit court awarded the parties joint legal and physical custody of the children. The order provided that, during the school year, appellant would have the children \u201cfrom five o\u2019clock p.m. Sunday, until the end of the school day on Thursday,\u201d and appellee would have the children overnight on Thursdays. Also during the school year, each party would have the children on alternate weekends \u201cfrom five o\u2019clock p.m. Friday, until five o\u2019clock p.m. Sunday.\u201d Pursuant to the order, appellee was granted physical custody of the children for eight weeks during the summer, with appellant to have the children for two weeks each summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">In August 2009, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Joan Cutchin, moved from Maryland to South Carolina to take a new job. Appellant continued to reside in Maryland, but visited Cutchin in South Carolina every other weekend. Although appellant did not have immediate plans to move to South Carolina, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>testified that he informed appellee that such a move \u201cwas a possibility.\u201d Appellant also informed Brandon and Jacob that he was looking for a house in South Carolina and that they were \u201cgoing to move down there\u201d if Cutchin\u2019s job \u201cstay[ed] stable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On March 14, 2010, appellant moved Brandon and Jacob to South Carolina. Brandon and Jacob were not made aware of the move until after they arrived in South Carolina. In addition, appellant did not notify appellee of his plans to move the children to South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On March 16, 2010, appellee contacted Brandon\u2019s and Jacob\u2019s schools and was informed that their records had been transferred to schools in South Carolina. Appellee called appellant twice that day, once at 12:00 p.m. and a second time at 6:30 p.m., but appellant did not answer his telephone. After meeting with school administrators, appellee learned that the children had moved to South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On March 17, 2010, appellee filed a Motion for Emergency Hearing and for Ex Parte Relief and a Petition for Contempt in the circuit court. The next day, the court issued an ex parte order awarding appellee sole legal and physical custody of the children and permitting her to travel to South Carolina to retrieve the children. Appellee then drove to South Carolina, picked the children up from the schools that they were attending, and drove them back to Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">On April 2, 2010, appellant answered appellee\u2019s Motion for Emergency Hearing and for Ex Parte Relief and Petition for Contempt. On April 8, 2010, appellee filed a Motion for Modification of Custody and Child Support. Appellant then filed a Petition to Modify Child Custody, Visitation, and Child Support on April 9, 2010, which requested that the court \u201c[mjodify the Order entered on December 17, 2003\u201d and award appellant \u201csole legal and physical custody of the minor children of the parties, both <em>pendente lite </em>and permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">A hearing was held before the circuit court on April 9, 2010. Upon consideration of the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the court issued a <em>pendente lite </em>order holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>appellant in contempt of the December 17, 2008 custody order. Thereafter, on July 22 and July 27, 2010, the court held a merits hearing on the parties\u2019 respective motions for modification of custody and support. The court received evidence from both parties and heard arguments from counsel, as well as argument from Leigh Melton, Esq., the best interest attorney appointed by the court to represent the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">The first observation is that the move to South Carolina by [appellant] ... was a material change in circumstances since the Order of ... December the l[7]th, 2003. Now this Court is seriously concerned about how [appellant] went about that move. He did so without telling [appellee], he didn\u2019t even tell the boys. He packed them up and move[d] them to South Carolina. He says because of financial reasons, because his significant other obtained a job after being [ ] unsuccessful in getting a job here, took a job in South Carolina. And that may very well be, but the way it was handled was clearly inappropriate and certainly suggests to this Court something about [appellant] that is now rather eviden[t]. [Appellant] wants to have his way and only his way and it\u2019s either my way or the highway with [appellant]. Unfortunately, [appellant\u2019s conduct [ ] violates the Order of December [ ] 17th, 2003. And with a Court Order it is not my way or the highway, it is a[n] Order of this Court that must be obeyed and must be adhered to.... [Appellant] took it upon himself to violate the Order and he\u2019s taken it upon himself to move to South Carolina and he\u2019s going to have to live with the consequences of that decision.... This Court is convinced that the parents cannot cooperate, that is well demonstrated, amply shown by the behavior of the parents throughout the life of this case. The father is over controlling, he\u2019s obsessive about control. He\u2019s a bully. Mom, [appellee] is inconsistent in what she does with these children. She lacks discipline. She needs to be a better parent, but primarily both parities [sic] have lost the fine art of communicating with each other over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>what\u2019s best for these boys, so the essential parenting skill is not here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In an order filed on August 13, 2010, the court awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of the children to appellee, with visitation for appellant. The order further provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">ORDERED, that except in emergencies, the parties shall communicate through e-mail and any contentious matters or disputed e-mail issues shall be forwarded to the attorney for the minor children, Leigh R. Melton, Esquire, for her review. In the event [appellant] and [appellee] cannot reach a mutual agreement on any disputed matter regarding the minor children within twenty-four (24) hours, then the attorney for the minor children shall serve as the \u201ctie-breaker\u201d and resolve the dispute, it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">ORDERED, that both [appellant] and [appellee] shall be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of all fees and costs incurred by counsel for the minor children, Leigh R. Melton, Esquire, in the resolution of any disputes between them regarding the minor children, as apportioned by counsel for the minor children, it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">ORDERED, that [appellant] shall pay the sum of Five Thousand dollars ($5,000.00) towards [appellee]\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees within ninety (90) days of this Order, it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">ORDERED, that [appellant] and [appellee] shall be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of all outstanding fees and costs incurred by the minor children\u2019s attorney, Leigh R. Melton, Esquire, in the amount of $5,568.75 ($1,000.00 of which was prepaid in trust and is now released from trust) said balance of fees and costs in the amount of $4,568.75 to be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">This timely appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Our review of the circuit court\u2019s judgment is governed by Maryland Rule 8-131(c). As this case was tried without a jury, we \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Rule 8-131(c). We \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The clearly erroneous standard does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Karsenty v. Schoukroun, </em>406 Md. 469, 502, 959 A.2d 1147 (2008). \u201cWhere a case involves the application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a de novo standard of review.\u201d <em>Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 554, 954 A.2d 1092 (2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The Court\u2019s Designation of the Best Interest Attorney as a \u201cTie-Breaker\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">On appeal, appellant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court committed legal error by appointing the minor children\u2019s Best Interest Attorney as the \u2018tie-breaker\u2019 decision-maker if the parties are not able to reach an agreement.\u201d Relying on <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332 (2001), and <em>Shapiro v. Shapiro, </em>54 Md.App. 477, 458 A.2d 1257, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 655 (1983), appellant contends that the court \u201cimproperly delegated judicial authority to the Best Interest Attorney, a non-judicial person.\u201d Thus appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s appointment of the Best Interest Attorney as the \u2018tiebreaker\u2019 ... should be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Appellee counters that the court did not err by appointing the best interest attorney as the \u201ctie-breaker.\u201d Citing <em>Meyr v. Meyr, </em>195 Md.App. 524, 7 A.3d 125 (2010), appellee claims that, \u201cwhere the delegation of authority is related to ancillary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>matters and the Court retains judicial review of the decisions concerning those issues, it is not improper delegation.\u201d Ap-pellee points out that the trial judge in the present matter \u201cgranted sole legal and primary physical custody of the minor children to Appellee\u201d and \u201cdid not state that the authority of the Best Interest Attorney extended to matters of custody and visitation.\u201d Accordingly, appellee contends that there was not an improper delegation of judicial decision-making authority to the best interest attorney. We agree with appellant and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u201cThe question whether a court has improperly delegated judicial authority to a non-judicial person is an issue of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Meyr, </em>195 Md.App. at 546, 7 A.3d 125. Maryland cases have made clear that a court may not delegate to a non-judicial person decisions regarding child visitation and custody. <em>See In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 704, 782 A.2d 332 (\u201c[A] trial court may not delegate judicial authority to determine the visitation rights of parents to a non-judicial agency or person.\u201d); <em>Shapiro, </em>54 Md.App. at 484, 458 A.2d 1257 (\u201cJurisdiction over custody and visitation, as well as guardianship, legitimation, maintenance and support of children, is vested in the equity courts. There is no authority for the delegation of any portion of such jurisdiction to someone outside the court.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court issued an order on August 13, 2010, which stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[i]n the event [appellant] and [appellee] cannot reach a mutual agreement <em>on any disputed matter regarding the minor children </em>within twenty-four (24) hours, then the attorney for the minor children shall serve as the \u2018tie-breaker\u2019 and resolve the dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added). The issue we must address is whether the delegation of authority to Melton, a non-judicial person, to resolve \u201cany disputed matter regarding the minor children\u201d was permissible. <em>Meyr </em>is instructive in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In <em>Meyr, </em>the trial court awarded the parties, appellee wife and appellant husband, a limited divorce. 195 Md.App. at 541, 7 A.3d 125. The court also issued an Order Regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Custody and Visitation, which awarded primary physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor children to the appellant, with visitation granted to the appellee. <em>Id. </em>The order included a provision authorizing the children\u2019s best interest attorney \u201cto coordinate the children\u2019s reunification therapy with [the appel-lee], for as long as she deems said therapy is needed by the family, or until she petitions to the Court to be relieved for said duties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On appeal, this Court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe trial court exceeded its authority when it delegated to the best interest attorney the decision of how long family reunification therapy [wa]s to continue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 549, 7 A.8d 125 (quotations omitted). We stated that the trial court, in its Order Regarding Custody and Visitation, \u201cresolved the primary issues relating to custody and visitation, and its delegation of authority to [the best interest attorney] involved merely the coordination of family reunification therapy, <em>a matter ancillary to custody and visitation.\u201d Id. </em>at 549, 7 A.3d 125 (emphasis added). Additionally, we observed that \u201c[t]he trial court expressly stated that [the best interest attorney]\u2019s authority to oversee the therapy was \u2018subject to supervision and modification by\u2019 the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded that the appellant\u2019s claim of error was without merit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Unlike <em>Meyr, </em>the court in the case <em>sub judice </em>did not limit Melton\u2019s decision-making authority to \u201cancillary\u201d matters. Indeed, the court\u2019s August 13, 2010 order delegated broad authority to Melton to resolve <em>\u201cany </em>disputed matter regarding the minor children.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>court did not indicate that Melton\u2019s authority to resolve \u201cany disputed matter regarding the minor children\u201d was subject to the court\u2019s review or modification. Thus we conclude that the court erred by delegating judicial authority to Melton, a nonjudicial person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall vacate that portion of the court\u2019s August IB, 2010 order designating Melton as the \u201ctie-breaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The Parties\u2019 Joint and Several Responsibility for the Payment of the Best Interest Attorney\u2019s Costs and Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in \u201cholding the parties[ ] jointly and severally hable\u201d for the payment of Melton\u2019s outstanding legal fees. According to appellant, making both parties jointly and severally liable for said fees \u201cwill serve only to cause more litigation between the parties\u201d and \u201cmay lead to animus between a party and the Best Interest Attorney.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Preliminarily, we note that appellant\u2019s brief does not comply with Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 504(a)(5), in that it contains no citations to legal authority in support of appellant\u2019s argument. <em>See, e.g., Rollins v. Capital Plaza Assocs., L.P., </em>181 Md.App. 188, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>201, 955 A.2d 869 (holding that the appellant\u2019s brief violated Rule 8-504(a)(5) because it did not contain citations to legal authority in support of her position), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 746, 962 A.2d 372 (2008); <em>Kramer v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>124 Md.App. 616, 633-34 n. 4, 723 A.2d 529 (refusing to address the appellant\u2019s contention because the appellant violated Rule 8-504(a)(o) by failing to support his contention with citation to legal authority and argument), <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 114, 729 A.2d 405 (1999). Notwithstanding this violation, we shall exercise our discretion to address the merits of appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 l-202(a)(l) of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d), states that, \u201c[i]n an action in which custody[ ] [or] visitation rights ... [are] contested, the court may ... appoint a lawyer who shall serve as a best interest attorney to represent the minor child.\u201d Subsection (a)(2) of the statute provides that \u201cthe court <em>may ... </em>impose counsel fees against one or more parties to the action.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus the statute expressly provides that the court may, in its discretion, impose attorney\u2019s fees against either or both parties as is just and proper under the circumstances. This discretion, in our view, necessarily includes the authority to decide the manner in which the attorney\u2019s fees are to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In the instant case, the court\u2019s August 13, 2010 order stated \u201cthat [appellant] and [appellee] [were] jointly and severally responsible for the payment of all outstanding fees and costs incurred by the minor children\u2019s attorney.\u201d In its oral opinion rendered at the conclusion of the merits hearing on July 27, 2010, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">The parties will also pay equally all attorney\u2019s fees that are due Mrs. Melton and that obligation will be joint and several. That means that Mrs. Melton can seek payment in full from one party and the other party will have to get it out of the other party. In other words that obligation is joint and several. I want Mrs. Melton paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Given the discretion accorded by F.L. \u00a7 l-202(a)(2) and the above rationale, we see no error or abuse of discretion by the trial court in imposing joint and several liability on the parties for Melton\u2019s outstanding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Best Interest Attorney\u2019s Authority to Apportion her Legal Fees in Future Disputes</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred \u201cby ordering that the Best Interest Attorney make the determination on how to apportion her legal fees between the parties for future disputes.\u201d Appellant claims that F.L. \u00a7 l-202(a)(2) \u201cdoes not provide that [a] court may appoint a third party, a non-judicial person, to impose, and apportion, those fees.\u201d Because we are vacating that portion of the court\u2019s August 13, 2010 order designating Melton as the \u201ctie-breaker,\u201d Melton will not actually incur any future costs or fees in that capacity. Accordingly, the issue of whether the court erred by delegating the authority to the minor children\u2019s best interest attorney to decide the apportionment of her legal fees between the parties for resolving future disputes is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Award of Appellee\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Finally, appellant argues that the trial court \u201cerr[ed] by awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to [F.L.] \u00a7 9-105 and [F.L.] \u00a7 12-103 because it failed to consider the statutory criteria.\u201d Specifically, appellant claims that the court \u201cfailed to consider that Appellee had not exercised Thursday night visitation for years prior to the children\u2019s move to South Carolina, and that, therefore, Appellee would not be losing visitation.\u201d Appellant further contends that the court \u201cmade no findings as to the financial status of either party, the needs of each party, or whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining or defending the proceeding.\u201d Lastly, appellant asserts that the court \u201ccould not find that there was [an] unjustifiable denial or interference with Appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>visitation with the minor children,\u201d because appellant \u201ctestified that the children would be returned to Maryland for their alternate weekend visitation with Appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In response, appellee argues that the trial court considered each of the statutory criteria set forth in F.L. \u00a7 12-103(b). Appellee contends that the court \u201ctook into consideration the financial situation of each party as well as their financial needs in his ruling on Custody as well as Attorney\u2019s Fees.\u201d Appellee points to the court having \u201cin evidence exhibits related to the financial resources of the parties, as well as testimony from each party on their finances.\u201d Additionally, appellee asserts that the court considered \u201cAppellee\u2019s substantial justification in brin[g]ing the action in order to obtain Appellant\u2019s compliance with [the Custody] Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Alternatively, appellee contends that the trial court \u201chad the authority to assess costs or counsel fees\u201d against appellant under F.L. \u00a7 9-105. Appellee asserts that appellant, \u201c[i]n violating the Court Order and moving the children to South Carolina, 8 to 10 hours away,\u201d \u201cunjustifiably infringed\u201d upon appellee\u2019s visitation rights. We agree with appellee and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">As previously noted, the court\u2019s August 13, 2010 order stated \u201cthat [appellant] shall pay the sum of Five Thousand dollars ($5,000.00) towards [appellee]\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees within ninety (90) days of this Order[.]\u201d \u201cThe award of counsel fees is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. A circuit court\u2019s decision in this regard will not be reversed unless a court\u2019s discretion was exercised arbitrarily or the judgment was clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Meyr, </em>195 Md.App. at 552, 7 A.3d 125 (citations and quotations omitted). \u201cAlthough the general rule is that \u2018each party is responsible for its own legal fees,\u2019 a court may order one party to pay the other party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to statute or by an express agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">One statute that permits the court, within its discretion, to award attorney\u2019s fees is F.L. \u00a7 9-105, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>In any custody or visitation proceeding, if the court determines that a party to a custody or visitation order has unjustifiably denied or interfered with visitation granted by a custody or visitation order, the court may ... take any or all of the following actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(3) assess costs or counsel fees against the party who has unjustifiably denied or interfered with visitation rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court, in a <em>pendente lite </em>order filed on April 14, 2010, held appellant in contempt of the December 17, 2003 custody order. At the conclusion of the July 27, 2010 hearing, the court specifically found that appellant\u2019s conduct in moving the minor children to South Carolina \u201cviolatefd] the [Custody] Order of December [] 17th, 2003\u201d and constituted \u201ca material change in circumstances since the Order of ... December [ ] l[7]th, 2003.\u201d The court also stated that it was \u201cseriously concerned about how [appellant] went about that move,\u201d because \u201c[h]e did so without telling [appellee], he didn\u2019t even tell the boys. He packed them up and move[d] them to South Carolina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Moreover, the court stated that it was \u201cnot persuaded by [appellant's explanation that he thought that the [December 17, 2003] Order ... permitted him because he had primary physical custody to do whatever he wanted to.\u201d According to the court, appellant \u201chad the benefit of legal counsel,\u201d and therefore the court \u201cd[id] not believe [that appellant] did not understand what that Order meant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In our view, by moving the children to South Carolina without notifying appellee, appellant clearly interfered -with appellee\u2019s visitation rights. The fact that appellee did not exercise her right to visitation on Thursday evenings under the December 17, 2003 order does not mean, as appellant argues, that his actions did not interfere with appellee\u2019s visitation granted by such order. Appellant\u2019s clandestine removal of the children from Maryland to South Carolina deprived appellee of her <em>right </em>to visitation with the children every Thursday evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Furthermore, appellant\u2019s interference was unjustifiable, as indicated by the court\u2019s finding of contempt and its determination that appellee violated the December 17, 2003 custody order. Although the court did not specifically discuss the statutory requirements under F.L. \u00a7 9-105 in awarding appel-lee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, the court\u2019s oral opinion set forth its findings regarding appellant\u2019s unjustifiable interference with appellee\u2019s visitation rights. <em>See Meyr, </em>195 Md.App. at 553-54, 7 A.3d 125 (holding that the trial court did not err in failing to \u201cspecifically recite the statutory factors in its award of attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d because the court\u2019s memorandum opinion demonstrated that it had considered the factors). Therefore, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees against appellant under F.L. \u00a7 9-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Because we have determined that the court\u2019s award of appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees was appropriate under F.L. \u00a7 9-105, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments concerning whether the court\u2019s award of the same attorney\u2019s fees was proper under F.L. \u00a7 12-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLANT AND 50% BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 1-202(a)(1) of the Family Law Article (\"F.L.\u201d), permits trial courts to \"appoint a lawyer who shall serve as a best interest attorney to represent the minor child\u201d in contested child custody and child visitation cases. We note, however, that F.L. \u00a7 1-202 does not expressly authorize trial courts to continue the appointment of a best interest attorney following the entry of an order resolving the custody or visitation dispute. Furthermore, the Maryland Rules define and set out the responsibilities of a child\u2019s best interest attorney. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules, Appendix: Maryland Guidelines for Practice for Court-Appointed Lawyers Representing Children in Cases Involving Child Custody or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Child Access. The Guidelines focus exclusively on the responsibilities of a child's best interest attorney <em>during the pendency of the custody or visitation action. See id. </em>at 1.1, 2.1-2.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">. Effective July 1, 2011, the Court of Appeals adopted a new rule, Rule 9-205.2, entitled Parenting Coordination. Under the rule, the circuit court may appoint a parenting coordinator during the pendency of an action in which the custody of or visitation with a child of the parties is in issue. Rule 9-205.2(f)(/). The court may also appoint a parenting coordinator upon entry of a judgment granting or modifying custody or visitation, <em>with the consent of the parties and after a hearing. </em>Rule 9-205.2(f)(2) (emphasis added). In the post-judgment context, a parenting coordinator is authorized by the rule to, <em>inter alia, </em>decide disputes by \"making minor, temporary modifications to child access provisions ordered by the court,\u201d if such decision making is authorized by court order and the parties have agreed to the same in writing or on the record. Rule 9-205.2(g)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
