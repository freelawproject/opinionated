The manure contains nutrients that, if improperly managed, contribute to water quality problems for lakes, rivers, and groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>both federal and state law prohibit discharges of pollutants to water, except as authorized by permit. The challenge here is to the decision by MDE to issue a General Discharge Permit for AFOs (the \u201cGP\u201d). The GP authorizes certain discharges, but it imposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>requirements regarding the management of manure and its application as fertilizer. Both parties have represented that the GP primarily impacts poultry farms on the Eastern Shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Appellants, Assateague Coastkeepers, Waterkeeper Alliance, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper, and Charles and Betty Schelts, acknowledge some benefit from the GP, in that it imposes restrictions on entities that were not otherwise restricted, but they contend that the GP is not stringent enough.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argue that the GP allows discharge of pollutants in violation of federal law, and it fails to address adequately the problem of animal waste threatening \u201cthe quality of the waters of the nation\u201d and of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Appellants challenged the GP pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2004 RepLVol., 2009 Supp.) \u00a7 10-201 <em>ei seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). After a decision by an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) in MDE\u2019s favor, to which appellants filed exceptions, the Final Decision Maker (\u201cFDM\u201d) of MDE found that the promulgation of the GP was in accord with state and federal law and it was not arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the FDM granted MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the decision of the FDM.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Appellants presented seven questions for our review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have consolidated and rephrased these questions, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>properly before this Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">1. Did the FDM err: (a) in failing to find that the decision to promulgate the GP was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence; and (b) in granting MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision when there was a dispute of material fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">2. Does the GP violate federal regulations governing water quality standards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">3. Is the GP less stringent than federal law because it fails to regulate all AFOs that meet the federal definition of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AHV\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">Federal Regulatory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Congress enacted the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) in 1972 to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (2008). Among its core provisions, the CWA prohibits the \u201cdischarge of any pollutant\u201d to waters of the United States, except as authorized by a permit issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1251(a)(1), 1311(a), 1342(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The term \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d means \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(12). A \u201cpoint source\u201d is defined as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance,\u201d including any container or \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operation\u201d (\u201cCAFO\u201d) \u201cfrom which pollutants are or may be discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(14). An AFO becomes a CAFO in two ways: (1) automatically, if it confines a certain number of animals; and (2) if it is specifically designated as a CAFO based on a determination that it is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United States. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.23(b)-(c) (2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Agricultural storm water runoff is excluded as a discharge requiring an NPDES permit. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>CWA regulates discharges to surface water; it does not regulate discharges to ground water because ground water does not qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d <em>See Rice v. Harken Exploration Co., </em>250 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Federal regulations regarding CAFOs have evolved through the years. In 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) expanded the definition of CAFO to include poultry operations utilizing a dry manure handling system. <em>See </em>National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), 68 Fed. Reg. 7176, 7179-80, 7192 (Feb. 12, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently summarized the regulations in effect in 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">Under the 2003 Rule, all CAFOs were required to apply for an NPDES permit whether or not they discharged. 68 Fed.Reg. 7176, 7266 (Feb. 12, 2003). Specifically, every CAFO was assumed to have a \u201cpotential to discharge\u201d and had to apply for an NPDES permit. <em>Id. </em>at 7266-67. However, an option built into the Rule permitted a CAFO to request from the EPA a \u201cno potential to discharge\u201d determination. <em>Id. </em>If the CAFO proved that it did not have the potential to discharge, the CAFO was not required to seek a permit. <em>Id. </em>The 2003 Rule also expanded the definition of exempt \u201cagricultural stormwater discharge\u201d to include land application discharge, if the land application comported with appropriate site-specific nutrient management practices. <em>Id. </em>at 7198. However, if the land application was not in compliance with those practices, the land application discharge would be an unpermitted discharge in violation of the CWA. <em>Id. </em>at 7197.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Furthermore, the 2003 Rule created a mandatory duty for all CAFOs, applying for a permit, to develop and implement a site-specific Nutrient Management Plan (NMP). <em>Id. </em>at 7176. An NMP required a CAFO to establish \u201cbest management practices\u201d (BMPs). <em>Id. </em>at 7213-14. The BMPs were designed to ensure adequate storage of manure and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>wastewater, proper management of mortalities and chemicals, and appropriate site-specific protocols for land application. <em>Id. </em>at 7176. The BMPs were neither reviewed by the EPA nor were they included in the terms of a CAFO\u2019s permit to discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><em>Nat\u2019l Pork Producers Council v. EPA, </em>635 F.3d 738, 744 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In 2005, in <em>Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA, </em>399 F.3d 486, 504-06 (2d Cir.2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the EPA had no authority to require CAFOs to apply for a permit based on a \u201cpotential to discharge.\u201d It held that the CWA \u201cgives the EPA jurisdiction to regulate and control only <em>actual </em>discharges \u2014 not potential discharges, and certainly not point sources themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. The court also held that the 2003 Rule violated the CWA in failing to require that NMPs be included in NPDES permits. <em>Id. </em>at 502.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>In response to the <em>Waterkeeper </em>decision, the EPA promulgated new regulations in 2008, requiring CAFOs to obtain a NPDES permit if they discharge or \u201cpropose to discharge.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Revised National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in Response to the <em>Waterkeeper </em>Decision; Final Rule. 73 Fed.Reg. 70418, 70421-22 (Nov. 20, 2008) (codified at 40 C.F.R. pts. 9, 122, 412). The 2008 rule also required a CAFO seeking a permit to submit a NMP, and it required the permitting authority to review the NMP, provide the public the opportunity to comment, and incorporate the terms of the NMP as an element of the NPDES permit. <em>Id. </em>at 70422.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Additional challenges were made regarding the propriety of the 2008 rule. On March 15, 2011, after the briefs were filed in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered its decision in <em>National Pork Producers Council, </em>635 F.3d at 750-51, striking down provisions of the 2008 rule. As relevant to this appeal, the court struck down provisions of the CWA that required CAFOs to obtain a NPDES permit if they \u201cpropose to discharge\u201d and imposed liability for a failure to apply. <em>Id. </em>The court held that \u201cthe EPA\u2019s authority is limited to the regulation of CAFOs that discharge,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny attempt to do otherwise exceeds the EPA\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Thus, pursuant to federal law, only CAFOs that discharge pollutants are required to apply for a NPDES permit. To obtain a NPDES permit, however, applicants are required to develop and implement NMPs to limit the discharge of pollutants to water.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The CWA contains other provisions to protect water quality, including limiting the issuance of a discharge permit if waters within a State\u2019s borders are identified as impaired by pollutants. The CWA requires that states develop water quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>standards for water bodies within their boundaries. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(e)(2)(A) (requiring standards sufficient to \u201cprotect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act\u201d). It also requires states to identify those waters within its borders that are impaired by one or more pollutants. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1313(d)(1)(A). For those impaired waters, states are directed to establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (\u201cTMDL\u201d) for each impairing pollutant that can be accommodated by the water body without violating water quality standards and to allocate the available load to existing and future sources. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1313(d)(1)(C).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">All NPDES permits must ensure that permitted discharges comply with all applicable water quality standards for the body of water that receives the discharge. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1342(a)(1). To this end, federal regulations prohibit the issuance of an NPDES permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">To a new source or a new discharger, if the discharge from its construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards. The owner or operator of a new source or new discharger proposing to discharge into a water segment which does not meet applicable water quality standards or is not expected to meet those standards even after the application of the effluent limitations required by sections 301(b)(1)(A) and 301(b)(1)(B) of CWA, and for which the State or interstate agency has performed a pollutants load allocation for the pollutant to be discharged, must demonstrate, before the close of the public comment period, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">(1) There are sufficient remaining pollutant load allocations to allow for the discharge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">(2) The existing dischargers into that segment are subject to compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with applicable water quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>standards. The Director may waive the submission of information by the new source or new discharger required by paragraph (i) of this section if the Director determines that the Director already has adequate information to evaluate the request. An explanation of the development of limitations to meet the criteria of this paragraph (i)(2) is to be included in the fact sheet to the permit under \u00a7 124.56(b)(1) of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(h)(2)\u00ae.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Maryland Regulatory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">MDE is charged with \u201cmanaging, improving, controlling and conserving the waters of Maryland.\u201d <em>Northwest Land Corp. v.

The 1996 GP did not authorize discharges of wastewater to surface water, and it did not set forth any regulations regarding dry manure handling systems. <em>Id. </em>Parts I.B-C. To be covered under the 1996 GP, an applicant needed only to submit an application and a Notice of Intent (\u201cNOI\u201d), and pay the required fees. <em>Id. </em>Part III.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The 1996 GP expired on December 17, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">MDE subsequently established a new permit scheme for AFOs, CAFOs, and Maryland Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cMAFOs\u201d). On September 12, 2008, MDE published a tentative determination regarding the GP at issue here. 35:19 Md. Reg. 1737 (Sept. 12, 2008). The GP established two categories of AFOs. The first category, CAFOs, are AFOs that discharge to surface waters, which are covered by the CWA and must obtain a NPDES permit issued by MDE. GP, Part I.A1; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>COMAR 26.08.03.09B(3) (2009). The second category, an AFO that qualifies as a CAFO under federal regulations, but does not discharge or propose to discharge to surface water, is classified as a MAFO. <em>Id. </em>26.08.03.09B(l)(d). MAFOs are not required to obtain a NPDES permit because they do not discharge to surface water. The State discharge permit required for MAFOs addresses groundwater; it does not permit discharges to surface water. <em>Id. </em>26.08.03.09C(5)(c)-(6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The GP regulations for MAFOs and CAFOs have many of the same requirements. For instance, both operations are subject to public comment on their plans. COMAR 26.08.04.09N(3). Both MAFOs and CAFOs are required to develop a NMP, although CAFOs must develop a Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan (\u201cCNMP\u201d), whereas a MAFO may develop a CNMP or a NMP and a Conservation Plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> GP, Part IV.A.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">One significant difference between MAFOs and CAFOs, however, is with regard to field storage operations. CAFOs can store dry manure in the field, without separating it from ground water and storm water through use of a plastic liner and a cover, for no more than 14 days; MAFOs can store dry manure in the field for up to 90 days.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> GP, Part IV.B.6.b-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">After MDE reached a Final Determination authorizing the GP,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> appellants filed with MDE a petition for a contested hearing, asserting that the GP violated both Maryland and federal law. Specifically, appellants asserted that the GP: (1) \u201callows open storage of poultry litter under conditions that are certain to result in discharges of pollutants to the waters and groundwaters of\u2019 Maryland; and (2) \u201cfails to ensure compliance with water quality standards and TMDL waste load allocations prior to permit coverage approval.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The case was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) for a hearing before an ALJ. On March 30, 2009, MDE filed a Motion for Summary Decision, asserting that the GP was \u201centirely consistent with state and federal law and regulations and reflected] the best scientific information available.\u201d It argued that, \u201cbecause the GP requires compliance with water quality standards and applicable TMDLs,\u201d MDE was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">MDE supported its motion with affidavits from Robert M. Summers, Ph.D., who at that time was Deputy Secretary of MDE, and Dinorah Dalmasy, a Senior Regulatory and Compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>anee Engineer with MDE. Attached to Dr. Summers\u2019 affidavit was a document he prepared, entitled: \u201cBasis for Requirements to Protect Water Quality During Field Storage of Litter Stockpiles in the Maryland General Permit for Animal Feeding Operations,\u201d which explained the rationale and basis for establishing the time limits set forth in the GP regarding field storage of poultry manure.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In this document, Dr. Summers explained that \u201cEPA regulations do not specify a time period for outdoor stockpiling of dry poultry manure, but EPA\u2019s guidance document suggests 14 days is appropriate.\u201d MDE had requested, but the EPA was not able to provide, \u201ctechnical documentation of the factual basis and risk level associated with the 15th day of storage, versus 10 days or 30 days, for example.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">MDE consulted with University of Maryland scientists at the Cooperative Extension Service and the Wye Research Education Center. They advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">[T]he scientific literature regarding loss of nutrients from field storage of poultry litter was not consistent regarding the water quality impact of stockpiles, whether covered or uncovered. They also stressed that it is most important to control runoff from the litter when it is applied to cropland by meeting nutrient management plan requirements for the timing and rate of application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Dr. Summers also noted that the Chesapeake Research Consortium, at the request of the Eastern Shore Agricultural Collaborative and the University of Maryland Environmental Finance Center, had convened a group of scientists to review the scientific data regarding field storage of poultry manure and to develop a consensus as to the appropriate limits on field storage times. Among their recommendations, the scientists concluded: \u201c[TJhere is little difference (in terms of nutrient losses to the surrounding soil) between litter stockpiled for 14 days and litter stockpiled for 190 days.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The panel recommended that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">Temporary stockpiling of poultry litter should be encouraged when other immediate use options (e.g., field applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tion meeting seasonal planting schedules, or regional hydrological cycles, or alternative off-site uses) are not \u00e1vailable, regardless of the length of time required, up to a maximum of 190 days based on documented research trials of 190 days in length.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">(Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Based on the information MDE was able to obtain, and \u201c[a]bsent clear documented evidence of significant water quality impacts between uncovered litter storage of between 14 days and 90 days (and even up to 190 days, according to the Science Panel),\u201d MDE determined that a 30-day limit for unprotected field stockpiling of litter from MAFO permitted operations \u201cwould be protective of water quality.\u201d MDE further determined that the initial 90-day time limit for a 3-year compliance period \u201cwould provide water quality benefits by beginning to restrict field storage and still give the agricultural community time to develop alternatives other than premature field application and/or transfer to unregulated operations.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Ms. Dalmasy also filed an affidavit, explaining MDE\u2019s development of TMDLs for bodies of water in the State that have been identified as impaired by pollutants. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>she asserted that the GP \u201ccontains measures intended to ensure that AFOs/CAFOs/MAFOs discharges do not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">That same day, appellants filed their own motion for summary judgment, asserting that the GP, in permitting MAFOs to store poultry litter and manure for up to 90 days, violated federal and state laws \u201cdesigned to protect both this nation\u2019s and Maryland\u2019s waters.\u201d They argued that the ALJ should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201coverturn\u201d the GP \u201cbecause it is affected by an error of law, is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence, and is arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Appellants argued that MDE\u2019s decision to adopt the GP was \u201cfundamentally flawed for three reasons.\u201d First, they asserted that the GP \u201cconflicts with federal law\u201d because \u201c[i]t allows certain AFOs that would otherwise be classified as a [CAFO] under the [CWA], and therefore likely subject to the [NPDES] permit pursuant to the [CWA], to instead qualify as a MAFO under State law\u201d and maintain open storage of poultry manure for up to 90 days, an action not permitted as a CAFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Second, appellants argued that the GP failed to assure compliance with applicable water quality standards before issuance of permit coverage. They asserted that MDE may not, without sufficient evidence, presume that \u201ccompliance with the technical standards in the Final Permit will assure compliance with all the various water quality standards applicable in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Third, appellants contended that the GP was not based on sufficient evidence. They argued that MDE ignored studies relating to the proper storage of poultry manure and that it \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d Appellants supported their motion with 26 documents, including several scientific studies regarding the implications of poultry manure storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">On April 13, 2009, MDE filed its opposition to appellants\u2019 motion for summary decision. With respect to appellants\u2019 first argument, MDE argued that the GP was consistent with federal law, asserting that it required CAFO permit coverage for every facility that then qualified under the federal program. It noted that MAFOs, by definition, are not CAFOs, and therefore, they are not subject to the same federal requirements. MDE next disputed appellants\u2019 argument that the GP failed to ensure compliance with applicable water quality standards, asserting that \u201cthe NOI process, which requires the preparation of a CAFO-specific [CNMP] and subjects the NOI and related plans to public review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>opportunity for a public hearing, and the process by which [MDE] can require an individual permit, satisfy any legal requirement in this regard.\u201d Finally, MDE argued that its factual findings were based on correct determinations of relevant and material facts. MDE contended that its decision to issue the GP was based on available evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The ALJ did not conduct a hearing on the motions. On May 5, 2009, it issued a proposed decision, denying appellants\u2019 motion for summary decision and granting MDE\u2019s motion. The ALJ initially rejected appellants\u2019 contention that the GP\u2019s open storage provision was inconsistent with federal law, reasoning that, because MAFOs are unregulated at the federal level, MDE\u2019s regulation of them was in excess of its responsibilities under the CWA. It stated that \u201cMDE is not narrowing the definition of CAFOs as the Petitioners suggest, but instead they are expanding the group of AFOs that must submit to some sort of permitting requirement in order to operate and store manure.\u201d The ALJ likewise rejected appellants\u2019 assertion that MDE\u2019s decision to regulate MAFOs differently from CAFOs was arbitrary and capricious, noting that MDE\u2019s decision was based on available scientific information. Finally, the ALJ found that the GP complied with federal regulations governing water quality, noting: (1) all of Maryland\u2019s water quality standards had been approved at that point by the EPA; and (2) the GP was consistent with the existing approved standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On or about May 27, 2009, appellants filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision granting MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision in its favor. Appellants argued that MDE\u2019s regulation of MAFOs \u201censures continued environmental pollution in direct contravention of both federal and state law.\u201d They stated that \u201c[t]he most pointed demonstration of MDE\u2019s violation of federal and state law is the provision that allows MAFOs to store poultry litter outside without a cover or ground liner for up to 90 days (which may be reduced [to] 30 days in three years),\u201d asserting \u201cthe common sense (and scientifically buttressed) observation that large open stockpiles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>of manure exposed to rain events will have devastating impacts on the environment.\u201d They argued that \u201cMDE is out of step with federal and other jurisdictions in fashioning the 90-day rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Appellants set forth four specific exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision. First, they argued that the proposed decision must be vacated on the procedural ground that the ALJ failed to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law. Second, appellants argued that the ALJ\u2019s grant of summary decision was improper because it was based on an incorrect legal standard, asserting that the briefs revealed \u201cobvious disputed issues of material fact\u201d regarding the basis to allow uncovered poultry manure for 90 days. Third, they argued that the ALJ failed to address the issue whether the GP contained measures to ensure that CAFO discharges do not cause or contribute to violations of water quality. Fourth, they asserted that the ALJ \u201crelied upon incorrect statements of fact and law and reached erroneous conclusions.\u201d Appellants requested that the proposed decision be vacated and the case set for a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On August 19, 2009, the FDM heard argument on the exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision granting MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision. On September 2, 2009, it issued a final decision, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">That Petitioners have demonstrated neither an error of law nor a dispute of material fact. MDE\u2019s issuance of the GP is in accord with federal and State law, is supported by substantial evidence, and is not arbitrary and capricious. For these reasons, MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision is granted, and Petitioners\u2019 motion for summary decision is denied.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The FDM noted that, pursuant to the GP, \u201c[b]oth CAFOs and MAFOs are required to comply with certain minimum standards to protect water quality.\u201d The GP regulates discharges \u201cby regulating the management of manure as it is stored, and also when it is land applied as fertilizer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The FDM summarized the substantive differences in the regulations for a CAFO and a MAFO:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u2022 A CAFO\u2019s CNMP must be submitted to [MDE] for approval before the CAFO can be covered by the GP, whereas MAFOs are allowed to submit their plans after obtaining permit coverage.

The litter must, however, be staged or stored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>after it is removed from the chicken house and before it can applied to fields. The field application has long been subject to nutrient management plans under the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. Md. Agrie. Art. Title 8, Subtitle 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">The GP allows CAFOs to store the litter in uncovered piles for up to 14 days. GP, Part IV.B.6.b.

GP, Part IV.B.6.C. Petitioners argue that uncovered storage for more than 14 days converts an AFO with a dry manure handling system to a facility with a liquid manure system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arh-dedup-0\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The FDM recognized that an AFO qualifies as a CAFO with fewer animals if it has a liquid manure system. It noted, however, that appellants did not identify any \u201cfederal law or regulation that defines a liquid manure handling system or that determines that uncovered storage will cause a dry system to be classified as a liquid one.\u201d The FDM rejected appellants\u2019 \u201cunsupported assertion that \u2018prolonged uncovered storage necessarily results in liquified manure.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The FDM was not persuaded by appellants\u2019 argument that \u201cMAFOs that take advantage of the extended storage time will, of necessity, discharge to surface waters and therefore must be classified as CAFOs and made subject to the NPDES permitting requirements.\u201d It noted that the CWA does not apply to an AFO with the potential to discharge and that \u201ca MAFO that discharges to surface water loses its status as a MAFO and becomes a CAFO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The FDM further rejected the argument that the GP violated the CWA \u201cbecause it fail[ed] to ensure that poultry waste discharges do not cause or contribute to violations of water quality.\u201d It noted that the CWA \u201cdoes not mandate a com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>p\u00edete ban on discharges into a waterway that is in violation of existing water quality standards,\u201d and deference should be given to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201ccause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.\u201d The FDM stated that \u201cthe issuance of a permit that would result in a net reduction of the pollutant causing the impairment\u201d is permissible pursuant to the CWA, and it found that, given the stringent requirements of the GP, \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that compliance with the GP will reduce the loading to the impaired waterbody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The FDM concluded: \u201cUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the issuance of the GP to existing CAFOs in impaired waterways, regardless whether a TMDL has been promulgated, will not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Finally, the FDM determined that summary decision was appropriate. It found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact, and the decision of MDE to issue the GP was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On October 1, 2009, appellants filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a Petition for Judicial Review of the Final Decision. On January 11, 2010, appellants filed a motion to present additional evidence, requesting that the court remand the case with instructions to MDE to consider evidence that it was prevented from introducing when MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision was granted, without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On January 27, 2010, MDE filed its opposition to appellant\u2019s motion to present additional evidence, asserting that appellants were \u201cfree under the applicable rules, indeed they were compelled, to support their motion! ] for summary decision by record evidence and affidavit providing evidence of the facts alleged in their motion! ],\u201d but they failed to do so. It argued that appellants \u201celected to rely exclusively on their lawyers\u2019 arguments,\u201d rather than present expert evidence needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>make their case, and that this \u201ctactical failure\u201d did not constitute good cause to permit them to introduce additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On February 3, 2010, appellants filed their reply. They argued that they \u201cwere unreasonably denied an opportunity to present their view of the scientific literature and to challenge and cross-examine the MDE\u2019s view of it in a contested hearing prior to MDE\u2019s resolution of the issue as required by MDE\u2019s administrative rules of procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">On February 4, 2010, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to present additional evidence. On March 3, 2010, the court heard argument on the merits. It requested supplemental briefing regarding the right to an evidentiary hearing at the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">On March 9, 2010, MDE filed its bench memorandum, arguing that there is \u201cno support for the proposition that the OAH was <em>required </em>to hold any kind of hearing on a motion for summary decision, much less a full evidentiary hearing.\u201d Appellants disagreed, arguing in their memorandum that, \u201c[b]e-cause the OAH [ALJ] improperly granted MDE summary decision, [appellants] were unlawfully denied the opportunity to present evidence at an evidentiary hearing.\u201d They asserted: \u201cOn May 5, 2009, without holding a single hearing or having the benefit of a fully developed record, in a proposed decision so fraught with legal errors it was discarded in its entirety by the Final Decision Maker ... the ALJ granted MDE\u2019s and denied [appellants\u2019] motion for summary decision.\u201d Appellants requested the court to \u201creverse and remand the matter to the administrative agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On April 8, 2010, the court issued an Order and Memorandum affirming MDE\u2019s Final Decision. It stated that appellants were \u201cunable to establish that a per se \u2018right\u2019 to an evidentiary hearing during a contested case is required.\u201d The court found that substantial evidence existed in the record to support the Final Decision, and accordingly, it affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained the standard of review of an agency decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.

Initially, appellants argue that the FDM erred in failing to find that the decision to promulgate the GP was arbitrary and capricious because: (1) MDE did not \u201cprovide any evidentiary support for its decision to adopt a 3-year, 90/30 day phase-in-period\u201d; (2) the GP is contrary to \u201cthe \u2018policy goals\u2019 of the Maryland Environmental Article\u201d to \u201c \u2018prevent, abate, and control pollution of the waters of this State\u2019 \u201d; and (3) the FDM \u201cfailed to address substantial evidence provided by Appellants.\u201d Moreover, they argue that the FDM erred in deciding the case by summary decision because there were disputes of material fact involving: (1) \u201cthe water quality impacts of litter stockpiling\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhether discharges to groundwater and discharges to surface water pose the same risks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">MDE disagrees. It asserts that there was substantial evidence to support the provisions of the GP, and there was no dispute of material fact precluding- the FDM\u2019s ruling by summary decision. MDE contends that, \u201cabsent clear documented evidence of significant water quality impacts between uncovered litter storage of between 14 and 90 days,\u201d the \u201c90/30 day limit imposed within the MAFO portions of the GP\u201d was not \u201carbitrarily lax.\u201d MDE further asserts that \u201c[ajppellants do not explain how regulating agricultural operations that were \u2018previously unregulated\u2019 ... is \u2018contrary to or inconsistent with\u2019 ... MDE\u2019s statutory charge.\u201d It argues that appellants\u2019 desire for \u201cstricter controls on farms is not grounds for reversal,\u201d particularly given the deference that should be afforded to an agency decision \u201crelating] to scientific matters traditionally left to agency expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We will address first appellants\u2019 contention that MDE\u2019s final decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Appellants contend that MDE failed \u201cto provide any evidentiary support for its decision to adopt a 3-year, 90/30 day phase-in-period.\u201d The record reflects, however, that MDE did provide support for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">MDE submitted the affidavit of Dr. Summers, who stated that, as Deputy Secretary of MDE, he had been involved with efforts \u201cto establish through the GP requirements to protect water quality during field storage of poultry litter.\u201d He attached a document he prepared, entitled: \u201cBasis for Requirements to Protect Water Quality During Field Storage of Litter Stockpiles in the Maryland General Permit for Animal Feeding Operations,\u201d which described MDE\u2019s rationale for adopting the provisions of the GP establishing time frames for field storage of poultry litter. Dr. Summers noted that \u201cEPA regulations do not specify a time period for outdoor stockpiling of dry poultry manure, but EPA\u2019s guidance document suggests 14 days is appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Dr. Summers explained that, in determining how stringent to make the storage requirement for the GP, MDE had requested, \u201cbut EPA was not able to provide, technical documentation of the factual basis and risk level associated with the 15th day of storage, versus 10 days or 30 days, for example.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Dr. Summers explained that MDE consulted with University of Maryland scientists at the Cooperative Extension Service and the Wye Research and Education Center. He summarized their thoughts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Their guidance was that the scientific literature regarding loss of nutrients from field storage of poultry litter was not consistent regarding the water quality impact of stockpiles, whether uncovered or covered. They also stressed that it is most important to control runoff from the litter when it is applied to cropland by meeting nutrient management plan requirements for the timing and rate of application. Stacking of litter in the appropriate locations in the field as far as possible, but at least 100 feet from waterways, including field ditches[,] provides better water quality protection compared to premature field spreading since the surface area of exposed litter is much smaller in a stockpile than it is spread on a field. A stringent field storage time limit encourages spreading of litter at times of the year that are not optimal for crop uptake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Based on concerns relating to a stringent field storage time limit, \u201cMDE determined that a 30 day limit for unprotected field stockpiling of litter from MAFO permitted operations was a more reasonable time frame that could be applied to all farms in Maryland, through modifications to the [Maryland Department of Agriculture (\u201cMDA\u201d) ] administered State Nutrient Management Regulations.\u201d Dr. Summers explained that the \u201cinitial 90 day requirement for three years allows a reasonable phased-in compliance period for the agricultural community to adjust whole-house clean out schedules, build additional storage capacity, or other compliance steps needed to meet the 30 day restriction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The document prepared by Dr. Summers explained that, subsequent to MDE\u2019s publication of its Tentative Determination for the GP, the Chesapeake Research Consortium \u201cconvened a group of scientists to review the pertinent scientific data and develop a consensus document to provide guidance for consideration in making a final determination on Maryland\u2019s General Permit.\u201d Pertinent to this appeal, Dr. Summers set forth the recommendation regarding the issue of limits of field storage as follows: \u201c[TJhere is little difference (in terms of nutrient losses to the surrounding soil) between litter stockpiled for 14 days and litter stockpiled for 190 days.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>(emphasis omitted). He noted that the panel also recommended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">Temporary stockpiling of poultry litter should be encouraged when other immediate use options (e.g., field application meeting seasonal planting schedules, or regional hydrological cycles, or alternative off-site uses) are not available, regardless of the length of time required, up to a maximum of 190 days based on documented research trials of 190 days in length---- Due to a lack of consistent differences between covered and uncovered litter storage piles with regard to nutrient runoff, the Panel does not support mandatory covering of temporary field stockpiles as a technique to reduce nutrient loading to soils or water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">(Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">MDE considered all comments, including those from the scientists. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">Since available evidence indicates that there are water quality impacts resulting from storage of litter in the field and those impacts are highly variable, it is very likely that the differences between a 14-day storage limit and a 30-day storage limit would be un-measurable. Absent clear documented evidence of significant water quality impacts between uncovered litter storage of between 14 days and 90 days (and even up to 190 days, according to the Science Panel), MDE concluded that the 30-day limit would be protective of water quality. MDE also concluded that the initial 90-day limit for a 3-year compliance period would provide water quality benefits by beginning to restrict field storage and still give the agricultural community time to develop alternatives other than premature field application and/or transfer or unregulated operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The FDM considered this evidence and rejected the argument that there was not a substantial basis for the GP. It found that MDE \u201chad a rational basis for the decision to allow MAFOs to store poultry manure uncovered for up to 90 days for the next 3 years, and that the decision was not arbitrary and capricious.\u201d The FDM noted that, in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>definitive data \u201con the questions of whether a cover reduces the leaching of nutrients and how, in what amounts, and over what [ ] period of time nitrogen and phosphorus are lost from a poultry manure litter pile,\u201d MDE sought advice from experts in the field. The FDM found that the initial 90-day storage period was consistent with the advice MDE received, and this advice provided a substantial basis for MDE\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Appellants do not dispute the factual assertions set forth in the document prepared by Dr. Summers. Rather, they fault MDE for not conducting \u201cits own analysis or review of the scientific literature.\u201d They further state that \u201c[t]he summary cited in the Summers Affidavit also largely relies on one sentence drawn from a \u2018Poultry Litter Experts Science Forum\u2019 white paper that summarizes the proceedings of a 2008 meeting of academic experts convened in response to the tentative General Permit,\u201d suggesting that the unpublished study was not a substantial basis for MDE to adopt the 90-day storage provisions in the GP.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">As indicated, our inquiry is whether a \u201creasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual decision the agency reached.\u201d <em>Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 173, 12 A.3d 1255. That test is satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">MDE sought advice regarding the water quality impact of various poultry litter storage times from several different sources: the EPA; the University of Maryland scientists at the Cooperative Extensive Service; the Wye Research and Education Center; and scientists at the Chesapeake Research Consortium. None of these sources advised that 30 to 90 days of storage would significantly increase nutrient loss to the environment. And, as indicated, the scientific experts at the Chesapeake Research Consortium gave the following recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">The available data suggests that while any stockpiled litter presents a potential for nutrient loss to the environment, the majority of this risk occurs within the first days of litter pile construction. In other words, there is little difference (in terms of nutrient losses to the surrounding soil) between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>litter stockpiled for 14 days and litter stockpiled for 190 days. Still, the impact is greater than zero, and minimizing the need for such stockpiles will reduce even these minimal loads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">Temporary stockpiling of poultry litter should be encouraged when other immediate-use options (e.g., field application meeting seasonal planting schedules, or regional hydrological cycles, or alternative off-site uses) are not available, regardless of the length of time required, up to a maximum of 190 days based on documented research trials of 190 days in length.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">(Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The rationale set forth by Dr. Summers made clear that MDE considered the lack of evidence of any significant differences in water quality impacts between litter storage of 14 and 90 days, and it weighed that against the potential adverse effects of a stringent field storage time limit, as well as the need to give chicken farmers time to makes changes to their business practices to comply with the new requirements. Under these circumstances, we hold that MDE had a reasonable basis for establishing the three year, 90-day phase-in-period for the storage of uncovered manure by MAFOs. Appellants have not stated a ground for reversal of the agency\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Appellants next assert that MDE\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious because it is contrary to the \u2018policy goals\u2019 of the Maryland Environmental Article,\u201d particularly the goal to \u201c \u2018prevent, abate, and control pollution of the waters of this State.\u2019\u201d (Quoting Envir. \u00a7 9-302(a)). They dispute MDE\u2019s argument that the GP satisfies this goal because it provides some regulation in an area that was previously unregulated, arguing that \u201cmerely chipping away at what was \u2018previously unregulated\u2019 does not make the General Permit protective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>water quality, particularly when the previous policy led to the environmental crisis faced by the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">MDE disagrees. It states: \u201cAppellants do not explain how regulating agricultural operations that were \u2018previously unregulated\u2019 ... is \u2018contrary to or inconsistent with,\u2019 ... MDE\u2019s statutory charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We agree with MDE. Its decision to regulate MAFOs, which, as indicated, previously were not regulated, is consistent with the statutory policy goal to \u201cprevent, abate, and control pollution of the waters of this State.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 9-302(a). That appellants would like stricter controls on MA-FOs is not dispositive. As noted, our review of MDE\u2019s decision to issue the GP is limited to the narrow issue whether there was substantial evidence to support MDE\u2019s determination. We have already determined that there was, and appellants\u2019 policy arguments are not a basis for reversing the agency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Appellants next assert that, even if there was substantial evidence to support the issuance of the GP, the FDM disregarded \u201cwell-settled legal principles\u201d in granting MDE\u2019s motion for summary decision when there were several disputed issues of material fact. Specifically, appellants allege two disputes of material fact: (1) \u201cwhether there are discernible water quality impacts between covered and uncovered manure storage\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhether discharges to groundwater and discharges to surface water pose the same risks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">MDE argues that there were no disputes of material fact as alleged by appellants. It contends that the FDM properly granted summary decision in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The rules of procedure for the OAH permit a party to move for summary decision on any appropriate issue in the case. COMAR 28.02.01.16.D(2) (2001). The rules provide: \u201cA judge may grant a proposed or final summary decision if the judge finds that: (a) [tjhere is no genuine issue of material fact; and (b) [a] party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>standard is the same as that applied in the courts in determining whether to grant summary judgment to a party. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-501 (a) (providing that a trial court may grant summary judgment when there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is entitled to judgment \u201cas a matter of law\u201d). <em>See also Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 229, 825 A.2d 966 (2003) (noting that the standard of review for the grant of summary judgment, whether it is \u201clegally correct,\u201d is \u201cthe same standard of review we apply to the question of the legal correctness of an administrative agency\u2019s decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">We address first appellants\u2019 contention that there was a dispute of material fact regarding \u201cwhether there are discernible water quality impacts between covered and uncovered manure storage.\u201d MDE asserts that Dr. Summers\u2019 affidavit demonstrated that \u201cthe existing scientific literature \u2018was not consistent\u2019 on whether there is a discernible difference in water quality impacts between covered and uncovered manure storage beyond 14 days.\u201d MDE asserts that, \u201chaving produced such evidence, the burden then shifted to [ajppellants to come forward with their own affidavits or other admissible evidence to contradict the fact that the scientific community had not developed a consensus as to the relative impact of uncovered versus covered manure storage,\u201d which they failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The FDM rejected appellants\u2019 argument that summary decision was inappropriate because there was a dispute of material fact regarding whether the GP, which allows MAFOs to store poultry litter on the ground, in uncovered piles, beyond 14 days, adequately protected water quality. The FDM found that appellants: (1) did not raise a genuine dispute of fact; and (2) failed to show that the allegedly disputed fact was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The FDM explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">There is no dispute that piles of poultry manure release nitrogen and phosphorus to the environment, whether the piles are covered or uncovered. The GP is the mechanism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>by which the release to ground water is regulated and permitted. The literature cited in support of their respective positions by [appellants] and [MDE] document losses in various ways, but do not provide sufficient information to specifically quantify the differences, either by whether the piles are covered or uncovered, or how long an uncovered pile remains. Indeed, [appellants] cite with apparent approval a study that determined that the greatest losses occur during the first few days after the pile is constructed, which would seem to indicate that the risk of nutrient loss declines as time passes. It may be the \u201cfact\u201d [appellants] wish to dispute cannot be answered with the available scientific data. Clearly, [appellants] have not alleged that they can better quantify the losses, or demonstrate that the differences between 14 day storage and 90 day storage would be measurable, much less presented an actual factual dispute by the use of affidavits or otherwise. [Appellants] have failed to raise a factual dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">Even if [appellants] were able to quantify the losses from uncovered piles precisely over time, it would not answer the question whether the conditions \u201cadequately\u201d protect ground water, because [appellants] have not identified any law or regulation that would provide the standard by which to judge \u201cadequacy.\u201d In oral argument, [appellants] indicated that the only acceptable time was \u201cthe shortest time possible.\u201d If this were the legal measure of adequacy, the \u201cfact\u201d is not material. I find that [appellants] have not raised a genuine dispute of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The FDM stated that it had reviewed the scientific literature referred to by appellants. It noted that the studies reported \u201cdifferent observations on the questions of whether a cover reduces the leaching of nutrients and how, in what amounts, and over what [ ] period of time nitrogen and phosphorus are lost from a poultry manure litter pile.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>We find no error in the FDM\u2019s conclusion that there existed no dispute of material fact in this regard precluding summary decision in favor of MDE. As the FDM stated, appellants did not submit any evidence, by affidavit or otherwise, stating that there were quantifiable differences in nutrient loss for 90-day storage of poultry litter as opposed to 14-day storage.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Given the lack of evidence quantifying the nutrient losses for uncovered piles of poultry manure over time, there was no material dispute of fact that the 90-day provision in the GP, based on the recommendation of the Chesapeake Research Consortium, did not adequately protect water quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We turn next to appellants\u2019 argument that there existed a \u201cfierce dispute\u201d of material fact regarding \u201cwhether discharges to groundwater and discharges to surface water pose the same risks.\u201d Appellants argue that MDE did not provide any evidence in support of its claim that \u201c \u2018soils can prevent or inhibit transport\u2019 of potential pollutants, such as nitrates, from manure piles to groundwater.\u201d They note that they cited studies indicating that groundwater is particularly susceptible to contamination by nitrates, which, unlike phosphorus, bind to soils and threaten surface water by runoff. They argue that the FDM ignored these studies and \u201cresolved this disputed issue by finding \u2018[djischarges to groundwater and discharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>directly to surface water are not the same and do not pose the same risk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">MDE responds that its position below was not that \u201csoils prevent <em>nitrates </em>from migrating to groundwater,\u201d but rather that <em>\u201cnitrogen, phosphorus, </em>and other <em>nutrients </em>are taken up by crops and other vegetation, making MAFO discharges\u2014 which, by definition, are to ground water, not surface water\u2014 less likely to cause water pollution than CAFO discharges to surface waters.\u201d It asserts that the ability of plants to \u201ctake up the nutrients within the soil is the very principle upon which the agricultural use of manure is based,\u201d and that appellants acknowledge that crop and pasture land can absorb nutrients. Accordingly, MDE argues that the FDM \u201cproperly found that there was no dispute of fact on this point and that the ability of vegetation and soils to take up nutrients justifies separate standards for agricultural operations that discharge to surface waters and those that do not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The statements to which appellants now object were made by the FDM in the context of appellants\u2019 argument that MDE\u2019s decision to establish a class of AFOs as MAFOs, and regulate them less stringently than CAFOs, was arbitrary and unsupported by the record. The FDM rejected this argument, noting that MAFOs were regulated differently from CAFOs because they do not discharge to surface water. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">Discharges to groundwater and discharges directly to surface water are not the same and do not pose the same risk. Concentration of contaminants discharged to groundwater can be reduced by dilution, attenuation, chemical or biological reactions, and uptake by plants before that groundwater enters surface water. The GP does not leave MAFOs unregulated. They are subject under the GP to design and operational standards and a NMP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The FDM\u2019s comments do not indicate that they were made in response to an argument, as alleged on appeal, that there was a dispute of material fact regarding \u201cwhether discharges to groundwater and discharges to surface water pose the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>risks.\u201d We have reviewed the record and have been unable to find anywhere that this argument was made before the ALJ or the FDM.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, this contention is not preserved for our review. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Weller, </em>390 Md. 115, 129, 887 A.2d 1042 (2005) (\u201c We do not allow issues to be raised for the first time in actions for judicial review of administrative agency orders entered in contested cases because to do so would allow the court to resolve matters <em>ab initio </em>that have been committed to the jurisdiction and expertise of the agency.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Md. 1, 32, 803 A.2d 460 (2002)). Accordingly, we will not consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Water Quality Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The CWA, in addition to controlling point source discharges into bodies of water, also requires states to set water quality standards for the waters in their state. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(l)-(2). \u201cWater quality standards are retained as a supplementary basis for effluent limitations, however, so that numerous point sources, despite individual compliance with effluent limitations, may be further regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels.\u201d <em>EPA v. Cal. ex rel. State Water Res. Control Bd., </em>426 U.S. 200, 205 n. 12, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>S.Ct. 2022, 48 L.Ed.2d <em>578 </em>(1976). A state\u2019s water quality-standards are established by \u201ctaking into consideration their use and value for public water supplies, propagation of fish and wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial, and other purposes, and also taking into consideration their use and value for navigation.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2)(A). Waterbodies that do not meet water quality standards are deemed \u201cwater quality limited\u201d or \u201cimpaired.\u201d <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. 1313(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The CWA requires states to identify waters that are \u201cimpaired\u201d and develop TMDLs to bring those impaired waters back into compliance with water quality standards. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1313(d)(1)(C). As indicated, a TMDL sets forth the specified maximum amount of a pollutant that can be discharged into the water from all point and nonpoint sources, plus a margin of safety, and still meet water quality standards for its designated uses. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The CWA directs that TMDLs \u201cshall be established at a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards with seasonal variations and a margin of safety which takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water quality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The FDM stated, and the record reflects, that MDE has prepared TMDLs for some waterbodies and that others \u201care under development or planned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Appellants argue that the GP violates federal regulations governing water quality standards. They make two arguments in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">First, they note that federal regulations prohibit the issuance of a NPDES permit \u201c \u2018[t]o a new source or a new discharger, if the discharge from its construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting 40 C.F.R. 122.4(i)). They acknowledge that there is an exception to this prohibition, but they assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that the exception is limited to the situation where \u201ca TMDL has been established for the water segment that would receive the discharge,\u201d and the permit applicant demonstrates: (1) that \u201cthere are sufficient allocations for the discharge pursuant to the TMDL\u201d; and (2) there are \u201c \u2018compliance schedules\u2019 to bring the water into compliance with applicable water standards.\u201d Appellants argue that the GP violates this law because it \u201cauthorizes \u2018new dischargers\u2019 to discharge to impaired waters without demonstrating compliance with the requirements of 40 C.F.R,. \u00a7 122.4(i).\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Second, appellants assert that, pursuant to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1), MDE is required to conduct a case-by-case reasonable potential analysis (\u201cRPA\u201d) for each CAFO to determine whether water quality-based effluent limits (\u201cWQBELs\u201d) are necessary for the specific NPDES to meet water quality standards of receiving water bodies. They argue that the GP fails to comply with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">MDE contends that the GP, which requires site-specific NMPs and CNMPs, ensures compliance with water quality standards. It disputes appellants\u2019 assertion that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i) establishes a blanket prohibition on the issuance of new permits in impaired waters. It frames the issue as \u201cwhether the discharge of pollutants authorized by the GP causes or contributes to such a violation when the GP will actually decrease the amount of pollution that is discharged.\u201d MDE argues that \u201cthe better view,\u201d and the view accepted by EPA, is that \u201ca permitted discharge does not \u2018cause or contribute\u2019 to impairment if it constitutes a <em>net reduction </em>in the loading of the substance causing the impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>MDE contends that the GP does not violate \u00a7 122.4(i) \u201cbecause CAFOs that are authorized by, and operate in accordance with, the general permit will not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.\u201d It notes that new CAFOs are subject to a \u201czero discharge\u201d standard. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. 412.46; COMAR 26.08.03.09B. With respect to existing sources, it argues that the GP \u201crequirement that covered facilities implement MDE-approved NMPs and CNMPs,\u201d which are farm-specific plans to ensure protection of water resources through appropriate management practices, \u201cprovides further assurance that GP-authorized facilities will not violate water quality standards.\u201d MDE asserts that it \u201creviews each NMP/CNMP to make sure that the <em>specific </em>practices proposed are sufficiently protective given the circumstances of the <em>specific </em>farm and the <em>specific </em>waterway that may be affected by the farm\u2019s operation,\u201d giving MDE \u201cthe opportunity to impose additional restrictions, identify specific load allocations, and even kick the farm out of the GP and require an individual NPDES permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Appellants\u2019 first argument relies on 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i). It prohibits the issuance of a NPDES discharge permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">(i) To a new source or a new discharger, if the discharge from its construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards. The owner or operator of a new source or new discharger proposing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>discharge into a water segment which does not meet applicable water quality standards or is not expected to meet those standards even after the application of the effluent limitations required by sections 301(b)(1)(A) and 301(b)(1)(B) of CWA, and for which the State or interstate agency has performed a pollutants load allocation for the pollutant to be discharged, must demonstrate, before the close of the public comment period, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">(1) There are sufficient remaining pollutant load allocations to allow for the discharge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">(2) The existing dischargers into that segment are subject to compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with applicable water quality standards. The Director may waive the submission of information by the new source or new discharger required by paragraph (i) of this section if the Director determines that the Director already has adequate information to evaluate the request. An explanation of the development of limitations to meet the criteria of this paragraph (i)(2) is to be included in the fact sheet to the permit under \u00a7 124.56(b)(1) of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">As indicated, the parties have different interpretations of the meaning of the phrase \u201ccause or contribute\u201d in the first sentence of this statute. MDE argues that a net reduction in the pollutant, due to offsets, should be considered in determining whether a new discharger \u201ccauses or contributes\u201d to a violation of water quality standards. It argues that the discharge of pollutants authorized by the GP do not \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to violations of water quality standards because \u201cthe GP will actually <em>decrease </em>the amount of pollution that is discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Appellants argue that <em>any </em>discharge to an \u201cimpaired water\u201d necessarily \u201ccauses or contributes to a violation of water quality standards,\u201d prohibiting issuance of a permit unless a TMDL has been completed and the permit applicant makes the requisite showing regarding pollutant load allocations and compliance schedules. They contend that the GP violates \u201cthis regulation by allowing CAFOs that will discharge into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>impaired Maryland waterways to receive a NPDES permit without consideration of whether the conditions set forth in \u00a7 122.4(i) are satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The FDM rejected appellants\u2019 argument that the first sentence of \u00a7 122.4(i) functions as an absolute prohibition to new discharges to an impaired water. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">The first sentence of 40 C.F.R. 122.4(i) reads: \u201cNo permit may be issued: ... To a new source or a new discharger, if the discharge from its construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.\u201d The phrase \u201ccause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards\u201d is susceptible to different interpretations. One view is that the new discharge does not \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to the impairment if the new discharge will result in a net reduction in the loading of the substance causing the impairment. This is a view EPA has espoused. In addition, it seems to comport with the CWA, that requires limits \u201cwhich can reasonably be expected to contribute to the attainment or maintenance of such water quality.\u201d ...

It does not define or explain the phrase \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to a water quality violation. A review of dictionary definitions reveals that: (1) \u201ccause\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo bring about or effect,\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 251 (9th ed.2009); and (2) \u201ccontribute\u201d is defined as: \u201c[T]o give or supply in common with others\u201d or \u201cto play a significant part in bringing about an end or result.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 285 (11th ed.2005). In this case, the effect or result would be a violation of water quality standards, but the definitions do not shed light on the proper analysis to assess whether the GP brings about that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The phrase \u201ccause or contribute\u201d is ambiguous; it is susceptible to \u201ctwo or more equally plausible interpretations.\u201d <em>See Wal Mart Stores, </em>416 Md. at 360, 7 A.3d 13. The phrase could mean, as appellants contend, that <em>any </em>discharge to an impaired water necessarily causes or contributes to a violation of water quality standards. It also could be interpreted, however, as MDE maintains, to mean that a discharge does not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards if there is a net reduction in pollution. In other words, a discharge does not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards if the discharge is offset by a corresponding reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Several courts have addressed the meaning of the phrase \u201ccause or contribute\u201d in \u00a7 122.4(i). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the \u201coffset\u201d interpretation relied on by MDE and adopted by the FDM. <em>Friends of Pinto Creek v. EPA, </em>504 F.3d 1007, 1012 (9th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>555 U.S. 1097, 129 S.Ct. 896, 173 L.Ed.2d 106 (2009). In that case, the EPA issued a NPDES permit to Carlota Copper Company, permitting \u201cmining related discharges of copper into Arizona\u2019s Pinto Creek, a water body already in excess of water quality standards for copper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009. The permit contained an \u201coffset provision,\u201d requiring Carlota to remediate sources of copper from an inactive mine site. <em>Id. </em>at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The Ninth Circuit rejected EPA\u2019s contention that the permit would not allow a discharge that would \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to a violation of water quality standards because remediation of the discharge for the inactive mine site would offset the new discharge of pollutants. <em>Id. </em>at 1012. It stated that \u201cthere is nothing in the Clean Water Act or the regulation that provides an exception for an offset when the waters remain impaired and the new source is discharging pollution into that impaired water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that, because the discharge did \u201ccause and contribute to the violation of water quality standards,\u201d and the applicant did not produce evidence pursuant to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i)(l) and (2), the EPA erred in issuing the NPDES permit to Carlota. <em>Id. </em>at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The view expressed by the Ninth Circuit is not shared by all courts. The Supreme Court of Minnesota, for example, disagrees, adopting instead the analysis advocated by MDE in this case. <em>See In the Matter of the Cities of Annandale and Maple Lake NPDES/SDS Permit Issuance for the Discharge of Treated Wastewater, </em>731 N.W.2d 502, 524 (Minn.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In <em>Annandale, </em>the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (\u201cMPCA\u201d) issued a NPDES permit to a wastewater treatment plant, which would increase phosphorus discharge to Crow River. <em>Id. </em>at 506. The MPCA concluded, however, that the increase would not contribute to the violation of water quality standards because \u201cthe increased discharge would be offset by [a substantial] reduction in phosphorus discharge due to an upgrade of a nearby wastewater treatment plant\u201d; and therefore, \u201c[b]ecause of the net reduction in the watershed,\u201d the proposed facility would <em>\u201cnot contribute </em>to water quality standards violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506-07 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Minnesota addressed first the appropriate standard of review of the MPCA\u2019s conclusion. The court noted that, although it gives deference to a state agency\u2019s construction of its own regulation, the regulation at issue was a federal regulation, albeit one that the agency was charged with enforcing and administering. <em>Id. </em>at 511-12. The court concluded that, \u201cwhen a state agency is charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u25a0with the day-to-day responsibility for enforcing and administering a federal regulation, courts should give deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of that regulation\u201d if two criteria are met: (1) \u201cthe language of the agency\u2019s regulation is unclear and susceptible to different reasonable interpretations\u201d; and (2) the \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Finding that the MPCA was charged with the responsibility for enforcing and administering 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i) in Minnesota, the court then discussed the differing interpretations that had been applied to the regulation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 518-22. It held that \u201cthe interpretation of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(f) is not a clear-cut issue where we can just give effect to an unambiguously expressed intent and therefore substitute our judgment for that of the MPCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The court then proceeded to determine if the MPCA\u2019s interpretation of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i), that offsets from another source within the watershed could be considered in determining whether a new discharge source \u201ccauses or contributes\u201d to a violation of water quality standards, was \u201creasonable,\u201d as well as the extent to which the court should \u201cconsider the MPCA\u2019s expertise and special knowledge when making this determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that \u201cthe determination of whether the proposed joint wastewater treatment plan will \u2018cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards\u2019 requires some factual inquiry,\u201d and that MPCA used \u201c \u2018basin/watershed management approaches as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the main policy context for addressing phosphorus,\u2019 \u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe broad nature of the phrase \u2018cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards\u2019 leaves leeway for the MPCA to make a range of policy judgments based on the MPCA\u2019s scientific and technical knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522-24. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">Nothing in the language of the regulation or the structure of the CWA prohibits the MPCA from considering offsets in this situation. In light of the multitude of variables and possible approaches in determining whether a specific discharge of phosphorus will \u201ccause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards\u201d \u2014 not the least of which is whether the MPCA should consider the discharge in isolation or in context of other reductions in the watershed as a whole \u2014 it appears that the MPCA\u2019s interpretation of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(i) is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 524. The court upheld the issuance of the NPDES permit as \u201creasonable and [ ] consistent with the purposes and principles of the CWA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We agree with the analysis in <em>Annandale. </em>The language of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4(f) is ambiguous; it does not make clear how to assess whether a discharge of a pollutant will \u201ccause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>whether the discharge from the new source should be considered in isolation or in the context of net reductions in the substance causing the water quality impairment. MDE is the agency tasked with enforcing and administering federal regulations regarding water quality standards, <em>see </em>Envir. \u00a7 9-324, and we give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to \u201c \u2018an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers,\u2019 \u201d <em>Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 174, 12 A.3d 1255 (quoting <em>Md.

Under the circumstances, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Appellants contend, however, that even if \u00a7 122.4(f) can be interpreted to allow consideration of offsets, the GP does not ensure that new dischargers will not cause or contribute to water quality violations in impaired waterbodies. They assert that \u201cMDE has not created TMDLs for all waters impaired by pollutants discharged by CAFOs,\u201d and \u201ceven for the impaired Maryland waterways that do have TMDLs, [ ] MDE has failed to properly quantify the pollutant loadings contributed to the waterway by each CAFO.\u201d They further argue that MDE has failed to identify \u201cthe quantitative significance of any purported \u2018offsets\u2019 to be achieved as a result of compliance with the permit terms.\u201d Appellants contend that, in the absence of \u201cparticularized and scientific analyses of the impacts of the new dischargers,\u201d MDE cannot properly conclude that the GP \u201cwould have no significant impact on the impaired waterway(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">MDE disagrees. It argues that CAFOs operating in accordance with the GP will not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards. Initially, it notes that \u201cthe federal CAFO regulations established a \u2018zero discharge\u2019 new source performance standard, which permits <em>no </em>discharge of pollutants from the facility\u2019s \u2018production area,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[tjhese zero discharge performance standards are incorporated by reference into Maryland\u2019s CAFO regulations.\u201d (Citing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.46; COMAR 26.08.03.09B). With respect to existing sources, MDE contends that \u201c[t]he GP\u2019s provisions for prepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ration of a site-specific CNMP or NMP and compliance with other requirefd] water quality measures ensure that the GP-authorized activities will not \u2018cause or contribute\u2019 to a violation of water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">On this issue, MDE submitted the affidavit of Ms. Dalmasy. She stated that MDE had identified \u201cnumerous waterbody segments impaired by various pollutants, including those associated with\u201d AFOs. She stated that MDE had developed TMDLs for impaired waterbody segments, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">TMDLs establish the assimilative capacity of a waterbody, i.e., the maximum allowable load of the specific substance the waterbody can receive without violating water quality standards. Maryland\u2019s nutrients and bacteria TMDLs include load allocations (LAs) for nonpoint sources and waste load allocations (WLAs) for point sources. The LA component of a TMDL includes allocations to agricultural landuse, urban, and forested areas; the WLA includes allocations to traditional point sources (e.g., waste water treatment plants) and NPDES-regulated stormwater discharges. MDE\u2019s current modeling tools and data resolution do not allow quantitative allocations to specific AFO/CAFO/MAFO sites. Rather, an overall LA is estimated for each impaired water quality segment, as one aggregate load that includes all agricultural practices, (e.g., cropland, pasture, AFOs/CA-FOs/MAFOs).... Maryland\u2019s nutrient and fecal bacteria TMDL analyses developed to date include an estimate of the baseline agricultural landuse load as part of the total watershed nutrients or bacteria budget. Maryland\u2019s bacteria and nutrient TMDLs apply a watershed based approach, which considers all potential pollutant sources and estimates load reduction targets for those sources necessary for the attainment of State water quality standards. As an example, in Maryland\u2019s nutrient TMDLs to date, all of which have been approved by EPA, the nonpoint source loads were computed in one of two ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">1. As the product of observed concentrations and estimated flows. These loads account for contributions from atmospheric deposition, septic tanks, agricultur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>al land (cropland, pasture, animal feeding operations), forest, and urban land. The percentages of these loads by land use were determined using ratios of land use and load coefficients by land use from the Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">2. As the summation of all of the individual land use areas and multiplying by the corresponding land use loading coefficients from the Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">Maryland\u2019s TMDLs apply a watershed-based approach, which considers all potential pollutant sources as explained above and estimates load reduction targets for those sources necessary for the attainment of State water quality standards. The agricultural load allocation includes all source categories (i.e., cropland, pasture, AFOs/CAFOs/MAFOs) but they are not broken out or quantified separately from this aggregated load. All currently approved nutrients and bacteria TMDLs were developed prior to the issuance of the January 2, 2009 Final Determination to issue the General Discharge Permit for Animal Feeding Operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Ms. Dalmasy stated that the GP was \u201cconsistent with existing approved TMDLs, since those TMDLs do not provide specific load allocations to this source of pollution.\u201d She further explained that \u201cthe new permit requirements will result in more stringent control of potential pollutants from these sources; and the permit\u2019s requirements will ensure that no new discharges will increase the pollutant loads in watersheds with established TMDLs.\u201d Ms. Dalmasy concluded that the GP \u201censures compliance with water quality standards as required by the Clean Water Act,\u201d and it \u201ccontains measures intended to ensure that AFOs/CAFOs/MAFOs discharges do not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The FDM reviewed this evidence and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">Compliance with the GP will result in a reduction in pollutants to State waters. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the issuance of the GP to existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>CAFOs in impaired waterways, regardless whether a TMDL has been promulgated, will not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In support of its conclusion, the FDM noted that the EPA has approved Maryland\u2019s use of a watershed-based approach in developing TMDLs.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The FDM explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">While no specific waste load is allocated to CAFOs in Maryland\u2019s TMDLs, a portion of the load allocation includes contributions from existing CAFOs. The TMDLs contain load reduction targets that are not specific for individual land uses or facilities. Methods available to Maryland to accomplish the load reduction targets include diverse programs that address air deposition, septic system discharges, environmental site design, and a host of BMPs, including not only those incorporated in the GP, but also such things as conservation tillage, off-stream watering, and forest buffers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">The pollutant contributions from CAFOs already in existence that will acquire NPDES permits for the first time under the GP are taken into account in the existing LA and therefore are included in the reduction targets. Further, the requirements of the GP are quite stringent, and it is reasonable to conclude that compliance with the GP will reduce the loading to the impaired waterbody. More specifically, the GP will regulate the discharges from a significant number of CAFOs that previously had not been required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>obtain a general or individual permit. For the first time, these CAFOs will be subject to stringent requirements aimed at reducing pollutant discharges to State waters. Because this represents a net reduction, it is not prohibited by 40 C.F.R. 122.4(i). As the TMDLs are further implemented, additional reductions may be required of the CAFO and nonpoint sources to fully achieve the TMDL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">Where no TMDL has been prepared for an impaired water, an existing CAFO subject to the GP for the first time will also be reducing its contribution to the impaired water. At the time a TMDL is prepared, consideration will be given to the contribution of the CAFO, and it is possible that further reductions will be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">As we previously have discussed, we begin our analysis with a determination regarding the requisite standard of review of the FDM\u2019s finding at issue. The finding here, that the issuance of the GP \u201cwill not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards,\u201d is a factual finding, or at least a mixed question of fact and law, which limits our review to whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding and whether a \u201creasoning mind\u201d could have reached that conclusion. <em>See Singley v. County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County, </em>178 Md.App. 658, 666, 943 A.2d 636 (decision whether property constituted a \u201ccommercial greenhouse and nursery\u201d that would be entitled to a special exception involved a mixed question of fact and law, to which appellate court applies substantial evidence test), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 114, 956 A.2d 202 (2008). That standard is satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">There was a substantial basis for the FDM\u2019s finding in this regard. As MDE notes, CAFOs and MAFOs are required by the GP to implement NMPs and CNMPs, which are farm specific plans intended to protect water resources through the implementation of appropriate management practices, \u201cincluding animal waste handling, nutrient management and conservation practices.\u201d GP, Part II.G (emphasis omitted); CO-MAR 15.20.08.04E-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Because the GP imposes restrictions on CAFOs and MA-FOs, including farms that previously were not subject to regulation, a reasoning mind could conclude, as the FDM did, that these conservation practices would reduce, overall, the pollutants introduced to waterbodies. Thus, even with some new discharges, there would be a net reduction in pollutants to State waters. There was a substantial basis for the FDM\u2019s decision that the GP would not \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to a violation of water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Appellants next assert that the GP \u201cfurther violates federal law because it fails to comply with other applicable federal laws governing water quality standards.\u201d They argue that, \u201c[f]or every NPDES permit issued, the issuing agency must perform a reasonable potential analysis (\u2018RPA\u2019) to determine whether the effluent from the permitted point source will cause a violation of water quality standards.\u201d (Citing 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1312(a); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d)(1)). Appellants contend that, \u201c[ujnder the EPA\u2019s regulations, a permit writer <em>must </em>either ensure compliance with any applicable WLA/ TMDL or make a case-by-case determination of any necessary WQBELs.\u201d They assert that these site-specific requirements \u201ccannot be reconciled with the broad authorization to discharge\u201d contained in the GP.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">MDE argues that the GP, which requires preparation of site-specific NMPs and CNMPs, and subjects them to MDE approval, \u201cprovides ample opportunity to consider whether the plans are adequate to assure compliance with water quality standards prior to issuing permit coverage.\u201d MDE contends that, in light of the site-specific review of CAFO applications provided for, the GP \u201cis not incompatible with any [federal] requirement that states impose\u201d WQBELs where existing standards are insufficient to meet water quality standards,\u201d noting that MDE has the opportunity to impose WQBELs where necessary to ensure the protection of water quality. MDE concludes: \u201cWith respect to the sufficiency of [Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>land\u2019s] GP, the Court need look no further than to EPA\u2019s approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The FDM concluded, similar to its earlier finding, that the GP adequately ensured \u201cthat discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The regulation on which appellants rely is 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44(d). That regulation provides that an NPDES permit \u201cshall include\u201d requirements \u201cmore stringent than promulgated effluent limitations guidelines or standards\u201d if they are necessary to limit pollutants that \u201cmay be discharged at a level which will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an ... excursion above [any] State water quality standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The FDM stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">The phrase \u201cwill cause ... or contribute to\u201d a violation of in-stream water quality standards\u201d in 40 C.F.R. 122.44(d) can be interpreted as in 40 C.F.R. 122.4(f): that a reduction in loading can satisfy the requirement that the discharge not \u201ccause or contribute\u201d to a violation. In addition, I find that the imposition of WQBELs is likely to be quite site-specific and therefore may be more appropriately imposed through the NOI process, including the approval of the CNMP.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] The NOI process is a reasonable way to identify facilities that could cause or contribute to water quality impairments and to require additional WQBELs. For these reasons, I conclude that the GP will adequately ensure that discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Again, this is a factual finding to which we give deference to the agency. The record reflects that the GP does provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>review of permit applications by MDE. CAFO applicants must submit a completed NOI form and a CNMP for MDE review and approval. The CNMP addresses methods to protect water quality, \u201cincluding animal waste handling, nutrient management, and conservation practices.\u201d GP, Part II.G (emphasis omitted). Each NOI and CNMP is subject to public review and comment, and a CAFO will not be issued permit coverage prior to completion of the public participation process. GP, Part 11I.C.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">It was within the province of MDE to determine that this process is sufficient to ensure that the issuance of new permits will not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Appellants next argue that the GP \u201cis less stringent than federal law because it fails to regulate all AFOs that meet the federal definition of \u2018CAFO.\u2019 \u201d Specifically, they argue that the GP \u201crequires that a large AFO \u2018discharge or propose to discharge\u2019 in order to be classified as a CAFO,\u201d whereas, pursuant to federal regulations, an AFO is defined as a CAFO based on the number of animals at the facility and the type of manure handling system employed, without regard for whether it discharges or proposes to discharge. Appellants assert that this results in less stringent regulation in two ways: (1) the GP \u201cdoes not impose management practices on CAFO unpermitted discharges\u201d; and (2) the GP\u2019s \u201c90-day open storage provision implies that MAFOs do not need a NPDES permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">MDE acknowledges that \u201csome facilities that would qualify as CAFOs under federal law are regulated as MAFOs under the GP because they do not \u2018discharge or propose to discharge.\u2019 \u201d It denies, however, that this results in the GP being less stringent than federal law, asserting that \u201cthe definitional distinction\u201d results in no practical consequences. Indeed, MDE argues that the GP is broader than federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Appellants\u2019 first assertion is that the GP \u201cdoes not impose management practices on CAFO unpermitted discharges.\u201d They argue that, under federal law, CAFOs that are not subject to permit requirements because they do not \u201cdischarge or propose to discharge\u201d are required to comply with the site-specific management practices in order for a precipitation-related discharge of manure to be considered agricultural stormwater discharge, which is excluded as a discharge requiring a NPDES permit.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> They argue that \u201cMDE has made no showing that all facilities that fall within the federal definition of CAFO, but do not fall under MDE\u2019s limited definition of CAFO, meet the federally required management practices as provided in [\u00a7] 122.28(e)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">MDE argues that the GP is not less stringent than federal law, but rather, it is broader than federal law. MDE further asserts that appellants \u201cmade no showing below that the management practices required by the GP are any less stringent than those required under federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The FDM rejected appellants\u2019 argument in this regard. Our review of the regulations confirm that the GP\u2019s requisite nutrient management plans are not less stringent than those required by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">As noted, the GP reflects a two-tiered permit scheme. A CAFO that discharges or proposes to discharge must obtain a NPDES permit issued by Maryland. GP, Part I.A.1; CO-MAR 26.08.03.09B(3). An AFO that qualifies as a CAFO under federal regulations, but does not discharge or propose to discharge to surface water, is classified as a MAFO. GP, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Part I.A.4; COMAR 26.08.03.09B(l)(d). Although MAFOs are not required to obtain a NPDES permit, they pose a threat to groundwater, and therefore, they are required to get a State discharge permit. The State discharge permit required for MAFOs addresses groundwater; it does not authorize the MAFO to discharge to surface water. GP, Part I.B.2; COMAR 26.08.03.09C(5)(c)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Both MAFOs and CAFOs are required to develop a NMP. Although a CAFO must develop a CNMP, whereas a MAFO may develop a CNMP or a NMP and a Conservation Plan,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the GP requires all AFOs in Maryland to develop NMPs. And the GP\u2019s requirements in this regard are substantially the same as the federal requirements. <em>Compare </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.42(e)(1) (setting forth nine best management practices that must be included in CAFO NMPs) <em>with </em>GP, Part IV.B. (setting forth virtually identical \u201cNine Minimum Standards to Protect Water Quality\u201d that must be included within each MAFO\u2019s NMP and Conservation Plan). Appellants\u2019 contention that the GP does not require the same nutrient management practices as federal law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Moreover, we agree with MDE that the GP actually is broader than federal law. As indicated, after <em>National Pork Producers Council, </em>635 F.3d at 751, CAFOs are subject to regulation under the CWA only if they discharge to surface water. Maryland, however, still regulates CAFOs that \u201cpropose to discharge.\u201d GP, Part I.A.1. (requiring a permit for an AFO that \u201cdischarge[s] or propose[s] to discharge\u201d); Envir. \u00a7 9-101(b)(2) (\u201cdischarge\u201d defined as including both actual discharges and \u201cplacing of a pollutant in a location where the pollutant is likely to pollute\u201d). The GP also regulates MAFOs that do not discharge or propose to discharge to surface water. GP, Part I.A.4. Because the GP regulates facilities not subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>to regulation under federal law, it is broader, not less stringent, than federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Appellants\u2019 final assertion is based on the provision in the GP permitting MAFOs to stockpile manure uncovered for up to 90 days. They assert that leaving manure stockpiles uncovered for more than 15 days converts a dry manure handling system to a liquid manure handling system, and because \u201c[a] facility is deemed a CAFO at a much lower threshold of animals if it operates a liquid manure handling facility,\u201d the GP \u201cmisleads AFOs because a single discharge from the regular occurrence of rain runoff from the large piles of uncovered chicken manure into a ditch would require a CAFO permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The GP is not misleading as appellants suggest. As the FDM observed, the GP makes clear that, if a MAFO discharges pollutants \u201cto surface waters of the State,\u201d it \u201cautomatically\u201d converts the MAFO into a CAFO. GP, Part I.A.5.b.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 argument that the GP is less stringent than federal law in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

The number of animals that qualify a facility housing poultry as a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (\"CAFO\u201d) depends on the type of manure handling system employed. A facility qualifies as a CAFO with fewer chickens or laying hens if it operates a liquid, as opposed to a dry, manure handling system. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.23(b)(4), (b)(6) (2010). For example, an AFO is defined as a Medium CAFO if: (1) it confines 9.000 to 29,000 laying hens or broilers and uses a liquid manure handling system; or (2) it confines 25,000 to 81,999 laying hens or 37,500 to 124,999 chickens (other than laying hens), and it uses other than a liquid manure handling system. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 122.23(b)(6)(i)(I)-(K).

Nutrient Management Plans (\"NMP\u201d) establish, <em>inter alia, </em>\"best management practices,\" including standards for application of manure to land, diversion of clean water from the production area, and controlling discharge of pollutants to waters. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.42(e).

The FDM noted that new CAFOs would be subject to new source performance standards, which contain a zero discharge requirement, and therefore, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.4Q) did not prohibit issuance of a permit to them. The new source performance standards promote \u201cup-front design, construction, operation, and maintenance to ensure that predictable discharges do not occur.\u201d 73 Fed.Reg. 70459 (Nov. 20, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. The FDM explained that such an approach \"considers all potential pollutant sources ... and estimates load reduction targets for those sources necessary for the attainment of State water quality standards.\u201d For example, as Ms. Dalmasy stated in her affidavit, the \u201cagricultural load allocation includes all source categories (i.e., cropland, pasture, AFOs/CAFOs/MAFOs) but they are not broken out or quantified separately from this aggregated load.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b742-10\">. MAFOs and CAFOs are required to submit, along with their NMP, a NOI form, which provides information regarding the farm, such as the number and types of animals at the facility.

After MDE receives the NOI, it \"may request additional information to determine whether or not the farm or proposed farm is in compliance with applicable regulations.\u201d GP, Part III.C.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">.
