The authority for treating a frivolous demurrer is found in section 247, which provides that <em>\u201c </em>if a demurrer, answer, or reply be frivolous, the party prejudiced thereby, upon a previous notice of five days, may apply to a judge of the court, either in or out of the court, for judgment thereon; and <em>judgment </em>maybe given accordingly.\u201d The application in the present case must have been made under this section, and the decision below must have been a judgment, if any thing. It clearly cannot, therefore, he treated as an order for the purpose of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
