The act of 1847, <em>{Laws of </em>1847, <em>p. </em>557, \u00a7 4,) provides that when it shall appear to the court that the several persons interested in lands, &amp;c., of which , partition is sought, are desirous of enjoying their several shares or interest in common with each other, the court may direct, &amp;c. This certainly contemplates that the provisions for setting apart the shares of those who desire to remain without partition, shall be made before the final decree is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">The plaintiffs are entitled to the order of reference asked for, and if the defendants desire it a provision must be inserted in the order, that the referee ascertain and report whether the shares of the defendants can be set off to them to be enjoyed in common.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
