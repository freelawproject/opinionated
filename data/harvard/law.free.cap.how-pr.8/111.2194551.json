In the ordinary case of con verting property, or detaining it in hostility to the claim of the true owner, the order to arrest must be under <em>sub. 1, of \u00a7 </em>17.9, which is satisfied with bail, that the defendant shall render himself amenable to the process and judgment of the court, whereas an arrest under <em>sub. </em>3, of that section, can be superseded only by an undertaking to pay any judgment that may be recovered (Code, j 187, and 211).</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b119-7\">\n<em>Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Avk\"><em>September </em>1852.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqh\">Defendant moved to vacate an order of arrest. The action was brought to recover the \u201c possession of personal property.\u201d The sheriff returned that he had served the papers on defendant, and demanded of him the property, which he refused to give up, and he further certified\u00bb \u201c that the property has been concealed or disposed of, so that he could not take the same.\u201d On an affidavit stating the proceedings and sheriff\u2019s return, and that the defendant wrongfully took and detained the property, an order was made for the arrest of the defendant, and requiring him io give bail <em>to pay any judgment </em>that might be recovered in the action <em>(Code </em>\u00a7 187).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-8\">The affidavits on. which this motion is made show that defendant \u00edf a police clerk. That the property in question was taken irom a person arrested on a charge of stealing some $85 in money, and was- at the time placed in the custody of James M. Murray, the <em>Property Clerk </em>of the Police Court at Jefferson market. That it was in his custody, as such clerk when the sheriff demanded it and since has been and that it was not then, nor since has been in the possession nor under the control of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-9\">A.

It is not an order to give bail to appear in the action and continue within the reach of the process of the court. But it requires the defendant to give bail to pay any Judgment that may be recovered. A plaintiff in an action \u201cto recover the possession \u201d of personal property is not entitled to such an order, without proof that the defendant has concealed, removed, or dis posed of it \u201c with the intent that it should not be so found, or taken, or with the intent to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof\u201d <em>(Code </em>\u00a7 179, <em>sub. 3d). </em>The sheriff\u2019s certificate does not state such facts, nor does the affidavit on which the order of arrest was founded. This is a fatal defect (3 <em>San. S. C. R. </em>707, Roberts vs. Randall; <em>Code R., </em>N. <em>S. </em>219, Remin vs. Nagle).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Section 9 of the act of 1846, <em>p. </em>404, requires the clerks in each police office to keep proper books,, and enter in them at length a description of each article \u201c of stolen or other property,\u201d which shall be taken from prisoners. Section 14 of the act of 1844 <em>(p. </em>471), prescribes that \u201ca room shall be provided at each police court, for the deposit and preservation of all property brought to said court. One of the clerks of said court, under the direction of the magistrates, shall be charged with the safe keeping of said property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The papers show clearly that this property is in an iron safe in the Police Court, in the custody of Murray, as an officer of the law; that it was there when this action was brought, and that the plaintiff knew the latter fact when he prepared his first affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The; property was not, therefore, in the possession or control of the defendant, either at the time the action was commenced, nor when the sheriff demanded the property, nor has it been since.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">It could not be taken under the papers delivered to the sheriff, as it was not in the possession of the defendant or of his agent <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7209).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">It has not been removed, concealed or disposed of, since the action was brought. .It remains in the iron safe in which plaintiff\u2019s- first affidavit stated it to be. If the papers given to the sheriff authorized hirii to break th\u00e1t open and take it, he may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>It is not alleged that any such attempt was resisted or forbidden. The ease of Roberts vs. Randall is decisive upon the point, that the order of arrest was not authorized by the papers on which it was granted. Neither is the plaintiff entitled on the facts appearing upon the papers on this motion to such an order, or to the common order to arrest the defendant and require him to give bail to the action. The order of September 3d must be vacated, with <em>$10 </em>costs to defendant, to abide the event of the action (see Pike vs. Lent, 4 <em>Sand. S. C. R. </em>650).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
