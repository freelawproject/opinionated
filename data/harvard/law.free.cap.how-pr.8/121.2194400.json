The referee to whom the cause was referred, made his report on the 1st of December 1852, but dated his report as of the time the cause was submitted to him, which was on the 7th February 1852. In entering up judgment on the 10th March 1853, the clerk computed and included in the judgment, interest from the date of the report. The defendant applies for a readjustment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-10\">J. C.

I think this means from the time the verdict is brought in, or the report made. Where plaintiff is entitled to recover interest on the demand in suit, the referee will compute it and include it in his report. When the demand does not draw interest, a referee can not give it to the plaintiff by antedating his report. In this case interest should have been computed on the report from the first day of December 1852, when it was made; and the excess of interest, being $12-11, must be deducted from the judgment; neither party to have costs of this motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
