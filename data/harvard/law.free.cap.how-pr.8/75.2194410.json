An execution upon the judgment was issued to the defendant as a constable of Cazenovia, by virtue 'of which he levied upon and sold in March 1852, a one horse gig wagon, worth $40 or $50. At the time of the levy and sale the plaintiff was a householder and physician, having mostly a country practice. The wagon had four wheels, <em>with a small narrow body for one person. </em>The plaintiff had no other wagon, and this was necessary for him in his business to support his family. The plaintiff forbid the sale. This action was commenced in a Justice\u2019s' Court to recover the value of the wagon upon the ground that it was exempt from execution under- the law of 1842, which exempts \u201c <em>necessary household furniture, working tools and team, to an amount not exceeding </em>$15Q.\u201d The action was defended upon the ground that the wagon was not exempt from execution, and the defendant at the trial read and relied upon the case of Morse vs. Keyes (6 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>18). The cause was tried by a jury who rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $30, upon which the justice, on the 5th of May 1852, rendered a judgment for $30 damages and $5 costs. The defendant appealed from this judgment to the County Court of the county of Madison, where the judgment of the justice was reversed and judgment rendered against the plaintiff for $25-43 costs of appeal.

The proof by reputation that Eastman was not a householder at the time of contracting the debt, was clearly erroneous. It was a fact capable of direct proof, and could not be proved by hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>2. </em>The verdict was too large. It was proved that the property was bid off by Fuller at $13-88 for the plaintiff by an arrangement between all the parties, and that he afterwards had it and disposed of it. He was therefore only entitled to recover that amount and interest. The judgment of the County Court must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
