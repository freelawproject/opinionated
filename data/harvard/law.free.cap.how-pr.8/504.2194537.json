Miller, (4 <em>How. </em>94,) where it was held that an action for a breach of promise of marriage fell under the first subdivision of section 129, as being on a contract for the recovery of money only. On the contrary, it seemed to me that the contract was for something quite different; and indeed, that money did not enter into it, directly, at all. Nor do I suppose that the plaintiff should be permitted to take judgment without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>applying to the court, in case of a breach of a contract, where the suit is brought to recover damages, as was decided in Trapp agt. The N. Y. and Erie R. R. Co., (6 <em>How. </em>237.) I suppose that that subdivision ought only to be applied to those contracts which <em>in terms </em>provide for the payment of money. In other words, I suppose the Code manufactors intended to retain the substance of the old practice, but, to make it new and original, atttempted to put it into a new dress, and, as usually happens with them, failed to express themselves so as to be understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">But this case does not stand upon the same ground as those above cited. It will, therefore, be unnecessary to determine whether they are to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In this case the contract provides expressly for the payment of $200, as the liquidated damages, and there can be no reason for saying that it does not fall within the clause above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The motion to set aside summons must be granted, with leave to plaintiffs to amend the same within twenty days, on payment of five dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
