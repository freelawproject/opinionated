Mills, County Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqU\">By section 149 of the Code of 1852, an answer must contain a general or specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint intended to be controverted by the defendant, and if the defendant has a <em>defence </em>or a <em>counter-claim, </em>he must set out in his answer a statement of such defence or counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The 153d section tells us what the reply must contain, and by that it seems when the answer contains new matter constituting a counter-claim, the plaintiff may reply, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">The question now arises, what is a counter-claim'? and it must be confessed that without the aid of the Code, the meaning of that word would be somewhat doubtful; but the 150th section relieves us from that doubt. A counter-claim, as defined by that section, is a claim existing in favor of a <em>defendant </em>against a <em>plaintiff </em>(and it must be a <em>cause of </em>action) arising out of contract, or the transaction set forth in the complaint or connected with the subject of the action; and in an action arising on con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tract, any other cause of action also arising on contract, and existing at the commencement of the action, is a counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The defence set up in the answer in this action does not fall within either of these definitions of a counter-claim, but it is a defence entirely separate and distinct from, and in no way connected with, or growing out of the transaction set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The counsel for the plaintiff insisted, upon the argument, that by section 154 he was bound to reply in order to save the plaintiff from the consequences of that section; b\u00fat I think that section 168 saves him. For by that section <em>\u201c </em>an allegation of new matter in an ansv er, <em>not relating to a counter-claim, </em>is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The legislature \u00e9vidently intended to do away with the necessity of a reply in all cases, except in those cases where a counter-claim, as defined by the 150th section, was set up as a defence. It is also quite evident that section 154 was overlooked in the amendment of 1852; and in order to make the Code consistent and that section sensible, it must be construed and applied as it would be if the word <em>counter-claim, </em>instead of the word \u201cdefence\u201d was contained in it (Quin agt. Chambers.\u2014N. <em>Y. Legal Observer, </em>155).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The motion must be granted; but as the question is a new one, and this decision adverse to the views entertained by other judges, it must be without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
