Lindsley.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-9\">\u201c Where the claim of title to real property arises on the pleadings,\u201d and the plaintiff recovers a verdict, he is entitled to costs of course.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-10\">If the defendant puts the title in issue and compels the plaintiff to <em>prepara </em>to prove it, he can not relieve himself from the liability, by <em>admitting the title on the trial.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-11\">The only evidence that can he received as to whether or not \u201c the title came in question at the trial,\u201d is the certificate of the judge who tried the cause.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b139-12\"><em>October </em>1852.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfC\">This was an action of trespass upon real estate. The complaint alleges that in 1847, and until the time of the commencement of the action, the plaintiff was <em>seized in fee simple </em>and possessed of fifteen lots in the 19th ward of the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>That in 1850, the defendant unlawfully entered upon the lots and carried away a large quantity of earth, which was itself valuable, and also injured the market value of the lots by defacing them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">The answer denies any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the plaintiff\u2019s ownership, and then alleges that the defendant bought the earth, and obtained leave to enter and -\u2022art it away, from an alleged agent of the plaintiff, whom he paid for the same, and denies that he (defendant) damaged the lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">It appears from the pleadings that the plaintiff was not in the <em>actual possession </em>at the time of the trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">The cause came on for trial on the 19th day of October 1852, before the chief justice, and the plaintiff recovered a verdict for six cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney noticed his costs for adjustment, when the defendant\u2019s attorney obtained an order to show cause on the 26th October why an order should not be granted \u201c directing the clerk not to enter judgment against the defendant for any costs of the plaintiff, but that he adjust the defendant\u2019s costs in the action and enter judgment therefor in his favor against the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-9\">E. L. Fancher, <em>for the </em>Motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\">1. No claim of title to real property arises on the pleadings. The defendant did not in his answer make any claim of title to the lots, nor did he dispute the plaintiff\u2019s title; on the contrary, both points of defence raised by the answer, viz: that <em>\u201c </em>defendant entered by permission of plaintiff\u2019s agent;\u201d and, 2d, that \" other trespassers, and not defendant, caused any injury that was done,\u201d both <em>necessarily </em>and <em>expressly </em>assume that the title was vested in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-11\">2. On the trial plaintiff\u2019s title was admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-12\">3. The mere fact that the action was for a trespass on lands, does not entitle plaintiff to costs. There must be <em>\u201c </em>a claim of title,\u201d or an issue involving a dispute as to title arising on the pleadings, or called in question at the trial and a recovery <em>on that question </em>(Burhans agt. Tibbits, 7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>74, 77).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>This was not the case here. Defendant failed to prove the authority of the agent, and plaintiff had a verdict for breaking his close.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">The answer of <em>have from, an agent, </em>and an attempt to prove it, expressly admit plaintiff\u2019s title; then he can not have costs if he recover less than fifty dollars (Wickham vs. Seeley, 18 <em>Wend. </em>649).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">Other authorities show that plaintiff can not have, but must pay costs (Brown vs. Moyers, 7 <em>Wend. </em>495; Chandler vs. D 10 <em>Wend. </em>563; Koon vs. Mazuson, 6 <em>Hill, </em>44.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\">W. W. Niles, <em>Contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">1. A perfect <em>issue, </em>on the question of title, was raised by the pleadings <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 149), and the subsequent allegation that defendant committed the acts complained of, by authority of an alleged <em>agent </em>of plaintiff does not do away with that issue; for aught the court knows he was agent for plaintiff, who was <em>sub-landlord, </em>or even a <em>tenant </em>of the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-9\">2. The alleged points of defence do not \u201c assume that <em>plaintiff was owner;\u201d </em>a tenant in <em>actual possession </em>may maintain an action for trespass, <em>See.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-10\">3. In this case, however, we also sue for an <em>injury to the freehold; </em>in such case <em>possession </em>is not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-11\">We must, therefore, <em>allege </em>and prove title, or fail as to that part of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-12\">4. It is admitted by the pleadings that the plaintiff was not in the <em>actual possession; </em>then he could have no verdict at all except by alleging and proving title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-13\">The claim of title, therefore, necessarily arose upon the pleadings. The counsel cited 11 <em>Wend. </em>639 and 19 <em>id. </em>509.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-14\">Duer, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ANZQ\">I am inclined to think that the certificate of the justice who tried the cause, is the only evidence I can receive as to whether or not \u201c the title came in question at the trial.\u201d I must, therefore, in the absence of that confine myself to the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">I am of opinion that the question of title arises upon the pleadings within the meaning of the statute. It is directly put in issue by the first portion of the complaint and answer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>allegation in a subsequent part of the answer, that defendant went upon the lots by leave of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>agent, </em>does not do away with the effect of that issue. As the plaintiff was compelled to come <em>prepared to prove title, </em>the admission of his title by defendant <em>at the trial </em>ought not to deprive him of his right to costs; and even could I adopt the defendant\u2019s present construction of his answer, I think that having taken issue upon the claim of ownership in the complaint, he is estopped from denying that the plaintiff was bound to prove title upon the trial. If he meant by his answer to admit the title, he should not have made the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The motion must therefore be denied with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Chief Justice, Campbell and Bosworth, Justices, <em>concurred. </em>(a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>(a.) Ex relatione W. </em>W. Niles, Esq.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
