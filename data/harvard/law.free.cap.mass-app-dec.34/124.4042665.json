Savage, p.p.a., in which the plaintiff recovered judgment against the City of Boston in the amount of $409.04 which includes costs and interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Prior to. trial, the defendant City of Boston, as third party plaintiff, impleaded August H. Kaufman, Carl P. Coleman and Pauline Wolfson, as Trustees of Coleman Associates, as third party defendants. The third party defendants moved to dismiss \u201cthe impleader\u201d against them on the ground that the court is without jurisdiction \u201cover such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>impleader\u201d under, the provisions of G.L.c. 231, \u00a746 and \u00a7141 as revised.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b131-9\">Theodore R. Stanley for the City of Boston.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJK\">James D. Casey.for trustees of Coleman Associates, third party defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The court allowed the motion to dismiss, and the City of Boston being aggrieved by the court\u2019s action brings this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">There was no error. The right to implead a party is governed by statute, and is found in G.L.c. 231, \u00a748, entitled \u201cImpleader\u201d. Unfortunately, an oversight in drafting the act failed to make it applicable to the District Courts of the Commonwealth. Nor was \u00a7141 of G.L.c. 231 entitled \u201cProvisions applicable to District Courts\u201d so amended as to include the above mentioned \u201cImpleader\u201d statute (G.L.c. 231, \u00a738.). As a .consequence the advantages of this Impleader statute are available only in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">See Forty-first Report, Judicial Council of Massachusetts, 1965, pp 25-26;</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\n<em>Report dismissed. \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
