There was a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The only question of law raised by the defendant\u2019s request for rulings which the justice denied, is whether the plaintiff is barred from recovering the deficiency because it did not file on the return day of the action \u201can affidavit signed by the purchaser at is aid foreclosure sale stating the price paid for said motor vehicle and the date and place of the sale.\u201d G.L. c. 255B, \u00a7 20A, inserted by St. 1960, c. 173. The findings by which the defendant claims to be aggrieved were that \u201cNo affidavit was filed by the plaintiff on return day of writ. I find, however, that that plaintiff was not a \u2018holder\u2019 as defined by Chapter 255B. . .(section 1.\u201d The defendant relies on G.L. c. 255B, $ 20A.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Chapter 255B, under the title \u201cRetail Instalment Sales of Motor Vehicles\u201d was inserted in the General Laws by St. 1958, c. 674, \u00a7 1. \u00a7 20A, relating to the filing of the affidavit on the return day of the action, was later added to Chapter 255B by St. 1960, c. 173. \u00a7 20A was substantially amended by St. 1966, c. 284, \u00a7 3 and by ^ 5 of that Act became effective on November 1,1966. The transaction with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>we are concerned occnred in 1964, before the 1966 amendment became effective. However, the result we reach with reference to the affidavit would not be different under the 1966 amendment of \u00a7 20A.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00a7 20A, as appearing in St. 1960, c. 173, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cSection 20A. The maker of a note secured by a mortgage or conditional sales contract, relating to the sale of a motor vehicle which has been repossessed, shall not be liable in a suit for a deficiency thereon after sale pursuant to the terms of said mortgage or conditional sales contract, unless the holder of said note shall on the return day of said action file an affidavit signed by the purchaser at said foreclosure sale stating the price paid for said motor vehicle and the date and place of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">GhL. c. 255B, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cHolder\u201d, as \u201cthe retail seller of the motor vehicle under or subject to a retail instalment contract, or, if the contract is purchased by a financing agency or other assignee, the sales finance company or other assignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The plaintiff was not \u201cthe retail seller of the motor vehicle\u201d nor was it the purchaser or assignee of financing paper from a dealer, financing agency or other assignee. It made a direct loan to the defendant who, with the proceeds of the loan, purchased the motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>from a dealer and then pledged it as security for his note to the bank. It follows that the justice was right in deciding that the plaintiff was not a \u201cholder\u201d as that word is used in c. 255B and that it was therefore not required to file the affidavit required by \u00a7 20A as a condition precedent to recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Precisely the same question was presented to us for decision in 1965 in the case of <em>City Bank </em>and <em>Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>17 LEGALITE 81. In that case we shared the opinion of the justice that \u00a7 20A had no application to a bank which made a direct loan to the defendant secured by a motor vehicle which he had purchased from a dealer with funds borrowed from a bank. We held, as we hold in the case before us, that \u201cThe reason is that the note which the defendant gave the plaintiff was not a note secured by a mortgage or conditional is ales contr act relating to the sale of the motor vehicle. The defendant had received from the dealer unconditional title to the . . . automobile. The defendant then pledged with the bank the automobile as collateral security for the payment of his note. In other words, an unconditional sale of the motor vehicle having been made the transaction involved her'e did not thereafter relate to the sale of it. A reading of all the provisions of Chapter 255B confirms the conclusion that the statute applies only to a conditional vendor of a motor vehicle or to a \u201csales financing company,\u201d which would include a bank which takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>from the vendor the contraet paper, including the buyer\u2019s note.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u201c. . . The defendant\u2019s note was not acquired by the bank from the vendor. It was acquired directly from the defendant buyer, the retail sale to the defendant having been made without being subject to a retail instalment contract-. The definition of \u201cRetail instalment contract\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d, \u00a7 1, is \u201can agreement, entered into in this state, pursuant to which the title to, the property in or a lien upon a motor vehicle, which is the subject matter of a retail instalment sale, is retained or taken by a retail seller from a retail buyer as security, in whole or in part, for the buyer\u2019s obligation.. \u201cRetail instalment sale\u201d or \u201csale\u201d, \u00a7 1, is defined as \u201ca sale of a motor vehicle by a retail seller to a retail buyer for a time sale price payable in two or more installments, payment of which is secured by a retail instalment contract. . .\u201d. \u201cRetail seller\u201d or \u201c\u00a1seller\u201d is defined, \u00a7 1, as \u201ca person who sells a motor vehicle to a retail buyer under or subject to a retail instalment contract. . \u201cgales finance company\u201d, as defined in s.l, includes a bank or other person \u201c. . . engaged, in whole or in part, in the business of purchasing retail instalment contracts from one or more retail \u00a1sellers and ... a retail seller, engaged in whole or in part, in the business of holding retail instalment contracts acquired from retail buyers...</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201cAll those definitions in \u00a7 1 expressly make e. 255B applicabel only to the dealers who make instalment contracts for the retail sales of automobiles or those financing companies, including banks, which purchase the contracts from the retail dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201cIt is not within our province to undertake to extend the statute beyond its stated limits. The note before us provides for the recovery of the deficiency. The law allows it. Uniform Commercial Code, Secured Transactions, G.L. c. 109, \u00a7 9-502(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As no error of law has been shown either in the denial of the defendant\u2019s requested rulings or in the findings, the report should, be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
