As to the infant, we feel bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Matter of Goglas </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Auth. </em>(11 N Y 2d 680). (Appeal from order of Herkimer Special Term granting leave to plaintiffs to file late notice of claims on defendant Town of German Flatts.) Present \u2014 Williams, P.
