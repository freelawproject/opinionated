Gresham, plaintiffs late husband. Plaintiff, Linda Lee Gresham, contends that MML should be deemed to have issued a $110,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Decedent had been employed by Hateo Chemical Corp. for 23 years, ending December 31, 1986. Hateo provided group life insurance giving decedent $110,000 coverage as part its employee benefit plan. The plan, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-24, offered its employees the right to convert the coverage to an individual policy within 31 days of termination of employment, without the necessity of a medical examination. In this case, the 31-day period expired January 31, 1987. Here, Hateo gave decedent his \u201cNotice of Right of Conversion\u201d in mid-December, amply complying with this requirement. The notice clearly stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">If you desire to convert your life insurance, you must act promptly by making application and paying the first premium to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company within THIRTY-ONE DAYS following the date of termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">If you elect to convert, you should contact the closest Massachusetts Mutual Agency either in person or by mail____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">On January 26, 1987, five days prior to the expiration of the 31-day period, decedent telephoned MML\u2019s Saddle Brook, New Jersey agency and spoke to Ronald Nalven, acknowledged to be a full-time agent employed directly by MML. He informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Nalven that he wished to convert his policy, and requested that Nalven come to his home for that purpose. According to decedent\u2019s phone records, he spoke to Nalven for approximately three minutes. According to Nalven, during this time he told decedent that his (Nalven\u2019s) schedule would not permit the home visit, but that decedent should go to an MML office, sign the conversion form and pay the first premium. Alternatively, he stated that he could schedule an appointment with decedent after the conversion period expired, but in such event, he could provide information only concerning policies that would require evidence of insurability. Nalven asked whether decedent, then 42 years old, was in good health, and was assured that he was. Obviously, neither anticipated decedent encountering any problems in obtaining coverage even after the conversion date.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Although the issue is contested by MML, the judge found that Nalven actually went to decedent\u2019s home on January 29, 1987, two days before the conversion period expired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since Nalven testified that he recalled meeting with decedent after January 31, 1987, he remembered no discussion of converting the group policy. Although we do not have decedent\u2019s recollections, plaintiff testified that after the meeting decedent told her that Nalven informed decedent it was then too late to convert the policy. This statement was admissible not only to prove decedent\u2019s then state of mind under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(12), but also to prove the included hearsay of Nalven\u2019s statement as an admission by defendant\u2019s agent, <em>Evid.R. </em>63(9)(a). The evidence also could be admitted as a trustworthy statement of a decedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Evid.R. </em>63(32), if notice of the intent to introduce this statement had been given defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">There is no dispute that Nalven failed to bring with him forms for the conversion of the group policy and information concerning the premium for any converted policy. Instead, he had prepared and left with decedent descriptions of various new insurance policies and the amount of the premiums therefor. Decedent signed an application dated February 4, 1987 for one of the new policies which Nalven submitted to MML. The application was denied in late March, but was then resubmitted by Nalven. It was again (and finally) denied for underwriting reasons relating to decedent\u2019s health. Decedent\u2019s cancer was diagnosed the next month; he died December 12, 1987. When no insurance benefits were forthcoming, plaintiff instituted this action for benefits under the conversion policy, notwithstanding the fact that no formal conversion application had been presented, nor had the first year\u2019s premium been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The trial judge determined that the application for new insurance was made under a mutual mistake of fact relating to decedent\u2019s health, and that the court could and should apply equitable principles and reform the MML agreement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to carry out his obvious intention to convert his group insurance rights to a private policy. The judge did not attribute any bad motives to Nalven, but rather determined that \u201che was trying to sell something that he thought was better,\u201d and thereby convinced decedent to change his position and buy the new insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">MML urges three basic reasons why we should reject the trial judge\u2019s conclusion. First, it argues that the claim is governed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>under which the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment against defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>dant. Second, defendant contends that decedent did not exercise his conversion rights in the manner and within the time period specified in the policy and that any equitable modification is precluded. Third, defendant asserts that even if State law applies, no grounds were proven for equitable relief. Defendant\u2019s additional evidence points have already been considered by us <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">ERISA, in 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a), specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(1) by a participant or beneficiary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(A) for the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Subsection (a)(3) also permits actions by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for injunctive relief from a violation of ERISA or the terms of the plan, or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief. However, jurisdiction in actions under subsection (a)(3) resides exclusively in the federal courts, since 29 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(e)(1) grants State courts jurisdiction solely for actions under subsection (a)(1)(B). Furthermore, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1144(a) generally preempts State substantive law relating to employee benefit plans described in ERISA. There is thus no question that Hatco\u2019s group insurance plan is governed by ERISA. Yet even under ERISA, if an insurer breaches its agreement with a beneficiary, certain redress may be obtained in either a State or federal court. However, the sole relief the trial judge could have considered, and that we may consider on this review, is the recovery by decedent or his beneficiary of benefits under the plan or the enforcement or clarification of his rights under the plan. 29 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). <em>Barnhouse v. Petrolite Corp., </em>700 <em>F.Supp. </em>16, 17 (S.D.Tex.1988); <em>Imler v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>8 <em>Kan.App.2d </em>71, 650 P.2d 712, 714 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">While the trial judge may have exceeded his non-preempted authority in exercising full equitable jurisdiction, similar analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>sis, limited to the enforcement of decedent\u2019s or plaintiff\u2019s rights under the terms of the plan, might yield the same results. Thus, preclusion of a state court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers does not require a finding for defendant on the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The plan and the Notice of Right of Conversion provide that decedent was required to convert the group insurance within 31 days of termination of employment. Further, in order to effect conversion, decedent was required to make an application therefor, and pay the first year\u2019s premium. There was no requirement that he go to an office, only that he \u201cshould contact the closest Massachusetts Mutual Agency either in person or by mail.\u201d He did so. He spoke to Mr. Nalven and unambiguously told him that he wanted to convert his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judge found that Nalven came to decedent\u2019s home on January 29,1987. Had Nalven then told decedent that the time had not expired, brought with him the conversion forms and informed decedent of the amount of the first year\u2019s premium, defendant\u2019s argument that decedent was bound by his decision to apply for new insurance in lieu of the converted policy might be unassailable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that meeting, however, decedent could not choose between the conversion policy and a new policy, since no information was apparently presented to him concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>conversion policy. He could not very well have determined whether to pay the premium on the conversion policy if he was never informed of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">While the employment benefit plan has no express condition that the insurer\u2019s agents must inform the former employee of the amount of the conversion premium and supply an appropriate form to convert the policy, the plan need not be equitably reformed to provide such terms. Rather, these terms may be implied in law from the terms that are already present in the plan. To do otherwise would render the beneficiary\u2019s right to convert meaningless. <em>Contrast </em>the necessity for reformation in <em>Weinisch v. Sawyer, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>333, 336-41, 587 A.2d 615 (1991). Here we have merely recognized implied terms in a contract; we find no necessity to reform it. While a beneficiary possibly could create his own form to apply for the conversion policy, without the insurer\u2019s input, the amount of the premium would be based upon pure speculation. <em>See Donnelly v. Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>136 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>78, 90 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>605, 611, 482 <em>N.E.2d </em>424, 430 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">As noted earlier, the trial judge did not find that Nalven was impelled by bad motives to withhold the application and renewal premium. Yet, if we give effect to the factual finding that Nalven went to decedent\u2019s home during the conversion period, it also appears that he failed to provide the application and amount of premium. Further, according to plaintiff he also misinformed decedent that the conversion period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">As permitted by 29 <em>US. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), we \u201cclarify [decedent\u2019s or plaintiff\u2019s] rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d When an initial informal request is timely made for conversion, and an opportunity given to the insurer to present the form of conversion application and to inform the applicant of the amount of the first year\u2019s premium, the conversion period must be deemed extended until a reasonable time after the insurer has complied with this implicit term of the plan. Absent prompt pre-expiration action by the insurer after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the conversion inquiry, the timely submission requirement may even be said to be legally waived, at least until a reasonable time is given after late compliance by the company. <em>Cf. Kubeck v. Concord Ins. Co., </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 533-534, 248 A.2d 131 (Ch.Div.1968), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 259 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1969) (broker\u2019s assurance of ineffectiveness of cancellation); <em>Highway Trailer Co. v. Donna Motor Lines, Inc., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>442, 449, 217 A.2d 617 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 <em>U.S. </em>834, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>77, 17 L.Ed.2d 68 (1966) (failure to supply proof of loss forms); <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co. v. Slide Rule &amp; Scale Eng\u2019g Co., </em>177 <em>F.2d </em>305, 310 (7th Cir.1949); <em>Kramer v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>494 <em>F.Supp. </em>1026, 1030-1031 (D.N. J.1980) (failure to accept first premium); <em>and see DiMarino v. Wishkin, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 393, 479 A.2d 444 (broker\u2019s failure to replace cancelled policy as requested by plaintiff and failure to inform insured that the coverage sought was not possible). Furthermore, if the beneficiary has been informed by the insurer's agent that the time period has run, when in fact it has not (there was no express finding to this effect by the trial judge and we need not make such a finding here), this misinformation should also be corrected. <em>Cf. Donnelly v. Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., supra, </em>90 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>at 612, 482 N.E.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">On the basis of the trial judge\u2019s factual findings and the law as we have here outlined, plaintiff is entitled to the insurance for which decedent clearly intended to apply. There are no significant different factual determinations necessary to support this legal theory for plaintiff \u201cto recover benefits due to [her] under the terms of [decedent\u2019s] plan,\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), and those necessary for the equitable determination made by the trial court. <em>Cf. Weinisch, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 336-41, 587 A.2d 615. The \u201cplan\u201d shall be deemed to include the above-described implicit duties of MML, and MML\u2019s failure to comply with its duties extended the time to exercise the option to convert at least until plaintiff\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to do so. Therefore, while we disagree (primarily because of the jurisdictional impediment) with the trial judge\u2019s equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>theory, we fully agree with the result. We reiterate that we have found no necessity to reform the agreement between Hateo and MML. We have merely found that MML had breached the contract as it exists. We thus distinguish <em>Weinisch, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The parties stipulated that the amount in difference is actually only $100,-000 since the insurance actually applied for by decedent under the circumstances described <em>infra </em>was for the lesser amount of $100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">There is sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s finding. Decedent\u2019s personal diary showed the visit on that date, and was admissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(32), although argument concerning admissibility centered around <em>Evid.R. </em>63(13). Furthermore, printouts of alternative coverage plans and their respective premiums left by Nalven with decedent all reflected the January 29, 1987 date. The fact that decedent\u2019s actual application for new coverage was dated one week later, while evidentiary, does not require a contrary finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">As defendant argues, the only agreements here were the life insurance component of Hatco\u2019s retirement plan entered into between Hateo and MML and decedent\u2019s participation in the plan. The trial judge apparently intended to reform the terms of decedent\u2019s application for new insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We say \"might\" be unassailable, since, as noted at oral argument before us, plaintiffs attorney might have asserted a tort claim against Nalven and defendant for negligence. Although decedent considered himself in good health and therefore insurable, there was always the possibility of an undetected condition. The conversion form and premium could have been submitted conditionally prior to the January 31st date, together with the application for new insurance and a request that the conversion insurance be processed only in the event decedent was found unacceptable as a new risk after medical examination. The failure to explain these rights to decedent, if established, may well have been negligent. <em>Cf. Sobotor v. Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 491 <em>A.2d 737 </em>(App.Div.1984); <em>DiMarino v. Wishkin, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 393, 479 A.2d 444 (App.Div.1984). This claim, however, was not included in the complaint before us against MML, and any personal claims against Nalven have been voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
