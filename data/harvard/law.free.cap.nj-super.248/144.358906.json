We hold that the rule\u2019s age requirement is satisfied by proof that the declarant was under 12 years old when the statement was made, regardless of her age at the time of the scheduled trial. We also conclude, however, that the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2A:81-18 to -23) is applicable to child witnesses and that the prosecutor, by not utilizing available statutory remedies, failed to exercise due diligence in attempting to obtain the presence of the declarant for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In early spring of 1988, the Pemberton Township Police Department received information that defendant had sexually abused several children who resided in the apartment complex in which he lived. As part of the ensuing investigation, Detective Ralph Johnston took a statement from R.I., who was then ten years old, in which she reported that defendant had molested her on a number of occasions in his apartment. R.I. also recounted that she had observed defendant commit sexual acts upon other young children in his apartment. According to R.I., she had been threatened by defendant and thus had told no one of these incidents. A formal statement was taken from R.I. on May 31, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In July of 1988, the Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s Office received reports from the parents of several children, including R.I.\u2019s mother, claiming that they had been threatened by members of defendant\u2019s family. On July 28, 1988, a multi-count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>indictment was returned charging defendant with sexual assault <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2), terroristic threats <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3a), hindering apprehension <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3b(2)), and endangering the welfare of a child <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a). We need not describe the indictment in detail. Suffice it to say, it alleged that defendant had sexually abused and threatened R.I. and three other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Trial was originally scheduled for September 10, 1990. However, the prosecutor\u2019s office learned that R.I. and her mother had moved to Florida, in part because of defendant\u2019s threats. The prosecutor located the family in August of 1990 and issued a subpoena, but R.I.\u2019s mother refused to permit the child to return to New Jersey. The prosecutor did not pursue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Instead, he filed a pretrial motion for the admission of R.I.\u2019s hearsay statement, claiming that the declarant was unavailable. At the hearing, the prosecutor asserted that the statement was trustworthy and that there was independent admissible evidence corroborating R.I.\u2019s account of defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. The Law Division agreed that R.I. was not available and that resort to the Uniform Act to secure her attendance would likely be futile in light of her mother\u2019s prior defiance of the subpoena. The judge nevertheless denied the State\u2019s motion on the basis that, although R.I. was ten years old when the statement was made, she had reached the age of 13 by the scheduled trial date. The judge construed <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) as requiring that the child victim be under 12 years of age at the time of the trial. An order embodying the court\u2019s decision was entered and this appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We first address the question of whether R.I. was \u201cunavailable as a witness.\u201d This phrase is defined in <em>Evid.R. </em>62. The only definitions germane to the present inquiry are those contained in subsections (b) and (d), which state in pertinent part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that a witness is unavailable if \u201cbeyond the jurisdiction of the court\u2019s process to compel appearance,\u201d or where the \u201cproponent ... is unable, despite due diligence, to procure [his] attendance.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>62(b) and (d). The facts set forth in the affidavit supporting the prosecutor\u2019s motion satisfied neither of these evidentiary requisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">R.I. was not beyond the Law Division\u2019s power to compel her appearance. Both New Jersey and Florida have adopted the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses, commonly known as the Interstate Compact. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-18; <em>Fla.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 942.01. In <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>217 <em>N.J. Super. </em>51, 524 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.1987), certif. den. 108 <em>N.J. </em>581, 531 A.2d 1355 (1987), we said that the Interstate Compact\u2019s provisions were available to the prosecutor to secure the attendance of a 13-year-old witness. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55, 524 A.2d 1281. Implicit in our decision was the determination that the Interstate Compact applied to child witnesses. To put the matter at rest, we hold here that the Interstate Compact is available to secure the attendance of a child witness in a criminal prosecution so long as the statutory requirements are satisfied. These include a showing that the \u201cwitness is material and necessary\u201d and his appearance \u201cwill not cause undue hardship.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We find that the prosecutor failed to exercise due diligence in seeking to procure R.I.\u2019s appearance for trial. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54-55, 524 A.2d 1281. The mere fact that R.I.\u2019s mother refused to honor a subpoena was not sufficient to establish that resort to the Interstate Compact would have been futile. We recognize the practical problems attendant to securing the appearance of child witnesses. These difficulties are accentuated when the children\u2019s parents do not wish them to testify and refuse to cooperate. However, the Interstate Compact provides measures to deal with defiant witnesses. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-19. These remedies and others, such as the contempt power and the appointment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>guardian, can be molded to insure compliance by recalcitrant parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We acknowledge the concerns expressed by R.I.\u2019s mother. We are sensitive to the rights of victims and wish to spare them any further suffering. However, other considerations are paramount. The law is entitled to every person\u2019s evidence. A witness cannot be made the final arbiter as to whether he or she will testify. So too, the rights of the accused must be considered. Although the demands of the hearsay rules and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause are not equivalent or congruent, the United States Supreme Court has said that both rest on \u201csimilar values.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, -.110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3139, 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 651 (1990). We need not determine the exact requirements imposed by the confrontation clause, because the precise issue is not before us. We note, however, that we are dealing here with an evidentiary rule not falling within the hearsay exceptions that have been historically and traditionally recognized. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653. The fact that we are treading on new ground impels caution. Finally, we are concerned with the right of the public to insist that the best available evidence be used in the prosecution of crimes. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 102, 543 A.2d 965 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">We thus conclude that the Law Division erred in its finding that the witness was unavailable. Because the prosecutor may wish to make further attempts to secure R.I.\u2019s attendance, we will consider whether the age requirement contained in <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) bars admission of the witness\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The Law Division concluded that the age of the witness at trial was determinative in deciding whether <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) was applicable. In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that the object of the evidentiary rule was to counteract the intimidating atmosphere of the courtroom setting which often ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>versely affects the ability of child witnesses to testify reliably. The Law Division determined that because witnesses 12-years-old and above have attained a greater level of maturity, the stress of the courtroom experience is less threatening. The court thus held that the exception to the hearsay rule was confined to children who have not attained the age of 12 at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"><em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 537 A.2d 667 (1988), was the genesis of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33). Citing national studies and scholarly comment, our Supreme Court observed that \u201cchild victim accounts of incidents of sexual abuse are highly reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 537 A.2d 667. <em>See also National Legal Resource Center for Child Advocacy and Protection, Young Lawyers Division, American Bar Association, Recommendations for Improving Legal Intervention in Intrafamily Child Abuse Cases, </em>(J. Buckley ed. 1982), \u00a7 4.3 at 34; Skoler, <em>New Hearsay Exceptions for a Child\u2019s Statement of Sexual Abuse, </em>18 <em>J. Marshall L.Rev. </em>1, 6 (1984); Note, A <em>Comprehensive Approach to Child Hearsay Statements in Sex Abuse Cases, </em>83 <em>Colum.L.Rev. </em>1745, 1751 (1983); Note, <em>The Testimony of Child Victims in Sex Abuse Prosecutions: Two Legislative Innovations, </em>98 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>806, 817 (1985). The Court reasoned that \u201c[y]oung children, having no sexual orientation, do not necessarily regard a sexual encounter as shocking or unpleasant, and frequently relate such incidents to a parent or relative in a matter-of-fact manner.\u201d <em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 359-360, 537 A.2d 667. According to the Court, \u201c[t]he overwhelming opinion of mental health workers, social welfare workers, and police investigators is that children almost never make false [sexual abuse] reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 537 A.2d 667, quoting Skoler, <em>New Hearsay Exceptions for a Child\u2019s Statement of Sexual Abuse, </em>18 <em>J. Marshall L.Rev. </em>at 44-45. The Court contrasted the reliability of a child complainant\u2019s out-of-court statement with the \u201cstress of the courtroom experience,\u201d 109 <em>N.J. </em>at 360, 537 A.2d 667, and found that the \u201cunique limitations on the availability of evidence in such cases, as well as the demonstrated [trustwor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>thiness] of sex abuse complaints by child victims,\u201d justified the creation of a new hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 537 <em>A.2d </em>667.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Because <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) is founded upon the presumed reliability of out-of-court statements of youthful sex abuse victims, we are convinced that the age of the declarant at the time the declaration is made is critical in determining whether the hearsay exception applies. More specifically, the evidentiary rule\u2019s age requirement is satisfied if the declarant was under 12 years of age when the statement was made. The fact that the declarant has reached the age of 12 or is older at the time of trial is irrelevant. Our interpretation of the rule is consonant with the language employed, comports with the reason for its existence, and is supported by important policy considerations. A contrary construction might encourage the defense to delay trial and hold the prosecutor captive to dilatory tactics. It is the presumed trustworthiness of a child victim\u2019s out-of-court statement that militates in favor of its admission. The passage of time does not detract from the reliability of the victim\u2019s account of an incident of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that the sole purpose of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) is to bolster the credibility of a child witness subject to the intimidating atmosphere of the courtroom. In the typical case, where the child is available at trial, that may well be the impact of admitting the witness\u2019s out-of-court statement. That could not have been the sole object in adopting the hearsay exception, however, because <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33) specifically envisions cases in which the declarant is not available for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> The Law Division judge made no findings concerning whether R.I.\u2019s out-of-court statement was trustworthy. We note that a finding concerning the reliability of the statement must be drawn from the totality of the circumstances that surround the making of the declaration. To be admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>under the confrontation clause, the statement \u201cmust possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>\u2014 <em>US. </em>at-, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d at 657. The courts have identified a number of factors relating to whether hearsay statements made by a child declarant in sex abuse cases are reliable. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656. <em>See also State v. Moritz, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 586 A.2d 290 (App.Div.1991); <em>State v. M.Z., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 575 A.2d 82 (Law Div.1990). Should the prosecutor renew his application for admission of the hearsay statement pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33), the issue of trustworthiness should be fully explored and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
