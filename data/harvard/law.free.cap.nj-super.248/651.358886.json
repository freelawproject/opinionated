STEIN, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Plaintiffs appeal the Law Division judgment limiting their recovery under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>49:3-71(a)(2) under New Jersey\u2019s version of the Uniform Securities Act to actual damages, interest and taxed costs, and denying out-of-pocket expenses and counsel fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>49:3-71(a)(2) provides that a securities buyer who suffers damages as a result of the seller\u2019s misrepresentation or omission of a material fact is entitled to recover</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">the consideration paid for the security, together with interest at 12% per year from the date of payment and costs.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The trial judge molded the jury\u2019s specific interrogatory answers into a damage award of $6,517.06, the amount of commissions withheld by defendant when plaintiffs redeemed their mutual fund shares. The judge also allowed 12% interest plus taxed costs and denied reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We conclude that the trial judge correctly ruled that the statute limits costs to those taxed costs allowable pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>22A:2-8. \u201cCosts\u201d does not include out-of-pocket expenses or attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>R. </em>4:42-9 provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">(a) No fee for legal services shall be allowed in the taxed costs or otherwise, except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">(8) In all cases where counsel fees are permitted by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>49:3-71(a)(2) does not expressly provide for counsel fees. They cannot be awarded pursuant to that statute. Unlike our statute, the Uniform Law provides that in addition to damages a successful plaintiff may recover \u201cinterest ... costs, and <em>reasonable attorneys\u2019 </em>fees,____\u201d Uniform Securities Act, \u00a7 410(a)(2), 7B U.L.A. (1985) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">We reject the holding allowing counsel fees pursuant to this statute in <em>Cola v. Terzano, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 60, 322 A.2d 195 (Law Div.1974), <em>affirmed sub nom., Cola v. Packer, </em>156 <em>N.J. Super. </em>77, 383 A.2d 460 (App.Div.1978), and note that the Law Division\u2019s ruling on counsel fees was not discussed in the Appellate Division\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">The failure to provide for counsel fees to a successful claimant proceeding under this statute may have been a legislative oversight. The Legislature has been willing to make counsel fee provisions for successful litigants pursuing remedies under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>other consumer-oriented laws such as the Consumer Fraud Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. A provision for attorneys\u2019 fees may be consistent with the statutory policy of the Uniform Securities Act, set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>49:3-75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">[T]o effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those States which enact similar laws____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">It is nevertheless a matter of legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"AvG\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
