Sullivan (plaintiff) and Patricia Sullivan, his wife, against various manufacturers and distributors of certain asbestos products to which plaintiff was exposed for a period of 33 years during the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of his employment. As a result of his exposure plaintiff developed thickening of the pleural lining of his lungs, an asbestos-related disease. The trial court dismissed his claim for present physical injury on the ground that the condition entails no loss of pulmonary function and because it is causing plaintiff no discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Dr. Donald Auerbach, plaintiffs medical expert, testified that, in 1981, plaintiffs chest x-rays first revealed the presence of asbestos-related pleural disease. He also stated that the scarring and thickening was permanent and its effect is to make the lining of the lungs \u201cvery hard____ [I]t can be just like shoe leather.\u201d Based on x-rays from 1981 to 1989 Dr. Auerbach noted that plaintiff\u2019s disease \u201chas progressed,\u201d and \u201cwill progress.\u201d However, he indicated that symptoms such as breathing impairment, shortness of breath and coughing are only possible with extensive pleural scarring or thickening, that plaintiff\u2019s scarring is not extensive and that he is at present symptom-free. He acknowledged also that pleural thickening is the least serious of the asbestos-related diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">On the plaintiff\u2019s medical evidence the trial court dismissed plaintiffs claim of a present physical injury for the reason that \u201cexcept for emotional damages and future damages for medical [surveillance] examinations\u201d there could be no claim for damages arising from plaintiff\u2019s asbestos-related pleural disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The jury found against plaintiff on his claim for emotional distress and for punitive damages, but awarded him $2,255 for the anticipated cost of future medical surveillance. The principal point of plaintiff\u2019s appeal is that the trial court erred in dismissing his damage claim for present physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">According to <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 905, Comment b at 456 (1977), compensatory damages that may be awarded without proof of pecuniary loss include compensation for \u201cbodily harm,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany impairment of the physical condition of the body, including illness or physical pain.\u201d Thus, compensatory damages can be awarded for bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>harm, \u201calthough there is no impairment of a bodily function and, in some situations, even though the defendant\u2019s act is beneficial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\"><em>Herber v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>785 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986), and <em>Mauro v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 542 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd, sub nom Mauro v. Raymark Industries, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>126, 561 A.2d 257 (1989), are instructive. In <em>Herber, </em>plaintiff was exposed to asbestos products during the course of his employment and was diagnosed as having asbestos-related pleural thickening. However, he had no symptoms such as coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. <em>Herber, supra, </em>785 A.2d at 88. Although the jury found that plaintiff\u2019s exposure to the asbestos fibers had caused pleural thickening, and that he had suffered a physical injury to his lungs, it decided that the sum of money that would fairly, reasonably, and adequately compensate him for his \u201cinjuries\u201d was \u201cnone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. That determination was upheld on appeal, based upon the reviewing court\u2019s conclusion that the jury\u2019s determination was one which properly lay within its authority. <em>Id. </em>at 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In <em>Mauro, </em>too, plaintiff had suffered pleural thickening as a result of long-term exposure to asbestos. The jury awarded a total of $7,500 for his \u201cclaims of bodily injury, emotional distress, pain and suffering and medical surveillance.\u201d <em>Mauro, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 211, 542 A.2d 16. In its affirming decision, the Supreme Court observed that plaintiff\u2019s x-rays showed \u201cscarring of the lung lining,\u201d and that \u201calthough the results of his physical examination and lung function test were \u2018normal,\u2019 he had bilateral thickening of both chest walls and calcification of the diaphragm.\u201d <em>Mauro v. Raymark Industries, Inc., supra, </em>at 116 <em>N.J. </em>129-30, 561 A.2d 257. As here, there were no \u201cphysical symptoms evidencing plaintiff\u2019s distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 561 A.2d 257. The Supreme Court also noted, without adverse comment, that the trial court \u201cpermitted the jury to consider Mauro\u2019s claim for damages caused by his present medical condition, as well as the cost of future medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>surveillance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 561 A.2d 257 (emphasis added). It specifically stated that Mauro\u2019s \u201cexposure to asbestos has resulted in physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 561 <em>A.2d </em>257. Finally, the Court observed that \u201cour case law affords toxic-tort plaintiffs the right to receive full compensation for any provable diminution of bodily health, accommodating <em>all </em>damage claims attributable to present injury____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 561 <em>A.</em>2d 257 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We distinguish <em>Landrigan v. Celotex Corp., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 579 A.2d 1268 (App.Div.1990). There, suit was brought on the claim that decedent\u2019s colon cancer had been caused by the asbestos products to which decedent had been exposed during his working lifetime. During the trial, decedent\u2019s surviving spouse asserted a claim for damages based upon decedent\u2019s pleural thickening, likewise said to be asbestos related. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claim for the \u201cminimal pleural thickening\u201d that was first discovered during the trial when plaintiff\u2019s expert examined an x-ray of decedent\u2019s lungs. <em>Id. </em>at 463-64, 579 A.2d 1268. The opinion pointed out that decedent \u201cwas never made aware of its existence,\u201d and expressly invited comparison of that case with <em>Mauro. Id. </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464, 579 A.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We conclude that the question of whether plaintiff\u2019s pleural thickening constitutes an injury and, if so, the extent of compensation to be awarded for the physical changes brought about in the lining of plaintiff\u2019s lungs, should properly have been left to the jury\u2019s determination. We believe our view coincides with those expressed or implied by other courts which have considered comparable cases. <em>See Howell v. Celotex Corp., </em>904 F.2d 3, 5 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Herber v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>785 F.2d 79, 88-89 (3d Cir.1986); <em>Giovanetti v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>372 <em>Pa.Super. </em>431, 539 A.2d 871, 876 (Pa.Super.1988); <em>but see In re Hawaii Federal Asbestos Cases, </em>734 <em>F.Supp. </em>1563, 1567-68 (D.Hawaii 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In our view, <em>Schweitzer v. Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), </em>758 <em>F.2d </em>936 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 <em>US. </em>864, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>183, 88 L.Ed.2d 152 (1985), and <em>Burns v. Jaquays Min. Corp., </em>156 <em>Ariz. </em>375, 752 F.2d 28 (App.1987), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>162 <em>Ariz. </em>186, 781 F.2d 1373 (1989), are distinguishable from the case now before us based on material differences in the physical facts presented to those courts. <em>Schweitzer </em>involved claims asserted by railroad workers under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51-60 (1986). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims of injuries seem to have consisted of nothing more than that they suffered \u201cexposure\u201d to asbestos fibers during the course of their employment. The opinion does not speak of any physical changes allegedly induced by the exposure, and holds only that \u201cmere exposure to asbestos\u201d without \u201cmanifestation of injury\u201d would not be recognized to support a cause of action. <em>Schweitzer, supra, </em>758 F.2d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>Burns, </em>in applying the <em>Schweitzer </em>rationale, also focused on claims primarily grounded in exposure. They differed in degree from those considered in <em>Schweitzer </em>only in that, as the court stated, all the plaintiffs \u201chave asbestos fibers in their lungs which are causing changes in the lung tissue.\u201d <em>Burns, supra, </em>752 P.2d at 30. While the line dividing actual pleural thickening from lung tissue which is merely undergoing the process of change is a fine one, we conclude that the <em>Schweitzer </em>and <em>Burns </em>decisions signify a determination by those courts that the pathological impact of exposure had not progressed to the point of a \u201cmanifestation of injury\u201d which is clearly present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Whether plaintiff\u2019s pleural thickening constitutes an injury and, if so, the damages to be awarded, is therefore remanded to the Law Division for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Plaintiff also argues that the trial court should have submitted to the jury his claim for \u201cpossible\u201d future consequences of his asbestos-related pleural condition. New Jersey\u2019s long-standing rule is that \u201cprospective damages are not recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>erable unless they are reasonably probable to occur.\u201d <em>Mauro, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 561 A. 2d 257. \u201cMoreover, there is no recovery allowed for the mere possible consequences of an injury inflicted by a tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Lesniak v. County of Bergen, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>12, 20, 563 A.2d 795 (1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Plaintiff makes the further point that the trial court should not have instructed the jury that in order for him to recover for emotional distress it must be shown that he is suffering from \u201cserious\u201d fear. The instruction given by the court accords with our holdings in <em>Mauro, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 211, 542 A.2d 16 and <em>Devlin v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 563, 495 A.2d 495 (Law Div.1985). See also <em>Advisory Com\u2019n v. Diamond Shamrock, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 174-175, 578 A.2d 1248 (App.Div.1990), where we stated that plaintiffs anxieties were not compensable in the absence of \u201cserious mental illness\u201d or emotional distress which is \u201csevere and substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Plaintiffs argument that the trial court erred in precluding the testimony of his medical expert witness is lacking in merit. Plaintiff failed to inform defendants that he planned to call Dr. Tobe as a witness until the eve of trial, notwithstanding that he had the doctor\u2019s report in his hands for more than three years. The failure to furnish timely the names of expert witnesses to be called at trial or their reports may, in the sound discretion of the trial court, result in the exclusion of their testimony. <em>Westphal v. Guarino, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 145, 394 A.2d 377 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>308, 394 A.2d 354 (1978); <em>Brown v. Mortimer, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 401, 242 A.2d 36 (App.Div.1968); <em>see also R. </em>4:17-4(e); <em>R. </em>4:17-7; <em>R. </em>4:23-5(b). Nevertheless, although the court\u2019s ruling was faultless under the circumstances presented, in view of our determination to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>remand the matter for retrial as to plaintiffs present physical injury, we also direct that the retrial include plaintiffs claim for emotional distress and that in connection therewith Dr. Tobe be permitted to testify. The trial court is authorized to make whatever provision it may deem necessary to allow defendants to meet Dr. Tobe\u2019s anticipated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Plaintiff challenges the jury instructions as to punitive damages on the claim that they wrongly informed the jury that \u201can act involving an actual intent to harm another is required before awarding punitive damages.\u201d We have examined the impugned language of the charge and conclude that it does not support plaintiffs interpretation. Although the court spoke of \u201can intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an evil-minded act or an act accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of the rights of another,\u201d we find no implication therein, as defendants claim, that the jury must find as a requisite to the award of punitive damages an \u201cactual intent to harm another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On their cross-appeal defendants argue that the court erroneously prevented them from introducing certain answers to interrogatories from settling codefendants. The purpose of the offer was to enable the jury to allocate liability among all the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.3e states: \u201cAny party who is compelled to pay more than his <em>percentage </em>share may seek contribution from the other joint tortfeasors.\u201d (emphasis added). Under this statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">[E]ach tortfeasor is liable for the same <em>percentage </em>of the judgment as the <em>percentage of negligence </em>found attributable to him. A natural corollary to this is that when a claimant settles with a codefendant, that <em>percentage of negligence </em>found attributable to the settling codefendant will be deducted from the verdict against the other codefendants found liable, <em>i.e., </em>the remaining joint tortfeasors will be liable for that <em>percentage of negligence </em>attributable to them____ [O]nly the <em>percentage amount </em>equal to the <em>percentage of negligence </em>attributable to the settling defendant is deducted, no matter what the size of the settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Rogers v. Spady, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 277-278, 371 A.2d 285 (App.Div.1977) (emphasis added); <em>see also Tefft v. Tefft, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 570, 471 A.2d 790 (App.Div.1983); <em>Dimogerondakis v. Dimogerondakis, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 521-522, 485 A.2d 338 (Law Div.1984). Therefore, a nonsettling tortfeasor must \u201cprove the negligence of the settling codefendant in order to minimize the percentage of negligence for which the jury may find him responsible.\u201d <em>Dimogerondakis, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 522, 485 A.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Here, the trial judge correctly determined that the answers to interrogatories could not be relied upon for purposes of allocating liability because they furnished no basis from which an allocation of <em>percentages </em>could be made. As the court said, they fail to show \u201cwhat part of the time plaintiff was exposed to which products____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages resulting from the present state of his physical injury and emotional distress and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm on the cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We leave for another day the question of whether plaintiff will be permitted to seek further damages in the future should symptoms develop or in the event that he experiences a more serious illness as the result of his exposure to asbestos. <em>See Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 584, 525 A.2d 287 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
