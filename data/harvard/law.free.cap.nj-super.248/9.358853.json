S.A. </em>40:145-13, under which plaintiff was appointed, and replaced it with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:63-6b(3) which cross-references <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-139, providing for one-year appointments only.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">On this appeal plaintiffs argue, as they did below, that since the original written appointment was for four years, the statutory repeal could not affect it and the trial judge erred in concluding that his termination was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">The trial judge issued a seventeen page opinion in which he dealt in detail with each of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, reviewed the applicable law and concluded that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 services [as township attorney] had been validly terminated.\u201d We have reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the entire matter and affirm essentially for the reasons given by Judge Eugene D. Serpentelli, A.J.S.C., in that opinion, dated February 9, 1990. 248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 589 A.2d 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We add only that the decision in <em>Pillsbury v. Board of Freeholders of Monmouth Cty., </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 356 A.2d 424 (App.Div.1976) is deemed to be inapposite and <em>Taylor v. Hoboken Bd. of Education, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 455 A.2d 552 (App.Div.1983) <em>certif. denied </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>228, 470 A.2d 441 (1983) is controlling. To the extent that the <em>Pillsbury </em>rationale may be inconsistent with the result reached in <em>Taylor, </em>we regard the latter to be controlling in the sense that it holds that Supreme Court disciplinary rules generally are applicable even to attorneys holding public office in that capacity. However, we have no need to discuss here which might govern if there is any tension between a Legislative provision and a disciplinary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
