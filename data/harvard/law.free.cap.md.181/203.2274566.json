The appellant had claimed $1,425, or a rental of $15 per day for ninety-five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">On June 5, 1941, appellant leased an Excello boring machine at $15 per day, reserving the right to cancel the lease on twenty-four hours\u2019 notice. Appellee, having possession of the machine, used it twenty-four hours daily until July 1, 1941, when it wrote appellant that it considered $15 per day as high and offered $110 per month. This sum appellant refused, calling attention to the fact that the machine had been used under a specific rental charge and notified appellant of the termination of the lease. But appellee failed to return the machine, retained possession and continued to use it twenty-four hours per day up to and including September 8,1941. Appellant elected not to treat this as a conversion but as a continuation of the original agreement and brought this suit. The court allowed $15 per day for twenty-five days and $4 per day for seventy days. Appellee has not appealed. The question is whether the trial court was in error in allowing only $4 per day for seventy days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>thus reducing the claim to a <em>quantum meruit. </em>In this holding we think the trial court was in error, since in our opinion a bailee, the bailment having ended, who continues to hold and use the goods does so under the original agreement. In other words, he is in a position comparable to that of a tenant holding over after the expiration of the term. <em>Benje v. Creagh\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 21 </em>Ala. 151, 155; <em>Edgar v.

Ed.), Sec. 91D; 6 <em>Williston, Contracts </em>(Rev. Ed.), Sec. 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The origin of this well settled rule seems to have been in the reluctance of courts to construe as a tort what could be justified as a contract, and its existence is fully justified as not allowing a bailee to take advantage of his own wrong. As suggested in appellant\u2019s brief, our theory of legal morality does not permit a bailee to demand that what may be given a lawful effect must be held tortuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It becomes unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s exceptions which were taken to the admission in evidence of a lease which expired before suit was brought, as showing the reasonable value of the machine. In our judgment they are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment de novo in favor of appellant, the Fast Bearing Company, for the sum of $1,U25, with interest from date, and costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
