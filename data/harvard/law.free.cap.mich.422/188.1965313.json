In <em>State Bar of Michigan v </em>Galloway,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals answered affirmatively. In <em>Michigan Hospital Ass\u2019n v Michigan Employment Security Comm,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a different Court of Appeals panel reached the opposite conclusion. We granted leave to appeal in both cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the <em>Galloway </em>panel\u2019s interpretation of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the decision in <em>Gallo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>way, and reverse the decision in <em>Michigan Hospital Ass\u2019n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As passed in 1936, the Michigan Employment Security Act allowed claimants to be represented in mesc proceedings by \"counsel or other duly authorized agent[s].\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Any individual claiming benefits in any proceeding before the commission or a court may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent; but no such counsel or agents shall either charge or receive for such services more than an amount approved by the commission. [1936 (Ex Sess) PA 1, \u00a7 31, MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">A very similar provision for employers was added by 1968 PA 338. The last paragraph of MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">Any employer may be represented in any proceeding before the commission <em>by counsel or other duly authorized agent. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The first and most important issue in this case is whether the Legislature intended the phrase \"other duly authorized agent\u201d to include nonlawyers. If so, then this expression of legislative intent must be reconciled with the statutory prohibition against unauthorized practice of law by individuals<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and corporations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>The Galloway Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Defendant Gates, McDonald &amp; Company is a corporation. It provides unemployment compensation cost-control services to employers. Defendant James Galloway was a Gates employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">As noted above, the mesa has always allowed claimants to be represented before the commission by a \"duly authorized agent.\u201d Several of the amici curiae inform us that they, as labor unions, routinely provide their members with the services of nonlawyer employees who represent those members at mesc referee hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">At least as early as 1963, Gates, McDonald &amp; Company began providing a similar service for its employer clients. The State Bar of Michigan viewed that activity as the unauthorized practice of law and, therefore, commenced an injunctive action in Wayne Circuit Court. The parties ultimately stipulated to the entry of a consent judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from representing employer clients at referee hearings. The case then lay dormant until 1981. In the interim, the Legislature passed 1968 PA 338, which amended MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533 so that it now also allows employers to appear by a \"duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>authorized agent.\u201d Without seeking modification of the Wayne Circuit Court judgment, Gates resumed its former practice of having its nonlawyer employees appear on behalf of employer clients at referee hearings. No resistance surfaced until 1979 when some mesc referees, in reliance on the 1963 injunction, refused to permit Gates personnel to participate in the hearings. That prompted Gates to return to circuit court where it sought dissolution or amendment of the 1963 injunction. The circuit judge ultimately ruled that the statute barring corporate law practice, MCL 450.681; MSA 21.311, still prevented Gates, McDonald &amp; Company from providing this additional service for its clients.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On appeal by Gates, McDonald &amp; Company, the Court of Appeals reversed. It saw in the 1968 amendment to MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533, a clear expression of a legislative intent to allow nonlaw-yers to represent employers at referee hearings. That interpretation forced the Court to resolve a conflict between the amended version of MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533 and the previously cited prohibitions against unauthorized practice of law by individuals and corporations. The Court of Appeals resolved that conflict by considering the statutes <em>in pari materia </em>and concluding that the more recent and more specific statute should be interpreted as an exception to the older and more general statutes. Thus the Court of Appeals concluded that Gates is now authorized to represent its clients at referee hearings. The State Bar of Michigan appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>The Michigan Hospital Association Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The Michigan Hospital Association is a nonprofit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>corporation. It offers a variety of services to its member hospitals. Many of those members are themselves nonprofit corporations or other types of not-for-profit entities. As such, they qualify for special privileges under mesa. First, they may elect to be \"contributing employers\u201d who reimburse the mesc for benefits actually paid instead of paying a periodic assessment based on their past claims histories. MCL 421.13a; MSA 17.513(1). Second, and of more immediate importance in the present case, they may band together with other nonprofit employers and form a group account to share the cost of unemployment benefits. MCL 421.13e; MSA 17.513(5). If they choose to form a group, they are required to \"identify and authorize a representative to act for the group for the purposes of [the mesa].\u201d MCL 421.13e(l); MSA 17.513(5X1). Acting under the mha\u2019s umbrella, its nonprofit members have formed a group and designated the mha as their authorized representative. The mha then provides the same representation services that Gates, McDonald &amp; Company provides to its private clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Like Gates, McDonald &amp; Company, the mha for many years sent its nonlawyer employees to appear as hospital representatives at mesc referee hearings. It followed that practice until 1980 when some mesc referees threatened to exclude the mha\u2019s employees from future hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The mha then filed an injunctive and declaratory judgment action in Wayne Circuit Court. The complaint named the mesc and the Employment Security Board of Review as defendants. The State Bar of Michigan subsequently intervened as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The trial court granted the relief requested by the mha. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and held that MCL 421.31; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>17.533 did not authorize nonlawyer participation in referee hearings. 123 Mich App 667. Unlike the <em>Galloway </em>panel, the Court of Appeals panel in <em>Michigan Hospital Ass\u2019n </em>saw no legislative intent to create an exception to the unauthorized practice statutes and comparable common-law doctrines. They harmonized the statutes by reasoning that a nonlawyer might be a \"duly authorized agent\u201d capable of appearing before the mesc in rule-making proceedings, but that only attorneys were \"duly authorized\u201d to appear at referee hearings or other quasi-judicial proceedings. We granted the mha\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appearances at mesc referee hearings would otherwise constitute the unauthorized practice of law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and be prohibited by MCL 600.916; MSA 27A.916 or MCL 450.681; MSA 21.311, the controlling question in this case is whether the Legislature intended MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533 to stand as an exception to those prohibitions. Looking at the plain language of the statute, we can reach no other conclusion. The employer language, added by 1968 PA 338, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">Any employer may be represented in any proceeding before the commission by counsel or other duly authorized agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">All agree that \"counsel\u201d means an attorney. The additional phrase \"or other duly authorized agent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>would have no meaning if the Legislature did not intend to authorize representation by persons who are not attorneys.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In construing a statute, we will make every effort to give meaning to every part of it and avoid rendering any part nugatory. <em>Melia v Employment Security Comm, </em>346 Mich 544, 562; 78 NW2d 273 (1956). This statute is so plainly written that we have little need to refer to principles of statutory construction. We mention <em>Melia </em>only because both Court of Appeals panels were understandably troubled by our decision in <em>Cobb v Judge of Superior Court of Grand Rapids, </em>43 Mich 289; 5 NW 309 (1880). There the Court dealt with a provision of Michigan\u2019s 1850 Constitution that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">Any suitor in any court of this state shall have the right to prosecute or defend his suit, either in his own proper person, or by an attorney or agent of his choice. [Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The <em>Cobb </em>Court interpreted as synonyms the words \"attorney\u201d and \"agent.\u201d But <em>Cobb </em>has no special precedential value in the present case where, if extended, it would require a distorted reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We hold that the Legislature meant what it plainly said. Notwithstanding the unauthorized-practice statutes, it intended to permit nonattor-neys to appear at mesc referee hearings as the representatives of their employer clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In <em>Michigan Hospital Ass\u2019n v Michigan Employment Security Comm, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the Wayne Circuit Court. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>State Bar of Michigan v Galloway.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Riley, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> The Michigan unemployment compensation act, 1936 (Ex Sess) PA 1, MCL 421.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.501 <em>et seq., </em>created the Michigan Employment Security Commission.
