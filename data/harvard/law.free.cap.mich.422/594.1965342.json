[419 Mich 933 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Since we conclude that plaintiff failed even to meet the threshold requirements of proof to make out a prima facie claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, we are constrained from reaching the issue as to whether this modern tort should be formally adopted into our jurisprudence by the well-settled rule that statements concerning a principle of law not essential to determination of the case are obiter dictum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and lack the force of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>adjudication, <em>McNally v Wayne County Canvassers, </em>316 Mich 551; 25 NW2d 613 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Plaintiffs Delores and Ralph Roberts brought this action, individually and on behalf of their minor daughter, Christine Rodzos, seeking recovery of certain no-fault benefits from their no-fault insurer, defendant Auto-Owners Insurance Company. The claims arose when Christine was struck by a motor vehicle while riding her bicycle, resulting in her hospitalization for several days and her missing of school for a total of three weeks. Auto-Owners paid plaintiffs\u2019 medical and ambulance bills. The instant lawsuit concerns only plaintiffs\u2019 claim for replacement benefits under MCL 500.3107(b); MSA 24.13107(b). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a separate paragraph of the complaint, plaintiffs also claimed damages for \"mental anguish\u201d and \"exemplary or punitive damages\u201d for Auto-Owners\u2019 conduct, alleged to be \"improper and/or outrageous and/or malicious\u201d in the following respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">On or about July 19, 1979, Plaintiff made appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>cation for replacement services benefits; August 28, 1979, forms requested by Defendant were submitted to Defendant on or about September 3, 1979, Defendant stated that Defendant did not have a document for the purpose of presenting replacement services claim; At the time of said September 3, 1979, statement, the Michigan No Fault Insurance Statute including replacement services benefits had been in effect for almost six years; Plaintiffs created and submitted their own document regarding replacement services on or about November 19, 1979, said application apparently being ignored requiring a follow up letter dated December 13, 1979; On or about January 8, 1980, approximately six months after the accident, Defendant submitted letter apparently denying plaintiff\u2019s valid claim; As of date hereof, Defendant has not paid anything at all by way of replacement services benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Before trial, Auto-Owners moved for summary judgment, arguing that mental anguish, exemplary or punitive damages are not available in an action claiming replacement benefits. The motion was denied, as was defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, apparently<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claim for mental anguish, exemplary or punitive damages was based on the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress rather than in contract. Auto-Owners renewed the motion at trial, this time alleging plaintiffs\u2019 failure to properly allege the tort theory in the complaint. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>motion again was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, Auto-Owners unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict, claiming a failure of proof on the same issue. The jury subsequently returned a verdict awarding the plaintiffs a portion of the replacement benefits claimed, as well as $2,500 in mental distress damages. Auto-Owners\u2019 motion for a new trial, contesting the validity of the mental distress damage award, also was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In the Court of Appeals, Auto-Owners relied on this Court\u2019s then-recent pronouncement in <em>Kewin v Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 401; 295 NW2d 50 (1980), contending that mental distress damages are unavailable in what is essentially a breach of contract action. In affirming the judgment of the lower court, the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Kewin </em>by finding sufficient evidence of tortious conduct \u2014 independent of the contract breach \u2014 to justify the award of mental distress damages in this case. <em>Roberts v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>135 Mich App 595; 354 NW2d 271 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">We granted leave to consider the viability of plaintiffs\u2019 tort theory on the facts of this case, and directed the parties to brief the issues set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In <em>Kewin, supra, </em>we held that a disability insurance policy did not involve matters of mental concern and solicitude that would justify an award of mental distress damages for its breach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 409 Mich 416. We further held that exemplary damages are not recoverable for breach of a commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cial contract \"absent allegation and proof of tortious conduct existing independent of the breach.\u201d 409 Mich 420-421; see also <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 263; 362 NW2d 628 (1984). Left open, however, was the question raised in this appeal: whether a separate tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress can be brought on the basis of an insurer\u2019s dilatory conduct in handling an insured\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The tort theory forwarded by plaintiffs has been recognized elsewhere to permit recovery of mental distress damages separate and apart from the recovery of contractual damages for breach of an insurance policy. See, <em>e.g., Eckenrode v Life of America Ins Co, </em>470 F2d 1 (CA 7, 1972); <em>Strader v Union Hall, Inc, </em>486 F Supp 159 (ND Ill, 1980); <em>Amsden v Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co, </em>203 NW2d 252 (Iowa, 1972); <em>Fletcher v Western National Life Ins Co, </em>10 Cal App 3d 376; 89 Cal Rptr 78; 47 ALR3d 286 (1970); see, generally, Holmes, <em>Is there life after Gilmore\u2019s death of contract? </em>\u2014 In<em>ductions from a study of commercial good faith in \u00f1rst-party insurance contracts, </em>65 Cornell L R 330, 356-359 (1980). Indeed, although the instant case apparently marks the first appellate affirmance of a mental distress award in this context, our Court of Appeals has previously acknowledged (at least implicitly) the viability of the intentional infliction theory in insurance suits alleging dilatory handling of claims. See <em>Butt v DAIIE, </em>129 Mich App 211, 218-219; 341 NW2d 474 (1983); <em>Butler v DAIIE, </em>121 Mich App 727, 735-737; 329 NW2d 781 (1982); <em>Holmes v Allstate Ins Co, </em>119 Mich App 710, 713-718; 326 NW2d 616 (1982) (workers\u2019 compensation action); <em>Frishett v State Farm Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Automobile Ins Co, </em>3 Mich App 688; 143 NW2d 612 (1966); see also <em>Bolden v John Hancock Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>422 F Supp 28, 29-31 (ED Mich, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Those courts which have recognized intentional infliction of emotional distress as a separate theory of recovery have generally embraced the Restatement definition of the tort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u00a7 46. Outrageous Conduct Causing Severe Emotional Distress</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">(1) One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm. [Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, p 71.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Four elements are identified in this definition: (1) \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct, (2) intent or recklessness, (3) causation, and (4) \"severe emotional distress.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Ross v Burns, </em>612 F2d 271, 273 (CA 6, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">We find that plaintiffs herein failed to make the minimum showing of proof of either \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct or \"severe emotional distress\u201d required to withstand defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">A. <em>Extreme and Outrageous Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVWt\">An oft-quoted Restatement comment summarizes the prevailing view of what constitutes \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">The cases thus far decided have found liability only where the defendant\u2019s conduct has been extreme and outrageous. It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>duct has been characterized by \"malice\u201d, or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \"Outrageous!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">The liability clearly does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. The rough edges of our society are still in need of a good deal of filing down, and in the meantime plaintiffs must necessarily be expected and required to be hardened to a certain amount of rough language, and to occasional acts that are definitely inconsiderate and unkind. There is no occasion for the law to intervene in every case where some one\u2019s feelings are hurt. There must still be freedom to express an unflattering opinion, and some safety valve must be left through which irascible tempers may blow off relatively harmless steam. [Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, comment d, pp 72-73.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Another Restatement comment further qualifies the conduct proscribed by this tort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">The conduct, although it would otherwise be extreme and outrageous, may be privileged under the circumstances. The actor is never liable, for example, where he has done no more than to insist upon his legal rights in a permissible way, even though he is well aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional distress. [Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, comment g, p 76.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Further, in a contractual setting, a tort action must rest on a breach of duty distinct from con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tract. Thus, in <em>Hart v Ludwig, </em>347 Mich 559; 79 NW2d 895 (1956), we recognized that mere <em>nonfeasance of </em>a contractual obligation cannot give rise to a negligence cause of action in tort:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">The action of tort has for its foundation the negligence of the defendant, and this means more than a mere breach of a promise. Otherwise, the failure to meet a note, or any other promise to pay money, would sustain an action in tort for negligence, and thus the promisor be made liable for all the consequential damages arising from such failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\"><em>As a general rule, there must be some active negligence or misfeasance to support tort. There must be some breach of duty distinct from breach of contract. </em>In the case at bar, the utmost shown against the defendant is that there was unreasonable delay on its part in performing an executory contract. [347 Mich 563 (quoting from <em>Tuttle v Gilbert Mfg Co, </em>145 Mass 169, 174-175; 13 NE 465 [1887]). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Moreover, in <em>Kewin, supra, </em>we declined to recognize a separate cause of action for bad-faith breach of an insurance contract, although some of our sister states have chosen to do so. 409 Mich 423.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The foregoing principles do not preclude recovery for an insurer\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, our continued adherence to these precepts, combined with the observations noted in the Restatement comments, significantly limits the range of circumstances in which a prima facie showing of outrageousness can be made in the insurance context. The mere failure to pay a contractual obligation, without more, will not amount to outrageous conduct for purposes of this tort. See <em>Bolden, supra, </em>422 F Supp 31 (defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion granted where plaintiffs claim \"does not arise out of any conduct by the insurer other than not paying his claim\u201d); <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>123 Mich App 521, 527; 332 NW2d 591 (1983) (pleading insufficient where only intentional breach alleged), <em>aff'd </em>420 Mich 256; 362 NW2d 628 (1984); <em>Van Marter v American Fidelity Fire Ins Co, </em>114 Mich App 171, 185; 318 NW2d 679 (1982). In addition, an insurer\u2019s request for verification of claims, in the absence of evidence of harassment or similarly egregious conduct, falls short of conduct which we would consider \"tortiously outrageous.\u201d See <em>Butt v DAIIE, </em>129 Mich App 211; 341 NW2d 474 (1983); <em>Holmes v Allstate Ins Co, </em>119 Mich App 710; 326 NW2d 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The instant plaintiffs rely on the following facts as establishing Auto-Owners\u2019 \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct: (1) Auto-Owners\u2019 failure to supply plaintiffs with a form for claiming replacement services benefits, even though the statutory no-fault provision relating thereto had been in effect for six years; (2) Auto-Owners\u2019 delay in responding to the claim for replacement services (roughly six months after the accident, and two months after plaintiffs created and submitted their own document claiming replacement benefits); (3) Auto-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Owners\u2019 apparent denial of the replacement benefits claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Recognizing that tortious conduct apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>from breach of the insurance contract is required to make out a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Court of Appeals nevertheless found that plaintiffs had supplied sufficient evidence of \"extreme and outrageous\u201d conduct to justify sending the claim to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">This case involves significantly more than the mere failure to pay benefits. Plaintiffs\u2019 case is based upon allegations of defendant\u2019s intentional attempts to frustrate them from applying for benefits. Plaintiffs allege that defendant was informed of the nature and extent of Christine\u2019s injuries and the costs of the services incurred therefrom but only supplied an application for a small portion of the payable benefits. Defendant claims that six years after the enactment of the no-fault statute it did not have application forms for the benefits plaintiffs requested under the act. This forced plaintiffs to procure counsel to apply for no-fault benefits. Considering the fact that defendant was informed that Christine had a severe facial scar that might necessitate plastic surgery, its conduct in frustrating plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to apply for benefits and define the limits of the policy could properly be considered as extreme and outrageous by a jury. [135 Mich App 598-599.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We disagree with this assessment of the evidence. While Auto-Owners\u2019 conduct is hardly praiseworthy, plaintiffs alleged no more than the failure by Auto-Owners to facilitate the filing of a replacement services claim, a delay of at most six months in responding to the claim as filed, and the denial of benefits owed. Such conduct may properly be considered unreasonable for purposes of assessing the statutory penalty for overdue payments as well as plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Auto-Owners.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the record evidence falls \"far short of the conduct which is considered tortiously outrageous.\u201d <em>Butt, supra, </em>p 219. There is no indication that Auto-Owners set out to harass these plaintiffs, nor does the evidence disclose a course of conduct that may fairly be characterized as \"so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community,\u201d Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, comment d, p 73. At most, the dilatory handling of plaintiffs\u2019 claim constitutes \"bad faith\u201d justifying imposition of the statutory penalties set forth above, but for which this Court has held no separate cause of action can lie. See <em>Kewin, supra, </em>409 Mich 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">B. <em>Severe Emotional Distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"anm-dedup-1\">The Restatement commentary explains the emotional distress requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">The rule stated in this Section applies only where the emotional distress has in fact resulted, and where it is severe. Emotional distress passes under various names, such as mental suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock, or the like. It includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea. <em>It is only where it is extreme that the hability arises. </em>Complete emotional tranquillity is seldom attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people. <em>The law intervenes only where the distress indicted is so severe that no reasonable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>man could be expected to endure it. </em>[Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, comment j, p 77. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Further, although bodily injury need not result, the Restatement commentary suggests that \"more in the way of outrage\u201d may be required where a claim is based on emotional injury alone. <em>Id., </em>comment k, p 78. .</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of severe emotional distress consisted entirely of the following testimony by Ralph and Delores Roberts:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\"><em>Ralph Roberts </em>\u2014 Direct <em>Examination</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\"><em>Q. </em>Have you ever been paid one nickel of this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\"><em>A. </em>Not of the \u2014 on that paper there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\"><em>Q. </em>How does that make you feel?

There was no evidence of grief, depression, disruption of life style, or of treatment for anxiety or depression. The distress proved by plaintiffs was, as a matter of law, insufficient to support this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Judging from the seventy-six pages of annotations that currently accompany \u00a7 46 of the Second Restatement of Torts, it is clear that the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress has gained widespread acceptance, in a variety of factual contexts, in the courts of our sister states. Because we find that plaintiffs\u2019 proofs failed even to make out a prima facie claim for relief under the Restatement definition, our review both of the policy implications for adopting this tort in general and of the propriety of allowing such recovery in the insurance context must await a case in which those concerns are necessarily presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and modify the judgment of the trial court by vacating the award of mental distress damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-8\">Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-11\"> Since we agree with Justice Levin that \"unjustified litigation\u201d is a vice, and that \"[ojnly by deciding specific cases can this Court give meaning to the words 'intentional and outrageous conduct,\u2019 \u201d we decline to yield to the temptation of engaging in a full blown discourse on the relative merits of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress or of a remedy for containing unfounded hypothetical future cases involving insurance practices.

This suggestion of a cause of action for \"intentional and outrageous conduct\u201d is made without boundaries or guidelines for the bench or bar. Nor are the boundaries properly spelled out by references to the Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, the accompanying commentary, or to \"seventy-six pages of annotations that currently accompany \u00a7 46 ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The twenty-two illustrations in the commentary accompanying the blackletter of the Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, are based on the cases that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>then been decided. A review of the illustrations indicates that, for the most part, they are far afield from the present case. Liability was found where there were threats of physical injury to the plaintiff or a relative, ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there were threats of destruction of property or of a relationship with the plaintiff's employer,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> false reports of injury to a relative were knowingly made,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there were threats of or actual false arrest or imprisonment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>public humiliation occurred<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 such as where a woman was provided with a bathing suit that would dissolve in water in the presence of a group of men and women. The only illustration based on abusive behavior of an insurance adjuster supposes that an adjuster enters a hospital room for the purpose of settling an insurance claim and, knowing of the plaintiff\u2019s weakened condition, acts in a boisterous and rude manner causing severe emotional distress and a heart attack.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The author of the commentary accompanying the Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, recognizes that callousness and heartlessness, even if it causes dire consequences and emotional distress, does not alone subject the actor to tort liability for emotional distress. In one of the twenty-two illustrations, a landlord evicts a woman and her children who are destitute and ill. The commentary states that while such conduct is heartless, the landlord has done no more than the law permits him to do.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Insistence upon legal rights in a permissible way, even though the actor is aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional distress, does not subject him to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Surely this Court has not, and cannot properly, adopt either the blackletter or the commentary accompanying \u00a7 46 or the seventy-six pages of annotations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The application of the concepts, expressed in \u00a7 46 and discussed in the accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>commentary, in concrete cases is a matter on which courts disagree. Only by deciding specific cases can this Court give meaning to the words \"intentional and outrageous conduct\u201d and indicate to what extent it agrees with the commentary accompanying \u00a7 46 and the terminology of \u00a7 46 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">One might rationalize that unfair claim-settlement practices can have consequences that to some people are as serious as those that might result from abusive language and threats of physical injury or the other conduct described in the twenty-two illustrations in the commentary accompanying the Restatement. But the argument can also be made that the recognition of a tort in the cases described in the twenty-two illustrations does not justify an extension of whatever principle may have been developed in those circumstances to refusals to pay money, however wilful and unjustified. The law frequently finds it necessary to draw lines lest a principle developed in one context be run into the ground in another.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">Decisions delineating the extent of tort liability are . . . more than exercises in logic. They are pronouncements of social policy which should reflect the often subtle balance of the interests involved.

An independent re-examination of the policy considerations implicated by the creation of such a separate cause of action is called for. <em>[Berger v Weber, </em>411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Mich 1, 23-24; 303 NW2d 424 (1981) (Levin, J., <em>dissenting).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">This Court declared in <em>Kewin v Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 401, 423; 295 NW2d 50 (1980) that, \"absent allegation and proof of tortious conduct independent of the breach,\u201d exemplary damages are not recoverable for breach of a commercial contract. In so declaring, this Court declined to follow a decision of the California Supreme Court \"and to declare the mere bad-faith breach of an insurance indemnity contract an independent and separately actionable tort and to thereby open the door to recovery for mental pain and suffering caused by breach of a commercial contract.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Kewin </em>reserved the question whether a tort action can be maintained for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">It makes little difference to the insured or an insurer whether mental distress damages are allowed as contract or tort damages. Changing the form of action to one labeled in tort does not, in the same factual context, justify a rule of damages different from that stated in <em>Kewin </em>and <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256; 362 NW2d 628 (1984). In <em>Valentine, </em>this Court declared that mental distress damages were not recoverable in an action for breach of an employment contract although the denial of such damages would leave the plaintiff with less than full recovery.

[420 Mich 261.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The key question is under what circumstances\u2014 not under what label \u2014 mental distress damages are collectible.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The opinion of the Court cites four decisions standing for the proposition that the tort theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress has been recognized to permit recovery of mental distress damages separate from the recovery of contractual damages for breach of an insurance policy. Both <em>Eckenrode v Life of America Ins Co, </em>470 F2d 1 (CA 7, 1972), and <em>Strader v Union Hall, Inc, </em>486 F Supp 159 (ND Ill, 1980), are federal cases purporting to apply Illinois law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In light of subsequent Illinois decisions, it is questionable whether they would be so decided today.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Subsequent to <em>Eckenrode </em>and <em>Strader, </em>the Illi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>nois Supreme Court left open the question whether a plaintiff may claim in tort for emotional distress resulting from \"outrageous\u201d activity apart from delay and held that vexatious delay in and of itself will not support an action for the tort of outrage. <em>Robertson v Travelers Ins Co, </em>95 Ill 2d 441; 448 NE2d 866 (1983). Before <em>Robertson, </em>Illinois intermediate appellate courts similarly held that such an action cannot be maintained, relying, in part, on a legislative provision similar to a provision in Michigan law allowing for the recovery of attorney fees as a remedy for an insurer\u2019s unreasonable delay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A United States district court in Illinois has, in light of the legislative provision for taxing costs if an insurer unreasonably delays in settling a claim, read <em>Robertson </em>as precluding a cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from an insurer\u2019s outrageous delay in settling a claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The third case cited in the majority opinion is <em>Amsden v Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co, </em>203 NW2d 252 (Iowa, 1972), where the Iowa Supreme Court \"recognized\u201d the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, but went on to hold that the conduct in the case then before the Court did not even begin to approach \"outrage.\u201d In the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>subsequent Iowa case, the court said there was insufficient evidence of emotional distress.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><em>Fletcher v Western National Life Ins, </em>10 Cal App 3d 376; 89 Cal Rptr 78 (1970), the fourth case cited, does indeed recognize this theory of recovery.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Fletcher </em>has been followed in other jurisdictions where the conduct included verbal assaults or threats of criminal prosecution, and it has been followed as well in other cases where the behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>was far less egregious.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In most of the cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>there has been an actual recovery, the circumstances are close to the facts of the insurance case described in Illustration No. 12 in the commentary accompanying the Restatement. The behavior, in cases where the behavior was found to have been tortious, is readily distinguishable from unfair claim-settlement practices that are not combined with verbal or physical assaults or threats.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The opinion of the Court states that the Court of Appeals has, at least implicitly, acknowledged the viability of the intentional infliction theory in insurance actions alleging dilatory handling of claims. In none of the cited cases, however, did the Court of Appeals affirm a money judgment awarded on that theory for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The courts in a number of states that have adopted the substance of a model act proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> have generally declined to formulate a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>mon-law remedy for unfair claim-settlement practices.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Michigan has enacted that legislation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The underlying premise of the present controversy is that the defendant insurer unreasonably withheld payment of benefits owing to the plaintiffs. The issue presented by this appeal \u2014 unjustified litigation in the insurance context \u2014 is a subset of the larger problem of unjustified commencement of actions and unjustified defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In <em>Friedman v Dozorc, supra </em>\u2014 a countersuit commenced by physicians against lawyers who had previously unsuccessfully brought a malpractice action against them \u2014 this Court was asked to modify the common law to provide an expanded tort remedy by eliminating the special injury requirement in actions for malicious prosecution. In declining to do so, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">Most commentators appear to favor abrogation of the special injury requirement to make the action more available and less difficult to maintain. Their counsel should, however, be evaluated skeptically. The lawyer\u2019s remedy for a grievance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>a lawsuit, and a law student or tort professor may be particularly predisposed by experience and training to see the preferred remedy for a wrongful tort action as another tort action. In seeking a remedy for the excessive litigiousness of our society, we would do well to cast off the limitations of a perspective which ascribes curative power only to lawsuits. [412 Mich 42.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">I remain of the opinion, expressed at the time <em>Friedman v Dozorc </em>was decided,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that it is this Court\u2019s obligation to provide a means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation, a problem that confronts all litigants and potential litigants \u2014plaintiffs and defendants. I question whether an expansion of tort remedies and more litigation is the correct response.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">If the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is the interposition of an unwarranted defense, it might be difficult to confine the scope of the action to a claim by an insured against an insurer. Since the commencement of this action, this Court has adopted a court rule, MCR 2.114(D) and (E),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>providing that an \"appropriate sanction\u201d may be imposed on a party who maintains an action or interposes a defense not based on a belief, \"formed after reasonable inquiry,\u201d \"well grounded in fact,\u201d or for the purpose of \"harass[ment] or to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d If this Court were to hold that a common-law action can be maintained against an insurer for breach of the obligation to refrain from interposing a defense except upon a belief, \"formed after reasonable inquiry,\u201d \"well grounded in fact,\u201d and not for the purpose of \"harass[ment] or to cause delay,\u201d then one would think such an action should also be maintainable against any defendant or plaintiff and his lawyer who breaches that obligation. The obligation of an insurer to an insured is not a higher obligation than that owed by a lawyer to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">If that view is sound, then recognition of an action in tort for unjustified litigation may open the door to countersuits in a large number of cases. Physicians turned back in <em>Friedman v Do-zorc, </em>might be encouraged to assert a claim of unwarranted or unjustified litigation against a plaintiff who has filed a medical malpractice action, and a plaintiff in such an action might be enabled to respond with a like claim against the physician who, it might be alleged, should have acknowledged the wrongdoing rather than have attempted to cover it up. The lawyers representing the parties might also find themselves subjected to suit. Once this becomes fashionable, I expect a deluge of litigation and attendant increase in the cost of insurance long before this Court is likely to respond to the questions that it has left open by its pronouncement today.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">I would favor enlarging the recently adopted court rule to expressly permit the assessment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the amount of all actual pecuniary loss<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> against a person \u2014 plaintiff or defendant \u2014 and his lawyer maintaining unjustified litigation, as suggested in <em>Friedman v Dozorc. </em>The sum recoverable should include all fees and administrative charges incurred because of the litigation, as well as reasonable attorney fees. The judge could also award a prevailing litigant an additional sum for loss of income-producing time or business attributable to the wrongful maintenance of the action if the amount is capable of being calculated with reasonable certainty. The sum recoverable would be determined in a prompt post-trial hearing before the judge who presided during the original action, and the rule should allow for the presentation of evidence, including testimony of witnesses, and appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Having such a determination made by a judge, in this framework, has a number of advantages over allowing a jury to award damages for emotional distress. First, a strategy for evaluating the propriety of litigation which is administered exclusively by judges is more susceptible of consistent application and careful supervision than a strategy which relies on a group of laymen chosen at random often for one day and one trial. Second, the meritorious question whether a defendant is subject to liability to the plaintiff for breach of contract or otherwise and, if so, the amount of the damages, is tried without the opportunities for confusion and prejudice attendant to allowing the trial at the same time of both the meritorious question and the separate question whether the defendant (or, indeed, the plaintiff) acted outrageously in defending (or commencing) the action. Third, limiting recovery to actual pecuniary loss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>and thus not allowing recovery for emotional distress, and relying on a judge to assess damages, combined with the greater control that appellate courts exercise over judge\u2019s findings as compared to a jury\u2019s verdict, should tend to avoid excessive awards which might intimidate good-faith litigants.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Such an enlargement of the court rule, and enforcement of the court rule, would go a long way towards addressing the problem that, in a few states, has been addressed by the recognition and application in the insurance context of the so-called tort of outrage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> The majority states that \"we are <em>constrained </em>from reaching the issue as to whether this <em>modern tort </em>should be formally adopted into our jurisprudence\u201d (emphasis added) and later suggests that although limited, there is a range of circumstances in which a prima facie showing of outrageousness can be made in the insurance context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> The courts of Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, and the District of Columbia have declined to recognize a cause of action in tort for emotional distress when the gravamen of the complaint was the insurer\u2019s delay or refusal to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The Alabama Supreme Court, in <em>Vincent v Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc, </em>373 So 2d 1054 (Ala, 1979), found the evidence insufficient to support the claim of the insureds for intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from the insurer\u2019s initial disallowance of claims under a preexisting condition exclusion and rude treatment of the insureds.

The agent encouraged the bringing of criminal charges against the insured by falsely implying that he had a motive to commit arson, and, knowing that the insured would not appear for an insurance examination during the pendency of criminal charges, the insurer relied on the failure to appear as a pretense for denying liability on the policy.

The Court of Appeals, recognizing that the intentional infliction of emotional distress constitutes a distinct and separate cause of action, concluded that the plaintiff did not allege conduct that might properly be characterized as outrageous and atrocious.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Statements in decisions of the Court of Appeals indicating that it has adopted the definition set forth in Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, providing that a cause of action is made out by proof of \"extreme and outrageous conduct [which] intentionally or recklessly causes severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>emotional distress to another,\u201d do not indicate that such a cause of action could be established on evidence of an insurer\u2019s dilatory handling of a claim. This appears on a comparison of the facts in often cited Court of Appeals cases. In <em>Warren v June\u2019s Mobile Home Village &amp; Sales, Inc, </em>66 Mich App 386; 239 NW2d 380 (1976), the Court of Appeals quoted extensively from both the Restatement of Torts and the accompanying commentary defining the type of situations where liability may result. The Court held that a landlord\u2019s actions in verbally harassing the plaintiff in retaliation for her complaints about electric bills, and his attempts to defeat plaintiffs sale of her mobile home, did not constitute the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court said, in part, that the defendant may have simply been relying on his legal right to refuse a prospective tenant in the trailer park he owned. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, applying Michigan law in <em>Ross v Burns, </em>612 F2d 271 (CA 6, 1980), looked to the standards of \u00a7 46 to determine that a newspaper\u2019s publication of photographs of an undercover police officer in a public place, along with his identity, did not amount to \"extreme and outrageous conduct.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Fry v Ionia Sentinel-Standard, </em>101 Mich App 725; 300 NW2d 687 (1980), the Court held that a newspaper report of the accidental death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband and that a female body v\u00edas found with his, did not constitute \"outrageous\u201d conduct. <em>Cf. Ledsinger v Burmeister, </em>114 Mich App 12; 318 NW2d 558 (1982), where the Court concluded that the plaintiff stated a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress on allegations of racial epithets uttered by a retail merchant while ejecting Ledsinger from his place of business. And in <em>Rosenberg </em>v <em>Rosenberg Bros Special Account, </em>134 Mich App 342; 351 NW2d 563 (1984), the Court concluded that a widow\u2019s complaint that her deceased husband\u2019s brother engaged in a course of extreme and outrageous conduct to inflict severe emotional distress on her for the purpose of forcing her to sell her interest in her deceased husband\u2019s business stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In often cited <em>Frishett v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>3 Mich App 688; 43 NW2d 612 (1966), <em>lv den </em>378 Mich 733 (1966), the plaintiff alleged that agents of an insurance company made false statements, unjustly withheld payment of benefits, and misused private information, and as a result the plaintiff became distressed and suffered emotional upset. The Court of Appeals reversed a summary judgment for the defendant, granted on the basis that Michigan courts do not allow recovery for mental distress unless accompanied by a physical injury, and stated that \"the law of Michigan as set forth in <em>Stewart v Rudner </em>[349 Mich 459; 84 NW2d 816 (1957)] and <em>Carter v General Motors Corp </em>[361 Mich 577; 106 NW2d 105 (I960)] is consistent with the principles enunciated in the Restatement of the Law 1948 Supp, Torts \u00a7 46 . ...\u201d In <em>Stewart v Rudner, </em>this Court affirmed a jury verdict against the defendant doctor for mental distress damages arising out of the breach of a contract to perform a Caesarean section. This Court has said that an exception, allowing the recovery of mental distress damages, to the general limitation on the damages recoverable for breach of contract was made in <em>Stewart </em>because of the \"personal nature\u201d of the contract. <em>Kewin v Massachu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>setts Mutual Life Ins Co, supra, </em>409 Mich 415-416. At the same time this Court in <em>Kewin </em>held that insurance contracts are commercial in nature and do not come within the reach of <em>Stewart. </em>In <em>Carter v General Motors, </em>this Court recognized that mental injury may result from emotional stress although there was no physical effect and permitted recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the circumstances. Neither <em>Stewart </em>nor <em>Carter </em>relied on \u00a7 46 or the concept of \"outrageous conduct,\u201d nor did either case involve the dilatory handling of an insurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Finally, the Court of Appeals said in <em>Holmes v Allstate Ins Co, </em>119 Mich App 710, 714; 326 NW2d 616 (1982):</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\"Although there has been confusion regarding a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as distinguished from damages for mental anguish incident to an independent tort, and the Michigan Supreme Court has not ruled on this issue, the Michigan Court of Appeals has delineated intentional infliction of emotional distress as a separate cause of action which is not necessarily parasitic to another cause of action as an aggravating element of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">On the basis of the standards set forth in the Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 46, the Court agreed with the trial judge that the erroneous termination of plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits when he failed to attend vocational rehabilitation and failure to give permission for treatment of plaintiff\u2019s back did not present evidence of an intent to cause plaintiff severe emotional distress, nor was there any conduct that could be viewed as \"extreme and outrageous.\u201d Defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict was properly granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> \"Section 4.
