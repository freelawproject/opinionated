In both cases, it is asserted that the guilty but mentally ill verdict violates principles of due process of law. We hold the statute to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Defendant Bruce Ramsey was charged with first-degree murder, MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>result of the death of his wife. Ramsey had first choked her, and then stabbed her thirty-two times. At trial, he raised the defense of insanity, claiming he believed that he was exorcising a demon from his wife by stabbing her and that she would return to life once the demon was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In the trial court, defendant moved that the verdict of guilty but mentally ill be held unconstitutional and that the jury not be instructed on that verdict. According to defendant, he opted for a bench trial because his motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Several witnesses, including Ramsey himself, testified in support of his claim of insanity. Defendant was portrayed as the product of a Southern fundamentalist religious family who had strayed from the church by drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, and having an extra-marital affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A few months before the killing, Ramsey visited his mother in Kentucky. She gave him a pamphlet entitled \"Defeated Enemies,\u201d which concerned demons and demon-possessed people. Both Ramsey and a woman by the name of Cross testified that that weekend, Ramsey, while engaged in sexual intercourse with Cross, suffered a psychotic episode; Ramsey thought that Cross was a devil. Ramsey fled the room. When later found by Cross, Ramsey insisted that they return to their room to pray, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Ramsey testified regarding an episode the day before the killing. He found in the clogged choke of his truck a sign from God that he should stay with his wife. He also found messages from God in the lyrics of popular songs.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The day of the killing, Ramsey, after a full day of work, called his mother in Kentucky. He was excited; his mother described him as exuberant over his \"return to God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">As for the killing itself, which was witnessed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Ramsey\u2019s children, who testified at trial, the victim and Ramsey had apparently argued. One of Ramsey\u2019s children testified that the victim came to the child\u2019s room crying. Ramsey entered the room and said, \"Walk.\u201d The victim left the room and locked herself in the bathroom. Ramsey broke down the bathroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Ramsey testified that he had attempted to choke, and then to stab, the demon out of his wife. Ramsey\u2019s son testified that he heard Ramsey say, \"Die demon, die.\u201d When Ramsey realized that the victim was dead and was not returning to life, he placed her body in bed, crawled in next to her, and stabbed himself in the chest. Found in that position by the police (the children had fled to a neighbor\u2019s home), Ramsey was taken to a hospital. There, he made statements to family and friends to the effect that he was \"screwed up\u201d and that his wife \"wasn\u2019t supposed to die.\u201d Hospital psychiatrists diagnosed Ramsey as acutely psychotic upon admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Psychiatrists called by the prosecution and the defense differed over whether Ramsey was mentally ill or insane at the time of the killing. Dr. Emanuel Tanay testified for the defense that Ramsey was acutely psychotic and legally insane at the time of the killing. A lengthy taped interview between Ramsey and Dr. Tanay was played to the court. Dr. Philip Margolis, however, testified for the prosecution that Ramsey was neither mentally ill nor insane at the time of the crime. Dr. Mar-golis stated that Ramsey\u2019s behavior, rationalizing the killing after it had taken place, was consistent with an attempt to escape responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Dr. Irving Edgar, also testifying for the prosecution, initially testified that Ramsey was not psychotic at the time of the killing and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>possible that the demon story was fabricated. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Edgar testified that he was not sure if Ramsey knew right from wrong when he was choking his wife and that Ramsey was probably psychotic following the choking.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The trial court found Ramsey guilty of the crime of second-degree murder, but mentally ill. Following a remand to the trial court for further factual findings, 89 Mich App 468; 280 NW2d 565 (1979), the Court of Appeals affirmed Ramsey\u2019s conviction by way of an unpublished opinion per curiam. This Court granted Ramsey\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 414 Mich 864 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Defendant Gary Boyd was charged with armed robbery, MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797, and assault with intent to commit robbery while armed, MCL 750.89; MSA 28.284, for conduct at the home of his former girlfriend. Boyd, after being admitted to the home of Ruby Hughes, suddenly and witho\u00fct provocation grabbed her around the neck, held a knife to her throat, and demanded money. He led Hughes upstairs and assaulted two other women, robbing one of the other women of a few dollars. Boyd then dropped his knife and fled after stating that he knew that Hughes was going to shoot him in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">At trial, Boyd did not dispute that the events occurred. He presented an insanity defense. He related an extensive psychiatric history, including several hospitalizations, with one hospitalization exceeding eighteen months. Regarding the events of the crime, Boyd testified, \"I don\u2019t know. One minute we was talking and the next minute, before I know it, I had a knife around her side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Boyd presented three witnesses as to his mental state. Dr. Bruce Danto, a psychiatrist, testified that defendant was schizophrenic, psychotic, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>insane at the time of the crime. Boyd\u2019s mother and his sister testified to the effect that Boyd had been exhibiting strange behavior patterns for years and that he was alternately violent and paranoic, a compulsive gambler, and would sometimes see and hear nonexistent things.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Dr. Steven Bank, a psychologist, testified for the prosecution that Boyd was mentally ill, but not insane. He noted that defendant had denied that the crime had occurred when he was arrested. This denial, according to Dr. Bank, indicated a purposeful behavior inconsistent with insanity. He further testified that defendant had described himself as a \"good con-man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty but mentally ill to both charged counts and the Court of Appeals affirmed Boyd\u2019s convictions in an unpublished opinion per curiam. This Court granted Boyd\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 415 Mich 851 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Both Ramsey and Boyd contend that the guilty but mentally ill verdict denied them the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Their arguments, however, are subtly different. Ramsey argues that the danger of jury compromise due to the existence of the guilty but mentally ill verdict caused him to waive his right to a jury trial, and, therefore, he should be allowed to challenge the constitutionality of the verdict. Boyd\u2019s argument is more straightforward. He contends that the submission of the guilty but mentally ill verdict to the jury encouraged the jury to return that verdict as a compromise between the verdict of guilty and the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>will treat the arguments of both defendants jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">A fair trial is a right guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Drope v Missouri, </em>420 US 162; 95 S Ct 896; 43 L Ed 2d 103 (1975). Therefore, our task is to decide if the guilty but mentally ill verdict violates principles of fairness by, according to defendants, deflecting a jury\u2019s attention from the issues of guilt or innocence by adding an irrelevant verdict which brings the risk of impermissible jury compromise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We must stress, however, that we are not concerned with the wisdom of the verdict. Arguments that a statute is unwise or results in bad policy should be addressed to the Legislature. Our concern here is only whether the statute is invalid because it denies criminal defendants a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">MCL 768.36(1); MSA 28.1059(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">If the defendant asserts a defense of insanity in compliance with section 20a [MCL 768.20a; MSA 28.1043(1)], the defendant may be found \"guilty but mentally ill\u201d if, after trial, the trier of fact finds all of the following beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">(a) That the defendant is guilty of an offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>(b) That the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the commission of that offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">(c) That the defendant was not legally insane at the time of the commission of that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">MCL 768.21a; MSA 28.1044(1) defines insanity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">A person is legally insane if, as a result of mental illness . . . that person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Finally, mental illness is defined in MCL 330.1400a; MSA 14.800(400a) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">[A] substantial disorder of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The history of the guilty but mentally ill verdict is well set forth in Smith &amp; Hall, <em>Evaluating Michigan\u2019s guilty but mentally ill verdict: An empirical study, </em>16 U Mich J L Ref 77 (1982). For our purposes here, it suffices to state that the statute was a reaction to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v McQuillan, </em>392 Mich 511; 221 NW2d 569 (1974). Following that decision, a large number of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, whom professionals had determined to be presently sane, were released from institutions, with tragic results. Two of the released persons soon committed violent crimes. See Comment, <em>Guilty but mentally ill: An historical and constitutional analysis, </em>53 U Det J Urban L 471, 471-472 (1976); Robey, <em>Guilty but mentally ill, </em>6 Bull of Am Ass\u2019n of Psychiatry 374-375. Amid public outcry, the Legislature responded with the guilty but mentally ill verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The major purpose in creating the guilty but mentally ill verdict is obvious. It was to limit the number of persons who, in the eyes of the Legislature, were <em>improperly </em>being relieved of all criminal responsibility by way of the insanity verdict. As stated in the House analysis of the bill creating the verdict, one argument in favor of the verdict was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The new verdict will help a jury. Perhaps because there seems to be a tendency for people to assume that someone who commits a particularly offensive crime \"must be insane,\u201d juries frequently find defendants in such cases \"not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d Sometimes, however, the defendants are not legally insane, and although it may well have been the intent of the jury that such defendants be committed for a long period, they must be automatically released under a Michigan Supreme Court ruling of September, 1974. [Third Analysis of HB 4363, Michigan House Legislative Analysis Section (July 15, 1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">There is nothing impermissible about such a purpose. It is well within the power of the Legislature to attempt to cure what it sees to be a misuse of the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What we must decide, however, is whether the verdict acts to deny defendants a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>It is claimed that the guilty but mentally ill verdict introduces a confusing irrelevancy into jury deliberations. Therefore, the first question we must face is whether the inclusion of the guilty but mentally ill verdict is so confusing to the jury that it denies a defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">To a certain extent, we must agree that the inclusion of the verdict complicates a trial and creates a greater opportunity for confusion. Under prior law, the jury had only to decide whether the defendant was sane. Under present law, the jury must engage in a two-step inquiry. But the fact that an extra step is added to the inquiry hardly makes the inquiry beyond a jury\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Furthermore, we reject the claim that a jury is unable to comprehend the distinctions made by the Legislature between the concepts of mental illness and insanity. Our statutory scheme recognizes a continuum of mental functioning. A person is mentally ill if suffering from \"a substantial disorder of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life.\u201d MCL 330.1400a; MSA 14.800(400a). A person is insane, however, only if that substantial impairment results in the lack of \"substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d MCL 768.21a; MSA 28.1044(1). Under these definitions, one must be mentally ill before he can be found insane, but the converse is not true. As stated by Justice Cav-anagh in <em>People v Fultz, </em>111 Mich App 587, 590; 314 NW2d 702 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">Insanity by definition is an extreme of mental illness. When a person\u2019s mental illness reaches that extreme, the law provides that criminal re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sponsibility does not attach. To put it alternatively, the statutes provide that all insane people are mentally ill but not all mentally ill people are insane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Also, MCL 768.36(1); MSA 28.1059(1) requires the jury to find that the defendant is not insane, that is, that the defendant does not lack the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or the ability to conform his conduct to the law, before it can conclude that the defendant is guilty but mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We conclude that the Legislature has created a clear distinction between mental illness and insanity. Of course, in particular cases, this distinction may be very subtle and difficult for the jury to apply. But, it is no more subtle or difficult than the distinction between the intent to do great bodily harm and the intent to kill, a distinction we allow juries to make which often determines whether a defendant is guilty of first- or second-degree murder. In short, we cannot say that the legislative distinctions between mental illness and insanity deny the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Both Ramsey and Boyd also contend that the inclusion of the guilty but mentally ill verdict infringed on their right to a fair trial by creating an unjustifiable risk of a compromise verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find this claim to be wholly speculative, and must reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">All members of a criminal jury must agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt to the same verdict. That is not to say that individual jurors cannot change their initial view of a case and ultimately reach a common ground with the others. Provided that in the end all jurors agree beyond a reasonable doubt as to the verdict, there is absolutely no prohibition of a juror changing positions during deliberations. Juror deliberations, however, must be distinguished from juror compromise. When jurors give up their beliefs to settle on a common ground with other jurors, who may have also abandoned their convictions in the interest of agreement, a compromise verdict results. When jurors forsake their convictions simply to reach a verdict, the defendant has not been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by all members of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In <em>People v Stahl, </em>234 Mich 569; 208 NW 685 (1926), <em>People v Gessinger, </em>238 Mich 625; 214 NW 184 (1927), and <em>People v Vail, </em>393 Mich 460; 227 NW2d 535 (1975), we recognized that jurors, as people generally, often will compromise with regard to their differences. In those cases, we recognized a fact, consistent with human nature. In each of those cases, however, the issue was not whether the jury had, in fact, compromised. Instead, the issue was whether allowing a greater charge not supported by the evidence to go to the jury constituted error requiring reversal of the defendants\u2019 convictions, even though the defendant in each case was convicted of the lesser charge. And, it was not only the possibility of impermissible compromises which led this Court to conclude that reversal was required, but also the possibility that all jurors could be equally swayed by the inclusion in their deliberations of a greater, but legally improper, charge. The point of those cases, however, is not that the possibility of jury compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>mise requires a conviction to be reversed. That possibility is present in every case. To the contrary, our decisions were based on the reality that compromise does occur, and, therefore, the boundaries within which it occurs must be legally and factually supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The problem raised in <em>Stahl, Gessinger, </em>and <em>Vail </em>is not present in the present case. Jurors had not begun their discussions considering charges of which the defendants could not have been convicted as a matter of law. Exactly how the jurors in <em>Boyd </em>reached their decision, or how the typical jury would act in the case of <em>Ramsey, </em>is entirely a matter of speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Parties who are concerned that the jury has compromised are free to poll that jury pursuant to MCR 2.512(B)(2). See also <em>People v Pizzino, </em>313 Mich 97; 20 NW2d 824 (1945). Since there is no other error identified in the present cases which, in light of the possibility of compromise, could have prejudiced defendants, we must reject their claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Illinois v DeWit, </em>123 Ill App 723; 463 NE2d 742 (1984), which also rejected the argument that the possibility of a compromise violates due process. To hold otherwise would require us to presume a jury compromise in every case where more than one verdict or charge is submitted to the jury.____</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Ramsey raises two additional issues regarding the guilty but mentally ill verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, he argues that as a matter of policy this Court should hold that a mentally ill defendant cannot entertain the malice necessary to support a murder conviction. Alternatively, he argues that we should find that a trial court must, in its findings of fact following a bench trial, affirmatively state that the mental illness did not negate the necessary intent for second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Malice aforethought, or stated otherwise, the mental state necessary for the crime of murder, requires the intent to kill, the intent to do great bodily harm, and the intentional creation of a great risk of death or great bodily harm with the knowledge that death is the probable result. <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980). A finding of mental illness, even when defined as a substantial disorder of thought or mood, does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the defendant did not entertain the requisite malice aforethought for murder. As explained in LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 42, p 326:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">A defendant in a criminal case, at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>engaged in the conduct giving rise to the charges against him, may have been suffering from an abnormal mental condition which was not of a kind or character to afford him a successful insanity defense under the right-wrong test or other standard applicable in that jurisdiction. But, while this defendant is therefore ineligible for a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, his mental abnormality may nonetheless be a most relevant consideration in the determination of whether he is guilty of the crime charged. Under the doctrine referred to as partial responsibility, diminished responsibility, or (somewhat less accurately) partial insanity, evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition is admissible on the question of whether the defendant had the mental state which is an element of the offense with which he is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Thus, while his mental illness may be a consideration in evaluating the requisite state of mind for the crime charged, we decline to accept Ramsey\u2019s invitation to hold that a finding of mental illness negates malice aforethought as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The trial court in this case found that <em>Ramsey </em>entertained the malice aforethought necessary to support a conviction of second-degree murder. Defendant would have us require that the trial judge affirmatively state that the mental illness did not affect the defendant\u2019s ability to form the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Had the trial judge indicated a refusal to consider the defendant\u2019s mental illness as a diminishing factor in his decision of whether defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>possessed the requisite malice aforethought, we would find it necessary to address the question of the extent to which mental illness could diminish the intent requirement for second-degree murder. But he did not. We therefore are faced with a statement by the judge that defendant possessed the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We are disinclined, under the circumstances of this case, to place a further burden on the fact-finding of a judge in a bench trial which would require, in addition to a finding of guilt on the elements of the crime, an affirmative statement that all potential mitigating factors have been considered and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Boyd raises one matter which requires additional consideration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He claims that error which requires reversal occurred when the trial court, over objection, instructed the jury on the disposition of a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity and on the disposition of a defendant found guilty but mentally ill. The Court of Appeals rejected Boyd\u2019s claim on the strength of authorities now questionable in light of our recent decision in <em>People v Goad, </em>421 Mich 20; 364 NW2d 584 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In <em>Goad, </em>we held that it was error to instruct the jury as to the disposition of a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity. However, we expressly stated that our holding was prospective, which makes it inapplicable to <em>Boyd. </em>As to the propriety of giving instructions on the disposition of a defendant found guilty but mentally ill (CJI 7:8:01), <em>Goad, supra, </em>p 37, strongly intimated that such instructions are also improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We hold that in all jury instructions given more than 30 days after the filing of this opinion, the jurors shall not be given any information including, but not limited to, CJI 7:8:07 and 7:8:08 requiring the disposition of the defendant after their verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We would now similarly hold that jurors should not be instructed on the disposition of a defendant found guilty but mentally ill. Although error occurred in the instant case, it does not require reversal, for the reasons stated in <em>Goad.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b666-5\">Williams, C.J., and Ryan, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> Amicus curiae Michigan Psychiatric Society, branch of American Psychiatric Society, also contends that the guilty but mentally ill verdict is unconstitutional because it creates an irrational distinction. The society contends that, in psychiatric terms, the definitions of mental illness and insanity are identical. We note that claim was contradicted by the testimony of psychologist Dr. Steven Bank in <em>Boyd, </em>who found Boyd mentally ill but not insane. In any event, it is not the custom of this Court to decide constitutional issues raised by amici, but not the parties, and we express no opinion on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> Ramsey also contends that we must review this case to determine if the Legislature used the least intrusive means to accomplish its purpose, citing <em>Dunn v Blumstein, </em>405 US 330; 92 S Ct 995; 31 L Ed 2d 274 (1972), an equal protection case. We do not find that standard applicable to the due process challenge made here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\"> A study by the Center for Forensic Psychiatry in September of 1974 indicated that of some 350 persons found not guilty by reason of insanity only twenty percent of them suffered from mental illness sufficient to exculpate their actions. Thirty percent of those persons were found to have no mental illness whatsoever. The remaining fifty percent were viewed as having some psychosis or neurosis, but with no evident relationship between their mental state and their crime. Robey, <em>supra. </em>Of course, a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity determines a defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime, not afterwards. Still, in view of these statistics and the number of persons released after McQuillan, and unless treatment of the mentally ill has progressed far beyond the level of which we are aware, one can hardly conclude that the Legislature was irrational in finding the insanity verdict to have been misused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\"><em> </em>Ramsey and Boyd also find a verdict which does not distinguish a separate degree of criminal responsibility to be \"so extraordinary that no direct analogy exists.\u201d We note that novelty does not equal unconstitutionality. Furthermore, since sanity is only presumed in a normal prosecution, and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in this state when evidence of insanity is raised, see <em>People v Savoie, </em>419 Mich 118; 349 NW2d 139 (1984), there is a direct analogy, the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.

Prior to the adoption of the guilty but mentally ill verdict, 0.024 percent of adult males arrested were found not guilty by reason of insanity. In 1982, 0.032 percent of adult males arrested were found not guilty by reason of insanity. Smith &amp; Hall, <em>supra, </em>p 101. These statistics, while not only hopeful, can be interpreted to mean that the guilty but mentally ill verdict, having not decreased insanity verdicts, has been ineffectual and, perhaps, irrelevant. One could also interpret these statistics to mean that the guilty but mentally ill verdict has been very effective in avoiding improper insanity verdicts, as evidenced by the almost insignificant rise in the percentage of such verdicts.

We find neither argument persuasive. First, he claims that the prosecution introduced insufficient evidence of his sanity. The prosecution responds with a request that the case relied on by defendant, <em>People v Murphy, </em>416 Mich 453; 331 NW2d 152 (1982), should be overruled. We decline to now consider that request. Expert witnesses testified for both the prosecution and the defense.

This procedure permitted the court to <em>require </em>the jurors \u2014 if they returned a general verdict \u2014 also to answer special questions concerning specific issues of fact.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In Michigan, the Legislature, in 1871, enacted that in cases involving the trial of factual issues \"the court shall, at the request in writing of the counsel of either party, instruct the jury, if they return a general verdict, also to find upon particular questions of fact to be stated in writing, and may direct a written finding thereon,\u201d and that \"when a special finding of fact shall be inconsistent with a general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Accordingly, under this procedure, a general verdict was set aside if the court determined that it was inconsistent with the jury\u2019s answers to special questions. It is apparent that the object of this procedure was to prevent the jurors from misapplying the law to the facts they had found.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This Court said that the purpose of requiring the jury to answer special questions was \"to test the correctness of their general verdict,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \"to enable the court to know what view the jury take of the material issues, and to correct their possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>wrong inferences from the facts which they find to exist,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and to \"enabl[e] the court to know whether in finding generally they have properly considered the necessary elements of the finding.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Shortly after the 1871 enactment, this Court held that this statutory procedure, authorizing the submission of special questions to supplement and control a general verdict, did not apply in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">In <em>People v Marion, </em>29 Mich 31 (1874), this Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction of uttering a forged instrument. The defendant assigned error on the basis of the trial court\u2019s refusal to direct the jury to find specially on certain issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The Court said that the statute permitting requests for special findings did not apply in criminal cases, observing that \"it is one of the most essential features of the right of trial by jury at common law, that no jury should be compelled to find any but a general verdict in criminal cases, and the removal of this safeguard would violate its design and destroy its spirit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 40. The Court, citing Justice Cooley\u2019s treatise on Constitutional Limitations,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> said that \"very serious questions\u201d \"could not fail to be suggested\u201d were the statute construed to apply in criminal cases, <em>id., </em>p 41.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The predicate of the \"very serious questions\u201d is the constitutional right of an accused to a trial by jury. The incidents of that right include a jury empowered \u2014 after instruction in the law by the court \u2014 to apply the law to the facts as found by the jury and to answer generally, without explication, the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. To call upon the jury to return answers to special questions in addition to, and in explication of, a general verdict would be contrary to an incident of a jury trial in a criminal case. Reluctant jurors might be \"catechized\u201d by \"a progression of questions each of which seems to require an answer unfavorable to the defendant\u201d; answering special questions may have a \"subtle, and perhaps open, direct effect\u201d \"upon the jury\u2019s ultimate conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The statute providing for the guilty but mentally ill verdict so impairs the right to a trial by jury. The statute, by requiring that the judge instruct the jury on that verdict, calls upon the jury to provide a special finding in explication of a general verdict of guilty.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">It might be argued that because the jurors retain the option of returning a general verdict of guilty or not guilty, they are not <em>required </em>by the inclusion of the special finding of mental illness within the alternative verdict of guilty but men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tally ill \u2014 as they would be if required to answer special questions \u2014 to provide a special finding.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">To be sure, the jury is instructed on the general verdicts of guilty and not guilty. Jurors, sworn to render a verdict in accordance with the instructions of the court,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> are not, however, informed that, even if they should find that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the alleged commission of the offense, they need not so specially find and may instead, consistent with their oaths, return a general verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">To preserve the right to a general verdict, it would be necessary to instruct the jurors that even if they find facts justifying a special finding that the defendant was mentally ill, but not legally insane, at the time of the alleged commission of the offense, they nevertheless may return a general verdict. To avoid confusing the jurors, it would also be necessary to instruct them on <em>why </em>they have the option, if they find the defendant was mentally ill, of returning either a verdict of guilty or a verdict of guilty but mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Such instructions are not in fact given;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> rather, the jurors are instructed that it is their \"duty to accept the law\u201d as stated by the court.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Jurors instructed on the verdict of guilty but mentally ill, and on the findings required to justify that ver-diet,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><footnotemark>37</footnotemark> will understand that if they find that the defendant was mentally ill, their duty to \"accept the law\u201d obliges them to return a verdict, in accordance with their findings, of guilty but mentally ill. They will not understand that it is lawful, although mental illness is found, to return a general verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The manner in which juries are instructed thus unconstitutionally impinges on the right to a general verdict by in effect requiring, where the jury finds all the elements of the offense and mental illness, that it make a special finding of mental illness in partial explication of its general verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The people argue that the purpose of enacting the guilty but mentally ill verdict was \"to require judges, juries, and counsel to focus on the critical issue in any insanity case, criminal responsibility, as well as on the frequently distracting issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>mental illness\u201d and \"to eliminate or substantially reduce <em>inappropriate </em>insanity verdicts by compelling all participants ... to focus on the distinct issues in each case with the hope that the fact-finding process would have less confusion and would be more likely to produce an accurate factual result.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">While the issue of sanity may often be particularly difficult,' juries are confronted with other difficult issues in which the need for factual accuracy is no less important to the ultimate decision on the issue of criminal responsibility. Were the need for care in fact-finding sufficient to justify a departure from the general rule that it is impermissible to call upon the jury for special findings, the exception for the issue of sanity might soon expand to include many, perhaps all, elements necessary to establish criminal responsibility, and the general verdict, without explication, might be virtually eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The people and the accused might be better served by a system in which the jury were required to provide special findings either in lieu of or in addition to a general verdict. We start, however, with the adoption in this state\u2019s constitution<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> of the accused\u2019s right to a trial by jury, which at common law referred to a jury that ordinarily returned a general verdict without explication. Until this Court decides that the constitution allows a judge to call upon a jury to explain its verdict, the Legislature cannot alter the role of the jury in a manner so inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>constitutional right to a jury trial in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">A finding of mental illness in the guilty but mentally ill verdict is not determinative of the issue of criminal responsibility. A person who is mentally ill may or may not, under the statute, be insane. A finding that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offense is not therefore inconsistent with either a guilty or not guilty verdict. Accordingly, a special finding of mental illness accompanying a general verdict does not assure that the jury has not misapplied the law to the facts. In a civil case, a court would be justified in refusing to submit to the jury a special question that had so little bearing on the general verdict.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">A finding that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offense is not a factual finding, but rather a legal conclusion. To ensure greater care in fact-finding on the issue of legal insanity, the jury should be asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">1) whether the defendant at the time of the offense had a substantial disorder of</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">a) thought, or</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">b) mood;</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">2) if the answer to either la or lb is \"yes,\u201d whether such substantial disorder(s) significantly impaired</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">a) judgment, or</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">b) behavior, or_</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>c) capacity to recognize reality, or</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">d) ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life;</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">3) if the answers to one or more of 2a, 2b, 2c or 2d are \"yes,\u201d whether such significant impairment(s) resulted in the lack of substantial capacity either</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">a) to appreciate the wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct, or</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">b) to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Some courts have said that the use of special questions in criminal cases, while disfavored, is not erroneous per se.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The circumstances in which those statements have been made do not, however, provide authority justifying the guilty but mentally ill verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">All would agree that the jurors may, indeed must, be called upon to specify the offense of which they find the defendant guilty. Where there are degrees or lesser included offenses of the charged offense, or the charged offense can be committed by alternative conduct, the accused is in effect faced with multiple charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">When a jury finds that a defendant so charged is guilty of, say, petty larceny rather than grand larceny, it is necessary for it to distinguish in the guilty verdict whether the defendant committed one offense or another. One may characterize a verdict of guilty of petty larceny as a verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>guilty of larceny with a special finding of the amount involved in the larceny, but the verdict nevertheless is a general verdict of guilty of the lesser offense of petty larceny. When a jury returns a verdict of guilty of larceny under $100, it is not rendering a special finding explicating a general verdict, but only a general verdict of one of the lesser offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Similarly, it is necessary \u2014 to avoid convicting a person of first-degree murder unless all twelve jurors concur that he either premeditated and deliberated or that the murder occurred in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a particular felony \u2014 to divide the offense, for purposes of the verdict, into two offenses, so that the verdict makes clear that all twelve have found the defendant guilty of premeditated and deliberated murder or all twelve have found him guilty of murder in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a particular felony.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The decisions in other jurisdictions stating that special findings are not erroneous per se are principally of that kind.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>A finding that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offense is not, however, determinative of either the fact or degree of criminal responsibility. The finding does not convict, exculpate, or reduce the degree of an offense from \u2014 taking the example suggested by Ramsey and discussed in the opinion of the Court<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u2014second-degree murder to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In some jurisdictions, the role of the jury has been expanded to include consideration of the appropriate punishment of a convicted felon. In those jurisdictions, the jury may be called upon to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>provide findings concerning facts that must be established to support imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In Michigan, however, the jury has no role in the determination of penalty or sentencing. It appears, moreover, that the finding of mental illness in the guilty but mentally ill verdict is not supposed to affect sentencing. If a defendant is found guilty but mentally ill, \"the court shall impose any sentence which could be imposed pursuant to law upon a defendant who is convicted of the same offense.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The not guilty by reason of insanity verdict\u2014 like the guilty but mentally ill verdict \u2014 calls upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the jury to provide a special finding explicating a general verdict. It appears, however, that the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict is an historical anomaly that has been accepted \u2014 in Michigan<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and in other jurisdictions<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> \u2014 as a singular historic exception to the general rule that a jury may not be called upon for a special finding explicating a general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Such a discrete and singular exception does not precedentially support unraveling the otherwise clear and undoubted rule that in a criminal case the jury renders a general verdict without explication.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The special finding of mental illness does not serve the same purpose as the special finding of insanity. The purpose of the special finding of mental illness is to assure greater care in fact-finding \"to eliminate or substantially reduce <em>inappropriate </em>insanity verdicts . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) That special finding thus seeks to justify and explain the general verdict of guilty. The special finding of insanity, however, developed not to assure greater care in fact-finding or in explication of the general verdict, but rather as a means of identifying guilty defendants whom the jury considered warranted pardons from the king, and later as a means of identifying acquitted defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dants considered sufficiently dangerous to themselves and others that they should be confined until no longer dangerous.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The immediate disposition of the defendant after trial is a direct consequence of the special finding of insanity at the time of the commission of the offense, and thus that special finding may be seen as analogous to other special findings that affect sentencing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In contrast, the special finding of mental illness in the guilty but mentally ill verdict does not, under the statute, affect either the finding of criminal responsibility or the sentence that may be imposed on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Nor does the special finding of mental illness determine whether the defendant receives mental health care and treatment.

The presumption of innocence, both at common law<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and as a component of due process,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> requires that the people convince the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the charged offense.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The sanity of the defendant at the time that the offense was alleged to have been committed is a necessary element.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Once evidence of insanity is introduced, the jury may not properly return a verdict of guilty unless it finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the. defendant was sane at the time of the commission of the offense. To return a guilty but mentally ill verdict, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the offense and also beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not then insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">As a conceptual matter, the definitions of \u201clegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>insanity\u201d and \"mental illness\u201d are distinguishable. Indeed, it is asserted that the guilty but mentally ill alternative verdict focuses attention on the definition of insanity and leads to more \"accurate\u201d determinations on the issue of criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Under the statute, before a jury may return a guilty but mentally ill verdict it must find <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that the defendant had substantial capacity both to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct <em>and </em>to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, and, also <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the defendant had significant impairment of his judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">It is apparent that the statutory definitions of legal insanity and of mental illness contain terms that overlap. The reasonable doubt standard increases the difficulty and complexity of the distinctions that must be made. Most jurors \u2014 as well as psychiatrists, lawyers, and judges \u2014 might find it difficult to conceive of a substantial disorder of thought or mood that significantly impairs judgment <em>or </em>behavior <em>or </em>capacity to recognize reality <em>or </em>ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life that <em>might </em>not also cause <em>either </em>a lack of substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of conduct <em>or </em>a lack of substantial capacity to conform conduct to the requirements of law.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">It is not, however, a defect of the guilty but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>mentally ill verdict that it requires a difficult decision from the jury on the issue of insanity. The infirmity is rather that the verdict encourages the jurors to focus their deliberations on a question (whether the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the alleged commission of the offense) that is not determinative of the central issue of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">At one time the law did not distinguish between those who intended the harm caused by their conduct and those who did not. The concept of <em>mens rea, </em>culpability, represented an important advance in modifying the harshness of strict liability for harmful conduct, intended or not. Still later those who intended the conduct but who could not distinguish between right and wrong were exculpated as criminally insane, but nevertheless detained until pardoned or released by the king.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It is now firmly established in the law that a person cannot be convicted of an offense on evidence that he intended to commit the act causing the harm where, because he was criminally insane, he did not have the requisite felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The not guilty by reason of insanity verdict is a mechanism of that progression, but not an essential element of it. The Legislature could address the seemingly intractable problem of the conflict between the competing goals of bringing to justice those whose conduct causes harm and yet exculpating those whose conduct, however harmful, is not culpable, by eliminating the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict altogether and establishing other means of initially confining those who commit assaultive offenses who are found not guilty and who are thought to have been acquitted because they interposed an insanity defense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>who may be dangerous to themselves or society.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Such means are already in place for persons who are so dangerous who have not been charged with committing a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">If it is thought that, because of jury confusion, erroneous not guilty by reason of insanity verdicts were or are being returned, that verdict can be abolished, and the jury simply instructed to convict an offender who was only mentally ill and to acquit where the accused is found to have been insane. Problems experienced with the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict do not justify either erosion of the general verdict of guilty or not guilty or changing the focus of the jury\u2019s deliberations from simply whether (i) the deed was done, (ii) the accused did it and (iii) he had the requisite felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Special focus in the deliberations of the jury or form of verdict on whether the defendant was mentally ill is no more justified than would be special focus on any other element or finding alone insufficient to decide the outcome. \"Guilty because the defendant was armed,\u201d \"guilty because not an accident,\u201d \"guilty because it was not self-defense,\u201d might be general verdicts with special findings along with guilty but mentally ill when \u2014 in addition to an insanity defense \u2014 the evidence tends to show that the defendant might not have been armed, and a defense of accident or self-defense is also interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Similarly, \"guilty <em>but\u201d </em>the defendant (i) is only an aider and abettor and not the planner, or (ii) only drove the getaway car, or (iii) did not carry a gun, or (iv) did not fire a gun, are of the same feather as guilty but mentally ill. It would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>determinative in a prosecution for, say, armed robbery whether the defendant carried or fired a gun or merely drove the getaway car or was not the planner but only otherwise aided and abetted the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Focusing jury deliberation and the verdict form on \"guilty because\u201d or \"guilty but\u201d an element or finding that alone is not determinative unconstitutionally denigrates the importance of all the other elements the jury is required to consider at the same time. It is a tilt that impairs the presumption of innocence, which requires the people to prove and the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element comprising the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In sum, the guilty but mentally ill verdict unconstitutionally impinges on the presumption of innocence by focusing the jury\u2019s attention on a finding that does not alone support a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The guilty but mentally ill verdict introduces a risk that the jury will be misled as to the meaning of that verdict and will in effect decide the issue of criminal responsibility on the basis of speculation or impermissible compromise, thereby depriving the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">The g\u00fcilty but mentally ill verdict is misleading in at least two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">First, designating \"guilty but mentally ill\u201d as one of four possible verdicts unjustifiably elevates the perceived importance of the finding that the defendant was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offense. To repeat, that finding is of no direct consequence in the disposition of the defendant after trial. To categorize the finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>mental illness as the same <em>kind </em>of decision \u2014 that is, one with some distinct, identifiable consequence \u2014as a verdict of guilty or not guilty is to mislead the jurors on the significance of their finding and thus on the meaning of their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Second, the label of the verdict, \"guilty <em>but </em>mentally ill,\u201d is itself misleading. Many jurors will assume erroneously that the verdict reflects a finding of diminished culpability and criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The guilty but mentally ill verdict may be especially misleading because, in spite of the rule\u2014 today reaffirmed by the Court \u2014 that the jurors should confine their deliberations to the issue of guilt or innocence and should not consider the potential disposition of the defendant after their verdict, the jury may focus on perceived differences in the disposition of the defendant under the various verdict alternatives.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> It is likely that jurors, and indeed some judges in bench trials, will consider the possibility that their verdict may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>influence whether or when a defendant \u2014 who has asserted publicly a previous mental illness resulting in a lack of substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of otherwise criminal behavior or to control that behavior \u2014 will be released back into society. Jurors, without instruction by the court, may speculate \u2014 correctly\u2014that a defendant found guilty but mentally ill may receive a prison sentence; they may also, however, speculate \u2014 erroneously \u2014 that they can ensure psychiatric care and treatment for the defendant by finding him guilty but mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The guilty but mentally ill verdict introduces a risk that the trier of fact will reach the decision on criminal responsibility as a result of impermissible compromise. In particular, there is a risk that the trier of fact will, in lieu of reaching a considered and deliberated decision on whether the defendant was legally insane under the statutory definition, \"settle\u201d on a perceived intermediate verdict that appears to designate the defendant as criminally responsible and yet <em>deserving </em>of psychiatric care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">It is immaterial whether this compromise might occur <em>between </em>members of the jury during their joint deliberations, or merely <em>within </em>the reflective deliberations of a single juror. The presumption of innocence is overcome only if <em>all </em>jurors agree that every element of the charged offense has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. If one or more jurors who are not persuaded of the defendant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt agree to the guilty but mentally ill verdict as a compromise, the defendant has not received the full protection of the presumption of innocence and of any reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In rejecting the argument that the guilty but mentally ill verdict creates an unjustifiable risk of compromise, the opinion of the Court observes that the prior decisions of this Court<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> ordering new trials because of an impermissible risk of compromise \"were based on the reality that compromise does occur, and, therefore, the boundaries within which it occurs must be legally and factually supportable.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In the prior cases, the impermissible risk of compromise occurred where convictions on lesser offenses were obtained after jurors were instructed on greater charges that, as a matter of law, were not established factually. To use the language of the Court, the \"boundaries\u201d of compromise were not \"legally and factually supportable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Nor is a verdict of guilty but mentally ill legally and factually supportable. The finding of mental illness at the time of the commission of the offense has no identifiable effect, in law or in fact, on issues of criminal responsibility, sentencing, or psychiatric care and treatment. It is no better and no different than would be encouraging jury compromise by providing the jurors with an alternative verdict of guilty <em>but </em>the defendant (i) is an aider and abettor and not the planner or (ii) only drove the getaway car or (iii) did not carry a gun or (iv) did not fire a gun. Those \"but\u201d verdicts, like the \"but mentally ill\u201d verdict, would have no identifiable effect, in law or in fact, on criminal responsibility, sentencing, or psychiatric care and treatment. A verdict that has no such identifiable effect introduces an unjustifiable risk that the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>of fact will reach the decision on criminal responsibility as a result of impermissible compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Recognizing that unidentifiable compromise does occur, it is as unsupportable and prejudicial to a defendant to require jurors to focus specially on the nondeterminative finding of mental illness and consider the verdict \"guilty but mentally ill\u201d as it is to permit them to deliberate on a finding and verdict that is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Boyd was found guilty but mentally ill by a jury.

Ramsey apparently then placed his wife\u2019s body in their bed and crawled in next to her body, where he fell asleep. He testified that he was awakened when state police officers knocked on his door and identified themselves, that at that point he realized that his wife was in fact dead, and that he stabbed himself in the chest and got back into bed with his wife\u2019s body so that, if he died, he could \"go with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Ramsey was arrested and transported to a hospital.

Because under this construction there is in effect no minimum term of probation for defendants found guilty but mentally ill, and because the conditions and period of probation depend in part on reports of the defendant\u2019s mental state <em>at the time of sentencing or periodic review, </em>it appears that the special finding by the jury that the defendant was mentally ill <em>at the time of the commission of the alleged offense </em>does not affect a sentence of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b685-5\"> The only discussion on this question we have been able to find, in Michigan or indeed in any jurisdiction, is a brief dictum in <em>Underwood v People, </em>32 Mich 1 (1875). The defendant, charged with murder, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and, pursuant to 1873 PA 168, committed to the state prison insane hospital. The act provided that when a defense of insanity was asserted in cases involving charges of murder, assault with intent to commit murder, or arson, \"it shall be the duty of the jury ... to find specially whether such defendant was, or was not insane when the alleged crime was committed . . . .\u201d The act further provided for the conditions necessary for release from the state prison insane hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendant asserted on appeal that his imprisonment was illegal because the release provisions constituted a denial of liberty without due process of law. This Court agreed and ordered the defendant discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Addressing the defendant\u2019s alternative assertion that the act imper-missibly authorized a special finding in a criminal case, the Court \u2014 in an opinion by Justice Campbeia, who also wrote the opinion of the Court in <em>People v Marion, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\"The right of trial by jury is secured by constitutional provisions, and it would not be competent to make any substantial changes in its character. As suggested in <em>People v Marion, </em>29 Mich. R., 31, one of its substantial elements is the right of the jury to give a general verdict on the merits. . . . [WJhile it is not competent to prevent an acquittal on a reasonable doubt of insanity, which would require a general verdict of not guilty, yet if the jury agree that the prisoner was insane, and that he would have been guilty if not so, they are undoubtedly at liberty, though they cannot be compelled, to find that fact specially. We cannot hold a special verdict or finding unauthorized, as the common law furnishes abundant precedents to the contrary. \u2014 1 Hale P.C.

While the authors of the study acknowledged that a representative sample might not have been obtained, it is noteworthy that, in Michigan, two mental health care administrators and one forensic psychologist \u2014 persons involved in the provision of treatment \u2014 confirmed that the post-conviction evaluation and availability of resources, and not the guilty but mentally ill label, are the factors considered in the decision to provide treatment. Two prosecuting attorneys and two judges, however, said that guilty but mentally ill offenders, because of a statutory right to treatment or at least a post-conviction evaluation, are more likely to receive treatment than guilty offenders with mental health problems. <em>Id., </em>pp 2-251 to 2-252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> It appears that, at most, the guilty but mentally ill designation may be a \"flag\u201d to officials at the Department of Corrections that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>provide a convicted person a better chance of seeing a psychiatrist during initial screening.
