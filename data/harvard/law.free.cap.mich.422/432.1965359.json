Both opinions in <em>Kestenbaum </em>employed the balancing test articulated, in dictum,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352, 372-373; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976), which stated that the \"public interest\u201d in disclosure is to be weighed against the \"individual\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d <em>Kestenbaum </em>is not, however, binding under the doctrine of stare decisis because this Court was there evenly divided,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and did not constitute an adoption of a balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In <em>Tobin v Civil Service Comm, </em>416 Mich 661; 331 NW2d 184 (1982), a \"reverse foia\u201d case in which a third person attempted to prevent disclosure, the parties agreed that the information requested was within the privacy exemption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">This Court thus has not decided whether, in determining if an invasion of privacy is \"clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>unwarranted,\u201d a court should measure only the nature and extent of the asserted invasion of privacy or should balance the benefits of disclosure against the intrusion on privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Our conclusion that providing the information requested in the instant case would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy under either approach makes it unnecessary to decide whether a court should balance the interest in disclosure against the individual right to privacy or consider only the nature and extent of the potential invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Attorney General contends that disclosure is required only where it would serve the foia\u2019s \"core\u201d purpose of revealing the inner workings of the government. This argument is based on the following declaration of public policy at the outset of the foia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">It is the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">While the federal Freedom of Information Act does not contain such a declaration of policy, the inclusion of the policy section does <em>not </em>mean that the Legislature intended for use of the foia to be limited to its core purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The foia does not require that all requests further the core purpose, or even that all requests affecting the rights of third persons further the core purpose. The act presumes records are dis-closeable and provides that a person has a right to public records \"except as otherwise <em>expressly </em>provided by [the exceptions section].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The exceptions section does not expressly permit withholding merely because a request would not further the core purpose. To the contrary, except as narrowly restricted in the exception sections themselves, the foia permits persons to obtain information per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>taming to trade secrets,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the location of archeological sites,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> product testing data<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and academic transcripts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This information would be much more useful and likely to be used in purely private pursuits than in scrutinizing governmental activity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and disclosure of such information \u2014 especially information concerning trade secrets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>academic transcripts \u2014 could implicate the rights of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The Legislature decided on a broad policy of disclosure not limited to special circumstances. By declining to confine use of the foia to its core purpose, the Legislature seems to have decided that society would be better off if the government shares valuable information. As has been said, one aim of a freedom of information act is \"to facilitate the exploitation of positive externalities created by the government\u2019s acquisition of valuable information.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Restricting the use of the foia to its core purpose would also put a premium on the ingenuity with which a requester can characterize his interest as furthering the core purpose of the act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Virtually any information held by the government could, conceivably, be used to scrutinize a governmental activity. Here, for instance, upgwa could have requested the information not only to recruit members, but also to determine whether the State Police record of security guards is sufficiently accurate and up-to-date to ensure that dangerous or otherwise unfit persons are not allowed to become, or remain, security guards capable of carrying weapons and detaining citizens. When so characterized, the request furthers the core purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Thus while the policy statement underscores the core purpose, it cannot properly be read as words of limitation, requiring that all information requests further the core purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In Part III, we discuss the \"public interest\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>disclosure, an issue that needs to be considered only in connection with a balancing test. In Part IV, we focus only on the nature and extent of the invasion of privacy. As previously indicated, whether a balancing test is employed, or whether only the privacy interest is considered, we reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Assuming a balancing test is to be applied, it must still be determined whether a court should consider only the classic public interest, or whether a court should also consider the benefits that disclosure would bestow on the requester and other directly interested parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the foia \u2014 which does not expressly mandate a balancing test<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u2014 does not clearly answer this question, the act does provide that copying costs, which generally are imposed, may be waived if a particular request \"can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The foia apparently contemplates requests that would not benefit the general public. This, plus the factors considered above in Part II, suggests that the benefits accruing to the requester and other directly interested parties should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In addition, if courts consider only the classic public interest, the balancing test would account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>for the cost imposed on one directly affected party (an addressee\u2019s loss of privacy), but would ignore the benefits that might be obtained by that directly interested party (an addressee might welcome an upgwa solicitation) and the benefits sought by the other directly interested party (the requester). This would not only tilt the balance against disclosure \u2014 an inappropriate result considering the statutory policy in favor of disclosure and the provision that only a <em>\"clearly </em>unwarranted\u201d privacy invasion justifies withholding information<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 but it also would elevate the \"interests\u201d of a largely disinterested public above those of directly interested requesters and addressees who might desire contact. We should not assume irrefutably that the difficult-to-quantify<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> benefits accruing to a large number of persons \u2014 dubbed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>classic public interest<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014 are more significant than more readily quantifiable benefits accruing to directly interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The benefits to both directly interested groups and the general public should be considered.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> There are, therefore, four interests to be considered<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 the interests of the requester, the general public, the \"benefited addressees\u201d (addressees whose benefit from the contact exceeds their privacy loss), and the \"harmed addressees\u201d (addres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sees whose privacy loss exceeds their benefit from contact).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The requester, upgwa, has a strong proprietary interest since the information would be useful and is difficult otherwise to obtain.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, as the Court of Appeals noted, \"this is presumably one reason why [upgwa] is willing to bear the risk and expense of litigating the issues now before this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The classic \"public interest\u201d is very limited in this case. The union did not assert that the request would further the foia\u2019s core purpose. The general public purpose claimed is the encouragement of collective bargaining, but this is not compelling. Collective bargaining is governed by its own body of law. If the information requested were neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>sary to actuate the public benefits of collective bargaining, one would expect that labor law would provide a means for its acquisition. Upgwa\u2019s claimed public benefit has not been deemed, as a matter of labor law, sufficiently important to require employers to divulge the requested information;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the claimed public benefit should not loom larger for the foia.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Although labor law does not provide a means for the acquisition of the requested information, it does not follow that the information cannot be obtained pursuant to the foia. In <em>Excelsior Underwear, Inc, </em>156 NLRB 1236; 61 LRRM 1217 (1966), the National Labor Relations Board recognized that a union might attempt to secure names and addresses by means other than the acquisition of an <em>'Excelsior </em>list\u201d of employees eligible to vote in a representation election.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Excelsior </em>merely validated one means of acquiring names and addresses \u2014it did not make that means exclusive or bar other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In <em>Washington Post Co v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>223 US App DC 139, 145; 690 F2d 252 (1982), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in concluding that \"information that is privileged against discovery can nonetheless be obtained under foia,\u201d reasoned that \"the issues in discovery proceedings and the issues in the context of an foia action are quite different\u201d and that therefore an \"independent inquiry\u201d was required to evaluate the privacy issues.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In the instant case, issues not involved in <em>Excelsior </em>are significant. Because <em>Excelsior </em>involved a private employer, and not the government, the board was not called upon to consider the effect of a freedom of information act. The board might have promulgated a different rule if Congress had enacted a \"private\u201d equivalent to the Freedom of Information Act requiring private parties to disclose information.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Also, an <em>Excelsior </em>list is available only after the direction or approval of an election,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and is designed, at least in part, to reduce the number of post-election challenges by enabling the union to learn the employer\u2019s position on voter eligibility before the election.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In the instant case, the list requested does not purport to be a list of eligible voters, but is rather a list of security guards who may or may not be eligible to vote in a union election. Because the employer is not taking a position on voter eligibility, the list requested has less legal significance than an <em>Excelsior </em>list.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Finally, because the list requested is in the possession of the state, the employer has no bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>den of preparation, as it would if an <em>Excelsior </em>list were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Certain addressees who would like to unionize might be unaware of upgwa, and would be pleasantly surprised by the receipt of an upgwa solicitation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Although no evidence has been presented on this aspect of the matter,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the number of \"benefited addressees\u201d should not be underestimated. Solicitors like upgwa would not go to the trouble and expense of an foia request and a mailing unless they expected to profit from the endeavor. They can profit only if addressees respond favorably, and addressees are not likely to respond favorably unless they believe they would be benefited. Therefore, upgwa, which knows more about its affairs than we do, must believe that a good number of addressees will believe they would benefit from the contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Solicitation could result in an invasion of an addressee\u2019s privacy interest. The \"short, though regular, journey from the mail box to the trash can,\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> is not a major burden, but some addressees might suffer a greater loss. Although one would expect upgwa to treat potential members well in order to induce cooperation, some addressees might fear harassment by the union, and, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>use restrictions were employed effectively, some addressees might still fear that their addresses could become \"public\u201d and such addressees could therefore suffer a loss of peace of mind.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> A few addressees might even find the mere thought of unionization repulsive and offensive, akin to pornography.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">There is little evidence concerning the actual effects upgwa\u2019s solicitations might have on addressee privacy.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The state\u2019s promise of confidentiality<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and the express exemption barring the disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sure of the addresses of police officers<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>suggest that the information is \"information of a personal nature\u201d the disclosure of which \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d Nevertheless, because privacy is so subjective a concept \u2014 virtually anything can be embarrassing in the appropriate circumstance<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u2014 we regard as significant the absence of evidence establishing or even tending to show that the requested information is personal in nature. We are not willing to \"deem\u201d these addresses personal in nature as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">While we realize that foia is often used as a shortcut to obtain information, and that the compilation of empirical data might therefore defeat a requester\u2019s objective, and that, in cases in which the requested information is truly embarrassing, the state might find it difficult to secure witnesses who would openly testify about, and thereby reveal their relation to, the embarrassing information, we nonetheless conclude that the state has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the requested information is so personal and private<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>that the address lists should not be disclosed.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Upgwa claims it is entitled to recover reasonable, actual attorney fees, costs, and disbursements, and is not limited to an attorney fee taxed as costs pursuant to \u00a7 2441(l)(b) of the Revised Judicature Act.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The foia provides concerning attorney fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">(4) If a person asserting the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record or a portion thereof preve\u00e1is in an action commenced pursuant to this section, the court shall award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements. If the person prevails in part, the court may in its discretion award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements or an appropriate portion thereof. The award shall be assessed against the public body liable for damages under subsection (5).[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The act clearly provides that reasonable fees and other expenses must<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> be awarded to a requester who prevails completely. Arguably, upgwa did not prevail completely since its use of the disclosed information has been restricted.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> While upgwa\u2019s victory may not be total, it is still a very substantial one, and upgwa has obtained everything it initially sought. Accordingly, upgwa may recover reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements that have been incurred or will be incurred on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We remand to the circuit court for a determination of the amount, and reasonableness, of upgwa\u2019s claimed attorney fees, costs, and disbursements.</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-8\">Boyle, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b601-9\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">In my judgment, the provisions of \u00a7 13 of the Michigan Freedom of Information Act do not justify the refusal to disclose the information requested by plaintiff in this case because revelation of the requested information would not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of . . . privacy\u201d of the security guards involved. I write separately to say so because I am unable to subscribe to some of what my brother Levin has written.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">My views concerning the general purpose of the state foia, the intent of its drafters, the meaning of the principal operative language of the public policy section,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the privacy exemption provisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are all set forth in my opinion in <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State University, </em>414 Mich 510; 327 NW2d 783 (1982). There is no need to reiterate them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">It suffices to say that the only reasonably debatable point upon which the resolution of this litigation ought to turn is whether disclosure by the state police of the names and home addresses of the security guards in this case, and the identity of their employers, if an invasion of privacy at all, is one \"clearly unwarranted\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 13 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">My colleagues seem to be divided over the question whether courts should engage in a balancing of interests as a means of determining whether, in a given case, particularly this one, the public benefit to be derived from disclosure of requested information so outweighs the privacy interest involved as to warrant the conclusion that the privacy invasion was <em>not </em>clearly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">It seems plain to me that deciding whether an asserted invasion of privacy is warranted, unwarranted, or clearly unwarranted involves identification and application of a standard, a criterion, to provide an answer to the question, \"Compared to what?\u201d That is the \"balancing\u201d I referred to in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Kestenbaum </em>that has been forced upon the judiciary by a purposefully imprecise legislation for resolution of those cases in which a plain and serious invasion of privacy will result from disclosure of the requested information. Since the foia says nothing about conditioning the disclosure of requested information upon the purpose for which the requester wants it, or the manner in which he promises to use it, the assumption ought to be made that the information might be used for any purpose, even criminal misuse; but surely such a possibility cannot be a basis for nondisclosure under a statute whose policy is one of disclosure. As was indicated in both opinions in <em>Kestenbaum, </em>supra, whether the disclosure of requested information is a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy\u201d does not depend upon the possible worthwhile use to which the information may be put or the damage that can conceivably be done by its misuse. The inquiry is whether disclosure <em>itself </em>would amount to a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. In a close and difficult case, that will require, as an analytical aid to determining whether the invasion of privacy that may attend its disclosure is clearly unwarranted, a judicial determination (a balancing) whether there is a significant public purpose likely to be served by disclosure of the information. It is not every case, however, in which an appropriately self-restrained judiciary needs to make value choices in the name of \"balancing.\u201d In some cases, the information sought is simply not \"[information of a personal nature\u201d \u2014 a condition precedent to application of the \"invasion of . . . privacy\u201d exemption of \u00a7 13(l)(a) of the act. In my judgment, that was the situation in the case of the names and addresses of the 44,000 Michigan State University students in <em>Kestenbaum. </em>In such cases, no balancing of inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ests is required. But even if reasonable minds might differ concerning the question whether names and addresses of security guards and the identity of their employers is \"information of a personal nature,\u201d in construing the application of the state foia there is a presumption in favor of disclosure. The foia is an expression of a legislative policy of disclosure. If revelation of the information is merely an invasion of privacy, disclosure is required. If revelation is arguably an unwarranted invasion of privacy, disclosure is still required. It is only when the privacy invasion is clearly unwarranted that the exception provision of \u00a7 13 is an obstacle to revelation. The day may come when this Court will be presented with a claimed invasion of privacy of that dimension, but this is not it.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">I confess to great difficulty in identifying any basis for the conclusion, in this day and age, that one\u2019s name, address, and the identity of his employer is \"information of a personal nature,\u201d within the meaning of the exemption from disclosure provisions of \u00a7 13 of the foia or that public disclosure of such information is, per se, a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, whether considered in the abstract or as compared to an assert-edly countervailing public purpose. See <em>Kesten-baum, </em>opinion of Ryan, J., n 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">I concur in part V of my brother Levin\u2019s opinion concerning attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-8\">Boyle, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b604-9\">Riley, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">I believe that the release by the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>State Police of lists containing the names and home addresses of persons employed by private security guard agencies to a union for collective bargaining purposes constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of the employees\u2019 privacy and therefore such lists are exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 13(l)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act, 1976 PA 442, as amended, MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1801(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The foia provides for public access to public records kept by governmental bodies provided that the requested information does not fall within any enumerated exemption set forth in the act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The legislative intent of the foia is articulated in MCL 15.231(2); MSA 4.1801(1X2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">(2) It is the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information <em>regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. </em>The people shall be informed <em>so that they may fully participate in the democratic process. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Thus the foia provides public access to valuable information regarding the affairs of government, and at the same time, it subjects the activities of government to public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\"Public body\u201d and \"public record\u201d are defined in \u00a7\u00a7 2(b) and 2(c) of the act. MCL 15.232(b), 15.232(c); MSA 4.1801(2)(b), 4.1801(2)(c). The parties here agree that the defendant department is a \"public body.\u201d The parties also agree that the requested information is contained in a \"public record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">The parties hereto agree that the thrust of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>foia is a policy of disclosure and, therefore, the public body bears the burden of justifying refusal of a disclosure request. The parties agree, also, that the issue before this Court today is solely whether the department properly exempted the requested records from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 13(l)(a) of the act which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">(a) Information of a personal nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy. [MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In analyzing requests for release of records which are claimed to fall within the privacy exemptions of the state and federal acts, many courts have followed the approach articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976), <em>i.e., </em>that the public interest must be weighed against the invasion of privacy. In <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, supra, </em>372, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Congress sought to construct an exemption that would require a balancing of the individual\u2019s right of privacy against the preservation of the basic purpose of the Freedom of Information Act \"to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">As Justice Levin recognizes, it has not been clear, however, exactly what is the public interest that is to be balanced against the invasion of privacy. I conclude that the extent to which disclosure would effectuate the purpose of the foia, as expressed in \u00a7 1(2), is a factor properly considered in evaluating the public interest in disclosure. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>is not to say that disclosure must benefit the public as a whole, but it does require that release of the information be, in the language of the policy section, \"consistent with this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">It is significant to note that there is an important difference between the Michigan foia and the federal act, 5 USC 552. The federal act, unlike our act, contains no statement of public policy. In addition, a survey of the federal cases indicates that their decisions have gone far beyond the initial standard first enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I agree with Justice Levin that \"[t]he foia does not require that all requests further the core purpose\u201d as expressed in the policy section because that would, in effect, be creating a separate exemption not intended by the Legislature. However, I believe this section cannot be ignored. The foia\u2019s policy section must be used in defining the public interest side when determining whether a request for information gives rise to a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. The more the release of the information would further the core purpose of the act, the more the scale will tip in favor of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">It is for these reasons that I decline to follow the federal lead, or that of Justices Levin and Ryan today,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and adopt a broad conception of any unrelated public purpose as opposed to a purpose consistent with the Michigan Legislature\u2019s declaration of intent in \u00a7 1(2) of the Michigan foia.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">In evaluating the privacy interests involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the case at bar, it is instructive to note that the Private Security Guard Act of 1968, MCL 338.1051 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.185(1) <em>et seq., </em>prescribes, in part, certain powers and duties of the department with regard to private security guards and private security guard agencies. The purpose of the act is to license and regulate the security guard industry in order to protect the general public from any unauthorized and unethical procedures by individuals engaged in private security guard operations. The act also provides the department with the authority to promulgate rules and regulations. One such rule requires security guard agencies to file quarterly reports containing the names and addresses of personnel with the department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">A complete employee personnel list shall be filed with the department by each licensee on a quarterly basis. <em>This list shall be kept con\u00f1dential except for oficial use. </em>[1979 AC, R 28.4003. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">These quarterly reports (which include names and home addresses of each licensee\u2019s employees) are used by the department to verify that the individuals who are employed with private security guard agencies are in compliance with the employment qualifications specified in the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The department licenses only the agencies, not their individual employees. However, the act does require that individual employees meet certain minimum qualifications and requires that the employer submit a set of fingerprints of each employee to the department so that it may determine whether the qualifications have been met. MCL 338.1067, 338.1068; MSA 18.185(17), 18.185(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Turning next to the public interest asserted, the quarterly reports in the instant case were requested by the upgwa for the purpose of furthering union activity. The request with regard to one agency was to disseminate information concerning organization of a union. The purpose with regard to the other two agencies was to facilitate the enactment of collective bargaining agreements. As Justice Levin notes, the general public purpose asserted \u2014 the encouragement of collective bargaining \u2014 is not compelling. Further, in assessing the extent to which disclosure would further the core purpose of the act as expressed in \u00a7 1(2), no claim is made that release of the requested information would either serve to increase public awareness and understanding of the actions and operations of public agencies, officials, or employees, or that it would facilitate participation in the democratic process.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">I conclude that in balancing the privacy interest at stake with the public interest in disclosure (which includes the \"core purpose\u201d factor), it is clear that the privacy interest does outweigh the public interest, thus mandating denial of disclosure of the requested records. While release of names and home addresses in some instances <em>may </em>not be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, I am persuaded that it is in this case. Here the requested information is from an involuntary submitter under a requirement that also provides that the information be kept confidential. Moreover, this request intrudes upon and may adversely affect the confidentiality needs usually associated with private security personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>I also believe that whether or not the records in question are otherwise obtainable does not affect the disclosability issue. Nothing in the act suggests that records that are available elsewhere are to be treated any differently than records not available elsewhere. Further, as noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Mullin v Detroit Police Dep't, </em>133 Mich App 46, 54; 348 NW2d 708 (1984), the \" 'available elsewhere\u2019 inquiry [has been] used both to support and to deny disclosure . . . .\u201d Hence, I am persuaded that this factor is irrelevant to the determination of disclosability.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Finally, I conclude that it is a distortion of the language of the foia and the legislative intent declared therein to argue that the controlling factor, in weighing whether an invasion of privacy is warranted, is the particular public purpose claimed by those requesting the information contained in the public records. To be sure, my colleagues cite several cases to support the conclusion they have reached today, but in almost every instance they rely on federal cases which speak to the federal act which contains no express statement of public policy. I decline, however, to read the policy section out of the Michigan act. I consider this act in its entirety as it was written. Thus, I am persuaded that we are not bound by the balancing of interests test espoused by either Justices Levin or Ryan (i.e., the public purposes of those seeking disclosure versus the extent of the invasion of privacy). I agree with former Chief Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion in <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State University, </em>414 Mich 510; 327 NW2d 783 (1982), holding that the particular purpose for which the information is requested is not the controlling focus of analysis when scrutinizing the public benefits of disclosure. The determination should also include whether the release is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>consistent with the legislative intent as expressed in the policy section of the act. I am persuaded that an approach which takes into account the extent to which disclosure would further the public purpose of the act is the most workable approach and, further, is most consistent with the intent of the act. I believe that the department properly exempted the requested records from disclosure. Thus, I would reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-5\">Williams, C.J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1801(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\"> The privacy exemption provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">\"(1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">\"(a) Information of a personal nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Upgwa asserted that the request was in the public interest because it would \"facilitate the dissemination to . . . employees of information concerning the union,\u201d and facilitate enforcement of existing collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\"><em>Int\u2019l Union, United Plant Guard Workers of America v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>118 Mich App 292; 324 NW2d 611 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> Because the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976), ordered that the requested information be disclosed, the privacy exemption was not operative.

The reasons for this belief are not compelling, and apply with little force in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">While the foia exempts from disclosure \u201c[rjecords or information specifically described and exempted from disclosure by <em>statute\u201d </em>(emphasis added), MCL 15.243(l)(d); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(d), there is no corresponding provision concerning information described in administrative regulations or promises. A regulation, <em>qua </em>regulation, therefore, does not defeat disclosure. See <em>Legal Aid Society of Alameda County v Schultz, </em>349 F Supp 771, 776 (ND Cal, 1972) (\"administrative promises of confidentiality cannot extend the command of the Freedom of Information Act that only matters 'specifically exempted ... by <em>statute\u2019 </em>are [exempted from disclosure]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The significance, if any, of a pledge of confidentiality is attributable to the expectation of privacy the pledge may generate (see <em>Washington Post Co, supra, </em>223 US App DC 150) or to the belief that such a pledge would not have been made unless the information submitted was truly personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Assuming that a pledge of confidentiality can create an expectation of privacy if properly communicated, there is no evidence that the guards in this case were aware of the pledge. The Court should not assume such awareness especially since the employers, not the guards, submitted the information to the State Police. See MCL 338.1068(1); MSA 18.185(18X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>More importantly, while a pledge of confidentiality might induce an expectation that information will not be released, a pledge does not enhance or change the \"quality\u201d of the information and make it \"[i]nformation of a <em>personal nature\" </em>within the meaning of the privacy exemption. To illustrate, suppose a regulation required every citizen to submit to the state the third letter of the citizen\u2019s last name. A pledge of confidentiality would create an expectation of \"privacy\u201d (i.e., lack of disclosure), and breach of the pledge might be a \"clearly unwarranted\u201d breach of trust, but few would assert that a breach constituted an invasion of privacy. A pledge of confidentiality does not affect whether the underlying information is \"information of a personal nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">While, arguably, a pledge of confidentiality might give rise to the inference that the underlying information is personal in nature, there is no need to rely on an inference. This Court can directly examine the content of the information and make a judgment whether it is personal. The State Police may have honestly believed that the information was \"personal\u201d and thus in need of confidentiality, but the State Police possess no special ability to determine whether information is personal (in the generic sense), and the State Police certainly have no expertise in determining whether information is \"of a personal nature\u201d within the meaning of the foia.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Although there has been no allegation in the instant case that the pledge of confidentiality was given to subvert the foia, an agency might make such a pledge to accomplish that objective. See, <em>e.g., Washington Post Co, supra, </em>223 US App DC 150 (\"to allow the government to make documents exempt by the simple means of promising confidentiality would subvert foia\u2019s disclosure mandate\u201d); <em>Ackerly v Ley, </em>137 US App DC 133, 136-137, n 3; 420 F2d 1336 (1969) (\"it w\u00fcl obviously not be enough for the agency to assert simply that it received the file under a pledge of confidentiality to the one who supplied it. Undertakings of that nature can not, in and of themselves, override the Act\u201d).

See, also, Davis, Administrative Law (Supp 1970), \u00a7 3A.22, p 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Because a confidentiality pledge is of limited value in determining whether information is \"[\u00a1Information of a personal nature\u201d disclosure of which \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy,\u201d and because there is a potential for abuse, a pledge of confidentiality should be given little, if any, weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\"> The foia, MCL 15.243(l)(t); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(t), permits an agency to withhold \"[ujnless the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure in the particular instance, public records of a police or sheriffs agency or department, the release of which would do any of the following: . . .

The exceptions section does not <em>\"expressly\u201d </em>permit withholding the addresses of security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The fact that the addresses of law enforcement officers need not be disclosed does <em>not </em>mean that the addresses comprise \"[information of a personal nature\u201d the disclosure of which \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d If addresses were personal, there would have been no reason to include a separate section exempting from disclosure officers\u2019 addresses. The exemption for the addresses of law enforcement officers was added not because an address is information of a personal nature, but because the exemption is thought to promote effective police work or to he necessary for the protection of law enforcement officers and their families. The Legislature did not feel that such an address exemption was necessary for security guards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\"> See <em>Kestenbaum, supra, </em>pp 544, 554; <em>Ditlow, </em>n 20 <em>supra, </em>p 356, n 12; Kronman, n 15 <em>supra, </em>p 752.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\"> A showing that disclosure would constitute the tort of \"public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>disclosure of private facts\u201d would seem to evidence that requested information is personal and private.

(The federal courts have, with regard to the privacy interests of \"public figures,\u201d analogized the issues involved in the federal Freedom of Information Act to those involved in freedom of speech libel cases.

See <em>Simpson v Vance, </em>208 US App DC 270, 274; 648 F2d 10 (1980); <em>Washington Post Co, supra, </em>223 US App DC 149.

Similarly, in <em>Kestenbaum, supra, </em>p 546, Justice Ryan, apparently believing that the amount of effort expended to keep information confidential relates to whether information is personal and private, felt it was important that very few students had \"opted out\u201d of being listed in the student directory. Here, the Post Office's list of persons who have elected to be removed from mailing lists pursuant to 39 USC 3008 might have been compared, <em>in camera </em>if necessary, to the persons on the lists requested by upgwa.

However, I would employ a balancing test to reach this conclusion. The privacy interests at stake in this case, in my opinion, clearly outweigh any potential public interest, regardless of whether the definition of public interest is limited by the words of the preamble to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, MCL 15.231(2); MSA 4.1801(1 )(2), as Justice Riley advocates, or given a more expansive reading, as exemplified by Justice Ryan\u2019s opinion in <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State University, </em>414 Mich 510, 552-555; 327 NW2d 783 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">A balancing test is an appropriate means of implementing the words of the statutory exemption. Determining whether \"public disclosure of the information would constitute a <em>clearly unwarranted </em>invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sarily involves an evaluation of the privacy interests and a weighing of those interests against the public interest to be served in the disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">As Justice Levin observes, both opinions in <em>Kestenbaum </em>employed a balancing test. The Fitzgerald opinion in <em>Kestenbaum </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">It generally has been accepted, however, that where the requested information might fall under the federal privacy exemption, <em>a balancing test must be employed, i.e., </em>the public interest in disclosure must be weighed against the potential invasion of privacy. <em>[Kestenbaum, supra, </em>p 526, emphasis added (citing federal cases).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">That opinion further stated that it \"also is necessary under the state act to balance interests.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 527. The Ryan opinion in <em>Kestenbaum </em>also indicated that \"[t]he Court must balance the public interest against the privacy interests with a 'tilt\u2019 in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On the federal level, the balancing test first articulated in <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976), has gained wide acceptance. See <em>Minnis v Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>737 F2d 784, 786 (CA 9, 1984); <em>Heights Community Congress v Veterans Administration, </em>732 F2d 526, 528 (CA 6, 1984); <em>American Federation of Government Employees v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>712 F2d 931, 932 (CA 4, 1983); <em>Washington Post Co v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>223 US App DC 139, 147; 690 F2d 252 (1982); <em>Wine Hobby USA, Inc v Internal Revenue Service, </em>502 F2d 133, 136 (CA 3, 1974); <em>Getman v NLRB, </em>146 US App DC 209; 450 F2d 670 (1971). For example, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in <em>Washington Post Co, supra, </em>stated that in \"determining whether disclosure is clearly unwarranted \u2014 we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>must </em>balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interests of [the persons who are the subjects of the information].\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 147 (emphasis added). Likewise, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently stated that in <em>Rose, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">the Supreme Court <em>mandated </em>that the court balance the individual\u2019s right to privacy against disclosure\u2019s benefit to the public interest in determining if the disclosure would result in a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>[Heights Community Congress, supra, </em>p 528.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Application of the balancing test under either the state or federal exemption is a two-part process. Under the federal act, a court must first determine whether the information contained may be identified as applying to a particular individual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If so, it must determine whether disclosure would constitute \"a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The balancing test comes into play in the second stage of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Likewise, under the state act, a court must first determine whether the requested information is \"of a personal nature.\u201d If it is found to be personal, then the question is whether disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy. Again, this is where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>Rose </em>balancing test comes into play. See <em>Kesten-baum, supra, </em>pp 550-551 (opinion of Ryan, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I find the information sought in this case to be of such a sufficiently personal nature as to give rise to a cognizable privacy interest under the act. In <em>Kestenbaum, </em>Justice Ryan concluded that the names and addresses of Michigan State University students were not sufficiently personal to allow nondisclosure under the exemption. <em>Kestenbaum, supra, </em>p 546. However, Justice Ryan\u2019s analysis does not seem to preclude the possibility that names and addresses of different persons, in a different situation, might be sufficiently personal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In reaching his conclusion in <em>Kestenbaum, </em>Justice Ryan noted \"that names, addresses, telephone numbers, <em>and other standard identifying information </em>simply are not embarrassing information 'of a personal nature\u2019 <em>for the overwhelming majority of students </em>at Michigan State University.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 546 (emphasis added). It may be said that linking names and addresses with the fact of employment by a security guard agency is not \"standard information.\u201d Also, Justice Ryan seems to have considered the characteristics and situation of the persons subject to the disclosure in coming to his conclusion. That opinion noted explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">We leave for another day the question whether, in certain unusual circumstances, ordinarily impersonal information might take on an intensely personal character. <em>[Id., </em>p 547.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">There are several aspects of this case that heighten the privacy interest at stake. First, the information here would reveal more than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>name and address of the individual, it would indicate the type and place of employment. A strong case for distinguishing security guards from other types of addressees may be made on the basis of the law enforcement nature of their work. It is certainly relevant to note that the Michigan foia provides specific exemptions relating to police and sheriffs departments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\"><em>A public body may exempt from disclosure </em>as a public record under this act[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">[u]nless the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure in the particular instance, <em>public records of a police or sheriff\u2019s agency or department, the release of which would do any of the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\"><em>Disclose the personal address or telephone number of law enforcement officers or agents </em>.... [MCL 15.243(l)(t)(iii); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(t)(iii). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Although obviously not directly applicable to this case, these provisions indicate that when names and addresses are linked with the fact of law enforcement employment, the privacy interest is augmented.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Second, the State Police Department\u2019s promise of confidentiality regarding this information also weighs on the side of a heightened privacy interest. As Justice Riley points out, the department\u2019s rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">A complete employee personnel list shall be filed with the department of each licensee on a quarterly basis. <em>This list shall be kept conffdential except for office use. </em>[1979 AC, R 28.4003. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In <em>Washington Post Co, supra, </em>the court discussed how a pledge of confidentiality may affect the privacy interests at stake in a federal foia case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Other things being equal, release of information provided under a pledge of confidentiality involves a greater invasion of privacy than release of information provided without such a pledge. On the other hand, to allow the government to make documents exempt by the simple means of promising confidentiality would subvert foia\u2019s disclosure mandate. <em>On balance, we believe that a government pledge of con\u00f1dentiality, made in good faith and consistently honored, should generally be given weight on the privacy side of the scale in accord with its effect on expectations of privacy. Cf. Ditlow v Shultz, </em>[170 US App DC 352, 358] 517 F2d 166, 172 (1975) (footnote omitted) (\"the absence of a governmental assurance of confidentiality . . . would seem to undercut the privacy expectations protected by exemption 6\u201d). However, such a pledge should not be given determinative weight where the public interest in disclosure is high and the privacy interest in the information would otherwise be low. See <em>Ackerly v Ley, </em>[137 US App DC 133, 137, n 3] 420 F2d 1336, 1340, n 3 (1969) (\"pledge of confidentiality . . . can not, in and of [itself], override the Act\u201d); <em>Robles v EPA, </em>484 F2d 843, 846 (CA 4, 1973) (similar). <em>[Id., </em>p 150. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Clearly, the Department of State Police had good public policy and safety reasons for promulgating the confidentiality rule. Those reasons presumably do not include the subversion of foia requests. This conclusion is supported also by the existence of the specific law enforcement exemptions. There have been no allegations of bad faith or a lack of consistency in applying the confidentiality rule. Thus, the pledge should \"be given weight on the privacy side of the scale in accord with its effect on expectations of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In Justice Levin\u2019s abbreviated discussion of the confidentiality pledge, it merely observes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">because privacy is so subjective a concept \u2014 virtually anything can be embarrassing in the appropriate circumstance \u2014 we regard as significant the absence of evidence establishing or even tending to show that the requested information is personal in nature. We are not willing to \"deem\u201d addresses personal in nature as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On the contrary, factoring the confidentiality pledge into the privacy interest side of the balancing test would not amount to a declaration that all addresses are highly personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The public interest in disclosure in this case is minimal. In this respect, I agree with Justice Levin. The union\u2019s interest in this information is primarily a proprietary one. Moreover, a general interest in the encouragement of collective bargaining is not a compelling public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">A federal case from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit supports this conclusion. In <em>American Federation of Government Employees v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>712 F2d 931 (CA 4, 1983), the union sought disclosure of the addresses of 20,000 bargaining unit employees of the Social Security Administration headquarters for purposes of communicating with them about the union. Employing the <em>Rose </em>balancing test, the court noted the employees\u2019 privacy interest in their home addresses. Turning to the public interest, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">even granting that collective bargaining is a matter of grave public concern, any benefits flowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>from disclosure of the information sought would inure primarily to the union, in a proprietary sense, rather than to the public at large. <em>[Id., </em>p 932.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Thus, the court struck the balance in favor of the employees\u2019 privacy interest and against the union\u2019s interest when the only identifiable public interest was the furtherance of collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Thus, I find it unnecessary to reach the question whether the body of public interests cognizable under the Michigan foia should be circumscribed by the act\u2019s preamble or be interpreted more broadly. However public interest is defined, it is clear that the interests served by disclosure in this case do not rise to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Even assuming an initial \" 'tilt\u2019 in favor of disclosure,\u201d <em>Kestenbaum, supra, </em>p 561, when the privacy interests in this case are balanced against this minimal, possibly nonexistent, public interest, the privacy interests clearly tip the scale in favor of nondisclosure. I believe that the department\u2019s exemption of these records from disclosure was entirely within the dictates of our state foia. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I concur in part V of my brother Levin\u2019s opinion concerning attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b618-8\">Cavanagh, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> The federal foia privacy exemption applies to information contained in \"personnel and medical files and similar files . 5 USC 552(bX6). The United States Supreme Court has interpreted that language broadly, however, holding that the exemption applies to any</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">\"'. . . Government records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.\u2019 [Citation to House Report omitted.] When disclosure of information which applies to a particular individual is sought from Government records, courts must determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of that person\u2019s privacy.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of State v Washington Post Co, </em>456 US 595, 603; 102 S Ct 1957; 72 L Ed 2d 358 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
