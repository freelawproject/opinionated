Three suits pending between the same parties transferred to and pending in the district court of Travis county, Texas, for land in the counties of Mitchell, Howard and Tom Green. The attorneys for the parties to the above causes hereby consent to the following facts and waive proof thereof on the trial of said causes except by this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">1. That the Memphis, El Paso &amp; Pacific Railway Company was duly organized under its charter, and by the performance of all other precedent conditions became entitled to the land reservation of sixteen miles granted in its charter, if the designation of the reservation as required in said charter was made in the manner required in the charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-8\">2. That the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company, by contract and purchase in 1872, and by act of the Legislature of Texas of May 2, 1873, became the owner of the properties, franchises and rights including said land reservation of the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railway Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-9\">3. That all the lands in controversy in this suit within eight miles of the central line of the designation of the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific reservation as shown by the designation by map section number 2, filed in the general land office, and by the written designation filed in the office of the surveyor of Bexar Land District, and that the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company, has received from the State patents for all of said lands. Plaintiff does not admit that said designation was sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-10\">4. That either party may read in evidence any printed copy of the charter, or any private act of the Legislature relating to any railroad corporation relevant to any question in issue with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>out offering a certificate or other evidence of the authenticity of such charter or act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">5. That all facts found to be true in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, for the purposes of its decision of the case of Davis v. Gray, reported in the sixteenth volume of Wallace\u2019s Reports of the United States Supreme Court. Decisions, are admitted to be true for the purposes of the trial of these cases in the district court of Travis county; except that the designation or recognition of said reservation shall not be-proved as a fact by said case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-7\">6. That locations and surveys of all the lands in controversy were made by the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway Company, by virtue of valid land certificates owned by it; that surveys, of each section mathematically correct were made of each certificate, and the field notes having been properly recorded were-in each instance, together with the certificates filed in the general land office within the time required by law and remain soon file unpatented. Said location? and surveys were made and filed as follows, to wit: Surveys in block 26 in Mitchell county were made in the year 186?, and the field notes thereof filed in the general land office in July and August, 1867.

The surveys of the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway were made by the land surveyors of the land district in which the land surveyed was situated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-8\">1. The certificates by virtue of which surveys numbers forty-nine to ninety-one, in block twenty-six, were made for the-Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway Company, were returned to-the general land office July 26,1872, while the field notes thereof were returned in 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-9\">2. February 17, 1857, the Memphis, El Paso &amp; Pacific Railway Company filed in the district surveyor\u2019s office of Bexar land district, at San Antonio, a designation describing the recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>nized line of the road of said company, through said district, as follows: Commencing on the boundary line between the Milam and Bexar land districts, State aforesaid, at a point due \u2022east of the southeast corner of survey number four, made in the name of James H. Carothers, according to the map and records of the Bexar land district in the general land office at Austin; thence in a straight line south seventy-seven minutes west, to a point eight miles due south of the southeast corner of the territory of New Mexico; thence due west to the Pecos river, the same being the western line of the Bexar land district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-4\">3. June 20, 1857, a map of said designation was received and tiled in the general land office. The map showed proper connections with the line of route of the road of said company \u2022from its eastern extremity, and it includes as part of the line that filed in the Bexar land district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\">4. By actual survey, beginning at the southeast corner of New Mexico, as ascertained by the boundary commission, and Tunning by reverse calls, the lines designated as in numbers two and three have been verified. The line so run identically with the designation forms the basis of the measurement each way (north and south) to make the sixteen miles reservation, and which belt so found and measured includes the land in \u2022dispute in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\">5. The map and documents relied on as evidencing a designation of the line of the road of the said railroad company, were deposited in the land office in 1857. They were found in \u25a0said office in 1877, in proper file, and have remained there ever since. The attention of the officers of the land office was \u25a0called to said documents, and the State officials recognizing them, patents were issued to the defendant company over the older locations and surveys of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s certificates and field notes were in the land office long prior to the location of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-7\">6. The several acts of the Legislature on the subject (public .and private), were read in evidence, and can be inserted if desired by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-8\">Upon these facts the court finds and holds as matters of law\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-9\">1. That the \u201crecognition\u201d made and designated in 1857 was a, sufficient recognition under the law to validate or extend the reservation along it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-10\">2. Thereby the lands were reserved from general location, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>and such reservation was not destroyed by the 'State in opening reservation (either by Constitution or statute), and was existing at the date of the locations and surveys by the plaintiff upon the land sued for.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">'3. The locations and surveys (with return thereof, with certificates to the general land office) are not valid titles to the land-covered by them against the rights of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8H\"><em>H. D. Prendergast </em>and <em>D. H.

(Rinby v. Chambers, 15 Texas, <em>592; </em>Weir v. Van Bibber, 34 Texas, 229; Johnson v. Parnell, 2 Wheaton, 208; McArthur v.

Appellant relies upon two points for reversal of the judgment, and contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">1. That the description given of the reservation in the map and designation filed in the general land office, and in the office of the district surveyor of Bexar land district in 1857, is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">2. That the reservation was forfeited by the provision of section 5, article 10, of the Constitution of 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The charter of the Memphis, El Paso &amp; Pacific Railway Company, granted by act of the Legislature of February 4, 1854, contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201c Section 15. * * * All the vacant public lands within eight miles on each side of the extension line of said road, shall be exempt from location or entry, from and after the time when such line shall be designated by survey, recognition or otherwise.

The written \u25a0designation notified the surveyor that the reservation included eight miles north and eight miles south of the designated line. The map and designation were also filed in the general land cffice on June 20,1857. The central line of the reservation is described in the map and designation as follows: \u201cCommencing on the boundary line between the Bexar and Milam land district at a point due east of the southeast corner of a survey of land number four, made in the name of James H.

Commencing on the eastern boundary line of the State, in Bowie county, and thence westwardly to the twenty-third meridian of longitude west from Washington, are hereby continued to be reserved from pre-emption, location or survey by the holder of any land certificate or other land claim, for the ben\u00e9fit of said Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company and for the benefit of the school fund; and, where the public lands therein have not already been sectionized, said company shall sectionize the same and return the field notes and maps to the general land office. * * * Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to affect\u201cor impair the legal rights of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Section 6. That the said Memphis &amp; El Paso reservation, from the twenty-third meridian of longitude from Washington to the Rio Grande river, as designated by the field notes, maps and reports from the different surveyors of the several land districts of the State, on file in the general land office, is hereby continued to be set aside and reserved from pre-emption, location and survey for the benefit of said Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company and the school fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The act proceeds to set aside an additional width of forty miles on each side of the center of the reservation, so as to make eighty miles from the twenty-third meridian west to a point south of the southeast corner of New Mexico and opposite, after passing that point the reservation of eighty miles is continued to the Rio Grande, bounded north by New Mexico; \u201cthe same to include the Memphis &amp; El Paso reservation hereinbefore mentioned,\u201d to continue till 1880. \u201cProvided, that nothing in this section shall impair or affect the rights of any person or persons heretofore legally acquired within said reservations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The map and designation have been on file in the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>land office since 1857, and the sufficiency of the description of the reservation has been repeatedly recognized by both the legislative and executive departments of the government. The charter does not require a line to be run or surveys to be made as a condition precedent to the reservation taking effect, but expressly gives effect to the reservation from and after the time when such line shall be designated \"by survey, recognition or otherwise.\u201d Had the Legislature intended that the line should be actually run before the reservation should take effect, it would not have authorized the line to be designated \"by recognition or otherwise.\u201d The description given in the map and designation affords the information necessary for the exact location of the line and\u00bb identification of the boundaries of the reserve.
