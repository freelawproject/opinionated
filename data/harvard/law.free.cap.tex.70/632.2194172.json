Notice\u2014Lien\u2014Purchaser.\u2014The possession of land by a purchaser through his tenant, though his deed is unrecorded, operates as notice of the purchaser\u2019s rights to a creditor in whose favor a levy is made of an execution on the property. The purchaser under such execution who has actual notice of such deed at the execution sale, can not be an innocent purchaser, as he would be if the creditor had acquired the lien secured by levy unaffected by the constructive notice resulting from the possession of the tenant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b648-12\">Appeal from Cooke.

(Eylar v. Eylar, 60 Texas, 316; Smith et al. v. Miller et al., 63 Texas, 74; Wethered v. Boone, 17 Texas, 147, 148; Mainwaring v. Templeman, 51 Texas, 206; Smith v.

V. C. Holland formerly owned the property, but he conveyed it to appellants by a deed delivered on October 20, 1885, which, however, was not filed for record until March 15, 1886. That this conveyance was made in good faith and upon valuable consideration, is not questioned. A judgment was secured aghinst Holland in a justice\u2019s court on February 22, 1886, on which an execution issued March 9, 1886. That was levied on the property in controversy on March 11, and it was sold and bought by the appellee on April 6 following, and the officer executed a deed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>him. At the sal\u00e9 notice of the right of appellants was given. At the time the levy was made and at the time of the sale through which the appellee claims, the property was occupied by a tenant holding under the appellants, who had entered after their purchase. The notice given at the sale would not protect the appellants\u2019 rights, but there is no fact shown which would prevent the possession of the tenant of appellants from operating as notice to appellees and to the creditor of Holland of their right at the time the levy was made. The general rule is that the possession of a tenant operates as notice of whatever right the landlord has, as fully as would his own possession. (Mainwaring v. Templeman, 51 Texas, 213; Watkins v. Edwards, 23 Texas, 449; Hawley v. Bullock, 29 Texas, 224; Woodson v. Collins, 56 Texas, 175.)</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b650-7\">Opinion delivered May 4, 1888.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The creditor of Holland, under whose execution appellee bought, having notice of the appellants\u2019 rights before his execution was levied, and the appellee having notice before he bought, the latter can not be held to be an innocent purchaser, nor can he be protected as he would be entitled to be if the creditor of Holland had acquired a lien on the property by his levy without notice of the right or claim of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The judgment should have been for appellants, and it will be reversed and here so rendered. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
