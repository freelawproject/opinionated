II. Even under plaintiffs theory the action was not timely commenced.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b284-10\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">This appeal arises from a medical malpractice action whose viability is dependent on the application and contours of CPLR 214-a. This Court is obliged to determine whether a plastic stent, placed in plaintiff\u2019s nose for postsurgery healing purposes, constitutes a \"foreign object\u201d that would avoid the bar of the statute of repose. We conclude that the device is not a foreign object within the meaning of the statute and its purpose and history, as shaped by and reflected in our governing precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Supreme Court granted defendant Shapiro\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint against him. The Appellate Division affirmed and granted the plaintiff leave to appeal. We now also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">In May 1986, defendant Dr. Jack Martin Shapiro performed a nasal reconstruction on plaintiff at the New York Eye and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Ear Infirmary. At the conclusion of the procedure, Dr. Shapiro packed the nasal cavity with Bacitracin gauze and inserted a shaped piece of plastic \u2014 a silastic stent. This device was to provide temporary support, promote healing and prevent scarring. The packing material and the stent were expected to be removed by Dr. Shapiro approximately 10 days after the surgery. At that time, the doctor removed only the packing material.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">For the next six years, plaintiff suffered persistent nasal and respiratory problems. He consulted with Dr. Shapiro and other doctors. The last contact with Dr. Shapiro occurred in September 1988. No one detected the presence of the stent or diagnosed the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s complaints or condition. In 1992, a new doctor performed an endoscopic rhinoscopy, discovered the stent and removed it. Plaintiff\u2019s troublesome symptoms ceased. He then commenced this action in June 1993, within one year of the discovery and extraction of the stent.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Supreme Court dismissed the action against Dr. Shapiro as untimely on the ground that the \"foreign object\u201d exception to the Statute of Limitations did not apply. Under its ruling, the case was found to have been commenced more than <em>2xh </em>years beyond the uncontested last date of treatment with Dr. Shapiro in 1988, and thus was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The Appellate Division affirmed (230 AD2d 303). The Court concluded that the crucial distinction between a foreign object and a fixation device \"is whether the object was deliberately left inside the patient in the first instance\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 307). The Court drew a definitive demarcation line that \"[a] foreign object is one that the doctor 'does not intend to leave inside the body\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C214-a:3, at 603), in contradistinction to a fixation device which \"is meant to be left inside the patient\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis in original]). Since the stent was intended to be left, albeit temporarily, in this patient, it was classified as a \"fixation device\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 305).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The Court added that \"[w]hile this result is troublesome to the Court, we find that to hold otherwise would conflict with those cases in which the Court of Appeals has not only defined what constitutes a 'foreign object\u2019 but also consistently cautioned against judicial extension of the foreign object exception of CPLR 214-a\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Court emphasized that \"the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>express intent of the legislation was to curtail judicial expansion of the discovery rule\u201d <em>(id,., </em>at 306; <em>see, </em>Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 109, Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, at 4; McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C214-a:3, at 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Presiding Justice Murphy dissented <em>(id., </em>at 309). His preferred legal theory was that the instant claim \"is based on a physician\u2019s failure to make certain that all temporary holding devices \u2014 clamps, temporary stents, and others \u2014 have been removed from the body at the close of a single \u2014 albeit several-stage \u2014 medical proceeding\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The case presents another application of the governing statute in the light of our precedents. The \"foreign object\u201d exception to the Statute of Limitations emerged in <em>Flanagan v Mount Eden Gen. Hosp. </em>(24 NY2d 427). There, we concluded that \"where a foreign object [a surgical clamp] has negligently been left in the patient\u2019s body, the Statute of Limitations will not begin to run until the patient could have reasonably discovered the malpractice\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 431). We noted that \"foreign object\u201d cases differ from those involving \"negligent medical treatment\u201d because the former do not create \"the danger of belated, false or frivolous claims\u201d \u2014 one of the paramount goals of Statutes of Limitation <em>(id., </em>at 430-431).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Six years after <em>Flanagan, </em>in 1975, the Legislature codified the precedential \"foreign object\u201d exception in CPLR 214-a <em>(see, </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 42, at 52 [2d ed]). The statute prescribes that an action for medical malpractice \"must be commenced within two years and six months of the act, omission or failure complained of * * * provided, however, that where the action is based upon the discovery of a foreign object in the body of the patient, the action may be commenced within one year of the date of such discovery or of the date of discovery of facts which would reasonably lead to such discovery, whichever is earlier\u201d (CPLR 214-a). Importantly, the statute expressly excludes \"chemical compound[s], <em>fixation devicefs] </em>[and] prosthetic aid[s] or device[s]\u201d from the definition of the term \"foreign object\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">After the statutory codification, this Court decided <em>Rodriguez v Manhattan Med. Group </em>(77 NY2d 217). There, the Court held that \"a 'fixation device\u2019 [an I.U.D.] originally implanted in a patient\u2019s body for a specific treatment purpose is [not] transformed into a 'foreign object\u2019 within the meaning of [CPLR 214-a] when a physician retained to remove it negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>gently fails to do so\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 218-219). The Court noted that, unlike <em>Flanagan, </em>\"there [was] no claim against the physician who actually inserted the I.U.D.; instead, plaintiffs [sought] recovery from a different treating physician\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 223). We observed that \"the gist of plaintiff\u2019s claim, i.e., a negligent failure to detect the continued presence of a previously inserted device, is most logically classified as one involving misdiagnosis \u2014 a category for which the benefits of the 'foreign object\u2019 discovery rule have routinely been denied\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 223).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Additionally, the Court explained that \"the codification of the judicially created 'foreign object\u2019 rule in CPLR 214-a precludes our adoption of a more flexible discovery rule for these cases even if 'considerations similar to those which motivated the court in <em>Flanagan </em>[c]ould be applied with like effect to the * * * different circumstances [presented here]\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 223-224, quoting <em>Beary v City of Rye, </em>44 NY2d 398, 414). In other words, the statutory codification limited the range of common-law development. The <em>Rodriguez </em>Court concluded that application of the \"foreign object\u201d exception there would have \"represented] a giant step toward precisely what the statute\u2019s drafters feared: 'bringing virtually all medical malpractice cases under the discovery rule\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 224, quoting Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 109, Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The next and most recent poststatute explication on the \"foreign object exception\u201d occurred in <em>Rockefeller v Moront </em>(81 NY2d 560). There, the Court determined that a suture which was misplaced during a hernia operation did not constitute a \"foreign object;\u201d rather, it, too, was a \"fixation device\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 562). The Court stated that \"Mbjects such as surgical clamps, scalpels, and sponges are introduced into the patient\u2019s body to serve a temporary medical function for the duration of the surgery, but are normally intended to be removed after the procedure\u2019s completion\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 564). The Court explained that \"no assessment of the medical professional\u2019s expert judgment or discretion in failing to remove them is necessary to establish negligence\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Rather, \"items which are placed in the patient with the intention that they will remain to serve some continuing treatment purpose constitute 'fixation devices\u2019 \u201d <em>(id.). </em>Additionally, the Court reasoned that a claim based on such negligent implantation \"is more readily characterized as one predicated on negligent medical treatment, which, like misdiagnosis, is a category of malpractice not covered by the 'foreign object\u2019 rule\u201d (id., at 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In <em>Rockefeller, </em>the Court observed that it was \"not unmindful of the harsh consequences of ruling [against] plaintiff, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>first discovered the misplaced suture that caused his sterility only after undergoing exploratory surgery performed 18 years after the injury-producing herniorrhaphy\u201d (id., at 566). Nonetheless, \"our holding [remained] consistent with this Court\u2019s prior cautionary directive that the 'foreign object\u2019 exception must not be broadened beyond the narrow confines announced in Flanagan\u201d and delineated by the statute <em>(id.). </em>CPLR 214-a, its legislative history and our pre- and poststatute precedents evolved to a statement of a narrow rule: \"only in circumstances where a foreign object is negligently 'left\u2019 in the patient\u2019s body <em>without any intended continuing treatment purpose </em>will the discovery rule be available to delay the running of the Statute of Limitations\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">This case presents yet another variation among a myriad of medical protocols, devices and procedures. It is not about the failure to detect an \"object,\u201d like an I.U.D. inserted into a patient for an indefinite period of time; nor does it concern a doctor\u2019s negligence in improperly attaching an \"object\u201d to the wrong organ. Claims predicated on misdiagnosis and negligent medical treatment more readily implicate the rationale and policy direction of our precedents which is to prevent untimely claims dependent upon the assessment of a doctor\u2019s professional judgment or discretion. The instant scenario, on the other hand, presents a more elusive classification question. Nevertheless, our analysis comfortably rests on the same dispositional criterion used in <em>Rockefeller </em>\u2014 intentional insertion of a therapeutic item for postsurgery continuing treatment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The rule that emerges from <em>Rockefeller </em>also offers a measure of definiteness. A \"foreign object\u201d is one that is \"negligently 'left\u2019 in the patient\u2019s body without any intended continuing treatment purpose\u201d <em>(Rockefeller v Moront, supra, </em>81 NY2d, at 566; <em>see, </em>McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C214-a:3, at 603 [\"(i)t has become relatively clear that a foreign object is one that the doctor does not intend to leave inside the body\u201d]). That test removes this stent from the \"foreign object\u201d category and designation. Unquestionably, it was implanted with an intentional continuing treatment objective. Even in the vernacular, it cannot be said to have been \"left\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s nose. Rather, it was put there only to be removed after it had served its postsurgery healing purposes. The time frame was to be relatively short and conditionally fixed, but the key feature is the uncontroverted protocol of insertion as part of a continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ing treatment modality. Thus, it may be an \"object,\u201d but it is not \"foreign\u201d and not \"left behind,\u201d in any medical or legal senses.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In sum, therefore, we disagree with plaintiffs theory that the relatively short and ordinarily definite nature of the stent\u2019s time in the nose should allow it to be treated as a \"foreign object.\u201d We are similarly unpersuaded by the analysis propounded by the dissent in the Court below concerning a \"multistage procedure\u201d exception (i.e., that the surgical procedure continued until the packing was removed). These understandable explorations searching for individualized justice in the midst of well-settled definiteness of the governing principles are theoretically unsupportable and would engender unevenness of application. Also, they are contrary to the legislative intent to limit the scope of the \"foreign object rule.\u201d These efforts to enlarge the exception would also undermine, if not contradict, the statute and the policy lines and precedents that have emerged to fix boundaries for this troublesome field.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We are satisfied that an affirmance here is mandated by the statute and by our consistent restraint against opening up the \"foreign object\u201d exception. It has been noted that the codification of the judicially created \"foreign object\u201d rule in CPLR 214-a constricts judicial expansiveness towards a more plaintiff friendly discovery rule <em>(see, Rodriguez v Manhattan Med. Group, </em>77 NY2d 217, 224, <em>supra; </em>Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 109, Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, at 4; <em>see also, 2 </em>Bard and Marano, New York Medical Malpractice \u00a7 9.2.2.2, at 9-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Yet, in closing our resolution and discussion of this case, we reiterate that this area of medical malpractice has engendered expressions of possible \"unfairness\u201d suffered by the strict adherence to definitive rules and policies <em>(see, e.g, Rockefeller v Moront, </em>81 NY2d 560, 566, <em>supra; LaBarbera v New York Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, supra, </em>230 AD2d, at 305, <em>affd </em>91 NY2d 207 [the instant case]). We conclude, nonetheless, that the Legislature, having statutorily occupied the field, is more appropriately suited to effectuate any redefinition or expansion of the application of the exception, if that is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
