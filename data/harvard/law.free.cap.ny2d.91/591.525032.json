This Court must determine whether the subject matter jurisdiction of the New York Surrogate\u2019s Court extends to the Cayman Islands assets of decedent, a Texas resident and Mexican domiciliary, when the issuance of ancillary letters of administration in New York is predicated solely on a small bank account in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">This proceeding was commenced as part of the ancillary administration. It seeks discovery for the location and turnover of approximately $1,300,000 allegedly transferred after decedent\u2019s suicide on April 20, 1990. These assets moved from his investment account with Morgan Stanley Asset Management, Ltd. in London (Morgan Stanley-London) to a trust allegedly created before his death through Barclays Private Bank and Trust Limited (Barclays) in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The petition was amended to pursue particularly the discovery and turnover of the trust assets now in the Cayman Islands. Surrogate\u2019s Court denied motions by respondents, Bar-clays and Morgan Stanley, to dismiss the ancillary administrator\u2019s amended petition. The Appellate Division reversed and Stern appeals pursuant to leave granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">We now affirm. The Island of Manhattan can no more declare itself the command center over Mexico and the Cayman Islands with respect to the subject assets in the circumstances of this case today, than the Island of Tobago could pretend to rule the world in 1808 <em>(see, Buchanan v Rucker, </em>9 East 192, 194, 103 Eng Rep 546, 547 [KB 1808] [\u201cCan the island of Tobago pass a law to bind the rights of the whole world? Would the world submit to such an assumed jurisdiction?\u201d Held, No.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">While a resident of New York in 1988, Oscar Obregon opened an investment account with Morgan Stanley-London. The initial arrangements were handled by Eugene R. Gonzalez, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>officer in the New York office of Morgan Stanley International Inc., and Michael Cowan, an investment manager at Morgan Stanley-London. Obregon deposited over $1,300,000 into the London account through Mellon Bank in New York. Decedent\u2019s marital son, Oscar, was named as beneficiary of the London account.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In early 1989, while still residing in New York City, Obregon sought estate planning guidance from Gonzalez, who was then employed at Barclays. In March of 1990, Obregon contacted Nelson Ramirez, a trust officer at Barclays\u2019 Miami office, to establish a discretionary, inter vivos off-shore trust in the Cayman Islands with Barclays Private Bank using the London funds. Obregon executed a \u201cletter of instructions and WISHES TO ESTABLISH A TRUST AND COMPANY\u201d dated April 16, 1990. It allowed Barclays Private Bank \u201cconsiderable discretion with respect to the distributions and administration * * * of the income and capital\u201d of the \u201cFaygate Trust.\u201d The Letter of Instructions and Wishes provided that, in the event of Obregon\u2019s incapacity, \u201cthe Trustees may act in their absolute discretion should the need arise.\u201d Obregon also faxed an \u201casset transfer instruction letter\u201d dated April 19, 1990 to Cowan at Morgan Stanley-London authorizing him \u201cto transfer the balance of my Investment Management Account [approximately $1,200,000] to my trust at [Barclays Private Bank]\u201d in the Cayman Islands. Thereafter, Obregon allegedly indicated that he wanted to designate his nonmarital infant son, Christian, who was living in Canada, as beneficiary of the trust funded by the London account.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On April 20, 1990, the decedent committed suicide at his residence in Houston, Texas. Manuel Reyero Conejo (Reyero) is the husband of Obregon\u2019s ex-wife. The latter was sole distributee under Mexican law. Reyero was designated administrator of Obregon\u2019s estate in Mexico. The Mexican Probate Court later declared decedent\u2019s marital son as \u201cthe sole and universal heir of this succession\u201d to his father\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">On June 14, 1990, Barclays Private Bank and Morgan Stanley-London agreed that Morgan Stanley-London should manage the assets of the Faygate Trust on behalf of the trustee, Barclays. Thereafter, at the direction of Barclays, Morgan Stanley-London liquidated the trust assets in London and transferred the proceeds to Barclays Private Bank. This was accomplished by a cashier\u2019s check drawn on Citibank, N.A. in New York, purchased by Morgan Stanley-London, payable and transmitted to Barclays Private Bank in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>One year after Obregon\u2019s death, Reyero petitioned the Surrogate\u2019s Court in New York for ancillary letters of administration. He alleged that although the only New York estate asset was a bank account with a balance of $1,405, \u201c[t]he real purpose of having ancillary letters * * * is to enable us to conduct discovery proceedings in order to trace in excess of $1,200,000 that has been purportedly transferred to a trust in the Cayman Islands.\u201d Reyero later requested that his attorney in New York, Joel S. Stern, be designated ancillary administrator. On May 16, 1991, ancillary letters of administration were issued to appellant Stern. The order stated that \u201cnone of the property be removed from this state without first giving the State Tax Commission sufficient evidence to enable it to ascertain the tax due thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Stern then sought discovery and turnover of the funds used to establish the Faygate Trust. He alleges that respondents, Barclays Bank PLC and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., participated in the unauthorized transfer of approximately $1,400,000 of decedent\u2019s funds to the Trust from Obregon\u2019s London account after his death. Pegging New York\u2019s conceded power over the unadministered New York bank account to these events and assets, Stern makes claim to the funds in the Faygate Trust on the ground that the trust and transfer were not validly executed as of the time of Obregon\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Surrogate\u2019s Court concluded that it possessed and acquired subject matter jurisdiction over the Cayman Islands trust. The Surrogate asserted in this key respect that an ancillary administrator\u2019s authority \u201cextends to the reach of process of the state\u2019s courts * * * and that an ancillary administrator is not limited to the collection of the asset that furnished the basis for his appointment\u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed (230 AD2d 47). It held that, other than the de minimis sum in the New York bank account that served as the basis for Stern\u2019s ancillary appointment, the Surrogate\u2019s Court lacked more extensive subject matter jurisdiction in these circumstances and the ancillary administrator enjoyed no supervening authority over Obregon\u2019s extraterritorial assets by way of the ancillary New York proceeding <em>(id., </em>at 51-54, citing <em>Lockwood v United States Steel Corp., </em>153 App Div 655, 659-660, <em>revd on other grounds </em>209 NY 375; <em>Matter of Piccione, </em>57 NY2d 278, 287-291; <em>Matter of Re v Truck-A-Tune, Inc., </em>191 AD2d 327). Because Stern\u2019s appointment was purely and narrowly ancillary to the Mexican proceeding, the Appellate Division cogently concluded that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>authority was limited to property situated within the New York ancillary jurisdiction <em>(id., </em>at 52, citing <em>Lockwood v United States Steel Corp., supra, </em>153 App Div, at 659-660; <em>McMaster v Gould, </em>240 NY 379, 388; <em>Dimmerling v Andrews, </em>236 NY 43; <em>Matter of Rogers, </em>225 App Div 286, 289, <em>affd </em>254 NY 592).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Interestingly, after the commencement of this ancillary proceeding, the estate began to pursue whatever remedies it may have against respondents in the Cayman Islands and in the Supreme Court of State of New York <em>(see, e.g., Obregon v Morgan Stanley Group, </em>index No. 97-118415), the principal trial court in New York and the only one with plenary jurisdiction, among New York\u2019s array of trial courts (NY Const, art VI, \u00a77).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The New York State Constitution confers jurisdiction on the Surrogate\u2019s Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cover all actions and proceedings relating to the affairs of decedents, probate of wills, administration of estates and actions and proceedings arising thereunder or pertaining thereto, * * * and such other actions and proceedings, not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme court, as may be provided by law\u201d (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 12 [d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The codification of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act in 1966 was intended to implement the powers of that court \u201cto permit all matters relating to affairs of decedents to be determined <em>in the court settling the </em>estate\u201d (Mem of Temp St Commn on Estates, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 953, at 7 [emphasis added]). The Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act specifies that the Surrogate\u2019s Court\u2019s general jurisdiction encompasses:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">\u201call the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Constitution * * * and all other authority and jurisdiction now or hereafter conferred upon the court by any general or special statute or provision of law, including this act\u201d (SCPA 201 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\"><em>Matter of Piccione </em>(57 NY2d 278, supra) encapsulates the view that, by these grants of power, the \u201chistory of the Surrogate\u2019s Court during the twentieth century is one of steadily expanding jurisdiction;\u201d the case explains that \u201c \u2018 \u201cfor the Surrogate\u2019s Court to decline jurisdiction, it should be abundantly clear that the matter in controversy in no way affects the affairs of a decedent or the administration of his estate\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>at 287, 288 [citations omitted]). Importantly, however, this Court\u2019s dispositional analysis and holding focused on the general, original jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court to authorize discovery with regard to an eviction proceeding concerning New York realty of a domiciliary testator <em>(see, id., </em>at 283).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act also expressly declares that \u201c [t] he surrogate\u2019s court of any county has jurisdiction over the estate of any non-domiciliary decedent who leaves property in the state\u201d (SCPA 206 [1]). Appellant Stern and the dissent <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 604-605) would project the import of this sentence to sustain an expansive proposition that the New York Surrogate\u2019s Court enjoys plenary subject matter jurisdiction, emanating from an ancillary proceeding, over worldwide estate assets of a nondomiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">To be sure, the prefatory language of SCPA 206 bespeaks no jurisdictional limitations. The provision refers, however, in the main, to venue. Thus, a discerning analysis should not read those words in isolation and acontextually from sections 205 and 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In 1984, sections 205 (domiciliaries), 206 (nondomiciliaries), and 207 (lifetime trusts) were enacted collectively to \u201csubstitute a flexible \u2018venue\u2019 concept for what had been a rigid \u2018subject matter jurisdiction\u2019 notion appended to proceedings brought in a surrogate\u2019s court\u201d <em>(see, </em>Siegel and Connors, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 205, 206, at 136, 146). Thus, the addition of SCPA 206 is designed to provide for jurisdiction over <em>State-wide, rather than merely countywide, </em>assets and to remedy problems flowing from commencement of a proceeding in a wrong county <em>(see, </em>Recommendation of NY Law Rev Commn, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 128, at 24-26; Letter of Approval from Michael Colodner, Counsel to the Governor, dated Apr. 18, 1984, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 128, at 37-38; Approval Mem of NY St Bar Assn, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 128, at 42-43). This reformulation does not represent a generalized extraterritorial expansion of subject matter jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries\u2019 estates in ancillary settings <em>(see, </em>SCPA 205, 206; <em>see also, </em>Sponsor\u2019s Letter from Senator Barclay, dated May 24, 1984, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 128, at 16). The theory of the dissent appears to proceed largely from the proposition that there can be no restriction on the breadth of the subject matter jurisdiction of New York\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court since none is explicitly stated <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 604-605, 607, 608, n). Critically, however, none of these provisions including the linchpin of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>argument \u2014 section 206 \u2014 refers to ancillary proceedings of the type involved in this proceeding and appeal, a factor pointedly overlooked also by the dissent (see, dissenting opn, at 607-608).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Stern\u2019s hypothesis, in this respect, even fails to overcome or come to terms with the pivotal distinction between general, original administration or probate of a nondomiciliary\u2019s estate and the ancillary type at issue here; the dissent essentially ignores this difference, as well (see, dissenting opn, at 606, 607-608; see <em>also, </em>SCPA 1605; <em>Matter of Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d 337, 344-345; <em>Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 318 [\u201crules differ in respect to the status of a foreign executor and a foreign administrator as contrasted with the status of an ancillary executor and an ancillary administrator\u201d]; <em>Matter of Turton, </em>8 NY2d 311; <em>Helme v Buckelew, </em>229 NY 363, 366 [Cardozo, J.]; <em>compare, </em>SCPA 1602 [ancillary probate], <em>with </em>SCPA 1607 [ancillary administration]).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Thus, in context and taken as a whole, the subject matter jurisdiction of New York\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Courts is necessarily more embracive when it is the predominant tribunal for administering and preserving estate rights and assets <em>(see, Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 318-319, <em>supra; cf., Matter of Turton, </em>8 NY2d 311, 315, <em>supra </em>[\u201crecognition (must) be given to the fact that there is but one estate and that primary probate or administration proceedings should be undertaken by the appropriate court of the decedent\u2019s domicile, all other proceedings being ancillary\u201d]). On the other hand, traditional approaches and appropriately interpreted authorizations for the exercise of ancillary subject matter jurisdiction have been prudently treated more narrowly \u2014 as the circumstances of this case warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Ordinarily, little distinction is drawn between subject matter jurisdiction of domiciliary and nondomiciliary estates in <em>original </em>proceedings. The critical analytical failure to respect this pivotal distinction between plenary subject matter jurisdiction for original domiciliary proceedings may be appreciated better from a careful reading of our cases and the relevant statutes, particularly set against the distinguishable context of nondomiciliary <em>ancillary </em>proceedings. The distinction is so fundamental that it receives separate treatment in the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1605 [original probate of foreign estate]; <em>see also, </em>Tur ano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1607, at 601; <em>compare, </em>SCPA 1602 [1] [ancillary probate \u201cmay operate upon any property <em>in this state\u201d] </em>[emphasis added]; <em>see generally, Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d 337, 341, <em>supra). </em>We do not question that a Surrogate\u2019s Court may possess plenary and primary subject matter jurisdiction over the entire estate of a nondomiciliary, unless there is a valid, preexisting proceeding otherwise administering the estate <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1601, 1602, 1605, 1607; <em>see also, Matter of Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d 337, <em>supra). </em>Nor are we dealing here with the discretionary power of Surrogate\u2019s Court, in the interests of comity, to decline to assert its otherwise plenary original subject matter jurisdiction where a will has been previously probated in another jurisdiction, where the testator has expressed a jurisdictional preference, or where domiciliary laws discriminate against beneficiaries or fiduciaries <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1605; <em>Matter of Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d 337, <em>supra), </em>or even whether or not to <em>issue </em>ancillary letters <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1607) or whether to determine the decidedly discretionary distribution of assets successfully collected by the auxiliary representative <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1610; <em>Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 319-320, <em>supra). </em>Those circumstances are neither this case nor its jurisdictional problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We turn then to SCPA article 16, which specifically governs foreign estates and ancillary proceedings. To effectuate the legislative goal of centralized estate administration <em>(see, </em>Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinneys Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1601, at 575), section 1601 explicitly declares that \u201cancillary administration shall be granted in this state only when there is an actual administration in the domiciliary jurisdiction\u201d (SCPA 1601; <em>see also, Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 318, supra; <em>Steele v Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>31 App Div 389, 399, <em>affd </em>160 NY 703; Turano and Radigan, New York Estate Administration, at 509, 511; 3 Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogates\u2019 Courts \u00a7 47.02 [2], at 47-16 to 47-17 [6th ed rev]). The Temporary State Commission on Estates in 1966 noted that article 16 \u201cpermit[s] our courts <em>to maintain </em>jurisdiction over the property and the fiduciary\u201d through this assistive vehicle (Mem of Temp St Commn on Estates, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 953, at 16 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We do not quarrel with the general proposition that the \u201cjurisdiction and venue rules of SCPA 206 are applicable to ancillary proceedings\u201d (Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1601, at 576). The supplementary jurisdiction contemplated, however, does not spill beyond the borders of article 16 to rove after assets anywhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the world <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 606). That would offend the harmonious symmetry of the provisions and would, on the practical side, allow for potentially undue displacement or invidious competition with the principal estate tribunal, instead of simply serving to assist it. Moreover, it is no answer to a subject matter jurisdiction contest that a nondomiciliary estate representative is collaborating with a New York ancillary administrator, a circumstance that will not always be so and is not controlling here, in any event <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 605-606).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Thus, Stern\u2019s argument that the subject matter jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court in an ancillary proceeding in New York is coextensive with that of a domiciliary proceeding in Mexico is fundamentally at odds with the purpose and reach of article 16. Because the subordinate proceeding is intended essentially to complement the principal domiciliary proceeding, the ancillary one should not be allowed to eclipse the predominant domain and proceeding just because the ancillary locus may have more efficacious procedural mechanisms to reach \u201ctreasure island,\u201d or just because New York is New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Consequently, a sensible lid on the subject matter jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court in the context of the ancillary administration of this matter is consistent with the inherently supplementary purpose of ancillary proceedings <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1610; <em>Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 319, <em>supra; Helme v Buckelew, </em>229 NY 363, 372, <em>supra; see also, </em>Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1605, at 595 [\u201cif another jurisdiction has granted probate, we cannot grant <em>original </em>probate here (and) are relegated to ancillary probate\u201d] [emphasis added]; Preminger, Thomas, Frunzi and Hilker, Trusts and Estates Practice in New York \u00b6 7:5, at 7-4; <em>see generally, </em>Powers, <em>Foreign Estates, </em>34 Brook L Rev 442 [1967-1968]).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Appellant further postulates that once an ancillary administrator is duly appointed in New York State, New York courts acquire power to compel turnover of assets wherever located. Stern thus attempts to convert his undisputed, albeit limited, authority as ancillary administrator, into a full-scale search and envelopment over worldwide assets <em>(see, Buchanan v Rucker, </em>9 East 192, 194, 103 Eng Rep 546, 547 [KB 1808], <em>supra). </em>His strategic and functional objective is to substitute New York for Mexico as the more efficacious focal point for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>handling of the estate and to use New York as the power forum. We are not persuaded that there is authority or justification for this triangulated route to the asset located in the Cayman Islands destination. Moreover, we do not see that outreach as a convenient foot-in-the-door comity matter; the jurisdictional threshold must be satisfied first, before New York courts would acquire the competence to pass on discretionary comity factors. Thus, remittal of this case is entirely unwarranted, dilatory and dissipative.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Stern further argues that because the Mexican domiciliary requested Stern\u2019s ancillary appointment, he may circumnavigate the statute and use a New York foothold to reach extraterritorial assets. Parties can neither determine nor reformulate a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see, </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 8, at 10 [2d ed]), irrespective of their cooperative attitude at a given point on a given strategy. To so hold would encourage forum shopping and redundant or competing estate entanglements to the detriment of all parties and the various forums themselves. The more commonly exercised purpose of ancillary jurisdiction is to protect creditors, not to launch worldwide asset expeditions out of New York to foreign outposts <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1609; <em>Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 319, supra; <em>see also, </em>Turano and Radigan, New York Estate Administration, at 510-511; 3 Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogates\u2019 Courts \u00a7 47.01 [1], [3], at 47-5, 47-7 [6th ed rev]; Powers, <em>Foreign Estates, </em>34 Brook L Rev 442, 447).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Analogous provisions of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act also support our conclusion that the authority of the Surrogate\u2019s Court over a nondomiciliary\u2019s estate in an ancillary proceeding is generally limited to estate assets within New York <em>(see, e.g., </em>SCPA 210 [2] [a]; Siegel and Connors, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 203, at 120 [\u201cSCPA 206 * * * confers jurisdiction on the surrogate\u2019s court of any county in the state to handle administration <em>of the property located in the state\u201d] </em>[emphasis added]; <em>see also, </em>SCPA 1610; Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1610, at 613).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The provisions pertaining to discovery proceedings add persuasive instruction. SCPA 2103 limits access of a fiduciary in discovery petitions to \u201cthe court which has jurisdiction over the estate\u201d (SCPA 2103 [1]). Ordinarily, therefore, ancillary administrators should not be able to avail themselves of its benefits because their authority is circumscribed by their assistive role. Our rationale, it should-be emphasized, is rooted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>this particular discovery exertion, where the original domiciliary jurisdiction of this estate is lodged in <em>Mexico, </em>and the asset sought to be snagged is in the <em>Cayman Islands, </em>after having been transferred from a <em>London </em>account.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The weight of authority, moreover, supports this demonstrably and intuitively reasonable limitation of subject matter jurisdiction in ancillary proceedings to property within the State <em>(see, Lockwood v United States Steel Corp., </em>153 App Div 655, 660, <em>supra; see also, Wedemann v United States Trust Co., </em>258 NY 315, 319, <em>supra; Matter of Rogers, 225 </em>App Div 286, 289, <em>supra </em>[\u201ca proceeding for ancillary administration is directed against assets within the StateQ * * * (s)o in the case of ancillary administration the decree can have no effect except as it may be satisfied by property within the reach of the process of our courts\u201d], <em>affd </em>254 NY 592, <em>supra; Steele v Connecticut Gen.

That generality misses the import of the <em>Lockwood </em>discussion that \u201can ancillary executor or administrator has the same general powers as a domestic executor or administrator\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 380). The Court added that it did \u201cnot perceive that it makes any essential difference in this case whether the letters of the plaintiff executor are ancillary or domiciliary\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 380). Thus, for our analytical and precedential purposes, this apparently expansive language does not support Stern\u2019s sweeping application here, nor the far-reaching premises that the dissent would ascribe to it <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 609).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Our conclusion, within the factual context presented in this case, does not threaten or undermine the holding or the quoted language from <em>Lockwood. </em>Indeed, we are faithful to the still valid statement at the Appellate Division level that \u201c[s]trictly speaking, an executor or administrator, whether domiciliary or ancillary, has as [a] matter of right no extraterritorial authority\u201d <em>(Lockwood v United States Steel Corp., </em>153 App Div 655, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>659, <em>supra). </em>Irrespective of less pertinent, general language in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lockwood, </em>the Appellate Division\u2019s articulation in this respect remains undisturbed, despite the reversal on other grounds. It is persuasive, as applied here, that \u201cthe authority of an ancillary executor is quite different\u201d from a domiciliary executor or administrator; its further explanation remains cogent that \u201c[t]he jurisdiction to appoint [an ancillary administrator] rests upon the fact that the actual <em>situs </em>of the testator\u2019s personal estate is within the State * * * <em>and it is only over such property that the court issuing the letters has assumed jurisdiction\u201d (id., </em>at 660 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Thus, although this Court concluded that \u201c[a]ncillary letters are not less in their effect than other letters\u201d as to jurisdiction-ally affected assets and matters, they also are more confined and not self-defining beyond the ancillary borders <em>(Lockwood v United States Steel Corp., </em>209 NY 375, 380, supra; <em>see, </em>EPTL 11-1.1 [b] [enumerating fiduciaries\u2019 powers]; SCPA 1610; <em>see also, </em>Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1610, at 613 [\u201cancillary fiduciary\u2019s job is to marshal the assets, pay any New York claims and taxes, and deliver any remaining assets to the fiduciary in the decedent\u2019s domicile\u201d]). In sum, the obiter dictum of <em>Lockwood </em>should not be transformed, as appellant Stern and the dissent would do <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 609), to enlarge ancillary powers \u2014 \u201cderivative\u201d and \u201ccomplementary\u201d in nature \u2014 to a window on the world, equal to or greater than the predicate domiciliary proceeding may enjoy over assets wherever located. Neither statutory interpretation, nor policy reasons, nor practical application of governing principles would support the exercise of such centrifugal power by New York in such circumstances. We reach this conclusion without even considering any potential constitutional concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Our result \u2014 premised on these assembled authorities and on the cogent practical analysis we have tendered and that in the opinion by Justice Nardelli at the Appellate Division \u2014 is ultimately more consistent with the essential, underlying function of ancillary proceedings: to obtain control and possession of New York assets of a nondomiciliary, to satisfy New York creditors, and to transfer remaining assets to the domiciliary administrator <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1609; <em>see also, </em>Turano and Radigan, New York Estate Administration, at 510-511; 3 Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogates\u2019 Courts \u00a7 47.01 [1], [3] [6th ed rev]; Powers, <em>Foreign Estates, </em>34 Brook L Rev 442, 447). To venture beyond the backup role and border in this case is demonstrably unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AQl\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. In my view, the New York Constitution\u2019s grant of broad, plenary powers to the Surrogate\u2019s Court \u201cover <em>all actions and proceedings relating </em>to the affairs of decedents, probate of wills, administration of estates\u201d is amply sufficient to justify the exercise of jurisdiction in this discovery and turnover proceeding (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 12 [d] [emphasis supplied]). There is nothing in the language of the pertinent provisions of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act or our precedents to justify circumscribing that expansive grant of power in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The SCPA consistently has been interpreted as extending jurisdiction to the full breadth of that constitutional authority <em>(see, </em>Siegel and Conners, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 201-202, at 49, 113-117). Indeed, the language of SCPA 201 could not be more broad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201cThe court shall continue to exercise <em>full </em>and <em>complete general jurisdiction </em>in law and in equity to administer justice in <em>all </em>matters relating to estates and the affairs of decedents, and upon the return of any process to try and determine <em>all </em>questions, legal or equitable, arising between <em>any or all </em>of the parties to any action or proceeding, or between any party and any other person having any claim or interest therein, over whom jurisdiction has been obtained as to <em>any and all </em>matters necessary to be determined in order to make a full, equitable and complete disposition of the matter by such order or decree as justice requires\u201d (SCPA 201 [3] [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">With respect to subject matter jurisdiction, the statutory grant of authority vis-a-vis the estate of a domiciliary and the estate of a nondomiciliary are indistinguishable. SCPA 205 states \u201c[t]he surrogate\u2019s court of any county has <em>jurisdiction over the estate of a decedent </em>who was a domiciliary of the state\u201d (SCPA 205 [1] [emphasis supplied]). SCPA 206 similarly provides, \u201c[t]he surrogate\u2019s court of any county has <em>jurisdiction over the estate of any non-domiciliary decedent </em>who leaves property in the state\u201d (SCPA 206 [1] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Although the role of an ancillary fiduciary in New York State often is restricted to administering those assets within the State, this limitation does not appear to stem from a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction, but because Surrogates, based on principles of comity and practicality, exercise their discretion to decide the appropriate scope of the ancillary proceeding <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1607 [1] [upon required papers, \u201cthe court <em>may </em>issue ancillary letters of administration\u201d] [emphasis supplied]; SCPA 1610 [3] [ancillary administrator confined to limited powers but court may direct fiduciary to \u201cotherwise dispose of the assets as justice requires\u201d]; Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 1610, at 613 [role of the ancillary administrator extremely limited \u201cunless the court orders otherwise\u201d]; <em>Matter of Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d 337, 342 [rule of comity \u201ctruly is one of <em>ad hoc </em>discretion, to be exercised by the Surrogate\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Court today nevertheless holds that a Surrogate presiding over an ancillary proceeding would be acting entirely beyond its jurisdiction in ordering those with information pertaining to estate assets, who are also subject to personal jurisdiction in this State, to submit to discovery or to turn over assets located outside of New York. This conclusion is supported by the proposition that New York, in making a determination affecting rights in property located outside of the State in this ancillary proceeding, would be usurping the role of the State where the decedent was domiciled <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 593).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We do not know, however, from the record in this proceeding that the domiciliary fiduciary could act either in the domicile, or in the context of an ancillary administration in the Cayman Islands, to obtain personal jurisdiction over both respondents, or whether the relief sought here is available in those jurisdictions. Appellant Stern was appointed ancillary administrator upon the petition and expressly at the request of the domiciliary fiduciary. In his affidavit in support of the application for ancillary papers, appellant clearly stated that the purpose of commencing a proceeding in New York was \u201cto enable [them] to conduct discovery proceedings in order to trace in excess of $1,200,000.00 that has been purportedly transferred to a trust in the Cayman Islands.\u201d It is, thus, at least inferable that the domiciliary executor applied to Surrogate\u2019s Court to have the New York fiduciary appointed because he was unable to get full and adequate adjudication of the issues and relief as against all parties in any other jurisdiction. Thus, foreclosing this avenue would be inconsistent with \u201cthe inherently supplementary purpose of ancillary proceedings\u201d (majority opn, at 600) because it could effectively bar the ancillary fiduciary from accomplishing here what the domiciliary fiduciary is unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>accomplish in the domiciliary jurisdiction or, indeed, anywhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The rule that the majority adopts today will leave New York\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Courts powerless to act not only in this case but in future cases, even when all principles of practicality, equity and convenience dictate otherwise. Subject matter jurisdiction is not something that can ebb and flow on a case-by-case basis but limits absolutely the power of the court itself, taking away all discretion to act in a particular circumstance <em>(see, Matter of Rougeron, </em>17 NY2d 264, 271, <em>cert denied sub nom. Rougeron v Rougeron, </em>385 US 899; <em>People v Sturtevant, </em>9 NY 263, 269; <em>see also, </em>25 Carmody-Wait 2d, NY Prac \u00a7 149:92, at 83).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">There can be no dispute that, when entertaining a proceeding relating to the estate of a domiciliary, the subject matter jurisdiction of Surrogate\u2019s Court is exceedingly broad, and extends to adjudging issues concerning property and persons beyond the State\u2019s borders <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 596-597; <em>see also, </em>SCPA 209 [4] [power \u201c(t)o determine a decedent\u2019s interest in any property claimed to constitute a part of his gross estate * * * and to determine the rights of any persons claiming an interest therein\u201d part of the \u201c(p)owers incidental to jurisdiction of the court\u201d]; SCPA 2103). As the SCPA provisions quoted earlier demonstrate, the statutory grants of jurisdiction make no distinction whatsoever between the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction when it entertains an ancillary proceeding and when it entertains a domiciliary probate or administration. In both instances, the SCPA grants the Surrogate\u2019s Court \u201cjurisdiction over the estate\u201d of the decedent provided one of two, necessary jurisdictional facts are asserted: New York was the decedent\u2019s domicile (SCPA 205) or the decedent left property witbin the State (SCPA 206). Nothing in section 206 distinguishes the \u201ctype\u201d of subject matter jurisdiction conferred by that section from that conferred by SCPA 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The majority relies on the 1984 revision of the SCPA provisions governing the venue and jurisdiction of Surrogate\u2019s Court for the proposition that the Surrogates\u2019 jurisdiction is not extraterritorial when a nondomiciliary\u2019s estate is involved <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 597). These revisions were made, in part, in response to Surrogate Bennett\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Coletti </em>(91 Misc 2d 7), where he criticized the strict rule that afforded jurisdiction over a domiciliary\u2019s estate only to the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the county where the decedent was domiciled <em>(id., </em>at 11). Thus, the revisions were made to \u201cchange the[] provisions so that jurisdiction over the estates of <em>domiciliary and non-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>domiciliary </em>decedents * * * is statewide\u201d (Mem of NY Law Rev Commn, 1984 NY Legis Ann, at 87 [emphasis supplied]). The amendments do not distinguish between jurisdiction over a domiciliary\u2019s estate and over the estate of a nondomiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Even more instructional in this regard is the language of SCPA 206 prior to the 1984 amendments. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201cThe surrogate\u2019s court of each county <em>has jurisdiction </em>exclusive of every other surrogate\u2019s court <em>over the estate </em>of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c1. any domiciliary of the county * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201c2. any non-domiciliary of the state who</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201c(a) left property within that county\u201d (SCPA former 206, added by L 1966, ch 953 [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Thus, the same jurisdictional grant applied to both domiciliary and nondomiciliary estates. There is nothing in the legislative history of the 1984 amendments that suggests that the Legislature intended to change the scope of subject matter jurisdiction when a nondomiciliary decedent is involved (see, Mem of Trusts and Estates Law Section, Comm on Legislation, NY St Bar Assn, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 128, at 43 [\u201cThis bill would confer state wide jurisdiction on the surrogate\u2019s courts, in a manner similar to the Supreme Court\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">It is even more difficult to ascertain any distinction between the Surrogate\u2019s Court subject matter jurisdiction when it exercises original probate or administration over the estate of a nondomiciliary <em>(see, </em>SCPA 1605, 1607) and when it entertains a proceeding ancillary to a domiciliary proceeding in another State, such as the one at issue. When exercising original jurisdiction over the estate of a nondomiciliary, the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction clearly is not limited to intrastate property alone. When a Surrogate\u2019s Court authenticates and interprets a will, for example, it necessarily makes a determination that impacts all of the property within a decedent\u2019s estate, no matter where located. The court possesses full authority to adjudicate worldwide rights respecting the entire estate of the decedent and of all claims by any party over whom it has obtained personal jurisdiction <em>(see, </em>SCPA 209 [4]). Yet, just as in a \u201ctruly\u201d ancillary proceeding, the subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tion of original probate or administration is premised on, and delineated by, precisely the same statute \u2014 SCPA 206.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The majority draws a line between ancillary proceedings and nondomiciliary original proceedings, asserting that \u201cthe subject matter jurisdiction of New York\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Courts is necessarily more embracive when it is the predominant tribunal for administering and preserving estate rights and assets\u201d (majority opn, at 598). Although a Surrogate undoubtedly will be guided by different considerations when entertaining an ancillary proceeding than when exercising original jurisdiction, the nature of the proceeding does not divest the court of its jurisdiction. In an ancillary proceeding, a Surrogate should afford due respect to the primary proceeding in the decedent\u2019s domicile, but the court\u2019s power to act is limited by comity and discretion, not jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The cases cited by the majority for the opposite proposition are not to the contrary <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 598). For example, <em>Wedemann v United States Trust Co. </em>(258 NY 315) does not address the subject matter jurisdiction of Surrogate\u2019s Court but rather, the discretion that a Surrogate has in deciding the scope of an ancillary proceeding administration. There, the Court stated, \u201cwhether our courts will decree distribution of the assets collected under the ancillary administration or remit them to the jurisdiction of the domicile is not a question of jurisdiction but of judicial discretion depending upon the circumstances of the particular case\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 320). The majority also quotes the following language from <em>Matter of Turton </em>(8 NY2d 311): \u201crecognition [must] be given to the fact that there is but one estate and that primary probate or administration proceedings should be undertaken by the appropriate court of the decedent\u2019s domicile, all other proceedings being ancillary\u201d (majority opn, at 598 [quoting <em>Matter of Turton, </em>8 NY2d 311, 315, <em>rearg denied </em>9 NY2d 759]). The quoted language, however, omits the beginning of the <em>Turton </em>Court\u2019s sentence which states: \u201cInvoking <em>the rule that comity </em>among free nations has long required that * * * recognition be given\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>[emphasis supplied]). Thus, any restriction on the Surrogate\u2019s powers contemplated in <em>Turton </em>appears to stem from principles of comity, rather than from a limitation on subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see also, Matter of Heller-Baghero, </em>26 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 343-345 [principles of comity guide Surrogate\u2019s discretion in deciding whether to exercise original jurisdiction]; 3 BoweParker, Page on Wills \u00a7 26.15, at 49 [rev ed] [\u201cJudicial jurisdiction depends upon the recognition given to the judicial orders, decrees, and the like of one state by other states\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lockwood v United States Steel Corp. </em>(209 NY 375) further supports the conclusion that the Surrogate\u2019s Court\u2019s jurisdiction does not change when it entertains an ancillary proceeding. The majority relies on the lower court decision in <em>Lockwood, </em>which adopted precisely the argument advanced by respondents here, i.e., that the authority of an ancillary administrator \u201cis strictly limited to personal property within the jurisdiction of the court\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 379; <em>see also, </em>majority opn, at 602-603). Examining that very rationale, this Court stated in <em>Lockwood:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201c[A]n ancillary executor or administrator has the same general powers as a domestic executor or administrator except in disposing of the decedent\u2019s real property for the payment of his debts and funeral expenses. * * * Ancillary letters are not less in their effect than other letters. \u2018Apart from the statute, all administrations of estates in different countries are independent, so far as a matter of strict right or jurisdiction; but as a matter of comity all administrations in countries other than that of the domicile are ancillary to the principal administration\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 380 [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Thus, the Court has previously considered, and rejected, analysis akin to that embraced by the majority today <em>(see also, Matter of Re v Truck-A-Tune, Inc., </em>191 AD2d 327 [an ancillary administrator can direct a nondomiciliary to turn over automobile located in another State]).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Additionally, where an attempt was made to use some insignificant item of property located in the State to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign cause of action, this Court has rejected such efforts based on principles other than subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see, Hoes v New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R. Co., </em>173 NY 435, 442 [invoking principles of fraud]; <em>see also, Matter of Boda, </em>124 Misc 2d 464, 465-466 [finding an insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>jurisdictional predicate based on temporary presence of any property]).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Thus, there is scant judicial authority interpreting the SCPA\u2019s plenary grant of subject matter \u201cjurisdiction over the estate\u201d to be absolutely restricted to property in the State upon the issuance of ancillary letters. This view is reinforced in the statutory treatment of the very proceeding at issue here, where SCPA authorizes extraterritorial discovery in \u201cthe court which has jurisdiction over the estate\u201d \u2014 the subject matter jurisdiction expressly granted under SCPA 206 (SCPA 2103 [1]). The majority\u2019s dictum that SCPA 2103\u2019s discovery proceedings are not intended to apply, in general, to ancillary proceedings may have unintended regrettable implications <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 601). Certainly it was not the purpose of the Legislature to restrict an ancillary administrator from utilizing this provision. Indeed, a common use of ancillary proceedings is to pursue a cause of action in the New York courts on behalf of nondomiciliary \u2014 a proceeding that clearly requires the use of, and is contemplated by, SCPA 2103 <em>(see, </em>SCPA 2103 [2]). The majority\u2019s attempt to limit its holding to \u201cthis particular discovery exertion\u201d (majority opn, at 602) only cuts against its own assertion that \u201c[o]rdinarily * * * ancillary administrators should not be able to avail themselves of [SCPA 2103\u2019s] benefits\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 601).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In view of the foregoing, I conclude that the power of the Surrogate\u2019s Courts to render decisions concerning foreign property is restricted by prudent discretion and principles of comity, not by any arbitrary limitation on its subject matter jurisdiction. Applying that reasoning here, any conflict with the domiciliary jurisdiction is largely obviated by the fact that the ancillary administrator is acting at the request of the domiciliary administrator. However, because the Appellate Division did not reach respondents\u2019 alternative contention that the proceeding should be dismissed under a forum non conveniens analysis, I would remit this matter to the lower court for consideration of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick and Wesley concur with Judge Bellacosa; Judge Levine dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Titone concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> The majority attempts to minimize the importance of section 206 by pointing out that it does not expressly refer to ancillary proceedings (see, majority opn, at 597-598). But SCPA 206 is actually the exclusive statutory avenue for obtaining jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary\u2019s estate, regardless of whether the proceeding is ancillary or original. Thus, from the standpoint of statutory subject matter jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, the distinction between original and ancillary proceedings under section 206, which the majority claims we have \u201cpointedly overlooked,\u201d is actually nonexistent <em>(id., </em>at 598).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
