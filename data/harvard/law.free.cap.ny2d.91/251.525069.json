Petitioner\u2019s misconduct is established, in that he (1) wrote a vulgar note about a female law intern\u2019s breasts and twice suggested that she remove an article of her clothing, (2) knowingly made false statements to the Governor\u2019s Judicial Screening Committee and the State Senate Judiciary Committee, and (3) testified falsely as to the foregoing. <em>(Matter of Shilling, </em>51 NY2d 397.)

Petitioner argues that the Commission essentially \"misused lack of candor charges\u201d because there is no \"contrary objective proof\u2019 that petitioner lied <em>(see, Matter of Kiley, </em>74 NY2d 364, 370-371) and that although he made \"serious mistakes,\u201d his conduct merely reflects poor judgment and does not warrant the extreme sanction of removal <em>(see, id,.). </em>Having conducted a plenary review of the record (Judiciary Law \u00a7 44 [9]), we conclude that the Commission\u2019s determination is supported by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(see, Matter of Mogil, </em>88 NY2d 749, 752), and that the sanction of removal is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The investigation of petitioner\u2019s conduct was triggered by a complaint stemming from a note he passed to his court attorney, allegedly concerning the physical attributes of a female law intern, and that petitioner suggested, albeit in jest, to the same intern that she remove part of her apparel in his presence. Although petitioner denied, under oath, making such remarks and gave a different explanation for writing the note, the Referee and the Commission rejected his testimony. Based upon our independent review of the record and giving due deference to the credibility determinations of the Referee and the Commission <em>(see, Matter of Sims, </em>61 NY2d 349, 353, <em>rearg denied </em>62 NY2d 884), we find no reason to disturb their findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Here, petitioner\u2019s ribald note and indelicate suggestion, even if made in jest, are, without question, demeaning, entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>inappropriate and deserving of some sanction. Although we agree with the Commission that these isolated occurrences, standing alone, would not be sufficient to justify removal, petitioner\u2019s misconduct is magnified here by a pattern of evasive, deceitful and outright untruthful behavior, evidencing a lack of fitness to hold judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The most egregious instances of such misconduct occurred in connection with petitioner\u2019s attempt to conceal the Commission\u2019s pending investigation of the initial complaint while seeking an interim appointment to a vacancy on Supreme Court in the Twelfth Judicial District. First, in the course of completing a questionnaire for the Governor\u2019s Judicial Screening Committee, petitioner encountered the question: \"Have you ever been the subject of any inquiry or investigation by a federal, state or local agency (other than for routine background investigations for employment purposes)?\u201d Petitioner responded \"no,\u201d despite the fact that he unquestionably was aware of the pending investigation, having testified before the Commission only two months prior. Petitioner signed the questionnaire and certified that \"to the best of my knowledge the information I have supplied is complete, true and accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Petitioner attempted to explain away this falsehood, asserting that he believed the question referred only to criminal investigations. His explanation, however, was rejected by the Referee and the Commission in light of the clear language contained in the questionnaire. After reviewing the record and the questionnaire itself, we agree with the Commission that petitioner\u2019s explanation was, at the very least, disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Then, in May of 1995, petitioner was nominated by Governor Pataki to fill the Supreme Court vacancy and his name was submitted to the State Senate for confirmation. In accordance with the requirements of Judiciary Law \u00a7 45 (2), petitioner was asked to execute and promptly return to the Senate Judiciary Committee a waiver of his right to confidentiality as to any Judicial Conduct Commission records pertaining to him. Petitioner delayed returning the waiver until the day before his scheduled confirmation hearing despite repeated efforts by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s staff counsel to contact petitioner and procure the waiver. Petitioner asserted that the delay was attributable to his own second thoughts about accepting his pending elevation to Supreme Court. In light of petitioner\u2019s otherwise active pursuit of the appointment, both the Referee and the Commission rejected petitioner\u2019s explanation, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Significantly, during this period of delay, petitioner was asked directly by staff counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee whether he was the subject of any complaints before the Commission. He responded, unequivocally, in the negative. When confronted with these facts, he denied, under oath, that this conversation occurred. The Referee and the Commission credited the testimony of staff counsel over that of petitioner. Based upon our review of the record, we find no reason to disturb this credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Thus, we conclude that petitioner made false statements to the Commission and gave deceitful, and even dishonest, responses to the Governor\u2019s Screening Committee and to the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee. By no means can this pattern of behavior be explained as a \"mere lack of recall\u201d or described as \"poor judgment\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Kiley, </em>74 NY2d, at 369-370, <em>supra). </em>A further aggravating factor was that petitioner was motivated by his own personal gain to dissimulate in this manner <em>(cf., Matter of Skinner, </em>91 NY2d 142; <em>Matter of Kiley, supra, </em>at 370).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Although the sanction of removal is reserved for those instances where the conduct is \"truly egregious\u201d and not merely an exercise of poor judgment <em>(see, Matter of Mazzei, </em>81 NY2d 568, 572; <em>Matter of Kiley, supra, </em>74 NY2d, at 369-370), we have recognized that the \"truly egregious\u201d standard is measured with due regard to the fact that Judges must be held to a higher standard of conduct than the public at large <em>(see, Matter of Mazzei, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Aldrich v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>58 NY2d 279, 283). Particularly relevant here is our conviction that \"deception is antithetical to the role of a Judge who is sworn to uphold the law and seek the truth\u201d <em>(Matter of Myers, </em>67 NY2d 550, 554; <em>see, Matter of Cohen, </em>74 NY2d 272, 278). Thus, we conclude that the Commission appropriately imposed the sanction of removal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Accordingly, the determined sanction should be accepted, without costs, and petitioner should be removed from his office of Judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York and Acting Justice of Supreme Court, First Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur in Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Determined sanction accepted, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
