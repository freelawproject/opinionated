We are asked to provide an authoritative statement on the threshold question of whether an oral personal services contract between a fight trainer and a boxer to last \u201cfor as long as the boxer fights professionally\u201d provides a definite legally cognizable duration. Conversely, the problem can be framed as whether this temporal description constitutes an employment for an indefinite period, within the strictures of New York\u2019s at-will employment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The Federal lawsuit is for an alleged breach of an oral agreement essentially between plaintiff, Kevin Rooney, and defendant, Michael Gerard Tyson. Rooney was to receive 10% of Tyson\u2019s boxing earnings as compensation for his personal training services. The case was tried in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of New York; a jury rendered a $4,415,651 verdict for Rooney. The Trial Judge granted Tyson\u2019s posttrial motion for judgment as a matter of law; the verdict was set aside and the lawsuit dismissed. Rooney appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. It certified the question to this Court in order to decide its appeal in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>governing New York substantive law. We narrowly answer the core question as posed, that this durational clause satisfies New York\u2019s standard with sufficient definitiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The undisputed facts are taken from the trial evidence and the certified statement. In 1980, at 14 years of age, Tyson was placed under the supervision of Cus D\u2019Amato, a renowned boxing figure and manager. When Tyson\u2019s mother died in 1983, D\u2019Amato also became his legal guardian. At the beginning of the young man\u2019s boxing career, Rooney and D\u2019Amato agreed that Rooney would train Tyson without compensation until the fighter became a professional athlete. The two further agreed that when Tyson advanced to professional ranks, Rooney would be Tyson\u2019s trainer \u201cfor as long as [Tyson] fought professionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Rooney trained Tyson for 28 months without compensation. In March 1985, Tyson turned professional and began enjoying meteoric success. D\u2019Amato died that same year. James Jacobs became Tyson\u2019s manager in 1986. When rumors started in some sports media that Rooney would be replaced as Tyson\u2019s trainer, Rooney queried Jacobs. To quell the speculation, Tyson allegedly authorized Jacobs to state publicly that \u201cKevin Rooney will be Mike Tyson\u2019s trainer as long as Mike Tyson is a professional fighter.\u201d Jacobs sent Rooney a copy of a press release to that effect. Thereafter, Rooney continued to train Tyson and was compensated for each of Tyson\u2019s professional fights until 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In 1988, apparently in connection with Rooney\u2019s alleged comments regarding Tyson\u2019s divorce and other business-related litigation, Rooney allegedly read a newspaper article stating that Tyson would no longer train with Rooney. Tyson formally terminated his boxer-trainer relationship with Rooney later that year. The Federal lawsuit, claiming breach of the 1982 oral agreement, was begun in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The jury in Federal court in Albany returned its verdict in favor of Rooney in 1996. Tyson countered after the trial that the agreement was for an indefinite duration and was terminable at will under New York law and therefore unenforceable as a matter of law, regardless of the jury\u2019s verdict. The District Trial Court agreed with Tyson\u2019s legal position and granted him the posttrial victory. The Trial Judge reasoned that \u201cunder New York law, terms such as \u2018permanent employment\u2019, \u2018until retirement\u2019 or \u2018long term\u2019 do not state a definite term of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ment as a matter of law\u201d (956 F Supp 213, 216). The court concluded that \u201cthe alleged term of the employment contract, \u2018for as long as Tyson boxes professionally,\u2019 does not state a term of definite duration as a matter of law\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 216). It finally declared that \u201cthe nature of the proof offered at trial cannot sustain a finding that the employment relationship was anything other than one at-will\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 216).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On Rooney\u2019s appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals certified the question to this Court (127 F3d 295, 298) pursuant to this State\u2019s Constitution and this Court\u2019s Rules of Practice (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 3 [b] [9]; 22 NYCRR 500.17). The focus and role of this Court are confined by the precise and narrow question certified under the collaborative juridical arrangement. No plenary adjudicative authority is authorized or contemplated because the matter is not a case or controversy, as. such, in the State court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In New York, <em>\u201c[ajbsent an agreement establishing a fixed duration, </em>an employment relationship is presumed to be a hiring at will, terminable at any time by either party\u201d <em>(Matter of De Petris v Union Settlement Assn., </em>86 NY2d 406, 410 [emphasis added]; <em>see, Matter of Hanchard v Facilities Dev. Corp., </em>85 NY2d 638, 641; <em>Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 300). The at-will presumption may be triggered when an employment agreement fails to state a \u201cdefinite period of employment,\u201d \u201cfix[ ] employment of a definite duration,\u201d \u201cestablish [ ] a fixed duration\u201d or is otherwise \u201cindefinite\u201d <em>(compare, Ingle v Glamore Motor Sales, </em>73 NY2d 183, 186, 188; <em>Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 333; <em>Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 300, 305, supra; <em>Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 460, 465-466; <em>Martin v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>148 NY 117).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">A sensible path to declare New York law starts with these two steps: (1) if the duration is definite, the at-will doctrine is inapplicable, on the other hand, (2) if the employment term is indefinite or undefined, the rebuttable at-will presumption is operative and other factors come into the equation <em>(see, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 466, <em>supra; see also, Martin v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>148 NY 117, 121, <em>supra; Ingle v Glamore Motor Sales, </em>73 NY2d 183, 186, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Initial consideration of the at-will presumption, as the threshold pivot to answer the certified question, bypasses the logical prerequisite and precedential preference to search out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>and resolve the definiteness aspect first <em>(see, Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 333, <em>supra; Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 301, <em>supra). </em>That is a major difference of approach between the majority and the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Our ample previous precedents have not categorically delineated what may differentiate a \u201cdefinite,\u201d \u201cindefinite,\u201d or \u201cfixed\u201d employment term or duration utilized in various contractual formulations. That ellipsis prompted the certification to us from our Federal court counterpart with respect to this case and appeal in its court. The guidance we advisorily tender should be dispositive of the precise law query as transmitted to us <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 500.17 [a]; <em>Retail Software Servs. v Lashlee, </em>71 NY2d 788, 790; Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 65, at 393-394 [3d ed]). Everything else \u2014 including especially the relevant application and actual decision of the case \u2014 is, of course, within the exclusive juridical competence of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Notably, this Court has consistently reaffirmed the threshold determination that a definite employment duration does not implicate the at-will employment presumption <em>(see, Matter of De Petris v Union Settlement Assn., </em>86 NY2d 406, 410, <em>supra; Wieder v Skala, </em>80 NY2d 628, 633; <em>Ingle v Glamore Motor Sales, </em>73 NY2d 183, 186, <em>supra; Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 333, <em>supra; Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 300, <em>supra; Parker v Borock, </em>5 NY2d 156, 159; <em>Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., </em>249 NY 439, 443-444; <em>Martin v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>148 NY 117, 121, <em>supra). </em>This is not simply a chicken-or-egg-which-comes-first puzzle; it is the sensible, analytical progression.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">When an agreement is silent as to duration, however, it is presumptively at-will, absent an express or implied limitation on an employer\u2019s otherwise unfettered ability to discharge an employee <em>(see, Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 336, <em>supra; O\u2019Connor v Eastman Kodak Co., </em>65 NY2d 724, 725; <em>Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 305, <em>supra; Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 465-466, <em>supra). </em>Only when we discern no term of some definiteness or no express limitation does the analysis switch over to the rebuttable presumption line of cases. They embody the principle that an employment relationship is terminable upon even the whim of either the employer or the employee. The agreement in this case is not silent and manifestly provides a sufficiently limiting framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>This Court, for example, found indefinite such temporally amorphous terms as \u201cpermanent\u201d <em>(Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., </em>249 NY 439, 443-444, <em>supra), </em>to \u201ccontinue indefinitely and will follow [the employee] in each succeeding year\u201d <em>(Gressing v Musical Instrument Sales Co., </em>222 NY 215, 218), to \u201cdevote [the employee\u2019s] whole time and attention\u201d to the employer\u2019s business <em>(Watson v Gugino, </em>204 NY 535, 537), and yearly employment for a specified annual salary <em>(Martin v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>148 NY 117, 119-121, <em>supra). </em>Moreover, we have distinguished employment \u201cfor life or a definite period\u201d from those varying terms <em>(Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., </em>249 NY 439, 444, supra; <em>see, </em>1 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 4.2, at 560-561 [rev ed 1993]). None of the unenforceable porous phrasings is delimited by legally and realistically cognizable boundaries, as are found in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">For context, moreover, this Court adopted the at-will presumption doctrine in <em>Martin v New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(148 NY 117, <em>supra; see, Watson v Gugino, </em>204 NY 535, 541, <em>supra; Gressing v Musical Instrument Sales Co., </em>222 NY 215, 218-221, <em>supra; see also, </em>Feliu, Primer on Individual Employee Rights, at 3). There, a general hiring was found to result from an employment agreement that was \u201cyearly\u201d or \u201cby the year\u201d <em>(Martin v New York Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>148 NY, at 119-120). Because those terms were deemed too indefinite, the at-will rubric took precedence. In reinforcing the still prevailing at-will doctrine, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201c \u2018In England it is held that a general hiring, <em>or a hiring by the terms of which no time is fixed, </em>is a hiring by the year * * * With us, the rule is inflexible, that <em>a general or indefinite hiring is prima facie a hiring at will; </em>and if the servant seeks to make it out a yearly hiring, the burden is upon him to establish it by proof. A <em>hiring at so much a day, week, month or year, no time being specified, is an indefinite hiring, and no presumption attaches that it was for a day even, but only at the rate fixed for whatever time the party may serve. </em>* * * A contract to pay one $2,500 a year for services is not a contract for a year, but a contract to pay at the rate of $2,500 a year for services actually rendered, and is determinable at will by either party. * * * [I]n all such cases the contract may be put an end to by either party at any time, <em>unless the time is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>fixed!\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 121, quoting Wood, Master and Servant \u00a7 136 [2d ed 1886] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Distinctions crop up even in cases where a limitation exists on an employer\u2019s right to discharge an otherwise at-will employee <em>(see, Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, <em>supra; see also, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 460, <em>supra; Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, <em>supra). </em>Though an employment contract is of indefinite duration, an express or implied limitation on an employer\u2019s right to discharge may still become operative <em>(see, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 465, 467, <em>supra). </em>Most pertinently, this Court has emphasized also that \u201c \u2018if the employer made a promise, either express or implied, not only to pay for the service <em>but also that the employment should continue for a period of time that is either definite or capable of being determined, </em>that employment is not terminable * * * \u201cat will\u201d after the employee has begun or rendered some of the requested service or has given any other consideration\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 465, quoting 1A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 152, at 14 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">New York\u2019s jurisprudence is supple and realistic, and surely not so rigid as to require that a definite duration can be found only in a determinable calendar date. Thus, although the exact end-date of Tyson\u2019s professional boxing career was not precisely calculable, the boundaries of beginning and end of the employment period are sufficiently ascertainable. That is enough to defeat a matter-of-law decision by a Judge, in substitution for resolution at the Federal trial by jury verdict. Under the employment agreement, the durational term was understandable to the parties and reasonably determinable by the fact finders. Moreover, Rooney\u2019s compensation under the contract\u2014 for the legal consideration he bound himself to and rendered for years without payment prior to Tyson \u201cturning pro\u201d \u2014 was expressly linked to a percentage of Tyson\u2019s earnings within the professional career measuring rod <em>(see, </em>1A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 152, at 14 [1963]).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The range of the employment relationship, concededly created and actualized for several years in the framework of this Federal dispute, is established by the definable commencement and conclusion of Tyson\u2019s professional boxing career. Though the times are not precisely predictable and calculable to dates certain, they are legally and experientially limited and ascertainable by objective benchmarks. That is what makes this case distinctive within the myriad of arrangements people may undertake.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>It is imperative, too, that we emphasize that the aspect of New York\u2019s jurisprudence that we propound today in no way alters the force and effectiveness of general long-standing principles relating to commercial agreements, otherwise governed by common-law or statutory standards <em>(compare, North Shore Bottling Co. v Schmidt &amp; Sons, </em>22 NY2d 171, 175; <em>Cammack v Slattery &amp; Bro., </em>241 NY 39, 44-45; <em>Ehrenworth v Stuhmer &amp; Co., </em>229 NY 210; <em>Jugla v Trouttet, </em>120 NY 21, 28-29; <em>with Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 335, <em>supra; Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 304-305, <em>supra; Haines v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 769, 772-773; <em>see also, </em>UCC 2-309 [2]). The dissent ironically faults the majority repeatedly for such things as \u201cheralds\u201d some \u201cnew era\u201d in \u201coral promises of potentially long-term employment\u201d <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 694). Nothing could be further from the fact. The oral nature of this agreement, unassailably made, is not even in issue since that was conceded out of the case by the parties. Only the definiteness is controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Moreover, we deem it necessary to comment briefly also on the extent of the dissent in relation to the precisely posed certified question. The phrasing in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 request is instructive: \u201cin certifying a question of the validity of the particular contractual relationship before us, we are not asking the New York Court of Appeals to interpret a contract or to decide a case * * * but rather to elucidate a series of open and recurring questions of New York law\u201d (127 F3d 295, 297, <em>supra). </em>The preliminary and dispositive question, as we are bound to and have also emphasized, turns on definiteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">That Court\u2019s question is whether the contract between this fight trainer and this professional boxer to train the boxer \u201cfor as long as the boxer fights professionally\u201d may support a definite duration finding. This Court\u2019s response by our majority expression not only answers the question but also adheres to the realistic plenitude of New York\u2019s jurisprudence in this area of the law, and we are well aware of the personal and commercial consequences of the myriad types of arrangements made between parties to these transactions. We are also mindful of the scale of this Court\u2019s role, in constitutionally participating with the Federal court in its exclusive jurisdictional application and adjudication of substantive principles of New York State law is formally and appropriately limited <em>(see, </em>NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 3 [b] [9]; 22 NYCRR 500.17; <em>see also, </em>Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 65, at 393-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>396 [3d ed]). The majority\u2019s authoritative response is measured out in proportion to these operative principles and strictures, and with a full appreciation of our heralded common-law interstitial developmental process. We do not at all abandon the tradition that has wisely guided the careful progression of the at-will doctrine and its application in particular circumstances (Cardozo, <em>Nature of the Judicial Process, </em>in Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, at 115, 134 [Margaret E. Hall ed 1947] [observing that Judges proceed \u201c\u2018interstitially\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018from molar to molecular motions\u2019 \u201d], quoting <em>Southern Pac. Co. v Jensen, </em>244 US 205, 221 [Holmes, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The dissent, on the other hand, strongly disagrees with and variously over-characterizes the import and reach of the majority rationale <em>{see, </em>dissenting opn, at 694, 698-699, 704-706). The dissent uses a different and broader approach of its own, not unlike that of the Federal District Court <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 696, 699-705, 706). To be sure, those two differing views reach a conclusion that the agreement is indefinite, but that postulate cannot trigger a dispositional at-will analysis, when this majority, qua Court, determines, as we do, in the threshold step of analysis that the agreement measures up as sufficiently definite. We need not, nor may we, venture in dictum or additional discussion, and we need respond to the Second Circuit and to the dissent no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Accordingly, the certified question of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals should be answered that an oral contract between a fight trainer and a professional boxer to train the boxer \u201cfor as long as the boxer fights professionally\u201d is a contract for a definite duration.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b770-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyY\">(dissenting). By its ruling, the majority heralds a new era in interpreting oral promises of potentially long-term employment. Because I believe the majority\u2019s conclusion is contrary to precedent, policy and practice, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The following facts from the certification by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit provide a contextual backdrop for the ensuing legal analysis. Plaintiff Kevin Rooney claims that, pursuant to an oral contract in 1982 between himself and Cus D\u2019Amato, legal guardian and manager of defendant Michael Gerard Tyson, then a minor, he was to train Tyson until Tyson turned professional, whereupon he would be Tyson\u2019s trainer \u201cfor as long as [Tyson] fought\u201d and would be paid 10% of Tyson\u2019s boxing earnings. After he turned profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sional, Tyson initially enjoyed increasing success as a boxer and Rooney was compensated in accordance with the earlier arrangement. However, the personal relationship between the men later soured and on December 9, 1988, Rooney learned that Tyson would no longer train with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Rooney then brought the present action against Tyson, claiming a breach of the 1982 employment contract allegedly made by D\u2019Amato. Prior to trial, the court denied Tyson\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that there were factual issues relating to whether the employment relationship was terminable at will, and whether the contract was unenforceable as one of a close personal nature or because Tyson was a minor at the time it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">A jury found in Rooney\u2019s favor and awarded him damages of $4.4 million. However, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York vacated the jury award and granted defendant Tyson judgment as a matter of law. The court ruled that \u201cthe alleged term of the employment contract, \u2018for as long as Tyson boxes professionally,\u2019 does not state a term of definite duration as a matter of law\u201d <em>(Rooney v Tyson, </em>956 F Supp 213, 216). The court further held that \u201cthe nature of the proof offered at trial cannot sustain a finding that the employment relationship was anything other than one at-will\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 216). Rooney appealed the court\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">On appeal, the Second Circuit certified the following question to this Court: \u201cDoes an oral contract between a fight trainer and a professional boxer to train the boxer \u2018for as long as the boxer fights professionally\u2019 establish a definite duration, or does it constitute employment for indefinite duration within the scope of the at-will rule?\u201d <em>(Rooney v Tyson, </em>127 F3d 295, 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Although the question certified merely asks this Court to determine whether the stated language establishes a definite or indefinite duration, the answer carries significantly varied implications. If the duration of the employment is deemed to be definite, the employment relationship is defined by the contract and is examined under traditional contract principles. On the other hand, if the purported contractual language indicates an indefinite duration, the employment relationship is presumptively at-will, and terminable at any time. In the latter case, the parties could still be bound by the term of employment, though indefinite, if the plaintiff had sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>proof of consideration apart from a mere promise to work. Since the record is not before us, resolution of the latter issue is not required. However, the legal analysis relating thereto is an important consideration in examining the consequences of our answer to the core issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The majority concludes that the stated contractual language establishes an employment term for a definite duration. However, upon a straightforward application of our precedents in this area, I conclude that the submitted language indicates employment for an indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Definite vs Indefinite</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Although we have had few occasions to explore the contours of the issue presented, our precedents indicate that a hiring for an \u201cindefinite\u201d duration includes one that may have some definable ending point, but the actual length of employment is not fixed with precision. For example, in <em>Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>(249 NY 439) plaintiff sought to prove \u201cthat he was employed for life or at least for as long a time as the defendant remained in business\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 440) based upon an oral promise of \u201cpermanent employment.\u201d We characterized the promise as \u201cnothing more than that the employment [was] to continue indefinitely\u201d <em>(Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., </em>249 NY, at 444; <em>see also, Revere v Boston Copper Co., </em>32 Mass 351, 361 [\u201ca contract (for life) with a corporation, which is in its nature perpetual, but determinable by some contingent event, is a contract for an indefinite time\u201d]). Similarly, an employment contract which provides that an employee may only be terminated for \u201cjust cause\u201d represents a hiring for an indefinite duration <em>(see, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Such circumstances may be contrasted with an employment relationship where its duration \u201c \u2018is either definite or capable of being determined\u2019\u201d <em>(see, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 NY2d 458, 465, <em>supra </em>[citation omitted]). In every example addressed by this Court, a \u201cdefinite\u201d duration was only determinable by reference to a precise calendar date. For example, in <em>Gressing v Musical Instrument Sales Co. </em>(222 NY 215) and <em>Cuppy v Stollwerck Bros. </em>(216 NY 591), the documentary evidence indicated that the parties had contracted for one year of definite employment. In the <em>Gressing </em>case, defendant had guaranteed a certain amount of business annually. In <em>Cuppy, </em>the employer\u2019s letters offered employment for 12 months and a certain rate per year <em>(see also, Carter v Bradlee, </em>245 App Div 49, <em>affd </em>269 NY 664 [contract which provided for two-year commitment with provisions to renew on the same terms could not be terminated after the third year of employment]).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">It would also appear that parties might specify that employment is to continue indefinitely until the happening of a particular event. However, it is only when the event precisely defines the length of employment that it will be considered of \u201cdefinite\u201d duration. Thus, a fixed duration may be precisely measured when employment lasts through summer (from the June solstice to the September equinox) or until the next election (first Tuesday in November) but not by the level of a company\u2019s stock, a lifetime or subjective performance evaluations. Indeed, the requirement that the length of the employment relationship be fixed and definite at the time of contracting effectively balances the rights of employees and employers since both will know exactly how long the employment relationship will last. It is only when the length of employment is actually and precisely ascertainable at the time of contracting, removing uncertainty for all, that we have found the duration to be \u201cdefinite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The question is not whether the event that may terminate employment is \u201cfixed\u201d but whether the duration of the relationship is precisely measured by that event. Indeed, as stated long ago in a case decided by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\u201cThe engagement of the plaintiff to perform services, being for the time for which the corporation was established, * * * is for an indefinite time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>determinable by the dissolution of the corporation in a mode fixed by law\u201d <em>(Revere v Boston Copper Co., </em>32 Mass 351, 361, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">A period of time measured by an individual employer\u2019s continued professional career is indistinguishable from a corporate employer remaining in business. Similarly, career-long employment is akin to a \u201c \u2018permanent\u2019 position\u201d allegedly measured by an employee\u2019s lifetime which we have held is employment of an indefinite duration <em>(see, Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., </em>249 NY 439, 442, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The majority reasons that contracts for a \u201cpermanent\u201d position establish an indefinite duration because they are not \u201cdelimited by legally and realistically cognizable boundaries\u201d (majority opn, at 691). The majority inevitably concludes that the ending of a professional boxing career is somehow more definite than death. Rather, both contracts, so delimited, indistinguishably define a fixed boundary, but for employment of indefinite duration. The distinction seen by the majority is elusive, to say the least. Indeed, it is difficult to glean the majority\u2019s basis for finding the boundary defining the duration at issue as more \u201cdefinite\u201d than contracts that are \u201cyearly\u201d or \u201cby the year\u201d (majority opn, at 691).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The majority concludes that a period which might last any length could still be characterized as \u201cdefinite\u201d and \u201cfixed.\u201d Though the condition which might terminate the employment relationship is defined, the time in which the relationship might endure is obviously far from \u201cdefinite.\u201d By focusing on the definiteness of how employment might be limited rather than the definiteness of the term of employment, the majority reshapes precedent to hold that a stated event which could terminate an employment relationship, but which might occur at any time, may also definitively fix the duration of employment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The most troubling aspect of the majority\u2019s ruling is its consequences. The doctrine of at-will employment has served as the judicial bedrock of New York employment law since 1896. By creating a subcategory of employment relationships where the duration has \u201csome definiteness\u201d (majority opn, at 690), the majority chips away at the precedential foundation that this Court has consistently applied. As exposed below, the shift taken by the majority in concluding that the submitted language creates employment for a definite term may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>substantial ramifications upon employment law as a practical matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Consequences of the Majority\u2019s Ruling on Employment Law</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">For over a century, this Court has strictly and steadfastly adhered to the approach that a general hiring or employment for an indefinite period, where no specific time is fixed for the duration of the employment, is presumptively \u201cat-will\u201d <em>(see, e.g., Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293, 301; <em>Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 333; <em>see also, Arledge v Stratmar Sys., </em>948 F2d 845, 848 [\u201cthe resoluteness with which the New York Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the \u2018at will\u2019 rule indicates that exceptions to the rule are discouraged\u201d]). The majority\u2019s ruling that the stated language defines an employment contract of definite duration avoids the at-will presumption and eliminates important elements of proof that we have always required under substantially similar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"ARnW\">Underpinnings of At-Will Employment</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">In <em>Martin v New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(148 NY 117), this Court examined the nature of a \u201cgeneral hiring\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 120) which, by definition, said \u201cnothing * * * as to its duration\u201d (2 Story, Contracts \u00a7 1290 [5th ed 1874]; <em>see also, Watson v Gugino, </em>204 NY 535, 540 [a general contract of hiring has no time specified]; Schouler, Domestic Relations \u00a7 458 [4th ed 1889] [engagement \u201cwithout mentioning the time nor the frequency of payment * * * is a general hiring\u201d]). In that case, we adopted a rule of interpretation and proof for claimed employment relationships:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201c With us, the rule is inflexible, that a general or indefinite hiring is <em>prima facie </em>a hiring at will; and if the servant seeks to make it out a yearly hiring, the burden is upon him to establish it by proof. A hiring at so much a day, week, month or year, no time being specified, is an indefinite hiring, and no presumption attaches that it was for a day even, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>but only at the rate fixed for whatever time the party may serve. * * * [I]n all such cases the contract may be put an end to by either party at any time, unless the time is fixed, and a recovery had, at the rate fixed for the services actually rendered\u2019 \u201d (148 NY, at 121, quoting Wood, Master and Servant \u00a7 136 [2d ed 1886]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Previous courts were divided as to how such contracts should be interpreted. Some authorities had construed general hirings to endure for a year in accordance with the approach taken by the English courts <em>(see, </em>1 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 425 [1765]) unless the frequency of payments was stated <em>(see, </em>2 Story, Contracts, \u00a7 1291 [5th ed 1874] [\u201cWhere wages are payable at a stipulated period, as per week, or month, or half-year, such circumstance, standing alone, indicates that the hiring is for such period\u201d]; Schouler, Domestic Relations \u00a7 458 [4th ed 1889] [\u201cif a contract for hiring is at so much per month, it will readily be presumed that the hiring was by the month, even if nothing was said about the term of service\u201d]). In one treatise, it was stated that the English rule of a one-year presumption applied to a general hiring but a \u201chiring for an indefinite time is only at will\u201d (2 Story, Contracts \u00a7 1290 [5th ed 1874]). Both types of employment were presumptively at-will under the rule espoused by commentator Horace G. Wood <em>(see, </em>Wood, Master and Servant \u00a7 136 [2d ed 1886]). In New York, the latter \u201crule was deliberately adopted, all the judges concurring, to settle the differences of opinion which had prevailed in the lower courts\u201d <em>(Watson v Gugino, </em>204 NY 535, 541-542, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We have noted that the \u201coriginal purposes of the employment at-will doctrine were to afford employees the freedom to contract to suit their needs and to allow employers to exercise their best judgment with regard to employment matters\u201d <em>(Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d 329, 333, <em>supra). </em>In fact, the core of the at-will doctrine is the \u201cunfettered\u201d right held by the parties to terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason not otherwise prohibited by law or public policy <em>(see, Sabetay v Sterling Drug, </em>69 NY2d, at 337). General or indefinite terms of employment are not even presumed to endure \u201cfor a reasonable time\u201d <em>(Haines v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 769, 772).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In accordance with the above-noted rule, any presumption of an at-will relationship may be rebutted with proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>unfettered right to terminate the employment \u201chas been limited by express agreement\u201d <em>(Sabetay v Sterling Drug, supra, </em>69 NY2d, at 334; <em>see also, O\u2019Connor v Eastman Kodak Co., </em>65 NY2d 724; <em>Matter of Hanchard v Facilities Dev. Corp., </em>85 NY2d 638; <em>Parker v Borock, </em>5 NY2d 156). However, as detailed below, the \u201cburden of establishing the existence of these contractual limitations is heavy\u201d (1 Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn, New York Employment Law \u00a7 2.04 [2] [a]). Particularly relevant here is the principle that the elements and burden of proof required to overcome the at-will presumption are substantially different from that required to succeed in a claim based upon a contract for a definite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Overcoming the At-Will Presumption</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Since employment contracts with a definite duration are not presumptively at-will, traditional rules of contract interpretation apply. Typically, a court will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration supporting the parties\u2019 agreement since even the \u201c \u2018slightest consideration is sufficient to support the most onerous obligation\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mencher v Weiss, </em>306 NY 1, 8; <em>see also, Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc., supra, </em>57 NY2d, at 464; 1 Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn, New York Employment Law \u00a7 2.03 [2] [\u201cNew York courts have rarely refused to uphold an employment contract for lack of consideration\u201d]; Bakaly and Grossman, Modern Law of Employment Contracts \u00a7 3.2 [2d ed] [\u201cadequacy of consideration is rarely an issue in employment contracts\u201d]). Accordingly, an employee\u2019s mere promise to work could potentially support a promise of work for a definite term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>However, a promise of employment which might last anywhere from a day to a decade is insufficient, standing alone, to indicate an actual intention to be potentially and absolutely bound to obligations far in excess of an ordinary employment at-will relationship. While \u201c \u2018the manifestation of a party\u2019s intention rather than the actual or real intention is ordinarily controlling\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mencher v Weiss, supra, </em>306 NY, at 7 [citation omitted]), promises of employment of indefinite duration \u2014 such as that measured by the physical or professional life of either party \u2014 are simply too unusual to be taken at face value. Such assumptions are of greying vintage <em>(Heaman v Rowell Co., </em>261 NY 229, 231 [\u201cAlleged contracts of life employment are * * * so unusual as to have been, with rare exceptions, condemned by the courts as unreasonable and unauthorized\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In <em>Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>(249 NY 439, <em>supra), </em>we noted that, \u201c[standing alone and by themselves,\u201d the words \u201cpermanent employment\u201d do not guarantee a job for life when used in contracts between employers and employees <em>(id., </em>at 444). We distinguished the matter from cases where such intent was demonstrated \u201cfrom the circumstances * * * and from the consideration which has been furnished\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 444). As an example, we cited <em>Rague v New York Evening Journal Publ. Co. </em>(164 App Div 126), a case in which the Court held in favor of a plaintiff who sued to enforce an oral agreement under which defendant promised to pay him for \u201cas long as he abstained\u201d from selling a rival newspaper <em>(id., </em>at 126). The Court expressly observed that the contract \u201cwas not without consideration, as the plaintiff abandoned a valuable business\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Another case we cited approvingly was <em>Pierce v Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. R. Co. </em>(173 US 1), where the plaintiff had been employed as a machinist in the defendant\u2019s coal mine when he was seriously hurt under conditions which plaintiff claimed rendered defendant liable to him in damages. The contract at issue required plaintiff to receive certain wages and benefits \u201cso long as his disability to do full work continued; and that, in consideration of these promises of the defendant, the plaintiff agreed to do such work as he could, and to release the defendant from all liability upon his claim for damages for his personal injuries\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 9). At trial, plaintiff proved that he was permanently disabled by his injuries; that he was always ready and willing to do such work for defendant as he was able; and that defendant, without reasonable ground therefor, discontinued payments to plaintiff and disregarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>contract. Where such facts were \u201cproved to the satisfaction of the jury,\u201d the Supreme Court held that defendant \u201ccommitted an absolute breach of the contract, at a time when the plaintiff was entitled to require performance\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 16). Clearly, more was involved in that case than the mere allegation that wages were promised \u201cso long as\u201d plaintiff was disabled, an indefinite period.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">As one court has stated the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201cUnder circumstances where an employee has given consideration of benefit to the employer, additional to the services of employment, a contract for permanent employment is valid and enforceable and not against public policy and continues to operate as long as the employer remains in business and has work for the employee, and the employee is willing and able to do his work satisfactorily and does not give cause for his discharge\u201d <em>(Forrer v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>36 Wis 2d 388, 394, 153 NW2d 587, 590).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In a later case, this Court explicitly held that \u201ca contract for employment for life * * * based on an adequate consideration, will ordinarily be sustained\u201d <em>(Heaman v Rowell Co., </em>261 NY 229, 231, supra) and other \u201cas long as\u201d-type employment relationships recognized by this Court as binding have all involved continuing performance and consideration given by the employee independent of a mere promise to work for the employer <em>(see, e.g., Cammack v Slattery &amp; Bro., </em>241 NY 39, 42 [employer held to promise to continue paying royalties for indefinite period when it continued to sell radiators \u201cwhich embodied ideas and conformed to plans developed by the plaintiff\u201d]; <em>Ehrenworth v Stuhmer &amp; Co., </em>229 NY 210, 215 [agreement to sell defendant\u2019s bread \u201cas long as\u201d the parties were in business was supported by consideration given on both sides]; <em>Schwarz v Regensburg &amp; Sons, </em>227 NY 568 [payments for life upheld upon promise not to compete with defendants in business]; <em>cf., Rubin v Dairymen\u2019s League Co-op. Assn., </em>284 NY 32, 38 [Court upheld lower court\u2019s finding of fact that \u201cagreement was \u2018unilateral as to time and could be terminated by either party at any time\u2019 \u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">More recently, in <em>Weiner v McGraw-Hill, Inc. </em>(57 NY2d 458, <em>supra), </em>we concluded that a jury question had been raised as to whether plaintiff was entitled to employment indefinitely in light of a claimed promise by defendant \u201cnot to discharge [him] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>without just and sufficient cause and an opportunity for rehabilitation\u201d {id., at 466). In that case, we concluded that plaintiff had alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>sufficient facts to support the conclusion that he had detrimentally relied upon defendant\u2019s assurance that he would not be discharged without cause. We have characterized such factors to be \u201csignificant\u201d in a claim of breach of an employment contract for an indefinite duration <em>(Sabetay v Sterling Drug, supra, </em>69 NY2d, at 334) and the absence of such pleading and proof may be fatal to such a claim <em>(see, e.g., O\u2019Connor v Eastman Kodak Co., </em>65 NY2d 724, <em>supra; Matter of De Petris v Union Settlement Assn., </em>86 NY2d 406).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Although each of these cases raised different issues relating to pleading and proof based upon the facts presented, it is clear that an employee must show consideration independent of a mere promise to work for an employer to overcome the presumption of at-will employment. In this case, though analogous to those requiring such additional proof, the majority finds that the employment is for a definite duration as a matter of law and, thus, a traditional contract analysis would apply. Thus, the majority\u2019s ruling relieves plaintiff from having to prove elements we have recognized as necessary for recovery upon similar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">No one claims that Tyson must train under Rooney despite the strain in their personal relationship. In contemplation of such circumstances, it may well be that Tyson and/or his guardian never intended that Rooney be paid even in the absence of an ongoing, actual training relationship. It is also possible that sufficient proof exists in the record to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s claim regarding the parties\u2019 intention. However, that question and that proof are not before us. While the District Court concluded that \u201cthe nature of the proof offered at trial cannot sustain a finding that the employment relationship was anything other than one at-will\u201d <em>(Rooney v Tyson, </em>956 F Supp 213, 216, <em>supra), </em>no opinion is expressed here on the issue which must be resolved in the Federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">For this case, the Second Circuit has asked this Court to determine whether an oral promise that employment will endure \u201cas long as\u201d defendant\u2019s professional boxing career, standing alone, establishes an employment agreement of definite duration, which effectively reduces to an irrelevancy the requirement of additional circumstances and/or consideration that would be required to rebut an at-will presumption. Rather than analyze this case in accordance with our precedents in which the present circumstances neatly fit, the majority carves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>out a category of employment contracts from the at-will rebut-table presumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">Consideration of the Statute of Frauds</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon oral promises of job security is also troubling in light of other concerns we have articulated in this area. An employment contract of a definite duration beyond a year may avoid application of the at-will presumption but must be in writing to be enforceable at all <em>(see, </em>General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-701 [a] [1]). Though, in some circumstances, oral contracts may bind parties as tightly as those that are written, it is clear that a writing subscribed by the party to be charged with long-term obligations is the most reliable indicator of actual intent <em>(see, Burns v McCormick, </em>233 NY 230, 234 [Cardozo, J.] [\u201cThe peril of perjury and error is latent in the spoken promise\u201d]). Indeed, in <em>Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>(249 NY 439, <em>supra), </em>we opined that \u201c[a]n agreement to employ the plaintiff * * * for life is so unusual that we would expect to find it contained in some writing\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 441).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the potentially long-term obligations recognized by the majority as a matter of law would not be barred by the Statute of Frauds because Tyson concedes that his professional career might have ended within a year. Thus, the majority\u2019s decision manages to sidestep the level of proof we have recognized as necessary under both the at-will presumption and the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Of course, such concerns do not inform the previously reached conclusion herein that the contractual language at issue is for employment of indefinite duration, the sole issue submitted for our determination by the Second Circuit. Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization of the dissent, the \u201coral nature\u201d of the contract at issue is not the basis of the difference in conclusions reached on definiteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The ultimate question is not whether the agreement is void for indefiniteness but whether the parties intended to be bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>to the claimed obligations. We have conclusively held that \u201cpermanent\u201d or \u201clifetime\u201d employment is of indefinite duration\u2014 though fixed by a particular event \u2014 but may yet be enforced when such intent is indicated by the giving of consideration. \u201cPermanent\u201d employment logically and readily encompasses circumstances in which <em>either </em>party ends its professional life through death, retirement, bankruptcy or any other means. The majority recasts precedent to hold that an event, which could happen at anytime for any reason, may also precisely fix the length of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The majority declines to address the broader impact of its ruling upon employment law. However, it has been noted that \u201c[t]here can be no wisdom in the choice of a path unless we know where it will lead\u201d (Cardozo, <em>The Nature of the Judicial Process, </em>in Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, at 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">As discussed herein, certain contracts purporting to bind parties to career-long employment, or for some similarly indefinite term, have required a sufficient showing of consideration and/or other facts to overcome the presumption of at-will employment. Ironically, the majority supports its conclusion that the contract at issue is for a definite term by resorting to an analysis of the compensation and consideration rendered by the employee under the contract <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 692). Whether the contract is for a definite duration does not depend on whether the employee rendered sufficient consideration in reliance upon the contract. Nor does the conclusion regarding the contract term require any reference to the employee\u2019s compensation as a percentage of the defendant\u2019s professional bouts. Such factual issues are more properly directed to the enforceability of the contract itself which must be examined by the Federal court. The conclusion reached herein that the contract is for an indefinite duration depends solely upon the language certified by the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I would answer the certified question in the following manner: The purported contractual language indicates employment of indefinite duration which merely raises a rebuttable presumption under the at-will rule. I express no opinion about whether the presumption has been rebutted by plaintiffs evidentiary showing or whether any other grounds exist that might support a motion against the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Judges Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur with Judge Bellacosa; Judge Smith dissents and answers the certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>question by stating that the purported contractual language indicates employment of indefinite duration which merely raises a rebuttable presumption under the at-will rule, in a separate opinion; Chief Judge Kaye and Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.17 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.17), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered as follows: An oral contract between a fight trainer and a professional boxer to train the boxer \u201cfor as long as the boxer fights professionally\u201d is a contract for a definite duration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">. Federal authorities dealing with employment contracts are in accord with this approach (see, <em>Wanamaker v Columbian Rope </em>Co., 907 F Supp 522, 538-539 [oral assurance of a permanent career position is indefinite employment], <em>affd </em>108 F3d 462 [2d Cir 1997]; <em>Wright v Cayan, </em>817 F2d 999, 1003 [2d Cir 1987] [promise of a \u201cpermanent appointment\u201d is employment of indefinite duration]; <em>Hunnewell v Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., </em>628 F Supp 759, 762 [\u201cthe phrases \u2018full working life\u2019 and \u2018through normal retirement age\u2019, do not explicitly state a definite term during which plaintiff could expect to remain employed\u201d]; <em>Weiler v National Multiple Sclerosis Socy., </em>1980 WL 104, 4 [US Dist Ct, SD NY] [\u201cthe very phrase, \u2018until he chose to retire,\u2019 is indicative of the indefinite time period of the contract\u201d]; <em>Peters v MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>685 F Supp 411 [employer\u2019s promise that em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ployee \u201c \u2018could expect long-term employment\u2019 \u201d failed to state definite duration]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. The majority indicates that the dissent takes as its \u201cthreshold pivot\u201d an \u201c[i]nitial consideration of the at-will presumption\u201d to answer the question certified (majority opn, at 689). This statement ignores the conclusion reached herein on the issue of \u201cdefiniteness\u201d prior to any mention of the at-will presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. In interpreting New York law, Federal courts have applied a somewhat different analysis when the \u201cemployees\u201d are corporations (see, <em>Don King </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Prods. v Douglas, </em>742 F Supp 741; <em>Warner-Lambert Pharm. Co. v John J. Reynolds, Inc., </em>178 F Supp <em>655, affd </em>280 F2d 197; <em>Payroll Express Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>659 F2d 285). In those cases, the courts held that the corporate parties should be bound by the explicit termination provisions of the written service contracts they had freely executed. However, we have noted that \u201ccompelling policy reasons\u201d may require a different analysis in employment contracts <em>(see, Haines v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 769, 772-773, distinguishing at-will employment cases such as <em>Watson v Gugino, </em>204 NY 535, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, in <em>Haines, </em>we relied upon authorities such as <em>Benham v World Airways </em>(432 F2d 359), a case in which the Ninth Circuit explicitly noted that \u201cthe employment aspect of the contract presented different questions of duration and damage ascertainment from those involved in the joint venturing phase\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 362). In <em>Haines, </em>the agreement did not state how long it was to endure. We implied duration for a \u201creasonable time\u201d which we concluded was until one party \u201cno longer needed or desired\u201d the service provided by the other \u2014 an inference not to be drawn from an indefinite employment relationship (41 NY2d, at 773).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">. Although the Second Circuit asked this Court to answer whether the submitted language \u201cestablishes\u201d a definite duration, the majority holds that the language \u201cmay support a definite duration finding\u201d (majority opn, at 693). The majority further states that \u201cthe durational term was * * * reasonably determinable by the fact finders\u201d (majority opn, at 692).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">. We have noted that the \u201cStatute of Frauds was originally rooted in the prevention of \u2018fraud in the proving of certain legal transactions particularly susceptible to deception, mistake and perjury\u2019 * * * but not \u2018 \u201cto afford persons a means of evading just obligations\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Cron v Hargro Fabrics, </em>91 NY2d 362, 370 [citations omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
