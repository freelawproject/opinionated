The evidence was insufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt of burglary of a dwelling where the area of the school building alleged to be a dwelling area (an office with a bed in it) was not \u201cusually occupied by a person lodging there at night\u201d, appellant never came in close proximity to the alleged dwelling and appellant had permission to be in the building at the time of the burglary. <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Gaines, </em>74 NY2d 358; <em>Quinn v People, </em>71 NY 561; <em>People v Paul, </em>204 AD2d 205; <em>People v Cuozzo, </em>199 AD2d 966; <em>People v Dwight, </em>189 AD2d 566; <em>People v Rohena, </em>186 AD2d 509; <em>People v Johnson, </em>162 AD2d 267; <em>People v Green, </em>141 AD2d 760; <em>People v Torres, </em>162 AD2d 385.) II. The prosecutor\u2019s summation argument that appellant had 14 months to think of his story, which he had not told the police at the time of arrest, and the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that he had no obligation to speak to the police, constituted an improper exploitation of appellant\u2019s postarrest silence and infringed upon his right to silence and to testify. <em>(People v Conyers, </em>52 NY2d 454; <em>People v De George, </em>73 NY2d 614; <em>People v Foy, </em>220 AD2d 220; <em>People v Durden, </em>211 AD2d 568; <em>People v Spinelli, </em>214 AD2d 135; <em>People v Dawson, </em>50 NY2d 311; <em>Agard v Portuondo, </em>117 F3d 696; <em>People v Beslanovics, </em>57 NY2d 726.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b821-6\"><em>Robert M.

We hold that such a building is not a dwelling within the definition of second degree burglary and reduce appellant\u2019s conviction to third degree burglary, the burglary of a building that is not a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The building at issue, the Convent School of the Religious of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan, has seven floors, two below grade and five above. The basement contains employee lockers; the first floor, administrative offices; the second, a chapel, and the third and fourth floors, classrooms. On the fifth floor are a conference room, an art room and a kitchen, but primarily offices for faculty use when school is in session. One of the offices has a bed, and another has a chair which can be used for sleeping. The school\u2019s Administrator testified that the bed in the office was \u201crarely\u201d used for overnight guests, estimating between 20 or 30 occasions per year, when someone was working late or when needed by a visiting priest. No one was staying overnight on the fifth floor on the night in question. Employed as a member of the cleaning and weekend reception staff, defendant had keys to the school, and was free to come and go at any time whether for work or to obtain personal items from his locker in the basement. His keys, however, did not permit access to the two first floor offices. On June 6, 1993, defendant and his brother, who was separately convicted, broke into the first floor offices and took various items.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The Appellate Division determined that the fifth floor office with a bed in it was enough to make the building a dwelling within the second degree burglary statute (241 AD2d 315). The fifth floor \u201c \u2018guest\u2019 quarters\u201d were \u201cstructurally adapted for overnight accommodation\u201d and \u201ccould have been so occupied on the night of the burglary\u201d such that the school could be considered a dwelling <em>(id., </em>at 316, citing <em>People v Sheirod, </em>124 AD2d 14, 18). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Defendant concedes he committed burglary, but contests the degree. Second degree burglary includes entering a dwelling, while third degree burglary includes only the entry of a building (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 140.20, 140.25 [2]). A building becomes a dwelling if it is \u201cusually occupied by a person lodging therein at night\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 140.00 [3]). \u201cWhere a building consists of two or more units separately secured or occupied, each unit shall be deemed both a separate building in itself and a part of the main building\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 140.00 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Over 100 years have passed since we last addressed the question of what constitutes a \u201cdwelling\u201d in defining the crime of burglary. In <em>Quinn v People </em>(71 NY 561), we held that burglary of a dwelling could be committed by breaking into the first floor office of a building in which the upper floors were occupied residences. In that case we construed the then applicable statutory provision which stated that a building in order to be a dwelling must be \u201cjoined to, immediately connected with, and part of a dwelling house.\u201d The fact that the first floor commercial space did not have \u201cinternal communication\u201d with the upper floor residences was immaterial in light of the statute which strongly suggested that a ground floor commercial space \u201cunder the same roof\u2019 of a building otherwise used for residences was, in fact, a dwelling <em>(see also, People v Rohena, </em>186 AD2d 509; <em>People v Johnson, </em>162 AD2d 267). Wrongful entry into such a building also could have caused the very harm that the increased penalty for burglary of a dwelling was designed to prevent, namely \u201cmidnight terror\u201d and the \u201cdanger to human life, growing out of the attempt to defend property from depredation\u201d <em>(Quinn v People, </em>71 NY, at 567).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The facts here present a somewhat different question. In <em>Quinn, </em>there was little doubt that the upper floors were occupied and used for residential purposes. Here, we must determine, under the facts presented, the meaning of \u201cusually occupied by a person lodging therein at night.\u201d In most cases, this determination will be a question of fact for the jury based on the particular situation before it <em>(see, e.g., People v Lewoc, </em>101 AD2d 927 [noting factual issue whether house was dwelling which for a time was left unoccupied]). As the long history of this issue instructs, there are myriad factual situations in which the question of what constitutes a dwelling can arise <em>(see generally, </em>Annotation, 20 ALR4th 349 [compiling cases regarding burglary and the occupancy of building entered]).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Nonetheless, here we find that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding that the school building was a dwelling within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 140.00 (3). Although prior to 1967, burglary in the second degree required proof of another person\u2019s actual presence in the building wrongfully entered (former Penal Law \u00a7 403), the statute since that time has required only that the building be \u201cusually occupied\u201d <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 140.00 [3]). The main case that has examined this term is <em>People v Sheirod </em>(124 AD2d 14, <em>supra). </em>In that case, a single family home had been left vacant for one year when the family relocated to Colorado on account of a temporary employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ment assignment. The Court concluded that three factors should be used in analyzing whether the building was, in fact, a dwelling: (1) whether the nature of the structure was such that it was adapted for occupancy at the time of the wrongful entry; (2) the intent of the owner to return; and, (3) whether, on the date of the entry, a person could have occupied the structure overnight <em>(id., </em>at 17). The building satisfied this inquiry in that it was a fully furnished house used as the family residence for 12 to 13 years, utilities remained functioning, the family intended to return after the assignment ended in Colorado, and someone could have stayed overnight on the day of the break-in <em>{id., </em>at 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The Court relied on what could be called a temporary vacancy doctrine: a dwelling does not lose its character as such merely because its occupant is temporarily absent <em>(see, People v Melendez, </em>148 AD2d 964; <em>People v Lewoc, supra; see also, Starnes v Commonwealth, </em>597 SW2d 614 [Ky]; <em>Johnson v Commonwealth, </em>18 Va App 441, 444 SE2d 559; <em>State v Black, </em>627 So 2d 741 [La App 2d Cir]). Before determining whether the structure is only temporarily vacant, however, it must first be determined that the nature of the structure was such that it could be considered a residence to which someone would return, with all its attendant characteristics. In this way, the <em>Sheirod </em>analysis substantiated that the house in question was \u201cusually occupied\u201d in the sense that it was normal and ordinary that when the structure was occupied, it was used as a place for overnight lodging. This does not mean, however, that the building must always be a home or what would normally be considered a residence. Frequency of use for overnight lodging, in addition to the nature and character of the building as a place for such lodging when used, can be, and often is, a factor to be considered <em>(cf., People v Wright, </em>157 AD2d 534 [brothel a dwelling upon proof that women lodged there]).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">An analysis of relevant factors identified in <em>Sheirod </em>demonstrates that the building in the present case was not a dwelling. Neither the building as a whole nor the fifth floor office had the customary indicia of a residence and its character or attributes. When the building was occupied, it was used as a school, including offices, employee locker rooms, classrooms and a chapel. There was no residential apartment in the building. Instead, the fifth floor room was concededly an <em>office </em>that when occupied was used as an office. The existence of the bed and a chair in two offices was not enough to convert this building into what one would customarily conclude to be a resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>dence, nor were these accommodations used with such frequency to allow a conclusion that the offices were \u201cusually occupied by a person lodging therein at night.\u201d The evidence was clear that these offices were \u201crarely\u201d used for overnight stays, typically only 20 to 30 times a year. This use is too infrequent, without more, to be usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Finally, the Appellate Division\u2019s overreliance on the fact that a person could have been sleeping in the fifth floor office harks back to the time when actual physical presence in the building was the determinative factor, rather than a determination of whether it was \u201cusually occupied.\u201d The fact that on one night a person could have slept in the building could strengthen a conclusion that the building was a dwelling, but, on its own, is of little weight. Indeed, to hold otherwise in this case would convert into a dwelling every office or commercial space with a couch or comfortable chair that could be or infrequently is used for an overnight stay. That is unwarranted in light of the purpose and language of the second degree burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contention is unpreserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by reducing appellant\u2019s conviction from two counts of burglary in the second degree to two counts of burglary in the third degree, and remitting the case to Supreme Court for appellant to be resentenced, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
