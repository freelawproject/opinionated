This Court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>(Burke v Crosson, </em>85 NY2d 10.) II. Merchants has no duty to defend or indemnify Frontier because the underlying complaints allege claims that fall squarely within the definition of \"products hazard\u201d, a hazard for which Frontier did not purchase coverage. <em>(Johnson v National Fire Ins.

Even if appellant\u2019s interpretation of the Merchants\u2019 policies was correct, Merchants still would have no duty to defend or indemnify Frontier. <em>(Fitzpatrick v American Honda Motor Co., </em>78 NY2d 61; <em>Continental Cas.

Even if this Court accepts Frontier\u2019s arguments discussed and refuted above, the Court nonetheless should reverse Special Term\u2019s order insofar as it dismisses Merchants\u2019 affirmative defenses with respect to the duty to indemnify. <em>(Seaboard Sur.

Even to the extent this Court determines that the Court below\u2019s application of the products-hazard exclusion was overbroad, the case should be remanded to the Court below for consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the additional issues which that Court found it unnecessary to address. <em>(Commercial Union Ins.

We resolve this question in favor of the insured because defendant insurers have failed to establish that the personal injury claims fall entirely within the product-hazards exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Plaintiff Frontier Insulation Contractors, a Buffalo-based industrial and commercial insulation contractor, engaged in the business of installing and applying asbestos insulation on plumbing, fittings, ductwork, boilers and other equipment from 1929 through the 1970\u2019s. Frontier purchased comprehensive general liability insurance policies from defendants Merchants Mutual Insurance Company, Utica Mutual Insurance Company and Travelers Insurance Company, to cover its asbestos installation operations. This appeal concerns only one policy issued by defendant Utica and five policies issued by defendant Merchants in which the insurers agreed to pay on Frontier\u2019s behalf \"all sums\u201d which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury due to an accident or occurrence, including the continued exposure to conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Between 1993 and 1994, Frontier was named as a defendant in 21 lawsuits alleging bodily injury and resulting damages caused by asbestos exposure at various locations. Both insurers disclaimed coverage pursuant to \"product hazards\u201d exclusions contained in their respective policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Frontier brought this action, seeking a declaration that defendant insurers have a duty to defend and indemnify it in the underlying personal injury suits. Supreme Court granted Frontier\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and, with relevance to this appeal, declared that Merchants had a duty to defend Frontier in 18 of the 21 actions, and Utica in 15 of the 21 actions. The court rejected the insurers\u2019 claims that their product-hazards exclusions relieved them of their duties to defend and indemnify Frontier, and did not accept defendants\u2019 late-notice defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The Appellate Division disagreed. The Court ruled that \"[bjecause none of the underlying complaints alleges any cause of action sufficiently removed from the allegedly defective and injurious nature of the asbestos to warrant classifying Frontier\u2019s liability as something other than a 'products hazard\u2019 * * * defendants have no obligation to defend or indemnify Frontier.\u201d (238 AD2d 894, 896.) Given its conclusion that the product-hazards exclusions relieved the insurers of their duty to defend, the Court declined to address the parties\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Two Justices in dissent noted that the products-hazard exclusion \"does not apply * * * if the plaintiffs were exposed to asbestos during the course of Frontier\u2019s installation operations\u201d <em>(supra, </em>238 AD2d, at 897). Thus, the dissenters concluded that \"[b]ecause the plaintiffs\u2019 exposure could have occurred in a variety of ways, only some of which are potentially excluded from coverage, the insurers may not be relieved of their obligation to provide a defense to Frontier by virtue of the 'products hazard\u2019 provisions in their policies\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 897). This two-Justice dissent on a question of law provides the jurisdictional predicate for the appeal to this Court (CPLR 5601 [a]). We now modify the Appellate Division\u2019s order, and remit for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The duty of an insurer to defend its insured arises whenever the allegations within the four corners of the underlying complaint potentially give rise to a covered claim, or where the insurer \"has actual knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage\u201d <em>(Fitzpatrick v American Honda Motor Co., </em>78 NY2d 61, 65-67). To be relieved of its duty to defend on the basis of a policy exclusion, the insurer bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that the allegations of the complaint cast the pleadings wholly within that exclusion, that the exclusion is subject to no other reasonable interpretation, and that there is no possible factual or legal basis upon which the insurer may eventually be held obligated to indemnify the insured under any policy provision <em>(Continental Cas. Co. v Rapid-American Corp., </em>80 NY2d 640, 652; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v Zuk, </em>78 NY2d 41, 45). If any of the claims against the insured arguably arise from covered events, the insurer is required to defend the entire action <em>(Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304, 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Defendant insurers contend that all of the claims in the underlying complaints fall wholly within the policies\u2019 exclusions for product hazards because they all allege that bodily injuries resulted from exposure to Frontier\u2019s asbestos products. This claim misses the mark, however, because the focus in determining whether a product-hazard exclusion applies is not simply whether an insured\u2019s product caused the loss at issue, but rather \"is dependent on the location of the accident and the possession of the product\u201d (Henderson, <em>Insurance Protection for Products Liability and Completed Operations </em>\u2014 What <em>Every Lawyer Should Know, </em>50 Neb L Rev 415, 420). Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>dants\u2019 argument fails to appreciate that an exclusion for product hazards governs only one subset of product liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The insurance industry has segregated product-liability hazards and the premiums charged therefor by categorizing them as either risks arising while work is in progress, or as those arising from the defective nature of a completed product that has been placed in the stream of commerce (7A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4508, at 340 [Berdal ed]). An insured may cover the first risk by purchasing coverage for \"premises-operations\u201d (7A Appleman, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 4508, at 340; \u00a7 4508.03, at 388-389). Historically, this category of coverage was designed to protect a manufacturer from injuries to third persons on the business premises, or from those that occur during operations away from the normal business premises while the insured retains control of the jobsite (Henderson, <em>op. cit., </em>at 417; <em>see also, Friestad v Travelers Indem. Co., </em>260 Pa Super 178, 182, n 2, 393 A2d 1212, 1213, n 2). Frontier purchased premises-operations coverage from both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The distinct risk of loss occasioned by a defect in the insured\u2019s product, which manifests itself only after the insured has relinquished control of the product and at a location away from the insured\u2019s normal business premises, is covered by the purchase of separate \"products hazard\u201d coverage (7A Appleman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 341).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This class of coverage generally protects a manufacturer or seller against claims of injury due to a product defect, breach of warranty and misrepresentation (Henderson, <em>op. cit., </em>at 426). Insurance clauses that <em>exclude </em>coverage for product hazards \u2014 such as those at issue here \u2014 are thus designed to preclude the insurer\u2019s liability for events that occur after its insured\u2019s product is placed in the stream of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The product-hazards exclusions here accomplished that goal by exempting from coverage only those bodily injuries arising out of the \"named insured\u2019s products\u201d that occur <em>\"away </em>from premises owned by or rented to the named insured and <em>after </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others\u201d (emphasis supplied). The term \"named insured\u2019s products\u201d is defined in the insurance contracts as \"goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">As an initial matter, defendants contend that the asbestos was Frontier\u2019s \"product\u201d even if it did not manufacture or sell the insulation it installed because it necessarily \"handled\u201d the asbestos during its operations as that term is broadly understood. To be sure, the term \"handled\u201d, standing alone, could be construed to refer to any touching of a product in connection with the provision of a service, as defendants contend. However, we conclude that the term\u2019s association with the words \"manufacturer\u201d and \"seller\u201d in the same clause indicates that it should be given its commercial connotation, and construed to refer to products in which the insured trades or deals <em>(Todd Shipyards Corp. v Turbine Serv., </em>674 F2d 401, 420 [5th Cir 1982]). That narrower construction makes practical sense, given that the goal of product-hazards coverage is to insure the party who is responsible for sending goods into the stream of commerce (Henderson, <em>op. cit., </em>at 429-430).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Whether the offending asbestos here was Frontier\u2019s \"product\u201d is a question of fact that cannot be resolved on this record in this summary judgment posture. Assuming that fact to be established, however, defendants will only be relieved of their duty to defend on the basis of these product-hazards exclusions if they can show that all of the underlying claims fall squarely within those clauses and are susceptible of no other interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Defendants have failed to establish that all of the underlying bodily injury claims satisfy the time and place prerequisites of the product-hazards exclusion. The exclusions, by definition, cannot apply to accidents or occurrences that allegedly took place while Frontier\u2019s installation work was in progress because the offending product \u2014 the asbestos insulation \u2014 was not relinquished from Frontier\u2019s control until installation was complete. In fact, a number of the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuits expressly allege that Frontier\u2019s \"negligent installation\u201d of the asbestos insulation caused their personal injuries. More importantly, none of the underlying complaints specify that the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injuries occurred only <em>after </em>Frontier had completed installation and departed from the covered premises. Since asbestos fibers may be readily released into the air and inhaled while a contractor is cutting and sawing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>product during installation, there is a reasonable possibility that any liability attributed to Frontier would stem from injuries that occurred during ongoing operations \u2014 covered events. Accordingly, defendants have failed to establish as a matter of law that the product-hazards exclusions provide shelter from their duty to defend Frontier <em>(Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304, 311, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Frontier also asks this Court to declare that defendant insurers have a duty to <em>indemnify </em>it in all of the underlying actions. In essence, Frontier contends that the duty to indemnify is coextensive with the duty to defend here because the insurers failed to establish that the underlying complaints fall entirely within a policy exclusion. However, an unbroken line of cases establishes that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify <em>(Continental Cas. Co. v Rapid-American Corp., </em>80 NY2d 640, 648, <em>supra; Servidone Constr. Corp. v Security Ins. Co., </em>64 NY2d 419, 424; <em>Ruder &amp; Finn v Seaboard Sur. Co., 52 </em>NY2d 663, 669). As this Court has explained, \"an insurer may be contractually bound to defend even though it may not ultimately be bound to pay, either because its insured is not factually or legally liable or because the occurrence is later proven to be outside the policy\u2019s coverage\u201d <em>(Fitzpatrick v American Honda Motor Co., </em>78 NY2d, at 65, <em>supra). </em>While the duty to defend is measured against the possibility of a recovery, \"the duty to pay is determined by the actual basis for the insured\u2019s liability to a third person\u201d <em>(Servidone Constr. Corp. v Security Ins. Co., </em>64 NY2d 419, 424, <em>supra). </em>Thus, we decline to pass on the question of defendants\u2019 duty to indemnify at this early juncture, which predates any ultimate determination of the insurers\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">As a final matter, in light of its conclusion that defendants had no duty to provide Frontier with a defense because all of the underlying complaints fell within the policy exclusion for products hazards, the Appellate Division failed to consider the parties\u2019 remaining contentions, including the insurers\u2019 claims that they were entitled to a declaration that they have no duty to defend or indemnify Frontier in certain actions because the accidents or occurrences constituted noncovered events or did not fall within the periods of coverage under the six policies at issue. An affirmative declaration that defendants must defend Frontier in any of the underlying actions must await a determination of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified in accordance with the opinion herein, with costs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>appellant, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised but not determined on appeal to that Court, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em> </em>To be distinguished from \"product hazards\u201d insurance is \"completed-operations\u201d insurance, which provides coverage for injuries arising from the insured\u2019s service \"operations which do not involve goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the insured\u201d (Henderson, <em>op. cit., </em>at 434). Completed-operations insurance covers the risk of loss for bodily injury or property damage that arises out of the insured\u2019s operations, if those losses occur after the operations have been completed and away from the insured\u2019s premises <em>(Berger Bros. Elec. Motors v New Amsterdam Cas. Co., </em>293 NY 523, 527).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
