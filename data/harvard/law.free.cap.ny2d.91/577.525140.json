The amendment of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 effected by section 2 of the Omnibus Act, eliminating <em>Dole </em>claims against employers with limited exceptions, was intended by the Legislature to apply to <em>Dole </em>claims pending at the time of the amendment\u2019s effective date. <em>(Becker v Huss Co., </em>43 NY2d 527; <em>Simonson v International Bank, </em>14 NY2d 281; <em>Matter of Duell v Condon, </em>84 NY2d 773; <em>Gleason v Gleason, </em>26 NY2d 28; <em>Woollcott v Shubert, </em>217 NY 212; <em>Floyd v New York State Urban Dev.

III. There is not one scintilla of evidence that the Legislature intended the tort immunity to apply retroactively, and, moreover, the legislative history conclusively shows that the Legislature intended that these provisions <em>not </em>apply to pending cases. <em>(Matter of Daniel C., </em>99 AD2d 35, 63 NY2d 927; <em>Woollcott v Shubert, </em>217 NY 212; <em>Matter of Delmar Box Co.

Apart from all other factors, retroactive application would not advance the statute\u2019s intended purposes, and would unfairly penalize parties who had spent thousands of dollars in reliance upon the prior law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b657-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b657-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">This case requires this Court to examine whether certain amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law should be construed as retroactively applicable to pending actions. We conclude that the Appellate Division properly held that the relevant provisions of the new legislation should not apply to actions pending on the effective date of the amendments. Rather, the provisions should be applied prospectively to actions filed postenactment. Thus, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As alleged in the complaint, plaintiff was employed by third-party defendant Adirondack Mechanical Corporation (AMC). On October 26, 1994, plaintiff was assigned by AMC to perform certain repair work at a school operated and maintained by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fendant Broadalbin-Perth Central School District. AMC had contracted with defendant for the completion of this work.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">While performing the assigned repair work on the school\u2019s premises, plaintiff fell from an allegedly defective ladder which had been provided by defendant. Plaintiff commenced a lawsuit on December 20, 1995 against defendant to recover for his personal injuries based upon claimed violations of Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200 and 240 (1). On January 29, 1996, defendant commenced a third-party action against AMC which alleged that AMC had negligently supervised and failed to protect its employee. Defendant further claimed that AMC owed defendant a duty of contribution and/or indemnification for damages plaintiff might recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">On July 12, 1996, new legislation, commonly referred to as the Omnibus Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1996, was passed which amended Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 to provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201c[a]n employer shall not be liable for contribution or indemnity to any third person based upon liability for injuries sustained by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment for such employer unless such third person proves through competent medical evidence that such employee has sustained a \u2018grave injury\u2019 \u201d (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a72).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">However, the amendments did not affect the power of a third party to recover under express contractual obligations between the employer and the third party <em>(id.). </em>The legislation was signed into law by Governor Pataki on September 10, 1996 with the relevant portions of the Act designated to \u201ctake effect immediately.\u201d Thereafter, on September 20, 1996, AMC filed a motion for summary judgment against the third-party complaint arguing that the action for contribution and/or indemnification was now barred by the recent enactment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Finding that the legislation was to have retroactive application to pending actions, Supreme Court granted AMC\u2019s summary judgment motion and dismissed the third-party complaint. In reversing and denying AMC\u2019s motion, the Appellate Division concluded \u201cthat the clear legislative intent underlying sections 2 through 9 of the Omnibus Act was that those provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sions apply prospectively only\u201d (231 AD2d 102, 111). That Court certified the following question to this Court: \u201cDid this court err as a matter of law in reversing the order of the Supreme Court and denying the third-party defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment?\u201d We answer that question in the negative, and affirm the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cIt is fundamental that a court, in interpreting a statute, should attempt to effectuate the intent of the Legislature\u201d <em>(Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205, 208; <em>see also, Longines-Wittnauer v Barnes &amp; Reinecke, </em>15 NY2d 443, 453). As the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text, the starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself, giving effect to the plain meaning thereof. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cIn construing statutes, it is a well-established rule that resort must be had to the natural signification of the words employed, and if they have a definite meaning, which involves no absurdity or contradiction, there is no room for construction and courts have no right to add to or take away from that meaning\u201d <em>(Tompkins v Hunter, </em>149 NY 117, 122-123; <em>see also, Matter of Raritan Dev. Corp. v Silva, </em>91 NY2d 98).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Here, the Act says only that the subject provisions are to \u201ctake effect immediately\u201d (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 90). However, the date that legislation is to take effect is a separate question from whether the statute should apply to claims and rights then in existence <em>(see, Shielcrawt v Moffett, </em>294 NY 180 [separately analyzing retroactive or prospective application of a statute enacted to \u201ctake effect immediately\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">While the fact that a statute is to take effect immediately \u201cevinces a sense of urgency,\u201d \u201cthe meaning of the phrase is equivocal\u201d in an analysis of retroactivity <em>(Becker v Huss Co., </em>43 NY2d 527, 541). In fact, we noted in <em>Becker </em>that \u201c[identical language in other acts has not been enough to require application to pending litigation\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 541). Here, the significance of the effective date upon our analysis of the reach of the subject provisions is further obscured because the Legislature explicitly designated prospective or retroactive application for other provisions of the Act not at issue here (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 90). Under the circumstances, the proviso that the subject provisions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>to \u201ctake effect immediately\u201d contributes little to our understanding of whether retroactive application was intended on the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that retroactive operation is not favored by courts and statutes will not be given such construction unless the language expressly or by necessary implication requires it (see, <em>Jacobus v Colgate, </em>217 NY 235, 240 [Cardozo, J.] [\u201cIt takes a clear expression of the legislative purpose to justify a retroactive application\u201d]; <em>Landgraf v USI Film Prods., </em>511 US 244, 265 [\u201cthe presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic\u201d]). An equally settled maxim is that \u201cremedial\u201d legislation or statutes governing procedural matters should be applied retroactively <em>(see, Matter of OnBank &amp; Trust Co., </em>90 NY2d 725, 730; <em>Becker v Huss Co., supra, </em>43 NY2d, at 540).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">However, such construction principles are merely navigational tools to discern legislative intent. Classifying a statute as \u201cremedial\u201d does not automatically overcome the strong presumption of prospectivity since the term may broadly encompass any attempt to \u201csupply some defect or abridge some superfluity in the former law\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 321). As we have cautioned, \u201cGeneral principles may serve as guides in the search for the intention of the Legislature in a particular case but only where better guides are not available\u201d <em>(Shielcrawt v Moffett, supra, </em>294 NY, at 189; <em>see also, Matter of OnBank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>90 NY2d, at 730; <em>Becker v Huss Co., supra, </em>43 NY2d, at 540). To that end, we turn to legislative history to steer our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It is clear that one of the key purposes of the Act was the legislative modification of <em>Dole v Dow Chem. Co. </em>(30 NY2d 143) insofar as that case related to third-party actions against employers. That intention was repeatedly expressed by all sides during the legislative debates and is included in the official statement of intent <em>(see, </em>L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 1 [\u201cIt is the further intent of the legislature to create a system which protects injured workers and delivers wage replacement benefits in a fair, equitable and efficient manner, while reducing time-consuming bureaucratic delays, and repealing <em>Dole </em>liability except in cases of grave injury.\u201d]). In <em>Dole, </em>this Court examined the share of losses to be apportioned between joint tortfeasors. Notwithstanding which tortfeasor was sued by an injured plaintiff, this Court concluded that the defendant, if found liable, could recover a proportionate share from a joint tortfea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>sor. As we stated, \u201cwhere a third party is found to have been responsible for a part, but not all, of the negligence for which a defendant is cast in damages, the responsibility for that part is recoverable by the prime defendant against the third party\u201d <em>(Dole v Dow Chem. Co., supra, </em>30 NY2d, at 148-149; <em>see also, Raquel v Braun, </em>90 NY2d 177, 182). Such equitable principles are codified in article 14 of the CPLR.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In <em>Dole, </em>the plaintiff was the employee of the third-party defendant so no recovery could be had against the employer by the employee or \u201canyone otherwise entitled to recover damages * <em>* * </em>on account of such injury or death\u201d under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. Nevertheless, we extended our reasoning concerning the apportionment of liability to allow contribution or indemnification from an employer even though the employer could not have been liable directly to a plaintiff who had chosen to sue the joint tortfeasor. It was this part of the decision that proved most controversial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">With the recent passage of the Act, the Legislature endeavored to clarify and restore</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cthe force of \u2018exclusive remedy\u2019 (or \u2018no fault\u2019) provisions. Specifically, amendments would protect employers and their employees from other than contract-based suits for contribution or indemnity by third parties (such as equipment manufacturers which have been deemed liable for causing employees injuries or deaths) \u2014 in effect, repealing the doctrine of <em>Dole\u201d </em>(Assembly Mem in Support, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2562).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Memoranda issued contemporaneously with the passing and signing of the Act provided that \u201cthe exclusive remedy\u201d would be \u201crestored and reinforced\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 2565; <em>see also, </em>Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1915). In an analysis of retroactive application, we have found it relevant when the legislative history reveals that the purpose of new legislation is to clarify what the law was always meant to say and do <em>(see, Matter of OnBank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>90 NY2d, at 731). However, labeling the legislation as \u201cremedial\u201d in this regard is not dispositive in light of other indicators of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">For example, legislators made declarations during floor debates that conclusively state that the Act was not intended to be applied retroactively (231 AD2d, at 109). Moreover, a report entitled \u201cNew York State Assembly Majority Task Force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>on Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform\u201d explicitly states (at 25) that the provisions would apply only to \u201caccidents that occur [after the effective] date forward,\u201d and was \u201cnot intended to limit the rights of parties to a lawsuit filed after the law takes effect, but involving a claim arising from an accident that occurred before the law took effect.\u201d Although these averments \u201cmay be accorded some weight in the absence of more definitive manifestations of legislative purpose\u201d <em>(Schultz v Harrison Radiator Div. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>90 NY2d 311, 318), such indicators of legislative intent must be cautiously used <em>(see, Woollcott v Shubert, </em>217 NY 212, 221 [\u201cstatements and opinions of legislators uttered in the debates are not competent aids to the court in ascertaining the meaning of statutes\u201d]). As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cit is impossible to determine with certainty what construction was put upon an act by the members of a legislative body that passed it by resorting to the speeches of individual members thereof. Those who did not speak may not have agreed with those who did; and those who spoke might differ from each other\u201d <em>(United States v Freight Assn., </em>166 US 290, 318).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">On the same footing are statements contained in the Governor\u2019s Memorandum issued with the signing of the Act. In it, the Governor states his view that the legislation was intended to be retroactive (1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1912 [\u201c(o)f primary importance is the retroactive repeal\u201d of <em>Dole]). </em>The Governor further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cThis new system, which takes effect immediately, is enacted with the specific intent of maximizing savings in workers\u2019 compensation premiums through its application to all cases currently pending in the courts of our State wherein the primary action has neither been settled nor reduced to judgment\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 1913).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Although postenactment statements of the Governor may be examined in an analysis of legislative intent and statutory purpose <em>(see, e.g., Crane Neck Assn. v New York City / Long Is. County Servs. Group, </em>61 NY2d 154 [relying upon gubernatorial memoranda]; <em>see also, </em>Killenbeck, A <em>Matter of Mere Approval? The Role of the President in the Creation of Legislative History, </em>48 Ark L Rev 239), such statements suffer from the same infirmities as those made during floor debates by legislators. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Here, the reports and memoranda simply indicate that various people had various views.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Importantly, we note that the initial draft of the Act expressly provided that it would apply to <em>\u201clawsuit[s] [that have] neither been settled nor reduced to judgment\u201d </em>by the date of its enactment (231 AD2d, at 107). That language does not appear in the enacted version. A court may examine changes made in proposed legislation to determine intent <em>(see, United States v St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba Ry. Co., </em>247 US 310, 318; <em>Woollcott v Shubert, supra, </em>217 NY, at 221; <em>People v Korkala, </em>99 AD2d 161, 166 [\u201crejection of a specific statutory provision is a significant consideration when divining legislative intent\u201d]). Here, such evidence is consistent with the strong presumption of prospective application in the absence of a clear statement concerning retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Appellant points to the general principle that legislation is to be interpreted so as to give effect to every provision. A construction that would render a provision superfluous is to be avoided <em>(Matter of OnBank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>90 NY2d, at 731; McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 98 [a]). In this regard, appellant argues that sections 87 and 88 of the Act would be rendered meaningless if the provisions concerning third-party contribution claims were not applied retroactively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Section 88 of the Act mandates an audit of all workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers and the State Insurance Fund to determine \u201cthe value as of December 31, 1996 of any reduction in reserves, hereinafter referred to as the reserve adjustment, required to be established for losses or claims pursuant to section 1303 of the insurance law and, concerning the state insurance fund, section 88 of the workers\u2019 compensation law that result from the application\u201d of the Act\u2019s provisions related to <em>Dole </em>liability (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 88 [a]). Section 87 of the Act imposes a $98 million \u201cspecial assessment\u201d on all licensed workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers that is to be deposited in the general fund of the State (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 87). There is nothing in the law itself indicating the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>for the assessment or the intent behind these sections of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Section 88 refers to \u201creserves * * * required to be established for losses or claims pursuant to section 1303 of the insurance law.\u201d The referenced provision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c[e]very insurer shall * * * maintain reserves in an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for the payment of all losses or claims incurred on or prior to the date of statement, <em>whether reported or unreported, </em>which are unpaid as of such date and for which such insurer may be liable, and also reserves in an amount estimated to provide for the expenses of adjustment or settlement of such losses or claims\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 1303 [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Plainly, the statute requires insurers to set aside \u201creserves\u201d for losses or claims that have been incurred but not reported to the company. Such reserves are calculated actuarially based upon a statistical analysis of the insurance company\u2019s loss experience (se<em>e, Matter of Stewart [Citizens Cas. Co.], </em>23 NY2d 407, 414-415). Examined under the circumstances presented, workers\u2019 compensation carriers are required to maintain reserves for (1) reported and expected <em>Dole </em>losses on pending actions; and (2) anticipated <em>Dole </em>losses on claims already incurred but not yet reported or asserted. If the new amendments were applied prospectively, the second category of <em>Dole </em>losses would, by and large, never materialize and the reserves set aside to cover such claims would be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">However, that \u201creduction\u201d is mathematically related to monies already collected by carriers via the payment of premiums. The Legislature apparently decided that the State should receive such \u201creduction in reserves\u201d rather than permit insurers to retain the monies. As noted in the \u201cNew York State Assembly Majority Task Force on Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform\u201d report (at 31):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201cAs a result of the changes in employer liability enacted <em>{Dole), </em>carriers would be collecting more premium than actuarial [sic] needed. As a result, the legislation provides that this money be returned to the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">While the elimination of pending <em>Dole </em>claims might lead to a maximum reduction in insurance reserves, there is some reduction in reserves even upon a prospective application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>legislation. Thus, sections 87 and 88 of the Act would not be rendered meaningless in the absence of retroactive application. Indeed, it is impossible to determine from the record provided how the Legislature actually derived $98 million as the amount of the \u201cspecial assessment.\u201d As for whether these accounting provisions necessitate the wholesale dismissal of pending <em>Dole </em>claims, we are reluctant to assume that the Legislature would choose such a vexing and circuitous means of conveying that intent\".</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">We further note our agreement with the statement made by the Appellate Division in <em>Morales v Gross </em>(230 AD2d 7) that the \u201cpurpose of the subject provisions was to abolish most third-party actions so as to enhance the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, thereby reducing insurance premiums and decreasing the cost of doing business in New York\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 12). An extensive subject of discussion in the floor debates surrounding the subject legislation was how employers of New York have been forced to pay the highest insurance premiums in the country due, in part, to the possibility of third-party contribution/indemnification claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Prospective application of the legislation would still accomplish the legislative purpose of reducing insurance premiums and workers\u2019 compensation costs for employers and, in that way, assist \u201cour State\u2019s ability to attract and maintain businesses and jobs\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1912). Current employers would presumably realize future savings through the elimination of <em>Dole </em>claims and the consequent reduction in insurance premiums.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, prospective application still enables the payment of substantial sums to the State by insurance companies who have, indirectly, benefitted from the reduction of reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">That a statute is to be applied prospectively is strongly presumed and here, we find nothing that approaches any type of \u201cclear\u201d expression of legislative intent concerning retroactive application. Indeed, other than the Governor\u2019s statements, the direct evidence concerning retroactivity is either against that view or equivocal. Moreover, the discernible legislative purpose does not mandate a particular result. \u201cIn the end, it is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>considerations of good sense and justice that the solution must be found\u201d <em>(Matter of Berkovitz v Arbib &amp; Houlberg, </em>230 NY 261, 271 [Cardozo, J.]) in the specific circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We conclude that, irrespective of the date of the accident, a prospective application of the subject legislation to actions by employees for on-the-job injuries against third parties filed after the effective date of the relevant provisions is eminently consistent with the over-all and specific legislative goals behind passage of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\">. Not at issue is whether the plaintiffs injuries qualify as \u201cgrave\u201d within the meaning of the newly amended Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. Under the circumstances, little weight should be accorded to the post-passage opinions of the Department of Insurance and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board concerning the reach of the legislation (see, Mem of Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, Susan Gravlich, Secretary, dated Aug. 8, 1996, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 635, at 2; Letter of Department of Insurance, Edward Muhl, Superintendent, dated Aug. 9, 1996, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 635, at 8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. The Compensation Insurance Rating Board estimated that the change in employer liability will save employers approximately 3.2% in premium (see, Report of \u201cNew York State Assembly Majority Task Force on Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform\u201d, at 31).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
