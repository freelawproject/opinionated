Specifically at issue is the decision to utilize the \u201cincome first\u201d method rather than the \u201cresource first\u201d method to determine eligibility for Medicaid. Because we conclude that the statutes are ambiguous and do not resolve the issue presented; that the income first method is premised upon a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions and is consistent with the underlying policy of the Medicaid statute, there should be a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Medicaid is a medical assistance program established by title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 USC \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq.), </em>implemented in New York by article 5, title 11 of the Social Services Law, and jointly funded by this State and the Federal Government. The program\u2019s purpose is to pay for necessary medical care for those eligible individuals whose income and resources do not allow them to meet the costs of their medical needs. New York\u2019s Medicaid plan, like those of all States, must conform with the Federal statutory standards in order for the State to receive Federal program funding. The Medicaid program is administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the auspices of the Health Care Financing Administration and, locally, by the New York State Department of Social Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In 1988, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA) (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5, as added by Pub L 100-360, 102 US Stat 754) to address a perceived flaw in the Medicaid program which compelled a couple to liquidate virtually all of their joint resources before an institutionalized spouse could become eligible for Medicaid. In doing so, the non-institutionalized spouse, referred to as the community spouse, was left with little or no income to meet his or her daily needs <em>(see, Matter of Schachner v Perales, </em>85 NY2d 316, 319). The MCCA sought \u201c \u2018to end th[e] pauperization [of the community spouse] by assuring that [he or she] has a sufficient \u2014 but not excessive \u2014 amount of income and resources\u2019 \u201d to live comfortably when the other spouse was institutionalized <em>(see, id., </em>at 323 [quoting HR Rep No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong, 2d Sess 65]). At the State level, Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c implements this goal and serves also \u201cto protect the community spouse from financial disaster when the primary income-providing spouse becomes institutionalized\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Schachner v Perales, supra, </em>at 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Consequently, the Act requires that the community spouse be allotted a minimum level of monthly income referred to as the \u201cminimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d or \u201cmonthly need\u201d <em>(see, </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [d] [3]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [h]). The community spouse is also granted a \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d to protect him or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>from being forced to spend down owned assets to qualify the institutionalized spouse for Medicaid (see, 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [f] [2]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [d]). Only resources of the couple in excess of the community spouse resource allowance are taken into account in determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s eligibility (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [c] [2]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute also allows transfers from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse to raise the community spouse\u2019s income up to the level of the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance (Social Security Act [42 USC] \u00a7 1396r-5 [d] [1] [B]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [4] [b]). If either spouse is dissatisfied with the community spouse resource allowance determination, he or she may request a \u201cfair hearing\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the instant case, petitioner\u2019s husband, Floyd Golf, was admitted to a nursing home in January 1993. After his death in August 1993, Mrs. Golf petitioned the Monroe County Department of Social Services for Medicaid benefits for payment of nursing home expenses incurred by her husband for two of the months he resided at the nursing home. Applying the aforementioned statutory rules, the agency established that the couple had combined resources of $105,763.60. Of that amount, $86,855.25 was attributed by the agency to Mrs. Golf and $18,908.35 was attributed by the agency to her husband. Mrs. Golf, as the community spouse, was entitled to retain a community spouse resource allowance of $70,740 and required a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance of $1,769. However, she actually received a monthly income of only $1,379.06. The local agency determined that Mr. Golf had actual excess resources, after standard deductions, totaling $13,100 and had a monthly income of $1,319.58. Given these calculations, it was evident that Mrs. Golfs actual monthly income was less than her established monthly need (minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance) of $1,769.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Because of this shortfall between Mrs. Golfs actual income and her monthly need, the agency determined that Mr. Golf could transfer income and resources to his wife in order to raise her income to the monthly need level. Monroe County DSS first deducted $389.94 from Mr. Golfs income and transferred that amount to Mrs. Golf, and in so doing, raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>her monthly income to the required monthly need level of $1,769. After doing so, however, the local agency deemed Mr. Golf ineligible for Medicaid for the two months for which he sought coverage because he had $13,100 in excess resources. It denied Mrs. Golfs petition for Medicaid assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">At the fair hearing to review the local agency\u2019s determination, Mrs. Golf argued that the agency\u2019s decision to utilize the income first method \u2014 i.e., its decision to first transfer some of Mr. Golfs (the institutionalized spouse) income to her (the community spouse) to meet a shortfall in her monthly income need and then to determine his eligibility \u2014 was error. Instead, she asserts, the agency should have utilized the resource first method. Specifically, if applying the resource first method, the agency first should have allocated all or a portion of her husband\u2019s excess resources (the $13,100) to her and allowed her to retain any income generated by those excess resources in an effort to increase her monthly income to the appropriate level. Petitioner further asserted that if a community spouse\u2019s resource level is increased by the inclusion of all of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s excess resources and the community spouse\u2019s income level remains below the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance then, posteligibility, the community spouse is to be allocated a sufficient amount of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income. This, argues Mrs. Golf, is what should have occurred in her case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Thus, the crux of petitioner\u2019s argument \u2014 and the fundamental distinction between the two methods \u2014 is that once a shortfall in Mrs. Golfs monthly need was evident, the agency should have transferred to Mrs. Golf all of her husband\u2019s excess resources as a way of raising her income to close the shortfall. Next, the agency should have examined Mr. Golfs eligibility status. Because he would then be resourceless, he should have been deemed eligible for Medicaid assistance. Finally, after being deemed eligible, the agency could have, and should have, transferred a portion of Mr. Golfs income to Mrs. Golf to close the shortfall in her monthly need. However, in this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Monroe County DSS left untouched Mr. Golfs resources and instead first transferred a portion of his income to his wife to meet the shortfall in her monthly need. Once this transfer was complete, and Mrs. Golfs monthly need was met, the agency next examined Mr. Golfs eligibility for Medicaid. It deemed him ineligible because of the excess amount of resources\u2014 totaling $13,100 \u2014 in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments were rejected by the New York State Department of Social Services and the agency\u2019s application of the income first method was sustained on the ground that the pertinent laws and regulations did not require a contrary result. Petitioner then commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul the State\u2019s determination. Supreme Court denied the application, holding that the State\u2019s determination was not arbitrary and capricious since the statutes in question did not definitively require the utilization of either the \u201cresource first\u201d or \u201cincome first\u201d method. The Appellate Division unanimously reversed. It held that the State DSS erred in not employing a \u201cresource first\u201d method in determining eligibility. On remittal, Supreme Court awarded judgment to the petitioner. Respondents sought leave to appeal directly from this Supreme Court judgment and leave was granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In this case, we are called upon to construe a Federal statutory provision and its functionally identical State corollary. Petitioner asserts that the pertinent statutory provisions are clear, explicit, and unambiguous and, if read logically and sequentially, mandate that the resource first method be applied. Indeed, according to petitioner, no other rational or reasonable interpretation may be distilled from the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We disagree. While petitioner has asserted one credible interpretation of the State and Federal statutes, it cannot be said that the legislative scheme plainly and unequivocally requires the application of only the \u201cresource first\u201d rule. While at least one other jurisdiction has held otherwise (see, <em>e.g., Gruber v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., </em>98 Ohio App 3d 72, 647 NE2d 861 [1994], <em>appeal denied </em>71 Ohio St 3d 1493, 646 NE2d 468; <em>Kimnach v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., </em>96 Ohio App 3d 640, 645 NE2d 825 [1994], <em>appeal denied sub nom. In re Kimnach, </em>71 Ohio St 3d 1447, 644 NE2d 409), in fact the Federal and State statutes lend themselves to two acceptable interpretations. Thus, we conclude that the language and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>purpose of the statutes permit the application of an \u201cincome first\u201d method.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The reasonableness of the agency\u2019s decision to attribute income rather than resources to the community spouse from the institutionalized spouse and to do so prior to determining the eligibility of the institutionalized spouse is evident. First, it cannot be said that the spousal impoverishment provisions are clear and unambiguous on the issue presented. In fact, the statute is entirely silent on whether the \u201cincome first\u201d or \u201cresource first\u201d method should be utilized. The relevant statutory provision provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cIf either such spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an allowance) is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance under subsection (f)(2) of this section, an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e] [2] [C]; see <em>also, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [c]; 18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Petitioner argues that the \u201ccommunity spouse\u2019s income\u201d referenced in this section is limited to the community spouse\u2019s personal income as outlined by the rules for the treatment of income in subsection (b) (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and cannot include income available to the community spouse \u2014 such as the \u201ccommunity spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>monthly income allowance\u201d \u2014 through subsection (d) (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The community spouse monthly income allowance is simply the amount by which the community spouse\u2019s monthly need exceeds the monthly income available to him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">However, the language of the Federal statute is not so restricted. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s construction is undermined by the simple fact that the attribution-of-income rules outlined in subsection (b) (2) do not reference or, by their own terms, apply to the allocation of resources, which is the subject of subsection (e) (2) (C). As the Federal District Court in <em>Cleary v Waldman </em>(959 F Supp 222) reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cIn light of the detailed provisions of subsection (d) designed to make available to the community spouse as much, but only as much, of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income as necessary to ensure her monthly need, it would be anomalous to construe subsection (e) (2) (C) in such a manner as to exclude the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income from the calculation and substitute for it resources which would provide the needed income to ensure that the community spouse received her monthly needs allowance\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 232).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Nor does petitioner point to any compelling evidence that Congress intended the attribution of income from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse to be made only after eligibility had been determined. Subsections (b) and (d) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the Act do not \u201cprescribe a sequential restriction on income attribution\u201d <em>(Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>425 Mass 738, 746, 682 NE2d 874, 879 [1997]). We concur with the view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201c[w]hile it is true that subsections (b) (2) and (d) apply \u2018after\u2019 eligibility has been determined, this does not mean that income can be deemed to the community spouse \u2018only\u2019 after eligibility has been determined. * * * Rather, subsections (b) (2) and (d) can be interpreted as a framework for protecting income for the community spouse by limiting the amount of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income which must be used to pay medical costs after the latter is determined eligible\u201d (425 Mass, at 746-747, 682 NE2d, at 879).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">There is simply no evidence stemming from the statutory language or legislative history which definitively demonstrates that the statute prohibits the attribution of income to the community spouse for eligibility purposes. Absent such an express or implied limitation, an agency\u2019s decision to attribute income to the community spouse under subsection (e) (2) (C) was not arbitrary or capricious <em>(see, Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, supra, </em>425 Mass, at 746-747, 682 NE2d, at 879-880; <em>see also, Cleary v Waldman, supra, </em>at 232).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Second, the policy objectives underlying the spousal impoverishment provisions are met by an application of the income first method. As previously stated, the MCCA was enacted to ensure that the community spouse was provided with an income above the poverty level <em>(see, Matter of Schachner v Perales, </em>85 NY2d 316, 323, <em>supra </em>[\u201cManifestly, the narrow purpose of the legislation providing for the spousal allowance is to protect the community spouse from financial disaster\u201d]). It was not intended to offer a financial boon for applicants or to provide a route upon which one could bypass the obligation to contribute one\u2019s fair share of the costs associated with nursing home care. An agency\u2019s transfer of income, rather than resources, to the community spouse effectively serves the dual goals of ensuring that the community spouse would live comfortably and of protecting against the depletion of limited Medicaid resources by individuals capable of helping themselves <em>(see, Cleary v Waldman, supra, </em>at 232 [the income first model prevents the creation of \u201can endowment which not only provides the needed income but also creates a fund which can be passed on to the community spouse\u2019s heirs\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In so holding, we also reject petitioner\u2019s policy argument that application of the income first method would not offer a community spouse the protection intended by the legislation. More specifically, Mrs. Golf maintains that if the institutionalized spouse predeceases the community spouse (as happened here), the income which the community spouse was receiving from the institutionalized spouse could very well terminate, thereby leaving the community spouse with less income than the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance which he or she was receiving prior to the death of the institutionalized spouse. Petitioner\u2019s argument is speculative. It is equally true that the community spouse may die first; or if the institutionalized spouse dies first, his or her income may become available to the community spouse, thereby actually increasing the aggregate income of the community spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">More significantly, as respondent agency correctly asserted, the Medicaid statute in question serves to prevent the impoverishment of the community spouse \u201cwhile the institutionalized spouse is in a nursing home at Medicaid expense\u201d <em>(Matter of Schachner v Perales, supra, </em>at 323 [citation omitted]). Once the institutionalized spouse dies and his or her Medicaid eligibility terminates, that spouse is no longer within the purview of the Medicaid statute. Given the limited scope of the spousal impoverishment amendments, and the Medicaid statute\u2019s silence with respect to the question whether or how States should account for the risk that the institutionalized spouse might predecease the community spouse, it would be inappropriate to hinge the validity of the income first method on such a worst-case scenario.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Finally, we note that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Federal agency responsible for administering the Medicaid statute, has issued a policy statement asserting that \u201cStates have the option to use the \u2018income first\u2019 rule or to apply some other reasonable interpretation of the law until we have issued final regulations which specifically address this issue\u201d (Letter from Sally K. Richardson, Director, Medicaid Bureau, Health Care Financing Administration, to All Regional Administrators [Mar. 3, 1994]). We have previously stated that where an agency\u2019s determination \u201cis not only consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the governing statutes and regulations but also comports with the conclusion reached by [HCFA] \u2014 the Federal agency charged with interpreting Medicaid requirements\u201d <em>(Cricchio v Pennisi, </em>90 NY2d 296, 309) that determination is entitled to deference. Such is the case here. Moreover, given the fundamental ambiguity of the relevant statutory provisions, deference is appropriately given to the State agency\u2019s interpretation in this case (see, <em>Paramount Communications v Gibraltar Cas. Co., </em>90 NY2d 507, 513-514; <em>see also, Matter of Jennings v New York State Off. of Mental Health, </em>90 NY2d 227, 239-240).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We conclude that the dissent\u2019s reliance on certain language in Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (c) or on the virtually identical regulation promulgated at 18 NYCRR 360-4.10 (c) (7), as evidence supporting the proposition that the resource first method is mandated, is misplaced. We note again that both the State Social Services Law and the regulation are, essentially, the State statutory and regulatory counterparts to 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) \u2014 the very Federal statutory provision we construe here. As stated in the notice published when the regulation was promulgated, \u201cChapter 558 of the Laws of 1989 [Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c] conformed the SSL to the Medicaid requirements of the Federal Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) relating to transfers of resources and to the treatment of income and resources of institutionalized persons and their spouses in the community. The proposed regulatory amendments are necessary to implement Chapter 558\u201d (New York State Register, Oct. 17, 1990, at 39). Thus, the language of the regulation, and the State statute, present and frame the same issue we address herein; neither the language of the Social Services Law nor the regulation clearly resolves the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">As the dissent concedes (dissenting opn, at 675-676), the language of the Federal statute and regulations is ambiguous and does not dictate whether the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income or resources should be transferred first in meeting the community spouse\u2019s minimum income needs. The dissent, however, relies on a difference between the language of 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (c) and argues that the difference renders the State statute clear where the Federal is ambiguous. These provisions provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201cIf either such spouse establishes that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>munity spouse resource allowance (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an allowance) is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance under subsection (f)(2) of this section, <em>an amount </em>adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e] [2] [C] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cIf either spouse establishes that income generated by the community spouse resource allowance, established by the social services district, is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, the department shall establish <em>a resource allowance </em>for the spousal share of the institutionalized spouse adequate to provide such minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [c] [emphasis added]; <em>see also, </em>18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7] [clearly contemplating a transfer of resources under this provision]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Although the dissent finds the above-emphasized language to be dispositive, it does nothing more than show that these provisions address only a transfer of resources. This does not alter the ultimate conclusion that this provision does not dictate the resource first methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Concededly, this provision, under both Federal and State statutory frameworks, <em>is </em>clearly designed to permit the transfer of resources at the preeligibility stage. But, demonstrably, neither provision dictates whether income allocation should or should not precede resource allocation. The word \u201camount\u201d in the Federal statute is not the source of the ambiguity here. Instead, as we previously pointed out (see, majority opn, at 663-664), the ambiguity lies in the language of the critical test, <em>which is identical </em>in both statutes, namely whether the income generated by the resource allowance \u201c \u2018is inadequate to raise <em>the community spouse\u2019s income </em>to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 663 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">This ambiguity, not the ambiguity of the word \u201camount,\u201d is the fulcrum of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Cleary v Waldman </em>(959 F Supp 222, <em>supra), </em>where it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">\u201cAt issue is <em>what may be included in \u2018the com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>munity spouse\u2019s income\u2019 </em>within the meaning of subsection (e) (2) (C). The State contends that the statute permits it to consider any income which the husband can transfer to the wife to meet her needs before allowing the husband to transfer additional resources under subsection (e) (2) (C). The plaintiffs contend that only her personal income may be considered for subsection (e) (2) (C) purposes, and that the statute mandates a transfer of resources from the husband in an amount sufficient to generate income to make up any shortfall\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 228 [emphasis added]; <em>see also, Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, supra, </em>425 Mass, at 747, 682 NE2d, at 879-880).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">As the above-emphasized language clearly indicates, the ambiguity identified in the Federal statute and relied upon to support the administrative determination to allocate income to the community spouse before doing a resource allocation is not in the meaning of \u201camount,\u201d as the dissent claims, but is in the meaning of \u201ccommunity spouse\u2019s income.\u201d Since the latter phrase is used in exactly the same way in the State statute as it is in the Federal, the same reasoning supports the State agency\u2019s determination to allocate income first.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Thus, what is unclear is not the fact that 42 \u00a7 USC 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (c) speak to the transfer of resources at the preeligibility stage, but whether that transfer takes place before or after the creation of the community spouse monthly income allowance (CSMIA). It is undisputed that the statutes contemplate the transfer of income between spouses at some point <em>(see, </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [d] [defining the CSMIA as an amount to be transferred from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse to bring the community spouse\u2019s income up to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [g] [same]). Critical to an affirmance, however, is the fact that neither the Federal nor State statute provides for <em>when </em>such a transfer takes place \u2014 preeligibility (and preresource transfer) or posteligibility \u2014 and therein lies the room for agency interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The dissent\u2019s reliance on Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (3) and (4) for the proposition that the State statute only permits income transfers between spouses in the posteligibility stage is unpersuasive <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 679, 680-681). Section 366-c (3) states that its provisions are to be employed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>purposes of \u201cdetermining the availability of income <em>to an institutionalized spouse </em>in determining eligibility for medical assistance\u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus, by its own express terms, the purpose of section 366-c (3) is to address issues of <em>income eligibility of the institutionalized spouse. </em>Income eligibility is not at issue here where the case exclusively turns on the resource eligibility of the institutionalized spouse. Furthermore, section 366-c (3) is totally unrelated to establishing or calculating the CSMIA, which is critical to deciding whether the State agency properly determined resource eligibility of the institutionalized spouse here. Rather, all it seems to accomplish is to ensure that when determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income for eligibility purposes, there is no attribution from the community spouse\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Section 366-c (4) \u2014 the other section relied upon by the dissent as demonstrating that income allocation occurs posteligibility \u2014 also has little to do with that issue. Again, by its own terms, the purpose of the subdivision is to decide how much of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income will be used for that spouse\u2019s medical care once eligibility has been determined. It does not address <em>when </em>a transfer of spousal income is made to meet the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance of the community spouse. Indeed, if anything, it suggests an earlier transfer of such income in that it specifically provides that the CSMIA comes out of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s income before any of that income goes to the health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The dissent also cites to Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (b). It appears that this citation is meant to reinforce the proposition that no income transfers from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse are permitted prior to the determination of eligibility <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 679). However, section 366-c (8) (b) of the Social Services Law outlines the requirements for obtaining an <em>increase </em>in the monthly need level; it does not speak to raising a community spouse\u2019s income to the <em>existing </em>monthly need level, the issue presented here. Were we even to assume that section 366-c (8) (b) has some relevance to the specific issue on appeal, clearly, this provision of the statute does not provide the \u201conly\u201d means to effectuate an income transfer from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [g] [statute permitting interspousal income transfer has no cross-reference to section 366-c (8) (b)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Finally, it is important to note that it is not surprising that the statutes specifically provide for preeligibility resource <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>transfers, but are silent as to the stage when income transfers are to be made. With regard to the former, the Legislature had to specifically provide for resource transfers at the preeligibility stage to prevent the exhaustion of such resources prior to any necessary transfers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Income, however, will not be exhausted in the same manner because it is recurrent in nature. Indeed, income allocations, even when made prior to the initial eligibility determination, must continue to be made periodically thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In sum, because the relevant statutory provisions are ambiguous, we sustain the decision of Monroe County DSS to utilize an income first method to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. We, too, share the dissent\u2019s concern for the frustrations experienced by this State\u2019s senior citizens and its social service administrators as they maneuver through a maze of complex and ill-defined laws. But, in holding that the statutes do not mandate the transfer of resources first, we are mindful that the policy of the law is to prevent impoverishment of the community spouse; it is not to permit the sheltering of personal wealth at public expense. To the extent that the income first method preserves the public fisc, clearly such a result inures to the benefit of all New York senior citizens in that additional resources are more readily available to meet the needs of eligible applicants. Application of the resource first rule, in circumstances involving a spouse with no personal income, would permit the transfer of several hundred thousand dollars over and above the standard resource allowance, enabling the institutionalized spouse to qualify more readily for Medicaid. Even in a case such as the one before us, the community spouse\u2019s need for a few hundred dollars in monthly income would have allowed (assuming a 5 or 6% return) the transfer of more than $100,000 from the institutionalized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>spouse. Such a result might well be desirable. However, this policy choice and mandate should come unambiguously from the Legislature. Indeed, in Massachusetts, that State\u2019s lawmaking body amended its statute to make clear its intention and its preference for the resource first method. It cannot be said that the New York Legislature has done the same, and thus the State agency acted properly in utilizing the income first method.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of Supreme Court appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be reversed, without costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">.

The dissent points to various statutory provisions which the State may utilize in order to recoup any monies inappropriately or disproportionately sheltered by the Medicaid applicant or his or her spouse (see, dissenting opn, at 674). First, it is not clear that the State would have any recourse against a community spouse who, during her lifetime, transfers to her children resources received from the institutionalized spouse under a resource first methodology. Second, the practical difficulties of recoupment should not be lightly dismissed. We reiterate that while the spousal impoverishment provisions serve to support those in medical need, they are not vehicles for enriching the family of an applicant. That some means of recoupment exist is no reason to create opportunities for sheltering assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b748-6\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al0\">(dissenting). My examination of New York State\u2019s statutory and regulatory framework, as applied to this case, leads me to a vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The State statute and its corresponding departmental regulations emanate from the Federal financial font and stewardship of this vast field of Medicaid reimbursement. The New York State implementation warrants the conclusion that its Legislature has indicated its preference for a \u201cresources first\u201d approach to Medicaid eligibility affecting spouses in the situation presented here. Conversely, I discern no legislative authorization whatsoever for the \u201cincome first\u201d method, invoked and used by the Social Services entities, in the particular case application, to narrow the eligibility for benefits to this couple <em>(cf., Seittelman v Sabol, </em>91 NY2d 618, 626 [decided today]).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">On my analysis, until a State change more definitively prescribes otherwise, case-by-case administrative applications ought to be bound by the enacted superior precepts \u2014 statute and regulation \u2014 indicating \u201cresources first.\u201d The bottom-line issue devolves here to statutory interpretation \u2014 a unique nondelegable judicial responsibility, framed within an individual administrative decision. Because the Monroe County Social Services Department and its State agency superintendent, on the fair hearing review, failed to harken to the superior authority sources, their actions were properly nullified by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The agencies rejected the application for Medicaid benefits for the payment of expenses incurred by Floyd Golf during two of the eight months when he was a resident at a Rochester nursing home. He died there in August 1993 at the age of 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">In determining eligibility for Medicaid benefits, the Social Services entities must apportion resources and income, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>consider allowances as between the spouses (see, Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2], [5]). After calculating prescribed allocations, the agencies determined that Eileen Golfs monthly income did not meet the New York minimum monthly maintenance needs level of $1,769. To bring her up to the monthly minimum required, Monroe County Department of Social Services applied an \u201cincome first\u201d accounting formula to allocate $389.94 monthly from, her husband\u2019s Social Security and pension income. This occurred in 1993. The agency resolved that Floyd Golf was ineligible for Medicaid benefits based upon his savings resources of $13,100.11. Those resources were found to be in excess of the mandated $3,150 resource eligibility threshold and his $2,658.24 burial allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">After a fair hearing in 1994, the New York State Department of Social Services upheld the local agency\u2019s denial of benefits. The decision theorized that the institutionalized spouse \u201cwas in receipt of more than enough income from [Social Security, pension, an insurance annuity and savings interest] to allocate to the Community Spouse in order for her to reach the MMMNA.\u201d While State regulations specify that additional resources may be allotted to the community spouse to push her theoretical income up to the minimum level, \u201csuch is not necessary here, given the amount of other income available to her.\u201d It concluded that the argument that \u201cthe Agency must use th[e] income generated by [Mr. Golfs] resources first cannot be accepted. Such language is not found anywhere in the regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">By CPLR article 78 review, the widow sued for annulment of the agency\u2019s determination. Supreme Court denied the relief in 1994, holding that the agency\u2019s determination was not arbitrary or capricious because the pertinent statutes were \u201cunclear that there is any particular way in which you must apply either the resources or the income\u201d to calculate Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed and annulled the agency action (221 AD2d 997 [1995]). It held that based on New York\u2019s statute and the agency\u2019s promulgated regulations, \u201c[t]he resources of the institutionalized spouse should be attributed first to raise the income of the community spouse to the level of the MMMNA before income from the institutionalized spouse is attributed to the community spouse\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 997). I agree with that progressive method of calculation, and with the conclusion that flows from it, as now brought before this Court for review, through the final judgment rendered in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>IL</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">This Court has previously acknowledged that the purpose of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5) is \u201c \u2018to end th[e] pauperization [of the community spouse] by assuring that * * * a sufficient \u2014 but not excessive \u2014 amount of income and resources [are] available\u2019 while the institutionalized spouse is in a nursing home at Medicaid expense\u201d <em>(Matter of Schachner v Perales, </em>85 NY2d 316, 323, quoting HR Rep No. 100-105 [II], 100th Cong, 2d Sess 65, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News 888; <em>Matter of Gomprecht v Gomprecht, </em>86 NY2d 47, 51). This policy helps to minimize the \u201cdraconian results of the Medicaid rules\u201d <em>(Matter of Septuagenarian v Septuagenarian, </em>126 Misc 2d 699, 704). Indeed, \u201cthe primary focus of the legislation was to ensure that \u2018[o]ur senior citizens should not live their golden years in the shadow of impoverishment\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Schachner v Perales, supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 323, quoting Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, L 1989, ch 558, 1989 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2415).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">This spirit of helping New York\u2019s elderly residents is also manifested in the legislative choice to provide maximum allowances permissible within the Federal charter <em>(see, </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1989, ch 558, 1989 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2414-2415; see <em>also, </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [d] [3] [C]; [g]). Notably, this policy goal and implementation received the \u201cstrong! ] support\u201d of the Department of Social Services (DSS) at the time of enactment (see, Mem of Commissioner of DSS, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 558, at 22-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Correspondingly, however, to preserve the public fisc and to guard against disproportionate sheltering or inappropriate dissipation of assets beyond the salutary purposes and resources of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, the State becomes an assignee of any third-party benefits as a prerequisite to eligibility <em>(see, </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396k; Social Services Law \u00a7 366 [4] [h] [1]; 18 NYCRR 360-7.4 [a] [6]). The State may also recoup payments from responsible relatives <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366 [3] [a]). Moreover, with its formidable procedural and litigation resources, the State may promptly pursue the estate of the institutionalized spouse for excess Medicaid benefits paid on behalf of that spouse <em>(see, </em>Pub L 103-66 \u00a7 13612 [1993]; <em>see also, </em>18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [b] [5]; <em>Matter of Craig, </em>82 NY2d 388, 390, 394). Whatever practicalities may circumscribe these tools, the governmental apparatus still always enjoys a potent upper hand over the supplicants for entitlements <em>(compare, e.g., Seit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>telman v Sabol, </em>91 NY2d 618, 626-627, n 2, <em>supra </em>[decided today]).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Importantly too, a State\u2019s Medicaid program must conform to standards prescribed by the Federal statutes and regulations to qualify for national Medicaid funding <em>(Matter of Schachner v Perales, </em>85 NY2d 316, 320, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, in 1989, New York enacted Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c as this State\u2019s counterpart to the spousal allowance provisions of the Federal Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act <em>(id., </em>at 323; <em>see, Matter of Gomprecht v Gomprecht, </em>86 NY2d 47, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The pertinent language of the Federal statute provides that when the income generated by the community spouse resource allowance \u201cis inadequate to raise the community spouses income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there <em>shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance </em>* * * <em>an amount </em>adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance [MMMNA]\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e] [2] [C] [emphasis added]). The Federal structure thus contemplates and offers the choice to the States as to whether a threshold accounting calculation for eligibility should turn on an institutionalized spouse\u2019s income or resources. The applied method and mathematics can have constricting and disparate repercussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Thus, we all acknowledge that, under the fair hearing provisions of the Federal statute, the States may opt either to allocate income or to attribute sufficient and available resources from the institutionalized spouse that would generate income usable by the community spouse to meet the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance <em>(see, </em>Letter from Secretary Shalala, US Dept of Health and Human Servs, to Governor of State of Ohio [Mar. 28, 1995]; Mem of Director, Medicaid Bureau, US Dept of Health and Human Servs to All Regional Administrators [Mar. 3, 1994]; <em>Gruber v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., </em>98 Ohio App 3d 72, 81-83, 647 NE2d 861, 867-868; see <em>also, Cricchio v Pennisi, </em>90 NY2d 296; <em>see generally, </em>Note, <em>Spousal Impoverishment or Enrichment?

They, too, perceived correctly that a State may elect either \u201cresources first\u201d or \u201cincome first;\u201d neither approach would violate or be inconsistent with the provisions or the underlying policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>of the Federal Medicaid structure <em>(see, e.g., Cleary v Waldman, </em>959 F Supp 222 [D NJ]; <em>Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med.

Thus, courts in those cases were faced with the question of assessing only whether their State\u2019s particular legislative enactment conformed to the Federal authorization <em>(see, Cleary v Waldman, supra, </em>959 F Supp, at 234; <em>Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, supra, </em>425 Mass, at 745-746, 682 NE2d, at 879; <em>Kimnach v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., supra, </em>96 Ohio App 3d, at 649, 645 NE2d, at 831; <em>compare, Gruber v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., supra, </em>98 Ohio App 3d, at 83-84, 647 NE2d, at 869). This Court, therefore, is not dis-positively enlightened by the analysis in <em>Cleary v Waldman </em>(959 F Supp 222, <em>supra), </em>to which the majority significantly adverts <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 664), where the New Jersey Federal nisi prius court\u2019s decision was limited to whether that State\u2019s adoption of an \u201cincome first\u201d rule violated the Federal statute <em>(see, Cleary v Waldman, </em>959 F Supp 222, 228, 230, <em>supra). </em>That is neither the issue nor the problem in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Because the decisional features in the above-cited cases turned on the Federal statutory framework, they do not definitively answer the next, discrete level of problem with which this Court is now faced in this appeal; to wit, what has New York\u2019s Legislature authorized?</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">My departure from the majority rationale, therefore, essentially derives from the different focus I perceive within New York State\u2019s statutory enactment and promulgated regulation. I detect, for New York, a legislative preferential option in favor of a more generous and flexible eligibility based on the \u201cresources first\u201d method. That route, also, provides fairer notice to the cohort of regulated persons and more definitive and reliable guidance to the regulators and courts that are obliged to review administrative actions. Lastly, my approach would give greater deference in the distribution of governmental authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to the more appropriate law- and policy- and eligibility-defining source \u2014 the Legislature and the agency in its formal rule promulgating role, as distinguished from its case-by-case decision making actions <em>(see generally, </em>Mikva and Lane, An Introduction to Statutory Interpretation and the Legislative Process, ch 1, \u00a7 5, at 46-50).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Thus, I now try to pinpoint the key feature of my disagreement with the majority analysis, resulting in my different final destination \u2014 a vote for affirmance in favor of the party who should be eligible and entitled to benefits. Under my view of what the Legislature and the regulators actually said, New York\u2019s local and State agencies lack the authority to trump a reasonably manifested legislative choice, with an agency-applied version of fiscal and policy preferences at the administrative case level. They are subordinate and cannot override the legislative prerogative, as fairly expressed and legitimately extrapolated from this complex universe. Nor can they interpose a policy of their own making, especially when the enacted words, such as they are, have been ratified and reinforced by promulgated regulations prescribing and pointing the way towards the \u201cresources first\u201d method, that preserves instead of disfavors eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">This Court has analogously cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201cAn agency cannot create rules, through its own interstitial declaration, that were not contemplated or authorized by the Legislature and thus, in effect, empower themselves to rewrite or add substantially to the administrative charter itself\u2019 <em>(Matter of Tze Chun Liao v New York State Banking Dept., </em>74 NY2d 505, 510).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The instant case involves a more serious administrative arrogation of responsibility and power because it is the individual application decision that purports to \u201cenact\u201d a bureaucratic policy or set of standards, over the promulgated regulation and approved statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">New York State has declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">\u201cIf either spouse establishes that income generated by the community spouse resource allowance, established by the social services district, is inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>quate <em>to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, the department shall establish a resource allowance </em>for the spousal share of the institutionalized spouse adequate to provide such minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [c] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">To my mind and eye, these words help to evince a sufficiently plain expression, choice and signal for \u201cresources first.\u201d Thus, the language of the New York statute and regulations should not be characterized as \u201cfunctionally\u201d or \u201cvirtually\u201d identical to the concededly noncontrolling Federal fountainhead as to the issue at hand <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 662, 667). Rather, the discretely nuanced jargon of the field of high specialization ought to be accorded some meaning, as is required under ordinary canons of statutory construction. Similarly, the absence of an explicit prohibition against the use of income first computation method <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 665) should not prevail over the relatively more significant absence of legislative authorization for the threshold eligibility prerequisite itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Lawyers, bureaucrats and diplomats can almost always discern, parse and craft ambiguities. That professional training and skill, however, does not justify a deviation from a reasonably limited empowerment and plain reading of a complex statute, especially in the brighter illumination of particular and complementary regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Those corresponding regulations, promulgated by the State Department of Social Services, buttress the interpretation I see in the statutory language. They also restrict the local agency\u2019s options against doing whatever it pleases to reduce eligibility, with potentially widely varying and disparate results. The regulations even attempt to clarify the statutory distinction between treatment of resources and income for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. For example, they provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cIf either spouse establishes that income generated by the community spouse resource allowance * * * is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the [MMMNA], the department <em>must establish resource allowance </em>adequate to provide such [MMMNA] <em>from those resources considered to be available to the institutionalized spouse\u201d </em>(18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7] [emphasis added]; <em>contrast, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [b] [6]; Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [b]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The resource allowance required under section 366-c (8) (c) of the Social Services Law is thus limited to \u201cthose resources considered to be available to the institutionalized spouse\u201d <em>(see, </em>18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7]). Resources \u201cavailable\u201d to the institutionalized spouse include \u201call resources, including resources required to be considered in determining eligibility * * * held by either the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse, or both, * <em>* * </em>to the extent that the value of the resources exceeds the maximum community spouse resource allowance\u201d (18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Critically, in my view, no income allocation from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse prior to eligibility is authorized or directed under the New York statute <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [3], [4]). Before eligibility is determined, the department is authorized to <em>\u201csubstitute </em>an amount adequate to provide <em>additional </em>necessary income <em>from the income otherwise available to the institutionalized </em>spouse\u201d only when a community spouse\u2019s needs exceed the MMMNA because of \u201cexceptional circumstances which result in significant financial distress\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [b] [emphasis added]; 18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [b] [6] [emphasis added]; <em>see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [d] [iii]; <em>contrast, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [c]; 18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7]; 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e] [2] [C]).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">It must be pointed out that the majority misapprehends my citation to and distinguishment of Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (b) <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 670). The section is included for its instructional value in demonstrating that there are circumstances in which the Legislature of this State envisioned and expressly authorized a transfer of preeligibility income when exceptional circumstances result in need beyond the MMMNA. Thus, the corresponding prohibition of a preeligibility income transfer \u2014 as I see it \u2014 to satisfy the MMMNA threshold is affirmatively reflected by the requirement of resource transfers in the succeeding subdivision (8) (c) of Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c. That is my sole comparative point in that regard, not the characterization the majority attributes to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">When, however, the income generated by the community spouse\u2019s resources fails to satisfy the MMMNA minimum threshold, as happened here, the New York statute expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mandates then that \u201ca <em>resource </em>allowance * * * adequate to provide such [MMMNA]\u201d shall be established <em>from the institutionalized spouse\u2019s available resources </em>(Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [c] [emphasis added]; <em>see, </em>18 NYCRR 360-4.10 [c] [7]; <em>contrast, </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5 [e] [2] [C] [authorizing substitution of <em>\u201can amount </em>adequate to provide such (MMMNA)\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>Assembly Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 558, at 6). While this may be a troublesome and obscure aspect within the analysis of this case, I believe that if someone must bear the burden of confusion and ambiguity, it ought not be the otherwise eligible recipient of a joint Federal-State helping hand program.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">I respectfully submit, therefore, that the majority unnecessarily countenances the agencies\u2019 more restrictive view. They treat the \u201ccommunity spouse\u2019s income\u201d as used in Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (c) as inclusive of income attributable to the community spouse under Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (3), the income generated by resources attributable to the community spouse under Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (5), plus a \u201ccommunity spouse monthly income allowance\u201d (CSMIA) under subdivision (2) (g). Instead, it appears sufficiently plain to me from the statute \u2014 and fairer \u2014 that the CSMIA should be used to satisfy a deficit in the community spouse\u2019s MMMNA, only after eligibility of the institutionalized spouse has been determined. Because, therefore, the CSMIA should not be included in \u201cthe community spouse\u2019s income\u201d prior to eligibility, the only initial source to satisfy this shortfall should be the institutionalized spouse\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Although CSMIA is intended to satisfy a gap between the MMMNA and \u201cincome otherwise available to the community spouse\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [g]), its role is explicitly limited to the posteligibility stage (see, Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [4] [b]; New York State Register, Oct. 17, 1990, at 39). After an institutionalized spouse is eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, then and only then should the income be transferred for the community spouse to satisfy a deficiency in a monthly needs allowance. Of particular significance here, as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized, is that the Federal statute contains \u201cno <em>corresponding limitation on deeming income from the institutionalized spouse to the community </em>spouse\u201d for eligibility purposes <em>(see, Thomas v Commissioner of Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>425 Mass 738, 747, 682 NE2d 874, 879 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>[emphasis added]). That court\u2019s analysis, like the Federal nisi prius court in <em>Cleary (supra), </em>operated against the backdrop of the adoption of the \u201cincome first\u201d rule by the State of Massachusetts <em>(see, </em>425 Mass, at 743, n 8, 682 NE2d, at 877-878, n 8). It should be observed that New York\u2019s Social Services Law differs markedly in this key aspect and implicitly establishes a limitation at the preeligibility stage <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [3] [b] [\u201cin determining the availability of income to an institutionalized spouse in determining eligibility * * * (i)ncome solely in the name of the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse <em>shall be considered available only to that </em>spouse\u201d] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Thus, in my view, the income determination rules may reasonably be read to create a rebuttable presumption to ostensible title, attribution and ultimate alienability of income sources <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [3]). Until the agency has resolved the eligibility threshold, therefore, no modification or alteration to the attribution or availability of income from an institutionalized spouse for the benefit of the community spouse should be permitted <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In this way, before eligibility is established, all resources in excess of the \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d (CSRA) would be considered available to the institutionalized spouse <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [5] [a]). After eligibility is established, on the other hand, resource transfers from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse cannot exceed the preestablished and fixed CSRA <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [6]). The \u201cspousal share\u201d for which the resource allowance is to be established to satisfy the MMMNA before eligibility under Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c (8) (c), by contrast, is determined \u201cas of the date of the continuous period of institutionalization of the institutionalized spouse\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The applicable resource determination rules permit the CSRA to be modified at a fair hearing before eligibility <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [2] [d] [iii]; [8] [c]). Alternatively, the calculation of income can be altered in only two circumstances: (1) preeligibility at a fair hearing to increase the community spouse\u2019s income over the MMMNA upon a showing of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d or (2) after eligibility via a CSMIA deduction from the institutionalized spouse <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366-c [8] [b]; [2] [g]).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In this case, Mrs. Golfs income and resource allowance undeniably failed to add up to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance. Rather than transfer Mr. Golfs excess resources as a threshold method to satisfy Mrs. Golfs MMMNA, the agencies elected instead to shift part of Mr. Golfs income for their own calculated benefit \u2014 that is, to block eligibility. From the plethora of governing words and paperwork, I can extrapolate no statutory or regulatory authorization for bureaucrats to throw this critical switch at the outset of the process. As to eligibility, they lack the power to enact the policy-driven definition. Concomitantly, on a case-by-case application, they were granted no authority to erect an operative, de facto policy disqualifying a whole category of otherwise eligible persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The contradiction of how the social service agencies effectuated their diseligibility conclusion out of a vacuum of statutory empowerment seems evident to me and ought to be viewed as very troublesome. Thus, the Appellate Division correctly nullified the agency action on a sound basis \u2014 the reasonably discerned legislative authorization and preferment for \u201cresources first,\u201d as the prescribed sequence and manner of calculating eligibility (see, <em>Matter of Richardson v Commissioner of N. Y. City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>88 NY2d 35, 39-40; <em>see also, Gardebring v Jenkins, </em>485 US 415, 430; <em>Gruber v Ohio Dept. of Human Servs., </em>98 Ohio App 3d 72, 83-84, 647 NE2d 861, 869, <em>supra). </em>Since I believe that the judicial annulment of the agency determination is well founded, it should be accorded a judicial-review deference in this circumstance, and should, therefore, be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">To be sure, an agency\u2019s determination should be sustained when it is rational even though other, equally plausible, interpretations may exist. But that is not so, as here, when the agency\u2019s action strays beyond the reasonably interpreted authorizing language itself and countermands the import and combination of the controlling State statute and implementing regulations <em>(compare, Seittelman v Sabol, </em>91 NY2d 618, 625-626, <em>supra </em>[decided today]). On its face, therefore, the particular determination constitutes arbitrary and capricious action because it steps over its limited statutory charter and regulations. Nor can it gather sufficient saving justification solely out of the seeds of arguable ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">If fiscal, policy and application problems ensue from or inhere in the approach I urge, the other branches of State government are well equipped and invested with the plenary power to alter or shape them to their preferment. They can amend the statute in discrete, definitive terms, as other States have done, to command the \u201cincome first\u201d methodology, if that is what they truly wish and expect. I propose that they have not done so thus far because, among other reasons, they evidently have preferred to stand pat with New York\u2019s more embracive and generous eligibility program.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">A more restrictive administrative policy alternative should not be judicially countenanced based on arguments addressed to competing marginal applications of speculative fiscal hypotheticals or potential manipulation of process. There are other means and methods to deal with such concerns. Nevertheless, the majority propounds that the \u201cresource first\u201d method would create a \u201cfinancial boon\u201d (majority opn, at 665), a \u201cvehicle[ ] for enriching the family of an applicant\u201d or \u201copportunities for sheltering assets\u201d (majority opn, at 671, n 7). Lest there be any doubt whatsoever in this respect, it is important to appreciate that this lawsuit is not about a particular or paradigmatic scam, draining or threatening the public purse in any such ways. Moreover, the Legislature of this State is surely aware of these undesirable leverages and, as previously noted, nonetheless demonstrated an overarching preferential option for the primary statutory purpose of ameliorating spousal impoverishment, for which the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was enacted. Indeed, to help insure this preeminent goal, New York has implemented the maximum permissible allocations under the Federal charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In my desire to sum up this case simply, I believe it ultimately reduces to and represents the more fairly common occurrence for many elderly individuals of modest means who reach life\u2019s relatively natural denou\u00e9ments, only to experience an added frustration engendered by the vicissitudes and vagaries of governmental red tape, running over many years as in this very case. The practicalities of elder care financial planning and expectations, the theoretical structure and fair judicial construction of the web of statutes and regulations, and standard administrative law principles and precedents collectively support, I respectfully submit, the Appellate Division\u2019s appropriately judicial interpretative ruling in favor of the surviving community spouse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>That is essentially why I am unable to agree that the \u201creasonableness of the agency\u2019s decision to attribute [\u2018income first\u2019] * * * is evident\u201d or \u201cpremised upon a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions\u201d (majority opn, at 663, 658). This encompassing conclusion, moreover and for example, falters under assumptions and speculations of a \u201cspouse with no personal income * * * [and] the transfer of several hundred thousand dollars over and above the standard resource allowance\u201d that are used as part of the dispositional analysis of this case (majority opn, at 671). Those circumstances, again, are not this case or this record. This Court, in my opinion, would do better to resolve the issue and case within the framework of the specific facts, record and authorities presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Based on my understanding of the pertinent legislation in its particular words and in its practical, reasonable and proper context, I conclude that the \u201cresource first\u201d method is the route the Legislature sufficiently directed the agencies to take \u2014 until they are given a more definitive eligibility definitional formula by legislative policy governance. As a consequence of their not complying with the direction as it presently exists, the agencies\u2019 applied administrative determination denying the application for benefits in this case was properly annulled by the Appellate Division. Its order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur with Judge Smith; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
