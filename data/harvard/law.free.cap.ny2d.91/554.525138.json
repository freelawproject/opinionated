Specifically in issue is the disposition of five frozen, stored pre-embryos, or \u201cpre-zygotes,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> created five years ago, during the parties\u2019 marriage, to assist them in having a child. Now divorced, appellant (Maureen Kass) wants the pre-zygotes implanted, claiming this is her only chance for genetic motherhood; respondent (Steven Kass) objects to the burdens of unwanted fatherhood, claiming that the parties agreed at the time they embarked on the effort that in the present circumstances the pre-zygotes would be donated to the IVF program for approved research purposes. Like the two-Justice plurality at the Appellate Division, we conclude that the parties\u2019 agreement providing for donation to the IVF program controls. The Appellate Division order should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Appellant and respondent were married on July 4, 1988, and almost immediately began trying to conceive a child. While appellant believed that, owing to prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) she might have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term, her condition in fact was more serious \u2014 she failed to become pregnant. In August 1989, the couple turned to John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson, Long Island and, after unsuccessful efforts to conceive through artificial insemination, enrolled in the hospital\u2019s IVF program.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Typically, the IVF procedure begins with hormonal stimulation of a woman\u2019s ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The eggs are then removed by laparoscopy or ultrasound-directed needle aspiration and placed in a glass dish, where sperm are introduced. Once a sperm cell fertilizes the egg, this fusion \u2014 or pre-zygote \u2014 divides until it reaches the four- to eight-cell stage, after which several pre-zygotes are transferred to the woman\u2019s uterus by a cervical catheter. If the procedure succeeds, an embryo will attach itself to the uterine wall, differentiate and develop into a fetus. As an alternative to immediate implantation, pre-zygotes may be cryopreserved indefinitely in liquid nitrogen for later use. Cryopreservation serves to reduce both medical and physical costs because eggs do not have to be retrieved with each attempted implantation, and delay may actually improve the chances of pregnancy. At the same time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the preservation of \u201cextra\u201d pre-zygotes \u2014 those not immediately implanted \u2014 allows for later disagreements, as occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Beginning in March 1990, appellant underwent the egg retrieval process five times and fertilized eggs were transferred to her nine times. She became pregnant twice \u2014 once in October 1991, ending in a miscarriage and again a few months later, when an ectopic pregnancy had to be surgically terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Before the final procedure, for the first time involving cryopreservation, the couple on May 12, 1993 signed four consent forms provided by the hospital. Each form begins on a new page, with its own caption and \u201cPatient Name.\u201d The first two forms, \u201cgeneral informed consent form no. 1: in vitro FERTILIZATION AND EMBRYO TRANSFER\u201d and \u201cADDENDUM NO. 1-1,\u201d consist, of 12 single-spaced typewritten pages explaining the procedure, its risks and benefits, at several points indicating that, before egg retrieval could begin, it was necessary for the parties to make informed decisions regarding disposition of the fertilized eggs, addendum no. 1-1 concludes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u201cWe understand that it is general IVF Program Policy, as medically determined by our IVF physician, to retrieve as many eggs as possible and to inseminate and transfer 4 of those mature eggs in this IVF cycle, unless our IVF physician determines otherwise. It is necessary that we decide * * * [now] how excess eggs are to be handled by the IVF Program and how many embryos to transfer. <em>We are to indicate our choices by signing our initials where noted below.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\u201c1. We consent to the retrieval of as many eggs as medically determined by our IVF physician. If more eggs are retrieved than can be transferred during this IVF cycle, we direct the IVF Program to take the following action (choose one):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">\u201c(a) The excess eggs are to be inseminated and cryopreserved for possible use by us during a later IVF cycle. We understand that our choice of this option requires us to complete an additional Consent Form for Cryopreservation\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">The \u201cAdditional Consent Form for Cryopreservation,\u201d a seven-page, single-spaced typewritten document, is also in two parts. The first, \u201cinformed consent form no. 2: cryopreservation of human pre-zygotes,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u201cIII. <em>Disposition of Pre-Zygotes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cWe understand that our frozen pre-zygotes will be stored for a maximum of 5 years. We have the principal responsibility to decide the disposition of our frozen pre-zygotes. Our frozen pre-zygotes will not be released from storage for any purpose without the written consent of <em>both </em>of us, consistent with the policies of the IVF Program and applicable law. In the event of divorce, we understand that legal ownership of any stored pre-zygotes must be determined in a property settlement and will be released as directed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Should we for any reason no longer wish to attempt to initiate a pregnancy, we understand that we may determine the disposition of our frozen pre-zygotes remaining in storage. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cThe possibility of our death or any other unforeseen circumstances that may result in neither of us being able to determine the disposition of any stored frozen pre-zygotes requires that we now indicate our wishes, these important decisions MUST BE DISCUSSED WITH OUR IVF PHYSICIAN AND OUR WISHES MUST BE STATED (BEFORE EGG RETRIEVAL) ON THE ATTACHED ADDENDUM NO. 2-1, STATEMENT OF DISPOSITION. THIS STATEMENT OF DISPOSITION MAY BE CHANGED ONLY BY OUR SIGNING ANOTHER STATEMENT OF DISPOSITION WHICH IS FILED WITH THE IVF PROGRAM\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The second part, titled \u201cinformed consent form no. 2 \u2014 addendum NO. 2-1: CRYOPRESERVATIONSTATEMENT OF DISPOSITION,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201cWe understand that it is IVF Program Policy to obtain our informed consent to the number of prezygotes which are to be cryopreserved and to the disposition of excess cryopreserved pre-zygotes. We <em>are to indicate our choices by signing our initials where noted below.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\"><em>\u201c1. We </em>consent to cryopreservation of all prezygotes which are not transferred during this IVF cycle for possible use * * * by us in a future IVF cycle. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">\u201c2. In the event that we no longer wish to initiate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>pregnancy or are unable to make a decision regarding the disposition of our stored, frozen pre-zygotes, we now indicate our desire for the disposition of our pre-zygotes and direct the IVF program to (choose one): * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">\u201c(b) Our frozen pre-zygotes may be examined by the IVF Program for biological studies and be disposed of by the IVF Program for approved research investigation as determined by the IVF Program\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">On May 20, 1993, doctors retrieved 16 eggs from appellant, resulting in nine pre-zygotes. Two days later, four were transferred to appellant\u2019s sister, who had volunteered to be a surrogate mother, and the remaining five were cryopreserved. The couple learned shortly thereafter that the results were negative and that appellant\u2019s sister was no longer willing to participate in the program. They then decided to dissolve their marriage. The total cost of their IVF efforts exceeded $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">With divorce imminent, the parties themselves on June 7, 1993 \u2014 barely three weeks after signing the consents \u2014 drew up and signed an \u201cuncontested divorce\u201d agreement, typed by appellant, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cThe disposition of the frozen 5 pre-zygotes at Mather Hospital is that they should be disposed of [in] the manner outlined in our consent form and that neither Maureen Kass[,] Steve Kass or anyone else will lay claim to custody of these pre-zygotes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">On June 28, 1993, appellant by letter informed the hospital and her IVF physician of her marital problems and expressed her opposition to destruction or release of the pre-zygotes.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">One month later, appellant commenced the present matrimonial action, requesting sole custody of the pre-zygotes so that she could undergo another implantation procedure. Respondent opposed removal of the pre-zygotes and any further attempts by appellant to achieve pregnancy, and counterclaimed for specific performance of the parties\u2019 agreement to permit the IVF program to retain the pre-zygotes for research, as specified in addendum no. 2-1. By stipulation dated December 17, 1993, the couple settled all issues in the matrimonial action except each party\u2019s claim with respect to the prezygotes, which was submitted to the court for determination. While this aspect of the case remained open, a divorce judgment was entered on May 16, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>In connection with the continuing litigation over the prezygotes, by letter dated January 9, 1995 the parties agreed that the matter should be decided on the existing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Supreme Court granted appellant custody of the pre-zygotes and directed her to exercise her right to implant them within a medically reasonable time. The court reasoned that a female participant in the IVF procedure has exclusive decisional authority over the fertilized eggs created through that process, just as a pregnant woman has exclusive decisional authority over a nonviable fetus, and that appellant had not waived her right either in the May 12, 1993 consents or in the June 7, 1993 \u201cuncontested divorce\u201d agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">While a divided Appellate Division reversed that decision (235 AD2d 150), all five Justices unanimously agreed on two fundamental propositions. First, they concluded that a woman\u2019s right to privacy and bodily integrity are not implicated before implantation occurs. Second, the court unanimously recognized that when parties to an IVF procedure have themselves determined the disposition of any unused fertilized eggs, their agreement should control.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The panel split, however, on the question whether the agreement at issue was sufficiently clear to control disposition of the pre-zygotes. According to the two-Justice plurality, the agreement unambiguously indicated the parties\u2019 desire to donate the pre-zygotes for research purposes if the couple could not reach a joint decision regarding disposition. The concurring Justice agreed to reverse but found the consent fatally ambiguous. In his view, but for the most exceptional circumstances, the objecting party should have a veto over a former spouse\u2019s proposed implantation, owing to the emotional and financial burdens of compelled parenthood. A fact-finding hearing would be authorized only when the party desiring parenthood could make a threshold showing of no other means of achieving genetic or adoptive parenthood, which was not shown on this stipulated record.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">While agreeing with the concurrence that the informed consent document was ambiguous, the two-Justice dissent rejected a presumption in favor of either party and instead concluded that the fate of the pre-zygotes required a balancing of the parties\u2019 respective interests and burdens, as well as their personal backgrounds, psychological makeups, financial and physical circumstances. Factors would include appellant\u2019s independent ability to support the child and the sincerity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>her emotional investment in this particular reproductive opportunity, as well as the burdens attendant upon a respondent\u2019s unwanted fatherhood and his motivations for objecting to parenthood. Finding that the record was insufficient to permit a fair balancing, and that the parties\u2019 January 9, 1995 stipulation that there would be no further submissions violated public policy because it precluded full review, the dissent would remit the case to the trial court for a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We now affirm, agreeing with the plurality that the parties clearly expressed their intent that in the circumstances presented the pre-zygotes would be donated to the IVF program for research purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">A. <em>The Legal Landscape Generally. </em>We begin analysis with a brief description of the broader legal context of this dispute. In the past two decades, thousands of children have been born through IVF, the best known of several methods of assisted reproduction. Additionally, tens of thousands of frozen embryos annually are routinely stored in liquid nitrogen canisters, some having been in that state for more than 10 years with no instructions for their use or disposal (see, New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, <em>Assisted Reproductive Technologies: Analysis and Recommendations for Public Policy, </em>at 289 [Apr. 1998] <em>[\u201cAssisted Reproductive </em>Technologies\u201d]; Caplan, Due Consideration: Controversy in the Age of Medical Miracles, at 63 [1998]). As science races ahead, it leaves in its trail mind-numbing ethical and legal questions (see <em>generally, </em>Robertson, Children of Choice: Freedom and the New Reproductive Technologies [1994] [\u201cChildren of Choice\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The law, whether statutory or decisional, has been evolving more slowly and cautiously. A handful of States \u2014 New York not among them \u2014 have adopted statutes touching on the disposition of stored embryos (see, <em>e.g., </em>Fla Stat Annot \u00a7 742.17 [couples must execute written agreement providing for disposition in event of death, divorce or other unforeseen circumstances]; NH Rev Stat Annot \u00a7\u00a7 168-B:13 \u2014 168-B:15, 168-B:18 [couples must undergo medical exams and counseling; 14-day limit for maintenance of <em>ex utero </em>pre-zygotes]; La Rev Stat An-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>not \u00a7\u00a7 9:121-9:133 [pre-zygote considered \u201cjuridical person\u201d that must be implanted]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In the case law, only <em>Davis v Davis </em>(842 SW2d 588, 604 [Tenn 1992], <em>cert denied sub nom. Stowe v Davis, </em>507 US 911) attempts to lay out an analytical framework for disputes between a divorcing couple regarding the disposition of frozen embryos (see <em>also, York v Jones, </em>717 F Supp 421 [ED Va]; <em>Del Zio v Columbia Presbyt. Hosp., </em>1978 US Dist LEXIS 14450 [US Dist Ct, SD NY, Apr. 12, 1978, 74 Civ 3588]; <em>AZ v BZ, </em>Mass Probate Ct, Mar. 25, 1996). Having declared that embryos are entitled to \u201cspecial respect because of their potential for human life\u201d (842 SW2d at 597, <em>supra), Davis </em>recognized the procreative autonomy of both gamete providers, which includes an interest in avoiding genetic parenthood as well as an interest in becoming a genetic parent. In the absence of any prior written agreement between the parties \u2014 which should be presumed valid, and implemented \u2014 according to <em>Davis, </em>courts must in every case balance these competing interests, each deserving of judicial respect. In <em>Davis </em>itself, that balance weighed in favor of the husband\u2019s interest in avoiding genetic parenthood, which was deemed more significant than the wife\u2019s desire to donate the embryos to a childless couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Although statutory and decisional law are sparse, abundant commentary offers a window on the issues ahead, particularly suggesting various approaches to the issue of disposition of pre-zygotes. Some commentators would vest control in one of the two gamete providers <em>(see, e.g., </em>Poole, <em>Allocation of Decision-Making Rights to Frozen Embryos, </em>4 Am J Fam L 67 [1990] [pre-zygotes to party wishing to avoid procreation]; Andrews, <em>The Legal Status of the Embryo, </em>32 Loy L Rev 357 [1986] [woman retains authority when she desires to implant]). Others would imply a contract to procreate from participation in an IVF program <em>(see, e.g., </em>Note, <em>Davis v. Davis: What About Future Disputes?, </em>26 Conn L Rev 305 [1993]; Comment, <em>Frozen Embryos: Towards An Equitable Solution, </em>46 U Miami L Rev 803 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Yet a third approach is to regard the progenitors as holding a \u201cbundle of rights\u201d in relation to the pre-zygote that can be exercised through joint disposition agreements <em>(see, </em>Robertson, <em>Prior Agreements for Disposition of Frozen Embryos, </em>51 Ohio St LJ 407 [1990] <em>[\u201cPrior </em>Agreements\u201d]; Robertson, <em>In the Beginning: The Legal Status of Early Embryos, </em>76 Va L Rev 437 [1990] <em>[\u201cEarly Embryos\u201d]). </em>The most recent view \u2014 a \u201cdefault rule\u201d \u2014 articulated in the report of the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, is that, while gamete bank regulations should require specific instructions regarding disposition, no embryo should be implanted, destroyed or used in research over the objection of an individual with decision-making authority <em>(see, Assisted Reproductive Technologies, op. cit., </em>at 317-320).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Proliferating cases regarding the disposition of embryos, as well as other assisted reproduction issues, will unquestionably spark further progression of the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What is plain, however, is the need for clear, consistent principles to guide parties in protecting their interests and resolving their disputes, and the need for particular care in fashioning such principles as issues are better defined and appreciated. Against that backdrop we turn to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"> B. <em>The Appeal Before Us. </em>Like the Appellate Division, we conclude that disposition of these pre-zygotes does not implicate a woman\u2019s right of privacy or bodily integrity in the area of reproductive choice; nor are the pre-zygotes recognized as \u201cpersons\u201d for constitutional purposes <em>(see, Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113, 162; <em>Byrn v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>31 NY2d 194, 203, <em>appeal dismissed </em>410 US 949). The relevant inquiry thus becomes who has dispositional authority over them. Because that question is answered in this case by the parties\u2019 agreement, for purposes of resolving the present appeal we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>have no cause to decide whether the pre-zygotes are entitled to \u201cspecial respect\u201d <em>(cf., Davis v Davis, </em>842 SW2d 588, 596-597, <em>supra; see also, </em>Ethics Comm of Am Fertility Socy, <em>Ethical Considerations of the New Reproductive Technologies, </em>46 Fertility &amp; Sterility 1S, 32S [Supp 1 1986]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Agreements between progenitors, or gamete donors, regarding disposition of their pre-zygotes should generally be presumed valid and binding, and enforced in any dispute between them <em>(see, Davis v Davis, </em>842 SW2d at 597, <em>supra; see also, Early Embryos, op. cit, </em>76 Va L Rev at 463-469). Indeed, parties should be encouraged in advance, before embarking on IVF and cryopreservation, to think through possible contingencies and carefully specify their wishes in writing. Explicit agreements avoid costly litigation in business transactions. They are all the more necessary and desirable in personal matters of reproductive choice, where the intangible costs of any litigation are simply incalculable. Advance directives, subject to mutual change of mind that must be jointly expressed, both minimize misunderstandings and maximize procreative liberty by reserving to the progenitors the authority to make what is in the first instance a quintessentially personal, private decision. Written agreements also provide the certainty needed for effective operation of IVF programs <em>(see, Prior Agreements, op. cit., </em>51 Ohio St L Rev at 414-418; <em>see also, </em>Children of Choice, <em>op. cit, </em>at 107, 113).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">While the value of arriving at explicit agreements is apparent, we also recognize the extraordinary difficulty such an exercise presents. All agreements looking to the future to some extent deal with the unknown. Here, however, the uncertainties inherent in the IVF process itself are vastly complicated by cryopreservation, which extends the viability of pre-zygotes indefinitely and allows time for minds, and circumstances, to change. Divorce; death, disappearance or incapacity of one or both partners; aging; the birth of other children are but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sampling of obvious changes in individual circumstances that might take place over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">These factors make it particularly important that courts seek to honor the parties\u2019 expressions of choice, made before disputes erupt, with the parties\u2019 over-all direction always uppermost in the analysis. Knowing that advance agreements will be enforced underscores the seriousness and integrity of the consent process. Advance agreements as to disposition would have little purpose if they were enforceable only in the event the parties continued to agree. To the extent possible, it should be the progenitors \u2014 not the State and not the courts\u2014 who by their prior directive make this deeply personal life choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Here, the parties prior to cryopreservation of the pre-zygotes signed consents indicating their dispositional intent. While these documents were technically provided by the IVF program, neither party disputes that they are an expression of their own intent regarding disposition of their pre-zygotes. Nor do the parties contest the legality of those agreements, or that they were freely and knowingly made. The central issue is whether the consents clearly express the parties\u2019 intent regarding disposition of the pre-zygotes in the present circumstances. Appellant claims the consents are fraught with ambiguity in this respect; respondent urges they plainly mandate transfer to the IVF program.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The subject of this dispute may be novel but the common-law principles governing contract interpretation are not. Whether an agreement is ambiguous is a question of law for the courts (see, <em>Van Wagner Adv. Corp. v S &amp; M Enters., </em>67 NY2d 186, 191). Ambiguity is determined by looking within the four corners of the document, not to outside sources (see, <em>W.W.W. Assocs. v Giancontieri, </em>77 NY2d 157, 162-163). And in deciding whether an agreement is ambiguous courts</p>\n<p id=\"Adz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Where the document makes clear the parties\u2019 over-all intention, courts examining isolated provisions \u201c \u2018should then choose that construction which will carry out the plain purpose and object of the [agreement]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams Press v State of New </em>York, 37 NY2d 434, 440, quoting <em>Empire Props. Corp. v Manufacturers Trust Co., </em>288 NY 242, 249).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201cshould examine the entire contract and consider the relation of the parties and the circumstances under which it was executed. Particular words should be considered, not as if isolated from the context, but in the light of the obligation as a whole and the intention of the parties as manifested thereby. Form should not prevail over substance and a sensible meaning of words should be sought\u201d <em>(Atwater &amp; Co. v Panama R. R. Co., </em>246 NY 519, 524).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Applying those principles, we agree that the informed consents signed by the parties unequivocally manifest their mutual intention that in the present circumstances the prezygotes be donated for research to the IVF program.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The conclusion that emerges most strikingly from reviewing these consents as a whole is that appellant and respondent intended that disposition of the pre-zygotes was to be their joint decision. The consents manifest that what they above all did not want was a stranger taking that decision out of their hands. Even in unforeseen circumstances, even if they were unavailable, even if they were dead, the consents jointly specified the disposition that would be made. That sentiment explicitly appears again and again throughout the lengthy documents. Words of shared understanding \u2014 \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d \u2014 permeate the pages. The overriding choice of these parties could not be plainer: \u201cWe <em>have the principal responsibility to decide the disposition of our frozen pre-zygotes. Our frozen pre-zygotes will not be released from storage for any purpose without the written consent of both of us, consistent with the policies of the IVF Program and applicable </em>law\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">That pervasive sentiment \u2014 both parties assuming \u201cprincipal responsibility to decide the disposition of [their] frozen prezygotes\u201d \u2014 is carried forward in addendum no. 2-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cIn the event that we * * * are unable to make a decision regarding disposition of our stored, frozen pre-zygotes, we now indicate our desire for the disposition of our pre-zygotes and direct the IVF Program to * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201cOur frozen pre-zygotes may be examined by the IVF Program for biological studies and be disposed of by the IVF Program for approved research investigation as determined by the IVF Program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Thus, only by joint decision of the parties would the pre-zygotes be used for implantation. And otherwise, by mutual consent they would be donated to the IVF program for research purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The Appellate Division plurality identified, and correctly resolved, two claimed ambiguities in the consents. The first is the following sentence in informed consent no. 2: \u201cIn the event of divorce, we understand that legal ownership of any stored pre-zygotes must be determined in a property settlement and will be released as directed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Appellant would instead read that sentence: \u201cIn the event of divorce, we understand that legal ownership of any stored pre-zygotes must be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d That is not, however, what the sentence says. Appellant\u2019s construction ignores the direction that ownership of the pre-zygotes \u201cmust be determined in a property settlement\u201d \u2014 words that also must be given meaning, words that connote the parties\u2019 anticipated agreement as to disposition. Indeed, appellant and respondent did actually reach a settlement stipulation, reserving only the issue of the pre-zygotes (the subject of their earlier consents).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Additionally, while extrinsic evidence cannot <em>create </em>an ambiguity in an agreement, the plurality properly looked to the \u201cuncontested divorce\u201d instrument, signed only weeks after the consents, to <em>resolve </em>any ambiguity in the cited sentence. Although that instrument never became operative, it reaffirmed the earlier understanding that neither party would alone lay claim to possession of the pre-zygotes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Apart from construing the sentence in isolation, the plurality also read it in the context of the consents as a whole. Viewed in that light, we too conclude that the isolated sentence was not dispositional at all but rather was \u201cclearly designed to insulate the hospital and the IVF program from liability in the event of a legal dispute over the pre-zygotes arising in the context of a divorce\u201d (235 AD2d at 160). To construe the sentence as appellant suggests \u2014 surrendering all control over the pre-zygotes to the courts \u2014 is directly at odds with the intent of the parties plainly manifested throughout the consents that disposition be only by joint agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">For much the same reason, we agree with the plurality\u2019s conclusion that addendum no. 2-1 \u2014 the \u201cstatement of disposition\u201d \u2014 was not strictly limited to instances of \u201cdeath or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>unforseen circumstances.\u201d Those are contingencies that would be resolved by the addendum, but they are not the only ones. We reach this conclusion, again, from reviewing the provisions in isolation and then in the context of the consents as a whole. While we agree that the words \u201cdeath or any other unforeseen circumstances\u201d in informed consent no. 2 did not create a condition precedent (235 AD2d at 159), we also note that the present circumstances \u2014 including the parties\u2019 inability to reach the anticipated settlement \u2014 might well be seen as an \u201cunforeseen\u201d circumstance. Moreover, viewing the addendum in isolation, there is no hint of the claimed condition in the document itself. The document is a free-standing form, separately captioned and separately signed by the parties. Finally, viewing the issue in the context of the consents as a whole, as the plurality noted, \u201cthe overly narrow interpretation advocated by [appellant] is refuted not only by the broad language of the dispositional provision itself, but by other provisions of the informed consent document as well\u201d (235 AD2d at 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">As they embarked on the IVF program, appellant and respondent \u2014 \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife,\u201d signing as such \u2014 clearly contemplated the fulfillment of a life dream of having a child during their marriage. The consents they signed provided for other contingencies, most especially that in the present circumstances the pre-zygotes would be donated to the IVF program for approved research purposes. These parties having clearly manifested their intention, the law will honor it.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">. We use the parties\u2019 term \u201cpre-zygotes,\u201d which are defined in the record as \u201ceggs which have been penetrated by sperm but have not yet joined genetic material.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">. Recently, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law issued a comprehensive report, <em>Assisted Reproductive Technologies, </em>together with recommendations for regulation. The report, following two years of study by the full Task Force, addresses a wide range of relevant subjects, such as the commercial aspects of what has become a sizable business, and impacts on children bom of assisted reproductive technologies <em>(see also, </em>1997-1998 NY Senate Bill S 5815 [Nov. 24, 1997] [requiring that couples specify in writing how embryos are to be disposed of before a facility can accept them for storage]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">. Within recent months, for example, the press has carried news of a divorcing New Jersey couple now litigating the disposition of frozen embryos, with the <em>husband </em>wanting them for implantation in a future spouse and the wife objecting <em>(see, </em>Booth, <em>Fate of Frozen Embryos Brings N.J. Again to Bioethics Fore: With No Precedent, Court to Decide on Request to Destroy Fertilized Ova, </em>NJLJ, Mar. 9, 1998, at 1, col 2). And a now-divorced California couple is litigating the issue of support of a child conceived during their marriage through a donor egg, donor sperm and surrogate mother <em>(see, In re Marriage of Buzzanca, </em>61 Cal App 4th 1410, 72 Cal Rptr 2d 280 [Ct App 4th Dist]; <em>see also, </em>Hernandez and Maharaj, <em>O.C. Couple Who Used Surrogate Ruled Parents; Custody: In Closely Watched Case, Appeals Court Declares That Intent Is More Important Than Biological Ties, </em>L.A.

Parties\u2019 agreements may, of course, be unenforceable as violative of public policy (see, <em>e.g., </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 121 <em>et seq. </em>[declaring surrogate parenting contracts contrary to policy, void and unenforceable]; Scheinkman, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 14, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 122, 1998 Pocket Part, at 255 [\u201ccommercial surrogacy arrangements involve a form of procreation for profit, if not prostitution\u201d]). Significantly changed circumstances also may preclude contract enforcement. Here, however, appellant does not urge that the consents violate public policy, or that they are legally unenforceable by reason of significantly changed circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">. As noted by the Appellate Division, unless public policy is violated, parties to a litigation are free to chart their own procedural course \u2014 as they did here. On January 9, 1995, both sides agreed that the matter should be determined on the submissions, and one week later plaintiffs attorney indicated that the last affidavit had been submitted. \u201cThe record upon which we must rule was thereby established\u201d (235 AD2d at 162).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
