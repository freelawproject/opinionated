(Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21655.8, subd. (a), 21658, subd. (a), respectively.) Pursuant to Government Code section 68081, the parties were provided with an opportunity to submit supplemental briefs addressing the issue of whether the trial court violated the separation of powers doctrine or its statutory authority by amending the complaint sua sponte during the trial to add the charge of making an unsafe lane change.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">As discussed below in the published portion of this opinion, we reverse the judgment of conviction for making an unsafe lane change. The court did not have authority on its own motion to amend the complaint to add the charge. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments that the judgment should be reversed with respect to her conviction for crossing double yellow lines into an HOV lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">II. <em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">On April 9, 2012, defendant was issued a citation for crossing double yellow lines into an HOV lane in violation of section 21655.8, subdivision (a). Defendant signed a promise to appear in court on or before June 14, 2012. Defendant requested and was provided a trial by written declaration. The ticketing officer submitted a declaration concerning the infraction. After being found guilty, defendant requested a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-11\">At the trial de novo on March 11, 2013, Los Angeles Police Officer Schoop testified that he observed defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling southbound on \u201cthe 405 Freeway\u201d north of the Avalon Boulevard exit. Defendant changed lanes in front of the officer into the HOV lane, crossing over a set of clearly visible double yellow lines which were in good repair. Defendant caused Schoop to brake suddenly in order to avoid a traffic collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>Schoop testified that he originally wrote on the citation that the incident occurred \u201cSouth of Avalon,\u201d but prior to defendant signing her promise to appear, he made a correction to the citation indicating that the violation occurred \u201cNorth of Avalon.\u201d Defendant asked Schoop at trial why he wrote \u201csouth\u201d in his declaration, and he responded that he \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d Defendant requested that the case be dismissed because her citation stated that the violation occurred south of Avalon, and she prepared her defense relying on the location specified in her citation. The court denied her request, pointing out that the court\u2019s copy of the citation provided that the location of the violation was north of Avalon. The court further stated that the correction on the original citation regarding the location must not have gone through the carbon paper onto defendant\u2019s copy of the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The court told defendant that it was going to find her guilty, and asked Schoop whether defendant\u2019s lane change was unsafe. The officer responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then added the charge of making an unsafe lane change under Vehicle Code section 21658, subdivision (a), and found defendant guilty both of crossing double yellow lines into an HOV lane, and of making an unsafe lane change. The court imposed a fine, and defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">in. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">A. <em>The Court\u2019s Amendment to Add a Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">An infraction is a criminal matter subject generally to the provisions applicable to misdemeanors, except for the right to a jury trial, the possibility of confinement as a punishment, and the right to court-appointed counsel if indigent. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 19.6.) A written notice to appear filed with the trial court constitutes a complaint charging a person with an infraction. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40513, subds. (a), (b).) A complaint may be amended at any stage of the proceedings, so long as \u201cthe amendment does not prejudice the substantial rights of the defendant [citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valles </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 362, 371 [17 Cal.Rptr. 204].) \u201cAn amendment may be made even at the close of trial where no prejudice is shown. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Witt </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 154, 165 [125 Cal.Rptr. 653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">Penal Code section 1009 only allows a court to \u201corder or permit. . . the filing of an amended complaint,\u201d meaning that only a prosecutor may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>amend a complaint. In the present case, the court did not grant a motion to amend by the prosecution, but rather <em>itself </em>amended the complaint by adding to the notice to appear the unsafe lane change violation. As such, it exceeded the statutory authority given to it by Penal Code section 1009. Moreover, as explained below, permitting a court <em>itself </em>to amend a notice to appear or a complaint would be unconstitutional based on a violation of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">Article III, section 3 of the California Constitution provides: \u201cThe powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial. Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by this Constitution.\u201d \u201cIt is well settled that the prosecuting authorities, exercising executive functions, ordinarily have the sole discretion to determine whom to charge with public offenses and what charges to bring. [Citations.] This prosecutorial discretion to choose, for each particular case, the actual charges from among those potentially available arises from 1 \u201cthe complex considerations necessary for the effective and efficient administration of law enforcement.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The prosecution\u2019s authority in this regard is founded, among other things, on the principle of separation of powers, and generally is not subject to supervision by the judicial branch. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 134 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073].) A court cannot authorize the institution of a criminal prosecution without the approval of the prosecutor. <em>(People v. Municipal Court (Pellegrino) </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 193, 204 [103 Cal.Rptr. 645].) Thus, the trial court usurped the prosecutor\u2019s discretionary power to control the institution of criminal proceedings and violated the separation of powers by sua sponte adding a charge to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">We reject the People\u2019s argument in their supplemental brief that defendant failed to preserve the issue by not objecting on this ground in the trial court. Based on the court\u2019s action of ordering the amendment and immediately thereafter finding defendant guilty, we find defendant did not have the opportunity to object, and, in any event, because the issue raised \u201cinvolve[s] only questions of law based on undisputed facts\u201d <em>(People v. Rosas </em>(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 107, 115 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 74]), we conclude that the issue is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">B. <em>Contentions Regarding Crossing Double Yellow Lines </em>Conviction<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 11\">*Supp. 11</page-number>IV. <em>DISPOSITION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">The judgment of conviction for making an unsafe lane change is reversed.
