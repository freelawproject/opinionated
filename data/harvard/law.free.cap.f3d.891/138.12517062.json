Because the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires a hearing, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 30, 2016, Sarah Hyunsoon No filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy under \u00a7 301 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On December 15, 2016, No filed her \"Amended Chapter 13 Plan and Related Motions\" with attachments (\"Chapter 13 Plan\"). Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 1326 requires a debtor under these circumstances to \"commence making payments not later than 30 days after the date of filing of the plan or the order for relief, whichever is earlier,\" to the trustee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). No neither commenced payments within the time limit\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor appeared for a required meeting of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 13, 2017, Thomas P. Gorman, the Chapter 13 Trustee, filed a \"Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) Certification\" stating that No had failed to commence timely payments as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) provides that \"[u]pon receipt of such a certification, the Clerk shall enter an order dismissing the case.\" Bankr. E.D. Va. R. 3070-1(C). Gorman also separately filed a \"Motion to Dismiss, Notice of Motion to Dismiss, and Notice of Scheduled Hearing on This Motion.\" This latter filing argued that dismissal was proper for three reasons: (1) No failed to attend the required meeting of creditors; (2) No failed to commence payments as required under \u00a7 1326 ; and (3) No's Chapter 13 Plan was not made in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing on the motion to dismiss for February 9, 2017, with responses to be filed at least five days before that hearing, and it notified the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the bankruptcy court dismissed the case on January 17, 2017, before the scheduled hearing could occur. Its dismissal relied solely on Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) and Gorman's certification under that Rule that No had failed to commence timely payments.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    No\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-14062-BFK (Bankr. E.D. Va. Jan. 17, 2017); J.A. 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   No appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed, holding that \"because the Local Bankruptcy Rules required the dismissal of [No]'s bankruptcy case, the Bankruptcy Court did not err when it dismissed the case prior to holding a motion to dismiss hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    No v. Gordon\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re No\n   </em>\n   ), Ch. 13 Case No. 16-14062-BFK, Adv. No. 1:17-cv-135-GBL-IDD, slip op. at 3-4 (E.D. Va. April 28, 2017); J.A. 158-59. No appealed pro se to this court, and we assigned amicus curiae counsel to argue in support of her position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The issue presented is whether Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C)'s procedure for dismissal of a voluntary bankruptcy case conflicts with the notice and hearing requirement of \u00a7 1307 of the Bankruptcy Code. We conclude that it does. We review such questions of law de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Frushour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881122\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/393/#p398\">\n    433 F.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (4th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 1307 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a bankruptcy court to, \"on request of a party in interest or the United States trustee and after notice and a hearing, ... dismiss a case under this chapter ... for cause, including ... failure to commence making timely payments under section 1326 of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4). We read the plain text of this provision as permitting the dismissal of a bankruptcy case at a party's request for failure to commence payments under \u00a7 1326 only after opportunity for a hearing. Here, pursuant to the Local Bankruptcy Rule, the bankruptcy court dismissed No's case without the required hearing when the clerk received Gorman's certification that No had failed to commence timely payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Gorman argues in part that the requirements of \u00a7 1307\"[p]rocedurally\n   and technically\" would not apply here because \"this case was not dismissed upon the motion of a party in interest or the U.S. Trustee,\" but rather on the court's own authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee's Br. at 10. However, we note that \u00a7 1307 does not require a \"motion\" to dismiss, per se, but rather the \"\n   <em>\n    request\n   </em>\n   of a party in interest or the United States trustee.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4) (emphasis added). We view Gorman's certification under the Rule as constituting such a \"request.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because \u00a7 1307 applies, we must reverse. Simply put, Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) allows dismissal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   without the hearing that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires. The tension between the Bankruptcy Code and the Local Bankruptcy Rule is manifest in the circumstances presented here. No was notified of a hearing on the motion to dismiss scheduled for February 9, 2017, upon which she had every reason to rely. But the bankruptcy court dismissed the case on January 17, 2017, before the scheduled hearing could even occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A local rule of bankruptcy procedure cannot be inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9029(a) (authorizing local bankruptcy rules \"which are consistent with ... Acts of Congress\"). Therefore, we hold that Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) is invalid to the extent that it is inconsistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   's hearing requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For these reasons, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Local Bankruptcy Rule 3070-1(C) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    [E]ach chapter 13 debtor shall commence payments proposed by the plan not later than 30 days after the date of the filing of the plan or the order for relief, whichever is earlier, unless the Court has set some different time.

This is the functional equivalent of a \"request\" that the case be dismissed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
