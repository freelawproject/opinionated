We hold that the ALJ erred in not adequately addressing Luther's 100% Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") disability rating in her decision. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 27, 2013, Luther filed an application for DIB and SSI. She sought these benefits due to her post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") and degenerative disc disease. At that time, she claimed a disability onset date of December 28, 2012. In December 2013, the VA concluded that Luther was 100 percent disabled for PTSD, 30 percent disabled for urinary tract infection, and 10 percent disabled for degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, for an overall rating of 100% disabled, effective December 6, 2012. Luther provided only the first two pages of the total five pages of the VA's rating decision to the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 27, 2014, the ALJ conducted a hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, the parties briefly discussed the VA disability rating. Luther amended her social security disability onset date to correspond with the December 6, 2012 effective date of her VA rating. The ALJ then stated, \"One hundred percent disability VA has no bearing. It's something we consider-.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a decision dated December 3, 2014, the ALJ found that Luther was not disabled. The decision contained only two limited references to the VA rating. First, under the \"Jurisdiction and Procedural History\" section it states, \"The claimant was awarded 100% VA disability commencing December 6, 2012. At the hearing, the claimant amended her onset date to December 6, 2012 to correspond with the onset of her VA disability award.\" The second reference, later in the decision, states, \"At the hearing, the claimant amended her onset date to December 6, 2012, which is the date she was awarded VA disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Luther requested the Appeals Council review the ALJ's decision. There, she argued that the ALJ erred by failing to provide a \"specific, valid, record-based rationale to not give the VA ratings great weight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 10, 2015, the Appeals Council denied Luther's request for review. The Council found \"[t]he record that was before the Administrative Law Judge was sufficient to evaluate [Luther's] disability status under the Social Security Regulations.\" The Council observed that the ALJ had the benefit of extensive medical records, including records that had not been provided to the VA. The Appeals Council also stated that the VA disability rating was based on the same symptoms \"appropriately considered by the [ALJ] ... under applicable Social Security Regulations.\" The Council found that \"[e]ven if the 'Evidence' and 'Reasons For Decision' identified [by the VA] ... were sufficient to support a VA service connected disability rating of 100% due to PTSD, they were/are not sufficient to support a finding of disability under Social Security Regulations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after receiving the Appeals Council decision, Luther asked the Council to reopen her case. She submitted \"an entire copy of the [VA's] rating decision\" to the Appeals Council, which included\n   three additional pages of the VA's analysis that had not been previously provided to the ALJ or to the Appeals Council. The record does not contain any response by the Appeals Council. Nor does the administrative record contain these additional pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Ms. Luther appealed to the Central District of California. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's findings and recommendations, affirming the agency's decision. On appeal to this court, Luther asserts that the ALJ erred in not giving great weight to the VA disability rating, rejecting the opinions from Luther's treating physicians, and discrediting Luther's subjective complaints. She seeks a remand for the calculation of benefits or alternatively a remand for further proceedings. Because we reverse and remand as to the VA disability rating, we do not address Luther's other arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A district court's order affirming an ALJ's denial of benefits is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Brown-Hunter v.

The magistrate judge acknowledged \"[t]his Court has no jurisdiction to review the decision of the Appeals Council denying review.\" But the magistrate judge nonetheless discussed the Council's reasoning in denying review and relied on that analysis in his decision.

In this case, the ALJ failed to explain the consideration she gave to the VA disability rating, if any. And it is unclear from the record whether the ALJ would be required to find Luther disabled after evaluating the VA disability rating. \"We note that, on remand, the ALJ is not compelled to adopt the conclusions of the VA's decisions wholesale, but if she deviates from final VA decisions, she may do so based only on contrary evidence that is 'persuasive, specific, valid' and supported by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Hiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864303\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1208/#p1212\">\n    687 F.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McCartey\n   </em>\n   , 298 F.3d at 1076 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's decision affirming the Commissioner's decision and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   with instructions to the district court to remand this case to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Appeals Council decision would not alter our reasoning in this case even if it was properly a subject of our review.
