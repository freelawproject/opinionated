Jean pled guilty to receiving child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), (b)(1), and possessing child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B), (b)(2). He appeals, arguing that the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained by a warrant using the Network Investigative Technique (NIT). He also claims the court abused its discretion by denying his motion to disclose the NIT's codes. Having jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, the FBI began investigating a child pornography website \"Playpen.\" It offered users the opportunity to advertise, view, and distribute child pornography. The website's host, the Onion Router, gave anonymity to users, hiding identifying information and requiring access to Playpen through a nondescript web address. Playpen required users to create a username and password.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 20, 2015, a United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia granted the FBI's warrant to search computers, \"wherever located,\" accessing Playpen. The warrant approved the use of NIT, a computer program that reveals Playpen's users. The NIT would \"cause\" the user's computer to send its Internet Protocol address, operating system information and username, and Media Access Control address to the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FBI agents discovered a user named \"regalbegal.\" This username belonged to Jean, living in Arkansas. On July 9, 2015, executing an Arkansas search warrant, the agents seized Jean's computer and other devices with child pornography. He admitted downloading and viewing child pornography. He confirmed his username was \"regalbegal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jean moved to suppress his statements and all evidence from the search. He asserted that the search was unauthorized because the warrant was issued in the Eastern District of Virginia, not Arkansas. The district court denied his motion. He then moved to compel disclosure of the complete NIT code, arguing it was material to his defense. The court denied disclosure of the exploit and server codes. Jean pled guilty, preserving his right to appeal the rulings on the motions to suppress and compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jean challenges the NIT warrant under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(b)(4). His challenge is preempted by\n   this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Horton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276073\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1041/\">\n    863 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017).

A defendant may \"discover certain documents and tangible objects upon a showing that they are 'material to the preparation of his defense.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Jean believes these codes were material to his defense. The district court disagreed, finding \"Jean's argument fails to 'demonstrate that the requested evidence bears some abstract logical relationship to the issues in the case.' \" Summarizing the testimony of Jean's own expert, the district court found that the likelihood of any help to Jean's defense was \"vanishingly small.\" The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Alternatively, the court invoked the law-enforcement privilege to prevent disclosure of the exploit code, finding \"any need ... is greatly outweighed by the public's interest in keeping the exploit secret.\" Jean contends a protective order could alleviate this concern. But the court deemed a protective order insufficient: \"The risk that the information might inadvertently be leaked or otherwise used by third parties is too great.\" The court further found, \"Mere knowledge of the particular vulnerability exploited here could potentially lead the expert to later build his own exploit, or assist others in doing so, thereby effectively circumventing a protective order.\" The district court did not clearly err in making these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   * * * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The Honorable Timothy L.
