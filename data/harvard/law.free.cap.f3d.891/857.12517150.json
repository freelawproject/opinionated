Regrettably, despite some efforts to eradicate the practices, child labor and slave labor are modern-day scourges,\n   and manufacturers that source materials from around the world may benefit from that illicit labor. This issue has gained public attention in recent years such that many consumers now consider in their purchasing decisions the labor practices behind household products. In fact, some manufacturers have decided to market their products as free of unsavory labor practices, and some legislatures have attempted to further educate the public about modern-day slavery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nonetheless, the California consumer protection laws do not obligate the defendants-appellees to label their goods as possibly being produced by child or slave labor. In the absence of any affirmative misrepresentations by the manufacturer, we hold that the manufacturers do not have a duty to disclose the labor practices in question, even though they are reprehensible, because they are not physical defects that affect the central function of the chocolate products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   One of the key issues in this case is the continued viability of\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048442\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1136/\">\n    668 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2012). Defendants-appellees rely on\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   to argue that plaintiff-appellant has not alleged that defendants-appellees had a duty to disclose because\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   stands for the premise that plaintiffs in pure omission cases must plead that the undisclosed information created a safety hazard. Plaintiff-appellant acknowledges the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , but urges us to deviate from that precedent, arguing that intervening California Courts of Appeal cases render our interpretation of California law incorrect. It is true that recent state-court cases have cast doubt on the breadth of this Circuit's precedent about the duty to disclose, but the facts before us today do not compel us to reexamine that precedent in this case. This is so because, even applying the tests from the intervening California cases, Plaintiff cannot state a claim. We therefore affirm the district court's order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff-appellant Robert Hodsdon (\"Plaintiff\") is a California citizen who purchased defendants-appellees' (together, \"Mars\") chocolate products at retail stores and viewed the labeling. Hodsdon alleges he would not have bought the chocolate or would not have paid as much for it if the manufacturer had disclosed, on the label itself, the existence of child and slave labor in its supply chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Ivory Coast (or C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) is the world's largest producer of cocoa beans, the raw ingredient for chocolate. Like most chocolate manufacturers, Mars sources at least some cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast. Some cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast are produced using what the International Labor Organization (\"ILO\") calls \"the worst forms of child labour.\" The Bureau of International Labor Affairs of the U.S. Department of Labor describes the situation in the Ivory Coast as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [C]hildren ... are working under conditions of forced labor on Ivoirian cocoa farms.... Some children are sold by their parents to traffickers, some are kidnapped, and others migrate willingly but fall victim to traffickers who sell them to recruiters or farmers, where they end up in conditions of bonded labor.... Some children are forced to perform dangerous tasks....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mars recognizes that its supply chains may be infected by the worst forms of child labor, but does not disclose this on its product labeling. However, in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (\"Supply Chains Act\"), Mars does disclose on its website its\n   efforts to combat slavery and labor abuses in its supply chain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff brought this action under California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"), Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), and False Advertising Law (\"FAL\"), alleging that Mars has a duty to disclose on its labels the labor practices that may taint its supply chain. Plaintiff's CLRA claim is that Mars misrepresented the source, characteristics, and standard of the chocolate products by omitting information about labor practices on its label.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (5), (7). As to the UCL, Plaintiff claims that Mars' conduct came within the UCL's prohibition on \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice\" by: (1) violating the \"unlawful\" prong based on its violation of the CLRA; (2) violating the \"fraudulent\" prong because it omitted information about the forced labor at the point of sale; and (3) violating the \"unfair\" prong because the omission contravened legislative policy against child and slave labor, or because Mars' \"participation in a supply chain involving [slave labor] is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous and injurious to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Plaintiff's FAL claim also is based on Mars' alleged failure to disclose its labor practices on its label.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.

Duty to Disclose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff does not allege any affirmative misstatement and relies solely on an omission theory of consumer fraud. Omissions may be the basis of claims under California consumer protections laws, but \"to be actionable the omission must be contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant, or\n   <em>\n    an omission of a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Daugherty v.

Plaintiff urges us to rule that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law after more recent California Courts of Appeal opinions, and to apply the tests for duty to disclose from those cases. While the recent California cases do cast doubt on whether\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   's safety-hazard\n   requirement applies in all circumstances, we have no occasion in this case to consider whether the later state-court cases have effectively overruled\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . This is true because even applying Plaintiff's proposed tests, derived from his reading of the more recent California decisions, he cannot state a claim. Specifically, Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that the defect in question-the existence of child labor in the supply chain-affects the central functionality of the chocolate products. Therefore, without either relying on or overruling\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , we hold that Plaintiff has not established that Mars had a duty to disclose the labor practices on its labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The primary California cases on which Plaintiff relies are\n   <em>\n    Collins v. eMachines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246141\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/202/249/\">\n    202 Cal.App.4th 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20588\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), and\n   <em>\n    Rutledge v.

First, the court did not apply the\n   <em>\n    LiMandri\n   </em>\n   factors, as\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   did, to determine whether defendants had an obligation to disclose. Further, the section of the opinion on the duty to disclose ultimately concludes that there is \"a triable issue of fact as to the nature of HP's [affirmative] representations, and whether that\n   <em>\n    triggered\n   </em>\n   a duty to disclose the defect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20411\">\n    at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The opinion is thus somewhat inconclusive on whether there was a duty to disclose independent of HP's affirmative representations about its product. Finally,\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   seems to cite favorably the holding in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   that manufacturers have a duty to disclose a defect when it affects the central functionality of a product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20411\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20411\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , therefore, could be read as a case that stands for any of the following propositions: (1) there is a duty to disclose in light of affirmative representations; (2) there is a duty to disclose defects that go to the central function of the product; or (3) there is a duty to disclose defects that go to the central function of the product and which arise during the warranty period.

Plaintiff, however, omits a crucial element that\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   emphasize-that the defect must relate to the central functionality of the product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, we assume without deciding that the existence of slave or child labor in a product's supply chain is material to consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, however, Plaintiff fails to allege that the existence of slave or child labor in the supply chain affects the product's central function. In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were required to plead that the allegedly concealed\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   defect was\n   <em>\n    central\n   </em>\n   to the product's function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the alleged lack of disclosure about the existence of slave labor in the supply chain is not a physical defect at all, much less one related to the chocolate's function as chocolate. Plaintiff contends that he has \"no practical use\" for the products tainted by slave or child labor, but the central functionality of the product is not based on subjective preferences about a product. A computer chip that corrupts the hard drive, or a laptop screen that goes dark, renders those products incapable of use by any consumer; some consumers of chocolate are not concerned about the labor practices used to manufacture the product.

As such, the U.N. Convention and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention do not provide a tether here. Further, requiring Mars to place labels on its products could arguably impinge on the Supply Chains Act, which addresses disclosure of labor abuses, but does not require labels on the products themselves.

Plaintiff's allegation that Mars' participation in a supply chain involving slave labor is \"immoral\" does not suffice here, because Plaintiff is challenging the failure to disclose. While the labor practices themselves are clearly immoral, it is doubtful that failing to disclose on the label that a product may be tainted by such labor practices is itself immoral, especially when there is no specific duty to disclose this information and the information is otherwise disclosed under the Supply Chains Act. Further, the failure to disclose is not substantially injurious because, as mentioned above, information about slave and child labor is public knowledge, accessible on Mars' website-pursuant to the Supply Chains Act.
