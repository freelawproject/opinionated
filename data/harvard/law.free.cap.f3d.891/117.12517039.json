When a religion founds its empire upon the desire of immortality which lives in every human heart, it may aspire to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a government, it must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain nations. Thus, in forming an alliance with a political power, religion augments its authority over a few, and forfeits the hope of reigning over all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   As long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the consolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of mankind.

But like the lives of the fallen heroes it honors, what the Park lacks in length it makes up in height. Nearly a century ago, Maryland citizens, out of deep respect and gratitude, took on the daunting task of erecting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so nobly advanced. The panel majority says their effort violates the Constitution the soldiers fought to defend. I, respectfully, think otherwise. But wherever one's views fall on this matter, I\n   am certain that it raises an important question worthy of the full Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   WILKINSON, Circuit Judge, with whom Chief Judge GREGORY and Judge AGEE, join, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I would grant rehearing en banc for the reasons expressed in Chief Judge Gregory's dissent to the panel decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

We should take care not to traverse too casually the line that separates us from our ancestors and that will soon enough separate us from our descendants. The present has many good ways of imprinting its values and sensibilities upon society. But to roil needlessly the dead with the controversies of the living does not pay their deeds or their time respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This memorial and this cross have stood for almost one full century.

The holding not only violates\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   , it also needlessly puts at risk hundreds of monuments with similar symbols standing on public grounds across the country, such as those in nearby Arlington National Cemetery, where crosses of comparable size stand in commemoration of fallen soldiers. Because this ruling has such far-reaching and unnecessary consequences, it should be reheard by our court en banc, and I dissent from the vote not to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The mothers of soldiers who died during World War I and other private citizens in Prince George's County, Maryland, erected a memorial almost 100 years ago commemorating the soldiers' service to the Nation. The memorial, which consists of a large concrete Celtic cross on a pedestal, includes on four sides the words \"Valor,\" \"Endurance,\" \"Courage,\" and \"Devotion\" and a plaque stating: \"This Memorial Cross Dedicated to the Heroes of Prince George's County, Maryland Who Lost Their Lives in the Great War for the Liberty of the World.\" The plaque also includes the names of the 49 men who are commemorated by the monument and a quote from President Wilson, stating, \"The right is more precious than peace. We\n   shall fight for the things we have always carried nearest our hearts. To such a task we dedicate our lives.\" The monument's use of the cross shape mirrors the custom in Europe during World War I where \"the Cross became the principal grave marker\" in cemeteries where soldiers were buried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The monument at issue in this case stands in Veterans Memorial Park and is surrounded by numerous other monuments commemorating those who died in the Nation's conflicts, including a World War II Honor Scroll, a Pearl Harbor Memorial, a Korea-Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a September 11 Memorial Garden, a large Battle of Bladensburg Memorial, and two 38-foot-tall statutes of soldiers, one British and one American, facing each other across a bridge. Some of these monuments are as tall as the monument at issue in this case. Moreover, within 40 miles of the monument are other similar monuments commemorating lost soldiers and incorporating Christian symbols, such as the Wayside Cross in Towson, Maryland, the Victory Cross in Baltimore, and the Argonne Cross and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 1961, the property on which the monument was erected was deeded to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission because it had become a highway safety issue due to the monument's location in the median of the busy intersection of U.S. Route 1 and Maryland Route 450. It is now maintained by the Commission. Since 1961, however, the monument has continued to be used during relevant holidays to commemorate those who died in war.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Until this action was filed by persons who claim to be offended by the presence of the monument, no complaint had been made about its presence or its use of a Christian symbol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The panel, in a 2-1 decision, will now have the monument removed or destroyed because, as it concludes, its presence on public land amounts to a violation of the Establishment Clause, although no Supreme Court case has ever held that the Establishment Clause prohibits such monuments. Indeed, it has held to the contrary-that \"the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment\n   <em>\n    allows\n   </em>\n   the display\" of monuments like the one here.\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    545 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (plurality opinion) (holding that the Establishment Clause allows a large granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments to stand on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 700-01, 703-04,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment). The panel opinion seeks to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the cross as a symbol \"differs from other religious monuments, such as the Ten Commandments\" because the Ten Commandments is \"well known as being tied to our Nation's history and government\" and because, unlike the monument at issue in\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   , the monument here is \"conspicuously displayed at a busy intersection.\" The panel further rationalizes that when crosses are ordinarily used to commemorate fallen soldiers, such as in Arlington National Cemetery, they \"are much smaller than the 40-foot tall monolith at issue here.\" The opinion, however, fails to recognize that there are similarly sized monuments incorporating crosses in the Arlington National Cemetery-indeed, also elsewhere nearby. The panel opinion directs the district court, which had held that the Establishment Clause was not violated by the monument, to consider on remand whether the arms of the cross should be \"remov[ed]\" or the cross entirely \"raz[ed],\" or other \"arrangements [could be made] that would not offend the Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Supreme Court has adopted numerous tests for deciding Establishment Clause cases, and it debated in\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   which might apply in assessing monuments on public lands that contain religious symbols.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    545 U.S. at 683-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (canvassing the various tests that have been applied in varying circumstances);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 698,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that there is \"no simple and clear measure which by precise application can readily and invariably demark the permissible from the impermissible\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

The Court's conclusion was based on the following observations that it made about the monument at issue there: (1) that the text on the monument conveyed both a \"religious message\" and a \"secular moral message\"; (2) that the monument has stood in a secular setting on Capitol grounds for some 40 years; (3) that the monument was donated by a private, \"primarily secular\" organization to highlight the Ten Commandments' role in \"shaping civil morality\"; (4) that the monument's physical setting \"suggest[ed] little or nothing of the sacred,\" as it sat \"in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers\"; and (5) that over a period of 40 years, the monument \"went unchallenged\" until the present case.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 701-02,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 681, 688-92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p701\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It strains established judicial analysis to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   does not allow the monument in this case to stand as a secular memorial to the lives of soldiers lost during war in service of the Nation.
