CONRAD, JR., District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Rockville Cars, LLC and Priority 1 Automotive Group, Inc. (\"Rockville Cars\"), brought a Section 1983 suit in the District of Maryland against the City of Rockville, Maryland (\"the City\") and its Acting Chief of Inspection Services, Robert L. Purkey, Jr. In its action, Rockville Cars alleged a violation of its procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when the City suspended its building permit. The City filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the District Court granted. Rockville Cars now appeals the District Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We agree with the District Court and affirm its decision. A property right failed to vest in Rockville Cars' building permit when its application contained material misrepresentations. Furthermore, even if Rockville Cars did have a property interest, it failed to take advantage of the sufficient process afforded to it by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In pursuit of its business selling new and used cars, Rockville Cars leased a parcel of land owned by Robin Tang in Rockville, Maryland. On this leased plot stood a building which previously housed a restaurant and a small furniture store. Rockville Cars planned to convert this building into an automobile show room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before commencing its work on the building, Rockville Cars submitted two documents to the City in order to obtain a building permit. First, Rockville Cars sent a Minor Site Plan Application on October 17, 2012, to the City's Department of Community Planning and Development Services. This department would determine whether Rockville Cars' renovation plans complied with the City's zoning ordinances. In its Minor Site Plan Application, Rockville Cars accurately listed Robin Tang as the owner of the parcel of land and obtained his permission to begin redevelopment of the existing building. The project narrative stated that Rockville Cars would repurpose the building into a show room that would house approximately four cars. Specifically, Rockville Cars disclosed that the show room would \"replace the vacated, approved restaurant use within the existing building.\" J.A. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Approximately four months later, in February 28, 2013, Rockville Cars filed a second document, a Commercial Building Permit Application (\"Permit Application\"), to a separate division of the Planning Department, the Inspection Services Division. This division's bailiwick did not include determining compliance with the City's zoning ordinances. It never saw-nor did the Permit Application refer to-the Minor Site Plan Application. The Permit Application featured two differences from the Minor Site Plan Application. First, under the project description, the Permit Application stated that Rockville Cars would not just repurpose, but\n   <em>\n    demolish\n   </em>\n   and renovate the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The demolition would leave the current building's existing foundation and partial walls unchanged, but Rockville Cars would otherwise rebuild within that footprint. Second, the Permit Application mistakenly listed Priority One Automotive as the property owner rather than Mr. Tang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receiving the Permit Application, the City approved the renovation of the Rockville Pike building on March 21, 2013, and issued a permit in Mr. Tang's name. With the permit in hand, Rockville Cars razed the leased building, leaving only the foundational slab. Rockville Cars' plans, however, would soon come to a grinding halt. On July 17, 2013, Rockville Cars received an email relaying that Mr. Tang contacted the City and retracted his permission underlying the building permit. Accordingly, on July 19, Acting Chief of Inspection Services for the City, Robert Purkey, Jr., suspended Rockville Cars' building permit through a written Stop Work Order. The order explained that Mr. Tang claimed Rockville Cars lacked the authority to submit a building permit application. Additionally, the Stop Work Order stated that the scope of the project did not comport with the Minor Site Plan Amendment, which the City previously approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December of 2013, the City sent Rockville Cars a letter further detailing why it suspended the building permit. The City explained that the demolition of the building resulted in a violation of the City's zoning ordinances. Specifically, a \"build-to\" provision applied along the commercial strip upon which Mr. Tang's property was located. This ordinance mandated the construction of new buildings within a certain distance from the road. The original building predated the build-to provision and therefore was exempted from compliance. The City Code would have allowed this exception to continue if Rockville Cars merely renovated the interior of the original building. However, because Rockville Cars\n   <em>\n    demolished\n   </em>\n   the building, Rockville Cars was then required to build any new structure in accordance with the build-to provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following year, on May 16, 2014, Rockville Cars submitted a new application which the City approved. To restart construction, Rockville Cars conceded to numerous demands at a considerable expense. As a result, Rockville Cars brought suit in the District of Maryland claiming that suspension of the building permit violated its procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Rockville Cars' sprint to federal court, it chose not to first pursue its claim through the City's Board of Adjusters and Appeals. As laid out in the Rockville City Code, Chapter 5, Article 5, Section 113.1, this Board of Appeals allowed claims for \"[a]ny person aggrieved by and desirous of challenging a\n   decision of the administrative authority in connection with the interpretation, application, or modification of any provision ... relating to the manner of construction or material used in connection with the erection, alteration, or repair of a building.\" J.A. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The City responded to Rockville Cars' complaint by filing a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court granted the City's Motion, concluding that no property interest vested in a building permit granted on the basis of material misrepresentations within an application.\n   <em>\n    Rockville Cars, LLC v.

Going further, the District Court also concluded that, even if Rockville Cars was deprived of its property interest, it was nonetheless afforded due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. The District Court explained that Rockville Cars had access to post-deprivation process but \"gave the matter little or no thought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. Not only did the District Court point to the City's Board of Appeals, it also stated that Rockville Cars had access to state courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As such, the District Court found that Rockville Cars failed to establish a claim regarding the inadequacy of a process that was never tapped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rockville Cars now argues four issues on appeal, contending that the District Court erred by: (1) relying on extrinsic evidence that was not integral to Rockville Cars' Amended Complaint; (2) finding no property interest in Rockville Cars' building permit; (3) finding that, in the alternative, Rockville Cars was not deprived of any property interest that existed; and (4) finding that, in the alternative, Rockville Cars was not denied due process of law if a deprivation of property interest occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.\n   <em>\n    Weidman v.

Because the City relied on the Minor Site Plan Amendment to assure compliance with zoning ordinances, the City granted the building permit on the premise that the project would gut and renovate the existing building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Rockville Cars misrepresented the owner of the property in question.

Even if a property right vested in Rockville Cars' building permit, and even if the City deprived Rockville Cars of that interest, no \u00a7 1983 procedural due process violation exists when a party fails to exhaust both administrative and state court remedies that the government affords to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Analyzing the adequacy of process a state affords usually requires courts to \"consult the entire panoply of predeprivation and postdeprivation process provided by the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Tri Cty.

This \"panoply\" of process could spark a lengthy discussion beginning with whether or not Rockville Cars received an opportunity to be heard prior to the suspension of its permit. However, the Court need not decide the sufficiency of Rockville Cars' pre-deprivation process when it failed to even pursue the post-deprivation state remedies afforded to it.

Rockville Cars could have sought an injunction to block the City's suspension of the building permit. It could have even sought an immediate declaration of its rights that the appellate process provided by the City Code was unconstitutional. However, Rockville Cars ignored these avenues in its rush to federal court. As a result, the Court has no reason to believe that the state process for redeeming Rockville Cars' alleged property right in its permit was constitutionally inadequate. Not when Rockville Cars \"simply 'found it unnecessary even to enter upon, let alone travel the entire length of, that road.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550553\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/216/#p230\">\n    519 F.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Amsden v.

Rockville Cars failed to allege a \u00a7 1983 procedural due process violation.

Nor does the Court need to address whether remand to another district court judge is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the District Court's order granting the City of Rockville's Motion to Dismiss is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DIAZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rockville Cars' failure to exhaust available administrative and state court remedies\n   dooms this federal case. For that reason, I agree that the district court properly granted dismissal. I would not, however, reach the thornier question of whether Rockville Cars obtained a protected property interest that entitled it to some quantum of process before the City revoked its permit. Because the majority reaches this issue and concludes that no such interest attached, I write separately to explain why that may not be so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the majority recognizes, a building permit issued under state or local law generally conveys in its holder a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Ihnken\n   </em>\n   , Rockville Cars' due process claim does not turn on \"whether the permit actually allowed\" the demolition to proceed, but instead asks only whether Rockville Cars \"was given proper notice and an opportunity to be heard before the permit-whatever it may have lawfully allowed-was revoked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204371440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rockville Cars applied for a permit because it wanted to demolish two existing retail storefronts and convert them into a single BMW showroom. The inquiry as to what construction work (if any) Rockville Cars could perform given the misrepresentations in its application is a question that could have been pursued through the administrative appeal process or in state court. Rockville Cars chose not to do so, and cannot come to us now to seek relief. But that inquiry is distinct from the question of whether the City, after granting a permit to Rockville Cars, could then take it away without some form of notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. It seems to me the Constitution requires that much. But because Rockville Cars failed to exhaust the administrative and state court remedies available to it, I join my colleagues in affirming the district court's judgment dismissing this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Not only did this description conflict with the Minor Site Plan Application, it also conflicted with other portions of the Permit Application itself. None of the checkboxes pertinent to demolition above that handwritten project description were filled in.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The District Court treated the City's motion as a Motion to Dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The misrepresentations within Rockville Cars' application are material, even if the City, post permit-suspension, ultimately corrected the identity of the property owner. A misrepresentation is \"material\" if it is \"[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person's decision-making; significant; essential.\" MATERIAL, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Whether or not the City caught all of Rockville Cars' misrepresentations, and whether or not those misrepresentations actually affected the City's decision is irrelevant. Knowledge of them would affect the decision-making process. Here, who is doing the construction, and the nature of the construction matters. And the demolition of a building affected zoning ordinance compliance where a renovation would not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    We do not find the dicta in\n    <em>\n     Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

No \"retrospective fiction\" exists in this case. While Rockville Cars obtained a permit, it did not do so legitimately. A\n    <em>\n     legitimate\n    </em>\n    entitlement is necessary to invoke the protections of Procedural Due Process.\n    <em>\n     Roth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p569\">\n     408 U.S. at 577\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p569\">\n     92 S.Ct. 2701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nor did the City \"rephrase\" their reasoning to justify suspending Rockville Cars' permit. From the start, the Stop Work Order stated that the scope of the project did not comport with the Minor Site Plan Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The concurrence expresses concern that \"a municipality wishing to deprive a person of an interest could simply identify-or even invent-some material misrepresentation on the part of the owner and retroactively vanquish the interest without the burden of process.\" That simply is not the case here. The permit suspension identified the material misrepresentations that we find sufficient here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    It is unclear to me that all of the purported misrepresentations are in fact material. For example, while Rockville Cars did misidentify the owner of the property in its application, the permit ultimately issued by the City identified the correct owner. This cuts against materiality because it suggests that the City's decision to issue the permit was not based on Rockville Cars' statement as to who owned the land. Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, I assume that the permit application contained some material misrepresentations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
