In\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

In\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's scope did not extend to advisory sentencing provisions that only\n   <em>\n    guide\n   </em>\n   a sentencing court's discretion. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p894\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p894\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). But the Supreme Court did not disturb or redefine the right recognized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   : vague sentencing provisions that\n   <em>\n    fix\n   </em>\n   a defendant's sentence under the categorical approach violate due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brown's case presents just such a violation. He was sentenced in July 2003, when the Sentencing Guidelines were \"mandatory and binding on all judges.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p233\">\n    543 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p233\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p233\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Under these Guidelines, he received a career-offender enhancement for a prior conviction that fell within the Guidelines' identically worded residual clause.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p304\">\n    868 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   300 n.5. Pursuant to \u00a7 2255(f)(3), Brown filed a habeas petition within one year of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and asserted the Supreme Court's newly recognized\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   right to be free from sentences fixed by the unconstitutionally vague residual clause. He argued that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's right also applied to the residual clause of the pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   Guidelines, which used identical language to \"fix[ ]\" his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2557\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the majority read\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   too narrowly: Brown's petition was untimely, it concluded, because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is limited only to those sentences fixed by the ACCA's residual clause.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p304\">\n    868 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The majority erroneously conflates the threshold statute-of-limitations inquiry of \u00a7 2255(f)(3) with the merits of Brown's claim. To get into court, the petition must be filed within one year of \"the date on which the\n   <em>\n    right asserted\n   </em>\n   was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.\" \u00a7 2255(f)(3) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   recognizes a new right with retroactive application.\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1265\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Brown has asserted that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's new right applies to him and filed his petition within one year of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's publication. And Brown's assertion is eminently reasonable: \"the mandatory Guidelines' residual clause presents the same problems of notice and arbitrary enforcement as the ACCA's residual clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p304\">\n    868 F.3d at 309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gregory, C.J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   is not to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p894\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   903 n.4 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As the First Circuit has recognized, what \"\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   left open ... was a question of statutory interpretation concerning how mandatory the [Sentencing Reform Act] made the guidelines before\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263628\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/72/#p83\">\n    871 F.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (1st Cir. 2017). This is the merits inquiry-whether the Guidelines' residual clause, when used to fix sentences pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , is void for vagueness. But the statute-of-limitations inquiry cannot be identical to the merits inquiry lest the former swallow the latter. That the Supreme Court has not issued a formal holding on the merits does not change the fact that Brown has brought within one year a claim that\n   <em>\n    asserts\n   </em>\n   the right newly recognized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and made retroactively applicable on collateral review. \u00a7 2255(f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the merits, I believe that the majority's reading of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is too narrow.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p304\">\n    868 F.3d at 309-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gregory, C.J., dissenting). Congress used the word \"right\" instead of \"holding\" in \u00a7 2255 because it \"recognizes that the Supreme Court guides the lower courts not just with technical holdings but with general rules that are logically inherent in those holdings, thereby ensuring less arbitrariness and more consistency in our law.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263628\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/72/#p83\">\n    871 F.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Supreme Court precedent identifies a new right as one that \"breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation,\" as compared to a case simply \"dictated\" by existing precedent.\n   <em>\n    Chaidez v.

And because the mandatory Guidelines' identically worded residual clause fixed the sentences of pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   career offenders, I would conclude under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that it violates due process.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p304\">\n    868 F.3d at 309-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gregory, C.J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ultimately, the constitutionality of pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentences fixed by the Guidelines' residual clause is a question for the Supreme Court-and one I urge it to answer soon. But the Court today misses an opportunity to provide justice for hundreds of defendants imprisoned because of an unconstitutionally vague sentencing provision.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
