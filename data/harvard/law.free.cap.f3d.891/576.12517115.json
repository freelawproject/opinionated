The Order to Show Cause was predicated on potential violations of this court's Local Rule 8.10, requiring these petitions to be filed no later than seven business days prior to a scheduled execution date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. As to the first question, Counsel claimed their client, now executed, informed them about the lawsuit filed by Dr. Florez in February 2018, which precipitated their filings. Counsel nevertheless failed directly to answer the second question, and instead asserted unpersuasive, post-hoc arguments as to why this court should have discredited the affidavit. After reviewing Counsels' submissions carefully, we do not impose sanctions, but we chastise habeas Counsel for failing to even acknowledge, much less attempt, to rebut an affidavit timely offered by the State that on its face contradicted the factual basis for the last minute successive petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This court takes very seriously its duty to review all petitions on behalf of petitioners facing execution. Our task is made all the more difficult when counsel, having already pressed against an impending execution date, simply ignore facts brought to bear by the State that undermine their newly discovered theories. There is no excuse for such defaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We impose no more onerous Rule 11 sanction today for counsels' failure to address a crucial fact militating against their last-minute petition. This bespeaks lack of candor to the court and arguably lack of a good-faith basis for the positions they espoused. However, attorneys Seth Kretzer and Carlo D'Angelo are admonished that their pleadings and filings in future cases will be scrutinized for accuracy, completeness and compliance with Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Judge Dennis did not participate in deciding this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fifth Cir. Local R. 8.10 (\"Counsel who seek a certificate of appealability, permission to file a successive petition, or an appeal from a district court judgment less than 7 days before the scheduled execution must attach to the proposed filing a detailed explanation stating under oath the reason for the delay. If the motions are filed less than 7 days before the scheduled execution, the court may direct counsel to show good cause for the late filing. If counsel cannot do so, counsel will be subject to sanctions.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
