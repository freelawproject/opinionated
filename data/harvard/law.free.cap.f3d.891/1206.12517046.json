Plaintiffs assert that because membership benefits are so enticing, most teachers will acquiesce, join the Unions, and pay the non-chargeable-i.e., political-fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief in the form of (1) a declaration that California's agency shop laws, collective bargaining laws, and the CBAs entered into the by the Unions violate their constitutional rights; (2) a declaration that those laws and CBAs coerce teachers into funding the Unions' political activities in violation of their constitutional rights; and (3) a declaration that those laws and CBAs violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights by forcing school superintendents to deduct from teachers' paychecks dues that support the Unions' non-chargeable activities. Plaintiffs\n   also seek an injunction (1) barring the Unions from denying Union membership or any of its privileges based on a teacher's refusal to pay the non-chargeable fee; and (2) barring school superintendents from deducting the non-chargeable fee from Union members' paychecks. Finally, Plaintiffs seek \"such additional or different relief as [the district court] deems just and proper, including an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of this action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Unions filed a motion to dismiss the SAC under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which the district court granted with prejudice. The court rejected Plaintiffs' argument that the Unions' internal membership rules requiring their members to pay the non-chargeable fee constitute state action. The court found unpersuasive Plaintiffs' theory that \"the choice [teachers] face between the benefits of union membership and the lack of benefits of nonmember status 'is a product of state action because the coercion that California teachers experience could not exist without the State.' \" To the contrary, the court found that because the Unions could decide, without any intervention by the State, not to require their members to pay non-chargeable fees, Plaintiffs challenged only a\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   decision by the Unions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court also rejected Plaintiffs' argument that the CBAs negotiated by the State and the Unions are infused with state action through state legislation authorizing agency shops. The court noted that the \"agency shop arrangement established by the State does not compel employees to finance union activities unrelated to collective bargaining\n   <em>\n    unless they choose to join a union.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added).

Accordingly, because Plaintiffs failed to show that the Unions qua \"state actors\" had infringed their constitutional rights, the district court found no actionable claim for relief and dismissed the case.

First, Plaintiffs rely on a catch-all claim for relief in their SAC, which seeks \"such additional or different relief as [the district court] deems just and proper.\" Second, Plaintiffs argue that the district court could \"issue restitution or other equitable relief on its own.\" Third, Plaintiffs reason that because Bhakta still lives in California and works for one of the school districts represented by a Union, she has standing because it is conceivable she could rejoin the Union in the future.

But, as the Unions point out, bootstrapping restitution into an ancillary prayer for relief at this stage of the litigation runs afoul of binding Ninth Circuit law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Until now, Plaintiffs never sought any type of money damages. Injunctive relief-a requirement that the Unions allow their members to abstain from paying a non-chargeable political fee, or allow nonmembers to enjoy the perquisites of Union membership-and a declaration that the Unions' operations are unconstitutional, form the body, heart, and soul of Plaintiffs' action. None of Plaintiffs' three complaints nor their briefing on appeal indicate any desire for monetary relief. Moreover, restitution would not vindicate\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Union members' First Amendment rights, even though that is precisely what Plaintiffs seek to do.

Rule 21 provides that \"[o]n motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion confronts several obstacles. Most fundamentally, to grant Plaintiffs' request we would first need to hold that a court, having been deprived of jurisdiction by way of mootness, may nevertheless resurrect jurisdiction by adding a party to the suit. Second, we would need to find that AAE has standing in its own right to pursue Plaintiffs' claims. And third, even if we ruled in favor of Plaintiffs on these two jurisdictional issues, we would still need to decide that Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 21 's criteria for adding AAE to the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ultimately, despite its efforts, AAE fails to make the grade because, we hold, Rule 21 is an improper vehicle for reviving a moot case, and even if it were not, AAE does not satisfy the requirements for Rule 21 joinder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   By the time a case reaches the court of appeals, it has undergone significant development. If it originated in district court, a complaint has been served, an answer or motion to dismiss has been filed, and discovery may have been taken. All of this occurs in the context of a particular dispute between particular parties. Adding a party midstream can alter the character of the litigation in material ways, causing a plaintiff or defendant to adjust their theory of the case, file additional or different motions, and modify their legal strategy. Moreover, joining a party on appeal carries an acute risk of prejudice because the opposing party is deprived of the opportunity to develop the facts and law as is relevant to the new party. For these reasons, Rule 21 is \"rarely\" used on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullaney v.

While Plaintiffs also seek restitution in their post-merits briefing, as explained in Part IV.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we do not credit this eleventh-hour plea to convert a matter that was always about securing prospective equitable relief into a claim for money damages. However, AAE fails to carry its burden on the second and third factors. AAE has not shown that it seeks relief for the same reasons as the original Plaintiffs and, as a consequence, joining AAE presents a considerable risk of prejudice to the Unions in their chosen defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   AAE's interests and those of the Unions diverge in a crucial way: AAE seeks to out-compete the Unions, whereas Plaintiffs continue to support their Unions. Indeed, AAE characterizes its mission as providing an \"alternative to the partisan politics ... of the teacher labor unions.\" AAE has also \"acknowledg[ed] that [its affiliates and affiliates of public sector teachers' unions] compete for membership dues dollars, because as a practical matter both organizations offer similar benefits ... and one would not expect teachers to pay two sets of dues for similar benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Unified Sch.

In other words, join AAE, not the Unions. Driving home the point, AAE recently stated that \"[t]here is a direct conflict between AAE's mission\" and collective bargaining by the Unions, and that it \"object[s] on policy grounds to the positions taken by teachers' unions in the collective-bargaining process and outside of that process.\" Compl. at 11-12 (\n   <em>\n    Yohn v.

Plaintiffs, by contrast, \"value their unions,\" in particular the \"support\" their Unions provide in \"negotiating with their employers\" through collective bargaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The mis-match in objectives renders it implausible that AAE seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to, as the Plaintiffs desire, make Union membership\n   <em>\n    more at\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tractive\n   </em>\n   to teachers reluctant to pay the Unions' non-chargeable fee. It also means the Unions may have litigated the case differently, and made alternative arguments, had AAE been a party from the start. For example, the Unions likely would have argued that AAE lacks organizational standing-a threshold question not implicated by the Plaintiffs' original action. The Unions may have also explored the distinction between AAE's members' alleged First Amendment injury and Plaintiffs' own: Plaintiffs are Union members whose free speech interests are allegedly infringed by the requirement that they pay their Unions' non-chargeable fee.

These include voting rights within the Unions and the privilege of serving on certain school district policy committees. This disjuncture in benefits may provide some surface appeal to AAE's argument that their members might join the Unions but for the Unions' mandatory political fees, and thus that their members and Plaintiffs share a common interest in this litigation. But AAE fails to identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of its members that seek to join the Unions. And even if it did, voting rights and committee privileges do not implicate a First Amendment interest.\n   <em>\n    Minn. State Bd. for Comm'y Colleges v.

That is because \"pressure to join the exclusive representative in\n   order to give [individuals] the opportunity to,\" among other things, \"serve on ... committees\" is \"inherent in our system of government;\n   <em>\n    it does not create an unconstitutional inhibition\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    on associational freedom.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/#p289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

But Plaintiffs resigned their Union memberships during the pendency of their appeal, thereby mooting the appeal and depriving us of jurisdiction. Now, at the eleventh hour, Plaintiffs seek to add a new party, AAE, to their action. Adding a new party on appeal is rarely done, however, and is particularly ill-advised-indeed, we hold it to be erroneous as a matter of law-when used to resurrect a moot case.\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415444\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/135/#p141\">\n    42 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642882\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/128/\">\n    420 U.S. at 129-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642882\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/128/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
