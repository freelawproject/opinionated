In January 2017, after an evidentiary hearing on statutory rape allegations, the district court revoked Marcel King's term of supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months in prison. On appeal, King argues the district court violated his due process rights by excluding him from the courtroom for a portion of the minor victim's testimony and by admitting into evidence a hearsay report without live witness authentication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   King's appeal was fully briefed on October 31, 2017. On January 5, 2018, the Bureau of Prisons unconditionally released him from custody. His sentence is complete. The government argues King's appeal is now moot because King identifies no \"ongoing\" collateral consequences caused by his revocation. King counters that he does face collateral consequences, namely, the potential that his revocation charge, which involved a finding that he committed statutory rape, could require him to register as a sex offender and could affect his ability to visit his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although King raises a novel collateral consequences argument, the consequences he identifies are, under controlling case law, inadequate to maintain his case here. As explained below, this appeal is MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the parole revocation context, the Supreme Court has held that without proof of ongoing collateral consequences from that revocation, an unconditional release from custody moots a defendant's challenge to his allegedly erroneous revocation.\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

He contends that because his revocation was based on a finding that he committed statutory rape, he may be forced in the future to register as a sex-offender, which could affect his ability to visit his own children. Although sex-offender registration is a collateral consequence of a criminal conviction for statutory rape,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Gregoire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716361\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1180/#p1182\">\n    151 F.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182-83 (9th Cir. 1998), King was not convicted of statutory rape. Rather, in a supervised release revocation proceeding, the district court found by a preponderance of the\n   evidence that King violated a state law criminalizing statutory rape, and then revoked King's term of supervision. King argues he nonetheless faces a \"real and present danger\" that the charge underlying his revocation, though not leading to a conviction, may soon subject him to registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To support his argument, King cites laws throughout the United States that have extended sex registry requirements beyond criminal convictions. He points to five state laws requiring sex offender registration by a defendant who was charged with committing a registrable offense, but later found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20290.004\">\n    Cal.

He identifies laws mandating sex offender registration based on criminal convictions suffered in foreign jurisdictions, where certain due process protections may not have applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2029-4003\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-4003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/2 (A)(1)(a). He also refers to a law mandating registration for defendants initially charged with committing a registrable offense, but then convicted of a different offense arising from the \"same set of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20243.166\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 243.166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   subd. 1b. Identifying a trend of extending registration requirements he says these state laws represent, King argues the trend may soon reach him and others whose supervised release revocations are based on a finding they committed a registrable offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   King's argument raises a novel question. How likely must the future possibility of a requirement of sex-offender registration be for there to be an injury-in-fact? The question is an important one because the Supreme Court has determined that certain sex-offender registration requirements are nonpunitive. They therefore may be broadened on an ongoing basis and applied retroactively to those who were convicted earlier of a registrable offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p105\">\n    538 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105-06,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p105\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p105\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (because Alaska's statute broadening the reach and accessibility of sex offender registry was \"nonpunitive ... its retroactive application d[id] not violate the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   King need not wait until his name is etched on a registry to argue he has suffered collateral consequences. But he must show registration is more than \"a matter of speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p8\">\n    523 U.S. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p8\">\n    118 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This he has not done. In sentencing him on his revocation, the district court did not impose a sex-offender registration condition. King has not identified\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   existing or impending laws extending sex-offender registration requirements to defendants whose supervised release or parole revocations were based on a finding of commission of a registrable offense. He has not said he plans to move to a state where the risk of a future registration requirement is high. On this record, the future registration requirement King hypothesizes is too remote to constitute the \"concrete and continuing injury\" required to avoid mootness.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p8\">\n    523 U.S. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p8\">\n    118 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This conclusion applies equally to King's argument that the consequences of his revocation may hinder his ability to visit his own children. The record contains no information on an existing custody arrangement, or any statutory or factual suggestion that any such arrangement may be in jeopardy as a result of King's revocation charge. To the extent King argues the potential for a registration requirement in the future could affect his visitation rights, the argument fails for the reasons discussed\n   above with respect to a hypothetical threshold registration requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because King has fully completed the sentence imposed for his revocation of supervised release and has identified only speculative and hypothetical collateral consequences flowing from the charge underlying his revocation, this appeal is MOOT.
