We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The merits of Doe's lawsuit are not before us, so we recite only in brief the factual basis of his claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The procedural history of the case is more germane to the issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Doe's Suspension\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Doe, a male UCSB student, sued The Regents and Perkin after he was disciplined for the sexual assault of a female UCSB student, Jane Doe (\"Jane\") during a trip to Lake Tahoe. Doe denies that he assaulted Jane and instead contends that the sexual encounter, which occurred in June 2014, was consensual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 6, 2014, UCSB notified Doe that he had been charged with sexual assault in violation of the university's code of conduct. A week later, Doe had a meeting with Perkin, at which she read Doe a statement that Jane had written. On November 25, UCSB informed Doe that on December 11, an adjudicatory committee would hold a hearing on the assault charges. Two days before the hearing, Perkin provided Doe with an investigative report that she produced based on interviews with Doe, Jane, and other witnesses. The committee later held a second hearing, on December 19, before which Perkin completed a second investigative report. Shortly after the second hearing, the committee found Doe responsible for Jane's sexual assault and recommended the university suspend him for two quarters. In January 2015, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young upheld the decision and, on February 16, 2015, UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang denied Doe's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Complaint and First Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In April 2015, Doe filed this action against The Regents, alleging that the committee had \"no basis\" for its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doe brought a Title IX claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a claim\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his procedural due process rights, and numerous state law claims. Doe alleged that UCSB discriminated against him because of his male sex via a \"non-exhaustive list\" of wrongful actions, including preventing him from presenting character evidence and disciplining him on the basis of investigative reports that \"present[ed] a skewed rendition of the facts[.]\" Doe also alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that UCSB lacked jurisdiction over the Lake Tahoe trip, and that UCSB intentionally scheduled the December 19 hearing on a day when Doe's attorney was unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Regents moved to dismiss, arguing that Doe's lawsuit was barred in its entirety because he had not petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1094.5 (\" \u00a7 1094.5 petition\" or \"writ petition\") and had therefore not exhausted his judicial remedies. After supplemental briefing, the district court granted the motion, concluding that Doe's state law claims were barred because he had not yet filed a \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition. The court rejected The Regents' argument that Doe's \u00a7 1983 claim was also barred for failure to exhaust judicial remedies. Still, the court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claim on Eleventh Amendment grounds and the Title IX claim for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. First Amended Complaint and Second Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Doe filed a first amended complaint (\"FAC\"), which included a \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition. Doe alleged that UCSB held an unfair hearing and that its disciplinary decision was not supported by the evidence. Doe asserted Title IX and declaratory relief claims against The Regents and substituted Perkin as the sole defendant on his \u00a7 1983 due process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doe also added new factual allegations. For example, he alleged that UCSB exhibited gender bias against Doe as a result of \"mounting pressure\" from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, a campus roundtable on sexual assault, campus organizations, and a University of California system-wide task force on sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Regents moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court dismissed with prejudice the Title IX claim for failure to state a claim, and without prejudice the \u00a7 1983 claim as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the \u00a7 1094.5 writ claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Second Amended Complaint and Third Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doe then filed the SAC, in which he clarified that the \u00a7 1983 claim was alleged against Perkin in her official capacity. Doe also re-alleged the \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition. The Regents again moved to dismiss, arguing that the \u00a7 1983 claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the \u00a7 1094.5 writ claim was barred for failure to exhaust judicial remedies. Before the district court ruled on The Regents' motion, Doe moved the court to reconsider its dismissal of his Title IX claim. The court granted the motion. The Regents then moved to dismiss the reinstated Title IX claim, also contending that Doe's \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition against The Regents was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Thus, the district court had before it two motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court denied both motions. First, the court ruled that the \u00a7 1983 claim against Perkin in her official capacity did not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment, nor was Perkin entitled to qualified or quasi-judicial immunity. Second, the court\n   rejected The Regents' contention that the \u00a7 1094.5 petition was precluded. The court reasoned that because the SAC included the \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition, Doe had exhausted his judicial remedies. Third, the court concluded that abstention under\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), was not warranted because there were no ongoing state proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Regents moved for reconsideration, contending that the Eleventh Amendment bars a plaintiff from bringing a state law claim, including a \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition, against The Regents in federal court. The court denied the motion. First, the court concluded that a \u00a7 1094.5 petition is a procedural mechanism that \"functions as a vehicle for federal injunctive relief for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes\"; thus, the Eleventh Amendment did not bar it. Second, the court \"interpret[ed]\" the \u00a7 1094.5 petition against The Regents as a claim \"against the University officials who have the power to effectuate any prospective injunctive relief ordered by the court[,]\" and therefore concluded that it was permitted under the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908), exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, The Regents contend that the district court should have dismissed Doe's entire complaint because the Eleventh Amendment bars the \u00a7 1094.5 writ claim and, because Doe has thus not filed a valid \u00a7 1094.5 petition, his failure to exhaust judicial remedies bars the \u00a7 1983 and Title IX claims. Alternatively, The Regents contend that the district court should at least have abstained under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   . We consider The Regents' arguments\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For evidence of waiver, Doe points only to The Regents' acknowledgement in a hearing on the first motion to dismiss that they had \"yet to assert\" Eleventh Amendment immunity. Instead, The Regents first argued that Doe's entire complaint should be dismissed for failure to exhaust judicial remedies. That was not an unequivocal waiver. We therefore consider The Regents' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Eleventh Amendment protects states and state instrumentalities, such as The Regents, from suit in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334896\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/89/#p99\">\n    465 U.S. at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334896\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/89/#p99\">\n    104 S.Ct. 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BV Eng'g v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply when a suit seeks relief under state law, even if the plaintiff names an individual state official rather than a state instrumentality as the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334896\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/89/#p99\">\n    465 U.S. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334896\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/89/#p99\">\n    104 S.Ct. 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Those Eleventh Amendment principles require dismissal of Doe's \u00a7 1094.5 writ petition, which is a state law claim.
