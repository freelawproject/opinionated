A jury found Campbell guilty of drug and firearms offenses and he was sentenced to 195 months in prison. We affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct appeal. Campbell then filed this \u00a7 2255 motion, contending that his pretrial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in investigating and litigating his motion to suppress evidence. The district court denied Campbell's \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing on the grounds that Campbell could not establish deficient performance or prejudice. This is his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In late 2008, Detectives Richard Hughey and Charles Bates of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office received a tip from a confidential informant that Campbell was using United Parcel Service and Federal Express to ship marijuana to Jacksonville. The detectives used computer databases to identify several addresses associated with Campbell, one of which was 7635 Praver Drive East in Jacksonville. Detective Hughey contacted William Brown, a UPS employee, and told Brown to notify him if UPS received any packages designated for the addresses associated with Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2009, a UPS driver told Brown that he had a package addressed for a \"Maureen Lawrence\" at the Praver house. Brown took the package to his office, opened it, and found that it contained marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brown contacted Detective Hughey, and he and Detective Bates arrived at the UPS facility shortly thereafter to inspect the package. The detectives saw the marijuana sitting in the open package, determined that it was in fact marijuana, resealed the package, and decided to make a controlled delivery of the package. The detectives also obtained an anticipatory search warrant to execute after successful delivery of the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Police officers set up surveillance around the Praver house before making the controlled delivery. Detective Hughey observed a man, later identified as Campbell's brother, Alex, drive up to the house,\n   pull into the garage, and close it. About five minutes later he opened the garage and drove off. A few minutes after Alex left, another vehicle arrived at the house and the passenger, who the police identified as Campbell, got out. The vehicle drove off, and a detective dressed in plainclothes walked up to Campbell in the front yard of the house to give him the package. Campbell stated that the package might belong to a sibling with the last name of Lawrence, but accepted the package and then put it inside the garage. He then closed the garage door from the outside, knocked on the front door, and an individual later identified as Tamario Wiley opened the front door and let Campbell inside. A few minutes later, Alex returned to the house, drove his vehicle inside the garage, and closed the garage door from the inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers executed the search warrant about ten minutes later. They found the UPS package in a car parked in the garage; that car also contained another 50-pound package of marijuana. As the officers searched the house for marijuana, they found a number of other incriminating items: four firearms, including an assault rifle with a 100-round magazine; a laptop with an open screen displaying a UPS tracking number; a money counter; several thousand dollars in cash; a lease agreement naming Alex as the lessee of the Praver house; lease agreements for other houses; and storage unit rental agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The police arrested Campbell and his brother. When police asked Campbell where he lived, he initially gave the P.O. Box listed on his driver's license, but then identified the Praver house as his residence. The police searched Campbell and found over $5,000 in cash and a small amount of marijuana on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police used the documents from the Praver house to obtain search warrants for storage unit 226 at Atlantic Self-Storage and a house located at 4708 Trevi Drive in Jacksonville. Police found over $500,000 in cash at the storage unit. At the Trevi house, police found money grams; hotel, car rental, and airline receipts; various notes containing addresses, phone numbers, and tracking numbers; and storage unit rental agreements. Those rental agreements led the police to conduct more authorized searches at other storage units, one of which (storage unit 2002) contained an assault rifle and boxes of shipping receipts connected to marijuana shipments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A grand jury indicted Campbell, Alex, his mother, and his sister with conspiracy to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and 846. Campbell and his brother were also charged with possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Campbell filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from Brown's search of the package at the UPS facility, the officers' search of the Praver house, and the search of storage unit 2002. He also sought to exclude evidence taken from storage unit 226 and the Trevi house as fruits of the poisonous tree. As relevant here, the government argued that Campbell did not have standing to challenge the Praver house search because he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in that house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The magistrate judge held a hearing in August 2009 and the government called Detective Hughey, Detective Bates, and\n   Brown (the UPS employee). Campbell's pre-trial counsel, Ross Haine, did not call any witnesses, and instead relied on cross-examination to attempt to show that Campbell had a legitimate expectation of privacy at the Praver house. At the end of the hearing, Haine argued that Campbell had established standing to challenge the search of the Praver house because computer searches revealed that Campbell was associated with the Praver house and Campbell had given the Praver house as his address when he was arrested. According to Haine, those facts showed that Campbell was more than a mere visitor at the Praver house and that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that Campbell's motion be denied, finding that he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the Praver house. The magistrate judge also found that the officers exceeded the scope of their authority when they seized the storage unit agreement documents from the Praver house, which led them to obtain search warrants for the storage units. But the magistrate judge found that Campbell could not challenge the evidence obtained from the storage units as fruits of the poisonous tree because he did not have standing to challenge the Praver house search. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and denied Campbell's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Campbell proceeded to a jury trial in February 2010. Campbell testified in his own defense. He admitted that he had marijuana shipped from California to Jacksonville and sold it, but denied that any of his family members were involved in the operation. He also denied ever renting or residing in the Praver house. The jury found Campbell guilty on all three charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the sentence hearing, the district court found that Campbell committed perjury because he had lied under oath about his family's involvement in the marijuana operation, the amount of marijuana he was trafficking, and other pieces of evidence. He received a 195-month prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Campbell appealed his convictions and sentence, which we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As relevant here, we rejected his claim that he had standing to challenge the search of the Praver house.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Fed.%20Appx.%20805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Fed.%20Appx.%20805\">\n    at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because those facts \"did not establish that he was more than a mere guest at the Praver house,\" we held that he did not have standing to challenge the search of that house.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Fed.%20Appx.%20805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C. Campbell's \u00a7 2255 Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Campbell filed this\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255 motion in August 2012. He raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Haine, his pretrial counsel who handled the motion to suppress. He alleged that Haine rendered ineffective assistance by failing to consult with Campbell, failing to investigate Campbell's ties with the Praver house, and by failing to call Campbell and other witnesses at the suppression hearing. According to Campbell, if Haine had called him and the other witnesses then he could have established that Campbell had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Praver house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Campbell attached a number of sworn affidavits to his \u00a7 2255 motion that he relied on to support his ineffective assistance claim. In one affidavit, Campbell stated that he had met with Haine on multiple occasions before the suppression hearing and that the two discussed potential defenses. Campbell told Haine that he wanted Haine to file a motion to suppress, and that Haine did so and provided Campbell with a copy. But according to Campbell, Haine did not explain what \"standing\" was after the government filed its response; Haine told Campbell not to worry about that because Campbell had provided the Praver house as his residence when he was arrested. When Campbell told Haine that Campbell did not live at the house, Haine replied that it \"wouldn't be a good idea to tell the government you didn't live at the Praver home, because if I were to say you didn't stay at the home, you wouldn't have standing to challenge the search.\" Campbell also stated in the affidavit that Haine did not interview him about his connection to the home and that when Campbell explained that he wanted to testify, Haine replied that it would not be a good idea because the government would trip him up. Campbell's friend, Tamario Wiley, also submitted an affidavit describing his meeting with Haine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As for the other affidavits, Campbell submitted one in which he described his connection to the Praver house. He stated that he was a regular guest at the house and went there almost every day, even without an invitation. He stated that he had been present at the home when no one was there, slept there on multiple occasions-including the night before his arrest-and would go to the house to play video games, listen to music, and hang out with his brother Alex and their friends. He also stated that he kept personal items at the Praver house, such as clothes, his computer, and papers. Campbell admitted that he did not have a key to the Praver house but if he wanted to visit when no one was there Alex or Wiley would leave a door unlocked or he would borrow their keys. Finally, Campbell denied meeting anyone at the Praver home to sell drugs, but admitted to having marijuana sent to the home on two occasions (including the delivery in this case). Campbell also submitted affidavits from Alex, Wiley, and three friends who visited the home. Those five people confirmed that Campbell often visited the Praver house to hang out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court denied Campbell's motion without an evidentiary hearing. It found that a hearing was not necessary because, accepting the facts in Campbell's affidavits as true, he could not succeed on his ineffective assistance claim. For deficient performance, the court found that Haine adequately investigated the case and made a reasonable decision not to call Campbell because the government could have used Campbell's testimony at trial for impeachment purposes. As for prejudice, the court found that Campbell could not state a meritorious Fourth Amendment claim because the evidence did not establish that he had an unrestricted right of access to the house or that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy as an overnight guest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Campbell appealed and we granted a certificate of appealability on the following claim only: Whether the district court erred in denying, without an evidentiary hearing, Campbell's claim that his pretrial counsel provided ineffective assistance in his litigation of a motion to suppress evidence that was obtained during the search of a residence located at 7635 Praver Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"We review the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing in a\n   \u00a7 2255 proceeding for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Winthrop-Redin v.

Although a petitioner \"need only\n   <em>\n    allege\n   </em>\n   -not prove-reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief,\" a district court \"need not hold a hearing if the allegations are patently frivolous, based upon unsupported generalizations, or affirmatively contradicted by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203244\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1210/#p1215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Campbell must \"demonstrate both that (1) 'counsel's performance was deficient,' and (2) 'the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827835\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1238/#p1258\">\n    655 F.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1258 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Deficient Performance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Campbell cannot establish that his counsel rendered deficient performance in litigating his motion to suppress. \"The standard for counsel's performance is reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\"\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n    218 F.3d 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1313 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). We do not \"grade counsel's performance\" because the \"issue is not what is possible or what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is constitutionally compelled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Campbell must show that \"particular and identified acts or omissions of [his] counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" and our review of counsel's performance is \"highly deferential.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n    at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Campbell argues that he can satisfy that heavy burden because Haine, his pretrial counsel, did not adequately investigate his connection to the Praver house and should have called him and other witnesses at the suppression hearing to establish that he had standing to challenge the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   That argument fails. Campbell states that Haine did not interview him, but he admits that Haine met with him on multiple occasions to discuss case strategy and that Haine complied with Campbell's request to file a motion to suppress the evidence from the Praver house. Campbell faults Haine for not properly investigating his relationship with the Praver house, but his affidavit indicates that Haine reached out to Tamario Wiley (one of Campbell's friends who lived at the Praver house) to discuss the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the transcript from the suppression hearing shows that Haine was familiar with the facts of the case and applicable Fourth Amendment law, as he\n   argued that Campbell had standing to challenge the search because he was more than a mere visitor at the Praver House. Although Haine may have been able to investigate more thoroughly Campbell's connection to the house, he knew that Campbell had given the Praver house as his residence when he was arrested and that the detectives' computer searches revealed a connection between Campbell and the Praver house. In light of those facts, Haine could have reasonably believed that he had enough information to establish standing and that his time would be better spent on other issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/1305/#p1313\">\n    at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ounsel need not always investigate before pursuing or not pursuing a line of defense. Investigation (even a nonexhaustive, preliminary investigation) is not required for counsel reasonably to decline to investigate a line of defense thoroughly.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As for Campbell's argument that Haine should have called him and other witnesses to testify, we have stated that \"[w]hich witnesses, if any, to call, and when to call them, is the epitome of a strategic decision, and it is one that we will seldom, if ever, second guess.\"\n   <em>\n    Waters v.

In light of Campbell's testimony at trial that he did not reside at the Praver house (which was contrary to what he told the arresting officer) and the district court's finding that he perjured himself multiple times during trial, Haine's fear that the government would trip Campbell up if he testified was not unreasonable. As a result, Haine did not render deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B. Prejudice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if Campbell could show that Haine's performance was constitutionally deficient, he cannot establish prejudice. Because he alleges that Haine failed \"to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim competently,\" to demonstrate prejudice he must \"prove that his Fourth Amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimmelman v.

The government does not dispute that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had the Praver house evidence been suppressed; the evidence from that search led to other evidence that established the amount of marijuana Campbell was trafficking. But the government does argue that Campbell cannot establish a meritorious Fourth Amendment claim because he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the Praver house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Campbell bears the burden of \"demonstrating a legitimate expectation of privacy\" in the Praver house.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
