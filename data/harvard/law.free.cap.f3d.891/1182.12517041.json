In 1991, Ironworkers entered into a consent decree after we upheld the Board's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Labor Relations Bd. v.

As to each of the Board's orders, Ironworkers agreed to refrain from engaging in further \"secondary boycott activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1999, the Board issued a contempt order against Ironworkers after finding that Ironworkers engaged in secondary picketing similar to the conduct addressed by the 1991 consent contempt adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11772223\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/1217/#p1218\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We upheld the Board's order and, consistent with Ironworkers' settlement, entered a new consent contempt adjudication enforcing the same prohibitions on secondary picketing as articulated in the prior adjudication. Almost two decades later, Ironworkers filed four separate motions under Rule 60(b)(5) seeking to modify the language contained in the 1991 and 1999 consent contempt adjudications prohibiting secondary picketing under Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B). In each, Ironworkers argued that in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) should be analyzed as a content-based restriction on speech that could not survive strict scrutiny review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We consolidated these four actions and stayed proceedings pending the outcome of\n   <em>\n    National Labor Relations Board v.

Ironworkers subsequently filed a motion that \"modifie[d] and substantially narrow[ed] its request\" for Rule 60 relief.

Ironworkers contends that the \"constitutional infirmity\" in the statute arises from the use of the word \"person\" in the statute that has been interpreted too broadly by encompassing secondary picketing of public entities as \"persons.\" Ironworkers asserts that this specific argument has never been addressed by the Supreme Court or by this court. This \"constitutional infirmity\" forms the \"narrowed\" basis upon which Ironworkers seeks to modify the consent decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Nevertheless, Ironworkers contends that\n   <em>\n    Safeco\n   </em>\n   did not address whether the restraint is applicable to government entities because that case concerned a labor union's picketing of a private enterprise. However, it has long been held that public entities are \"persons\" for purposes of the NLRA,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plumbers, Steamfitters, Refrigeration, Petroleum Fitters, &amp; Apprentices of Local 298, American Federation of Labor v. Door Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165847\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/354/#p358\">\n    359 U.S. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358-59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165847\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/354/#p358\">\n    79 S.Ct. 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165847\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/354/#p358\">\n    3 L.Ed.2d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). As Ironworkers acknowledges, there has been no change in the statute that would affect the Supreme Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ironworkers relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   to suggest that its right to peacefully picket the government is impermissibly infringed upon if Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) applies to government entities. Ironworkers argues that secondary picketing of the government is no different than any other governmental protest, and that Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B)'s prohibition against such picketing is tantamount to content-based viewpoint discrimination under\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   . However, Ironworkers' reading of\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   grossly expands its holding. In\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that strict scrutiny applied to a township's permitting ordinance that classified outdoor signs based upon the information conveyed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that laws restricting speech are subject to strict scrutiny if the restriction is \"content based.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2227 (citation omitted). \"Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citations omitted). The township's ordinance could not survive strict scrutiny because the ordinance restricted the conveyance of messages based solely upon content, and the township failed to meet its burden of showing that\n   the law served \"a compelling governmental interest and [was] narrowly tailored to that end.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The restrictions on speech addressed by\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   are not implicated by compliance with \u00a7 8(b)(4)(ii)(B). At the outset, not all forms of secondary protest are impermissible under the Section.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. and Constr.

Indeed, conventional avenues of government protest remain available for Ironworkers, just as they exist for any protestor seeking to express dissatisfaction with the State.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fogel v. Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654587\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/824/#p832\">\n    531 F.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that the First Amendment \"welcomes and protects\" verbal protests against government policy).

The declarations by Michael Silvey, Ironworkers' Business Manager, are curiously (and perhaps deliberately) vague on what exactly the union plans to do. Silvey's initial declaration states that the union \"would like to picket the District including its administrators and Board members to bring to their attention the fact that RND has had safety issues and other issues on prior jobs.\" I have no reason to doubt Ironworkers' desire to picket the District, but that desire, without more, is far from a \"concrete plan\" to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Diego County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651104\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1121/#p1126\">\n    98 F.3d at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that plaintiffs' assertion that they \"wish and intend to engage in activities\" prohibited by the challenged statute did not establish a concrete plan to violate the law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Silvey's supplemental declaration, filed after RND began work on the construction project, is no more definite. Silvey states that \"if [the Union] would picket the [District] to bring to the attention of the [District] and the public the Union's concerns with RND, it could do so.\" This statement is unclear as a matter of syntax, but in any event, it is not a concrete plan to violate the law. Ironworkers does not explain where it will engage in picketing, what type of conduct the picketing will entail, or even assert that relevant union officers have, in fact, discussed a potential picket of the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213165\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1134/#p1139\">\n    220 F.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the Board has certainly enforced section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) in the past, including against Ironworkers, those proceedings overwhelmingly have involved secondary picketing of private, rather than governmental, entities. Ironworkers does not allege it has ever been subject to an enforcement action for engaging in secondary picketing of a governmental entity, and identifies only three cases since Congress passed the current secondary boycott provision in 1959 where the Board has held that a union's secondary picketing of a governmental entity violated section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B). Therefore, while it is true the Board enforces section 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) as a general matter, the apparently limited history of enforcement in cases involving picketing of governmental entities limits the extent to which this factor indicates a \"genuine threat of imminent prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768136\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1045/#p1057\">\n    616 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1058 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213165\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1134/#p1139\">\n    220 F.3d at 1140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding, in a case involving a pre-enforcement challenge to an Alaska housing discrimination law, that the \"past prosecution\" factor was \"neutral\" where \"the record of past enforcement [was] limited, was civil only, not criminal, and in any event was in each case precipitated by the filing of complaints by potential tenants\").
