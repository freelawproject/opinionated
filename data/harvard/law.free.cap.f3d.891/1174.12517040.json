Vitaliano, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We ask the California Supreme Court to resolve an important open question of state law. To have statutory standing under the Unruh Act, a plaintiff must suffer discriminatory conduct. We need guidance, however, in applying the rules for statutory standing in the internet context, in order to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to sue an internet-based service provider after the plaintiff visits the business's website but refuses to accept terms of service that deny the plaintiff full and equal access. The California Supreme Court's guidance is especially necessary in light of current case law, which is divided on the question whether plaintiffs who present themselves to a business with an intent to use its services and encounter an exclusionary policy must nevertheless patronize the business in order to satisfy statutory standing. Accordingly, we certify the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Does a plaintiff suffer discriminatory conduct, and thus have statutory standing to bring a claim under the Unruh Act, when the plaintiff visits a business's website with the intent of using its services, encounters terms and conditions that deny the plaintiff full and equal access to its services, and then departs without entering into an agreement with the service provider? Alternatively, does the plaintiff have to engage in some further interaction with the business and its website before the plaintiff will be deemed to have been denied full and equal treatment by the business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Our phrasing of the questions should not restrict the Court's consideration of the issues involved. The Court may rephrase the questions as it sees fit in order to address the contentions of the parties. If the Court agrees to decide these questions, we agree to accept its decision. We recognize that the Court has a substantial caseload, and we submit these questions only because of their significance to claims brought under the Unruh Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Square, Inc. provides an internet-based service that allows individuals or merchants to \"accept electronic payments without themselves directly opening up a merchant account with any Visa or MasterCard member bank.\" Square's seller agreement states that \"[b]y creating a Square Account, you ... confirm that you will not accept payments in connection with the following businesses or business activities: ... (28) bankruptcy attorneys or collection agencies engaged in the collection of debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Square does not charge a subscription fee or admission fee, but charges a specified percentage of each transaction plus a flat fee per each transaction for its service.\n   <em>\n    See Square Reader For Magstripe\n   </em>\n   , Squareup.com, https://squareup.com/reader (last visited Mar. 27, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to his second amended complaint, Robert White, a bankruptcy attorney,\n   \"formed the strong, definite and specific intent\" to become a subscriber to Square. White stated that before attempting to subscribe, he familiarized himself with the issues arising from Square's seller agreement by reviewing a related case,\n   <em>\n    shierkatz RLLP v. Square, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   White then visited and reviewed the Square website, including the seller agreement. White alleges that he refused to click the link marked \"Continue\" on Square's website, which would have subjected him to the terms of the seller agreement, because he intended to use the service for his bankruptcy practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Instead, White sued Square in October 2015, alleging Square's seller agreement discriminated against bankruptcy attorneys in violation of the Unruh Act's ban on occupational discrimination. White sought to form a class of bankruptcy attorneys and other persons who had been \"dissuaded from either (i) hitting the Continue button [to accept the seller's agreement] on [Square's] website or (ii) otherwise attempting in any other possible manner to become customers of [Square]\" due to Square's ban on using its service in a bankruptcy practice. After this suit was filed, White's counsel visited Square's website on a daily basis, presented White's first and second amended complaints to Square, and sent a letter to Square demanding that it allow White to use Square's service to facilitate his bankruptcy practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court dismissed White's first amended complaint without prejudice on the ground that White lacked statutory standing to sue Square pursuant to the Unruh Act, and then dismissed White's second amended complaint with prejudice on the same ground. The district court reasoned that White had not attempted to obtain services from Square, and under\n   <em>\n    Surrey v. TrueBeginnings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731475\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/168/414/#p418\">\n    168 Cal.

After the district court denied White's subsequent motion for reconsideration and motion for a new trial, White appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, White first argued that neither the district court nor we had jurisdiction under Article III of the U.S. Constitution because White had not suffered a concrete and particularized injury as defined in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1548\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1548,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1548\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

In the alternative, White argued that the district court erred in holding that he lacked standing under the Unruh Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We conclude that White meets the constitutional standing requirements. White alleged that he sought to use Square's services, but was unable to do so because of its discriminatory policy against bankruptcy\n   attorneys. Because \"discrimination itself ... can cause serious non-economic injuries to those persons who are denied equal treatment solely because of their membership in a disfavored group,\"\n   <em>\n    Heckler v.

For instance,\n   <em>\n    Reycraft\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Osborne\n   </em>\n   suggest White may have standing if he presents himself to Square and is denied equal access to Square's services. But it is not clear what steps are necessary for plaintiffs to \"present themselves\" to an internet-based business or to be denied equal access. For instance, White argues that he presented himself to Square merely by visiting the website, and was denied equal access merely by reviewing the exclusionary seller agreement.\n   <em>\n    Surrey\n   </em>\n   suggests that this would not be enough: plaintiffs who merely visit a website and discover a discriminatory fee do not have standing. Yet it is not clear\n   <em>\n    Surrey\n   </em>\n   applies in this context, because, as White argues, Square does not impose a discriminatory fee. Additionally, Square's seller agreement presents, on its face, an exclusionary policy that precludes a bankruptcy attorney from full and equal access to Square's services. Questions such as these are likely to arise frequently in the future, as internet-based services become more prevalent. We therefore need guidance from the California Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The California Supreme Court's answer to these questions will be dispositive and we will follow its decision in this case. If White has not experienced Square's allegedly discriminatory policy, then he lacks statutory standing and we must affirm the district court's dismissal of his claim. But if White has experienced Square's policy, then he has statutory standing and we\n   must vacate the district court's order and remand for the case to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We therefore respectfully ask that the California Supreme Court decide the certified questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Clerk of Court is hereby directed to transmit forthwith to the California Supreme Court, under official seal of the Ninth Circuit, a copy of this order and request for certification and all relevant briefs and excerpts of record pursuant to California Rule of Court 8.548. Submission of this case is withdrawn, and the case will be resubmitted following receipt of the California Supreme Court's opinion on the certified questions or notification that it declines to answer the certified questions. The Clerk shall administratively close this docket pending a ruling by the California Supreme Court regarding the certified questions. The panel shall retain jurisdiction over further proceedings in this court. The parties shall notify the Clerk of this court within one week after the California Supreme Court accepts or rejects certification. In the event the California Supreme Court grants certification, the parties shall notify the Clerk within one week after the Court renders its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    QUESTION CERTIFIED; PROCEEDINGS STAYED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Square's seller agreement also includes an arbitration clause that requires disputes to be resolved through individual, non-class arbitration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Shierkatz RLLP v.
