In petition number 17-1833, Guevara-Solorzano challenges the BIA's denial of his motion to reconsider and reopen and, in particular, the BIA's determination that he is subject to removal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) (INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) ) as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to the illicit trafficking in a controlled substance and is therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (INA \u00a7 240A(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we hold that petitioner's 1995 conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell constitutes a conviction of both an aggravated felony and a CIMT. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review petitioner's challenges to the BIA's decisions, except to the extent that they raise constitutional or legal issues. In addition, we hold that petitioner is ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because his 2000 convictions for felony larceny and felony breaking and entering constitute convictions of CIMTs that are not waivable under \u00a7 212(c), which was repealed in 1996.

AR 905.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a hearing before an immigration judge (\"IJ\"), Guevara-Solorzano, through counsel, conceded that he was removable as charged for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and of a controlled substance offense; however, he denied that he was subject to removal as an alien convicted of two or more CIMTs not arising out of a single scheme of misconduct. AR 440. After conceding his removability, petitioner sought a waiver under former INA \u00a7 212(c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (repealed 1996), for his 1995 Tennessee marijuana conviction. AR 438-467, 499-502. Section 212(c) authorized discretionary relief from deportation for some permanent resident aliens who had been domiciled in the United States for seven consecutive years; however, between 1990 and 1996, Congress progressively narrowed the class of aliens eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief and repealed \u00a7 212(c) entirely in September 1996, replacing it with INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, which allows some aliens to apply for cancellation of removal but excludes any alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. Resp. Br. 5 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 15, 2014, the IJ issued a written decision pretermitting and denying petitioner's \u00a7 212(c) application. AR 431-435. The IJ found that Guevara-Solorzano's convictions in 1995 and 2000 were for offenses qualifying as CIMTs that did not arise out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Because this ground for removability did not arise until 2000, four years after the statute had been repealed, \u00a7 212(c) relief was no longer available at the time Guevara-Solorzano became removable on the CIMT basis. Therefore, the IJ held that Guevara-Solorzano was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief with respect to the CIMT ground of removability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In reaching this conclusion, the IJ relied on a published BIA decision holding that a conviction \"may be alleged as one of the [two\n   CIMTs] in a second proceeding, even though the first proceeding was terminated by\" a \u00a7 212(c) waiver if \"the second crime alleged is a subsequent conviction or a conviction that was not disclosed in the prior proceeding.\" AR 433 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Balderas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (BIA 1991) ). The IJ also relied on a Seventh Circuit decision directly on point, which held that an alien may not \"avoid removal using a section 212(c) waiver\" if the alien has a second CIMT conviction to which \u00a7 212(c) relief does not apply. AR 434 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bakarian v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752567\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/775/\">\n    541 F.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2008) ). Petitioner appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 6, 2016, the BIA dismissed Guevara-Solorzano's appeal, AR 355-358, observing that he had conceded that his 2000 convictions were for crimes qualifying as CIMTs and that the marijuana offense to which he pleaded guilty in 1995 constituted an aggravated felony as well as a controlled substance offense, which concessions subjected him to removal, AR 355-356. The BIA further held, relying on BIA precedent establishing that participation in illicit drug trafficking is a CIMT, that petitioner's 1995 conviction also constituted being convicted of a CIMT. AR 356. Although the BIA observed that there was no dispute that a \u00a7 212(c) waiver would waive the aggravated felony and controlled substance conviction grounds of removability, both of which relied solely on the 1995 conviction, it held, as had the IJ, that \u00a7 212(c) relief was not available to waive the CIMT ground for removability. AR 356-357. According to the BIA, \"[b]ecause 'a grant of section 212(c) relief waives the finding of excludability or deportability rather than the basis of the excludability itself,' it cannot waive a charge of deportability where it does not reach one of the convictions that is the basis for the charge.\" AR 357 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Balderas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   391 ). Because the 2000 convictions, which occurred after the repeal of \u00a7 212(c), were one of the bases for the CIMT ground for removability, the BIA determined that \u00a7 212(c) was not available to waive this ground. Accordingly, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and dismissed the appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 20, 2016, petitioner filed a timely petition in this Court for review of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 5, 2017, petitioner filed with the BIA a motion requesting that the BIA reconsider its December 6, 2016 decision and reopen proceedings to permit him to apply for cancellation of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 240A(a).

The BIA denied Guevara-Solorzano's motion, rejecting his argument that the Tennessee drug statute did not qualify as an aggravated felony and finding that, as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(a).

In both cases, the court held that the intents specified in subsection (a)(4), which criminalizes possession with the intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell the controlled substance, represent means rather than elements. Accordingly, an indictment need not specify, and a jury need not unanimously agree on, which of the three intents a criminal defendant possessed.

Regardless of the basis upon which the BIA reached its decision, our conclusion that petitioner's 1995 conviction does so qualify resolves the issue, and it would waste the resources of the parties and the BIA to remand the question. Moreover, with respect to the categorical approach, the agency has no particular expertise to bring to the matter, nor is there any need to develop or evaluate factual evidence beyond that already in the record. Accordingly, there is no principled reason to remand to the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On this record, the BIA correctly determined, although for the wrong reason, that Guevara-Solorzano was convicted in 1995 of an aggravated felony, thereby rendering him removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii). This conclusion means we are without jurisdiction to review Guevara-Solorzano's petition number 17-1833, which challenges the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen so that it might reconsider\n   its determination that the 1995 conviction qualified as a conviction of an aggravated felony, and that as a result of having that conviction, petitioner is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 240A(a).

A CIMT is a crime that is \"inherently base, vile, or depraved,\" meaning that it involves conduct \"that not only violates a statute but also independently violates a moral norm.\"\n   <em>\n    Uribe v.

First, such a violation requires a culpable mental state because subsection (a)(4) only reaches the \"knowing[ ]\" possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture, deliver or sell. Tenn. Code \u00a7 39-17-417(a). This Court has held that the culpable mental state element is satisfied if the crime includes \"knowing or intentional conduct [a]s an element of [the] offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Sotnikau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131928\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/731/#p735\">\n    846 F.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Such conduct falls well within the heartland of the illicit drug trafficking described in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez Romo\n   </em>\n   and therefore qualifies as reprehensible. As such, the BIA properly determined that\n   petitioner's 1995 conviction constitutes a conviction of a CIMT. Because there is no dispute that petitioner's 2000 convictions also constitute convictions of CIMTs, petitioner is removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) as an alien who has been convicted of two or more CIMTs not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review Guevara-Solorzano's petition number 16-2434 to the extent that it challenges the BIA's determination that his two convictions for CIMTs render him removable. Therefore, that portion of the 16-2434 petition must be dismissed, leaving as the only remaining issue whether the BIA correctly found that petitioner is ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In petition number 16-2434, Guevara-Solorzano also challenges the BIA's determination that he is ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because one of the CIMTs that subjects him to removability occurred after that section was repealed in 1996. That conclusion involves a question of law, which we have jurisdiction to review notwithstanding the BIA's determination that Guevara-Solorzano's 1995 and 2000 convictions render him removable as a criminal alien.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D).

Where the parties disagree is on the question of whether petitioner is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief with respect to the CIMT charge of removability, which is based on the combination of the 1995 marijuana conviction and the 2000 North Carolina convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The BIA's decision below,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and respondent's argument, are based primarily on\n   <em>\n    In re Balderas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the BIA considered whether a CIMT that has been used as part of the basis for a \"two or more CIMTs\" charge of removability in an immigration proceeding that terminated with a \u00a7 212(c) waiver may later be used as part of the basis for a \"two or more CIMTs\" charge of removability if the alien in question commits another CIMT after the first immigration proceeding was terminated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BIA held that such a previously found CIMT could be used with a new CIMT to support a charge of removability because a \"grant of section 212(c) relief 'waives' the finding of excludability or deportability rather than the basis of the excludability itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20389\">\n    at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the crimes eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief \"do not disappear from the alien's record,\" petitioner's 1995 marijuana conviction continued to count as a conviction of a CIMT. When he was convicted in 2000 in North Carolina of another CIMT, he became deportable, and by then \u00a7 212(c) relief no longer applied.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bakarian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752567\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/775/\">\n    541 F.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a 2003 conviction could be used in conjunction with a 1996 conviction to form a basis for removability but that \u00a7 212(c) relief would not be available). This construction is not inconsistent with the logic of\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   , which held that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) was not retroactive in part because aliens who pleaded guilty to crimes before \u00a7 212(c) was repealed \"almost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of \u00a7 212(c) relief] in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p295\">\n    533 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p295\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, an alien who has pleaded guilty to an additional CIMT after the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) cannot be said to have relied on the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) relief in the same way, and it is reasonable\n   to interpret the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) as foreclosing relief from a charge of removability based in part on post-1996 criminal conduct. Similarly, the concern expressed by the Supreme Court that retroactive application of the elimination of \u00a7 212(c) could improperly \"impair[ ] vested rights acquired under existing law[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p295\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p295\">\n    at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p295\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), is inapplicable to petitioner's situation. Because petitioner did not become deportable on the basis of having committed two or more CIMTs until after 1996, his right to \u00a7 212(c) relief with respect to that ground of deportability had not vested at the time \u00a7 212(c) was repealed. Lastly, although petitioner cites a single unpublished BIA decision that held in his favor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Melo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%201734639\">\n    2008 WL 1734639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA Mar. 24, 2008), the published\n   <em>\n    In re Balderas\n   </em>\n   opinion represents the BIA's authoritative construction of \u00a7 212(c) and is the decision entitled to our deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, the BIA correctly determined that petitioner is ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because one of the CIMT convictions that renders him removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) occurred after the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) in 1996.
