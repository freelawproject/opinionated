Stephanie Daniel alleges that identity thieves made fraudulent charges on her debit card at some unspecified time after she visited Yellowstone National Park. Daniel sued the National Park Service for issuing a receipt showing her debit card's expiration date, a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm the district court's dismissal of Daniel's suit. As an initial matter, Daniel lacks standing because her complaint makes only conclusory allegations that her stolen identity was traceable to the Park Service's alleged FCRA violation. Nonetheless, giving Daniel leave to amend the complaint would be futile because the FCRA does not waive the federal government's sovereign immunity from Daniel's suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Daniel purchased an entrance pass to Yellowstone National Park, the National Park Service (the \"Park Service\") printed a receipt bearing her full debit card expiration date. According to Daniel, the Park Service violated the FCRA's prohibition that \"no\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number\n   <em>\n    or the expiration date\n   </em>\n   upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g) (emphases added). The receipt otherwise complied with the FCRA's card-number redaction requirements-it did not print more than the last five digits of the debit card number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Daniel sued the Park Service, on behalf of herself and a putative class, under one of the FCRA's enforcement provisions: \"Any person who willfully fails to comply with [the FCRA] with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer\" for statutory damages of between $100 and $1,000 per violation or \"any actual damages sustained by the consumer,\" costs and attorneys' fees, and potential punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681n. Daniel claimed that after the Yellowstone transaction, her debit card was used fraudulently and she suffered damages from her stolen identity. She also alleged that the fraudulent use of her debit card was caused in part by the inclusion of the card's expiration date on her Yellowstone receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted the Park Service's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the FCRA does not waive the U.S. government's sovereign immunity. The court concluded that \"including the United States as a 'person' every time the term is used in the FCRA would lead to inconsistent usage and potentially absurd results.\" Accordingly, Congress did not \"speak unequivocally\" as is required to waive sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both Article III standing and sovereign immunity are threshold jurisdictional\n   issues that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raines v.

In this instance, we analyze both issues because dismissal of the case on standing grounds leaves open whether Daniel could amend her complaint to satisfy standing requirements.

Bassett's theory of injury-an \"exposure\" to identity theft \"caused by [the issuer's] printing of his credit card expiration date on a receipt that he alone viewed\"-did not \"have 'a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516102\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/776/#p777\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1549 ).

The National Park Service is an agency of the United States. Hence, the sovereign immunity question boils down to whether the inclusion of \"governmental ... agency\" in the FCRA's definition of \"person\" constitutes an unequivocal waiver of the federal government's immunity from money damages and subjects the United States to the various provisions directed at \"any person\" who violates the law.

In \u00a7 1681u(j), the FCRA provides that \"[a]ny agency or department of the United States obtaining or disclosing any consumer reports, records, or information contained therein in violation of this section is liable to the consumer\" for statutory and actual damages, and, \"if the violation is found to have been willful or intentional, such punitive damages as a court may allow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u(j). As the district\n   court observed, \"[t]he fact that Congress explicitly named the United States in the remedial provisions found at \u00a7 1681u(j) but not in the remedial provisions found at \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o demonstrates the equivocal nature of any purported waiver of sovereign immunity\" in the latter sections. Congress enacted the explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in \u00a7 1681u(j) less than one year before Congress expanded liability to \"person[s]\" under the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.

Because Congress knew how to explicitly waive sovereign immunity in the FCRA, it could have used that same language when enacting subsequent enforcement provisions. That Congress subjected \"person[s]\" to liability in those later amendments-not the United States itself or any of its departments or agencies-is telling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Of course, \u00a7 1681u concerns disclosures of information by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies involved in counterintelligence investigations. While the section's limited focus on federal agencies might explain the difference in statutory language, \u00a7 1681u clouds whether the remedial provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 1681o and 1681n extend \"unambiguously\" to monetary claims against the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ordonez v.

It dismissed his claim because it could not find a clear, unequivocal statement in FACTA that Congress meant to abrogate the sovereign immunity of Indian Tribes. Meyers has lost sight of the real question in this sovereign immunity case-whether an Indian tribe can claim immunity from suit. The answer to this question must be \"yes\" unless Congress has told us in no uncertain terms that it is \"no.\" Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of immunity. Abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity may not be implied. Of course Meyers wants us to focus on whether the Oneida Tribe is a government so that we might shoehorn it into FACTA's statement that defines liable parties to include \"any government.\" But when it comes to sovereign immunity, shoehorning is precisely what we cannot do. Congress'[s] words must fit like a glove in their unequivocality. It must be said with \"perfect confidence\" that Congress intended to abrogate sovereign immunity and \"imperfect confidence will not suffice.\" Congress has demonstrated that it knows how to unequivocally abrogate immunity for Indian Tribes.
