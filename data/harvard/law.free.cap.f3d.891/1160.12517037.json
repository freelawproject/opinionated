He contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because his trial attorney held deeply racist beliefs about African Americans in general and him in particular. Our precedent involving the same attorney and mostly the same evidence requires us to reject this contention. When defense counsel does not express his racist views to his client, no conflict will be presumed, and the defendant must show both deficient performance and prejudice to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. Since Ellis fails to do so here, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ellis and his co-defendant were charged with the November 1989 murder, attempted murder, and robbery of two men who were waiting in their car at a McDonald's drive-through window. Several witnesses who observed the crime to varying extents testified with corresponding certainty that\n   Ellis looked like the shooter. Although the surviving victim repeatedly failed to identify Ellis in live and photographic lineups, a McDonald's employee who knew Ellis from school testified that he was the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Attorney Donald Ames, now deceased, was appointed to represent Ellis. Ellis's first two trials ended in mistrials due to witnesses being unavailable. His third and fourth trials resulted in hung juries. At the conclusion of his fifth trial in June 1991, Ellis was convicted of special circumstance murder, attempted murder, and two counts of robbery. He received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. His conviction became final on May 29, 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March or April 2003, Ellis's friend sent him a newspaper article about Ames's \"lousy\" performance as a capital defense attorney. The article described Ames as \"deceptive, untrustworthy, and disloyal to his capital clients\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Calderon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452621\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/483/#p484\">\n    276 F.3d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (9th Cir. 2001) (Reinhardt, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) ). It recounted the testimony of Ames's adult daughters regarding his \"frequent use of deprecating remarks and racial slurs about his clients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ellis obtained declarations from two of Ames's daughters in which they described their father's racism. According to one, Ames harbored \"contempt for people of other races and ethnic groups\" and \"especially ridiculed black people, referring to them with racial invectives.\" The other daughter recalled a May 1990 conversation in which Ames referred to his client Melvin Wade as a \"nigger\" who \"got what he deserved.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ellis also obtained declarations from individuals who worked with Ames. A fiscal clerk at the San Bernardino Superior Court stated in a declaration that Ames employed \"racist terms to characterize court personnel, his employees, and his clients.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A legal secretary who worked for Ames from September 1990 to January 1991 heard Ames talking about a client: \"because his client was black,\" Ames said, \"he did not trust him and did not care what happened to him.\" A secretary in Ames's office from January to June 1991 stated that Ames \"consistently refer[red] to his African American employees as 'niggers' \" and \"his African-American co-counsel as 'a big black nigger trying to be a white man.' \" In the fifth trial, which took place during the first half of 1991, Ellis's co-defendant was represented by an African American attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ellis sought habeas relief in the state courts, arguing that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel's \"racial prejudice against African-Americans\" created an actual conflict of interest. When that proved\n   unsuccessful, Ellis filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court initially denied relief on the ground that Ellis's petition was untimely. We reversed, holding that the petition could be timely if Ellis were entitled to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Fed.%20Appx.%20721\">\n    270 Fed.Appx. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2008). On remand, the district court determined that Ellis was not entitled to equitable tolling and again denied relief. We disagreed and once more remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

Ellis now appeals the district court's denial of his Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1291 and 2253. Because Ellis's habeas petition is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), we cannot grant relief unless he meets its \"demanding standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

Ellis concedes that he was unaware of Ames's racism until several years after his conviction was final. And while the relationship between counsel's bigotry and his performance at Ellis's trial is much less attenuated than in\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   -here, the representation occurred contemporaneously with the statements at issue whereas Mayfield's trial was held approximately a decade earlier-Ellis fails to identify any acts or omissions by Ames that \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 688,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

Of the constitutional rights given to a criminal defendant, none is more important than the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. By allowing Ellis's conviction to stand, we make a mockery of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ellis's lawyer, Donald Ames, openly and repeatedly expressed contempt for people who look like Ellis based on the ugliest of racial stereotypes. This was not just the depressingly common assumption that criminal defendants of certain races are more likely to be guilty, but something far more sinister: a belief in the inferiority of all people of color-be they support staff, co-counsel, or judge. Most damning of all, Ames made it clear that he did not care what happened to his black clients. It would be impossible for anyone with such views to adequately represent a non-white defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I do not suggest that a conviction should be overturned whenever a racially tinged comment by defense counsel comes to light. Racism has as many shades as race, and we generally assume that counsel can set aside any personal distaste for a client, whatever its motivation, to zealously advocate on his behalf. But when an attorney expresses such utter contempt and indifference about the fate of his minority clients as Ames did here, he has ceased providing the reasonably competent representation that the Sixth Amendment demands. A defendant in such an untenable position may be better off with no counsel at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lawyers today look very different than they did in 1991, when Ellis was tried. Within a generation, diversity among legal practitioners has markedly increased. On appeal in our court, of the three judges and two advocates at oral argument, four were people of color. These changes matter. Minority lawyers' greater representation on the bar has led to a growing acknowledgment and intolerance of racial bias in the practice of law. But it has not ended racism, both subtle and overt. People of color are still underrepresented in the legal profession but overrepresented among criminal defendants and face greater odds of conviction and higher average sentences.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Robert J. Smith et al.,\n   <em>\n    Implicit White Favoritism in the Criminal Justice System\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Ala.%20L.%20Rev.%20871\">\n    66 Ala. L. Rev. 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877-90 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When examining the reasonableness of counsel's performance, we extend considerable deference to strategic choices. This deference is predicated on the assumption that counsel is acting in the client's best interest. For an attorney as deeply racist as Ames, that assumption is unfounded. It makes no difference that Ellis was unaware of his counsel's beliefs. The deleterious effect of such racism on the outcome is usually impossible to prove and, under these circumstances, we should presume prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because I cannot in good faith distinguish Ellis's case from\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   , I reluctantly concur in the opinion. Had we not been bound by\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   , I would have granted Ellis's petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    We overturned Wade's death sentence due to Ames's ineffective assistance at the penalty phase.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wade v.

The declarations from Ames's daughters were executed in the 1990s in connection with\n    <em>\n     Wade\n    </em>\n    . In the district court proceedings, Ellis submitted more recent declarations from the daughters. In one, Ames's daughter recalls a case from 1990 or 1991 involving \"African-American men ... accused of holding up or robbing someone at a fast food restaurant,\" in which Ellis \"referred to his client ... with racial slurs\" and \"commented on how stupid his client was.\" We cannot consider the updated declarations because the state courts had no opportunity to do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cullen v.
