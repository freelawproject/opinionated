The court's finding is not clearly erroneous, and, accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties' dispute evolved out of transactions originating during the savings-and-loan crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We begin with a description of that crisis and the facts leading up to the disputed transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. Savings-and-Loan Crisis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As their names suggest, savings-and-loan institutions, also called \"thrifts,\" provide two main services. They collect customer deposits, which are maintained in interest-bearing savings accounts, and they originate and service mortgage loans funded by those deposits. Historically, thrifts were profitable because the interest they collected on outstanding loans exceeded the interest they paid out to customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That changed, however, in the late 1970s. First, interest rates rose to unprecedented levels, and thrifts, which were locked into long-term, fixed-rate mortgages, were unable to compensate for this increase by raising the interest rate on their mortgage loans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winstar Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n    518 U.S. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781146\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/116/2432/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (describing events precipitating the savings-and-loan crisis). To maintain their customers, moreover, thrifts were forced to raise the interest rates they paid on deposit accounts, causing the thrifts to operate at a loss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the industry suffered from \"disintermediation,\" whereby customers withdrew their deposits in favor of alternative investments paying higher interest rates. This one-two punch had a devastating effect on the industry, causing many thrifts to become insolvent. Between 1981 and 1983 alone, some 435 thrifts failed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lacking the funds to liquidate the failing thrifts, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (\"FSLIC\"), as thrift regulator and insurer of deposits, responded to the crisis by encouraging healthy thrifts to take over failing ones in what were called \"supervisory mergers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n    at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781146\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/116/2432/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These transactions relieved the FSLIC of its deposit insurance liability for the insolvent thrifts, and, in exchange, provided a package of non-cash incentives to acquiring thrifts. Two of those incentives are at issue here: \"branching\" rights and \"RAP\"-or \"regulatory accounting purposes\"-rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Branching rights permitted acquiring thrifts to open and operate branches in states other than their home states, which, prior to 1981, was generally prohibited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20556.5\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 556.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (1981). This prohibition was eliminated for thrifts entering into supervisory mergers across state lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20556.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 556.5(a)(3)(ii)(A) (1982). RAP rights, by contrast, affected regulatory accounting treatment for business combinations. At the time, regulations mandated, in relevant part, that each thrift maintain a minimum capital of at least 3% of its liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20556.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 563.13(a)(2), (b)(2) (1983);\n   <em>\n    Winstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n    518 U.S. at 845-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781146\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/116/2432/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This requirement presented an obstacle for healthy thrifts seeking to acquire failing ones because, by definition, failing thrifts' liabilities exceeded their assets. Regulators eliminated this obstacle by permitting acquiring thrifts to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In essence, GAAP allowed acquiring thrifts to treat failing thrifts' excess liabilities as an asset called \"supervisory goodwill,\" which, in turn, could be counted toward the acquiring thrifts' minimum regulatory capital requirement and amortized over a forty-year period (later\n   reduced to twenty-five years).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Winstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729857\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/839/#p845\">\n    518 U.S. at 850-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781146\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/116/2432/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The RAP rights provided by FSLIC guaranteed such treatment, regardless of future regulatory changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The combination of branching and RAP rights induced healthy thrifts to enter into supervisory mergers through-out the 1980s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The Transactions at Issue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   One such thrift was Home Savings of America (\"Home\"), a subsidiary of WMI's predecessor. Originally based in Los Angeles, Home grew to become one of the largest thrifts in the United States. Home took part in two categories of transactions in the 1980s that are relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, between 1981 and 1985, Home entered into four supervisory mergers in six states-Missouri, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Ohio-thereby assuming the acquired thrifts' liabilities in exchange for branching and RAP rights. Home would later sell off those branches in the 1990s in an effort to focus on its California presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, in 1988, Home acquired Bowery Savings Bank (\"Bowery\"), a federally chartered mutual savings bank headquartered in New York. Prior to the acquisition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") had been providing Bowery with assistance, including a RAP right, pursuant to a 1985 government-assisted merger. In connection with Home's 1988 acquisition, however, Bowery negotiated a new assistance package, which, among other things, replaced the 1985 RAP right with a new one. Like the supervisory RAP right, the 1988 Bowery RAP right allowed Bowery to count the goodwill arising out of the acquisition toward regulatory capital. Unlike the supervisory RAP right, however, the 1988 Bowery RAP right established an amortization period of twenty years as opposed to forty years. This represented an increase from the fourteen-year period established by the 1985 Bowery RAP right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Home's branching and RAP rights are considered intangible assets for tax purposes, and, as such, are generally subject to abandonment loss deductions under I.R.C. \u00a7 165, and amortization deductions under I.R.C. \u00a7 167(a), respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Home's consolidated parent, H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. (\"Ahmanson\"), filed income tax returns on behalf of Home, claiming deductions based on the transactions described above. Those claims spawned the litigation at issue here, as well as a related proceeding in the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. The Ninth Circuit's Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2008, WMI-then known as Washington Mutual, Inc.-brought suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking a refund for tax years 1990, 1992, and 1993 based on the amortization of the RAP rights obtained in one of the supervisory mergers, as well as the abandonment of Home's Missouri branching rights. To support its claims, WMI proffered a valuation report and testimony from its expert, Roger Grabowski, who used an income-based approach to determine the fair market value of the rights at issue. The district court granted judgment in favor of the government, rejecting WMI's refund claims because WMI did \"not prove[ ], to a reasonable degree of certainty, Home's cost basis in the Branching\n   and RAP rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wash.

The court rejected WMI's argument that the district court required an unprecedented level of precision and held that the district court did not err in determining that the \"cumulative flaws underlying the Grabowski Model rendered it incapable of producing a reliable value for the Branching Right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276879\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/711/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276879\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/711/#p714\">\n    at 722-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B. The Claims Court's Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Meanwhile, WMI also filed suit in the Claims Court against the United States, seeking a refund of more than $250 million for tax years 1991, 1994, 1995, and 1998. WMI claimed it was entitled to a refund based on the amortization of the RAP rights obtained in the supervisory mergers and the Bowery acquisition, as well as the abandonment of Home's Florida, Illinois, New York, and Ohio branching rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   WMI offered a valuation report from Grabowski that was nearly identical to the report he presented in the Washington case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, like the Washington district court, the Claims Court rejected Home's tax refund claims, finding that WMI had failed to prove Home's cost basis in each of the branching rights, RAP rights, and Bowery government assistance rights.\n   <em>\n    Claims Court Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n    130 Fed.Cl. at 688-704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   WMI timely appealed the Claims Court's ruling to this court.

There is also no dispute that WMI bears the burden of proving it is entitled to a refund. Before addressing whether WMI satisfied that burden, we first address WMI's contention that the Claims Court applied an incorrect legal framework. That issue is a legal one that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kan. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.

As explained below, the court's findings are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Grabowski valued each RAP right as \"a contract[ual] right conveyed to Home by FSLIC\" that \"allowed Home to treat the goodwill recorded in the transaction as an asset (on a diminishing basis over 40 years) for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.\" J.A. 7148. Specifically, he estimated the cost associated with raising and maintaining replacement capital to maintain the hypothetical willing buyer's pre-merger capital level. In other words, Grabowski assumed that Home needed the approval of government regulators to treat the goodwill created by these transactions as an asset subject to amortization over a period of up to forty years. This assumption, however, is flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Claims Court noted that it \"is without dispute that the accounting regulations in place at the time of the\" supervisory mergers \"required that Home use the purchase method of accounting,\" which provided for the treatment of goodwill as an asset.\n   <em>\n    Claims Court Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n    130 Fed.Cl. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court pointed out, for example, that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's September 1981 Memorandum R-31b mandated that acquiring thrifts account for the goodwill created by the merger in accordance with GAAP, which, in turn, required thrifts to use the purchase method of accounting to account for supervisory mergers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That method allowed companies to treat goodwill as an asset, and to amortize that goodwill over a period of up to forty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, as the Claims Court properly found, the RAP rights Home acquired as part of the supervisory mergers were in the nature of \"a guarantee\"-i.e., \"the right to\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to amortize the goodwill created by these mergers over a period of forty years if the regulations governing the amortization period for goodwill changed in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n    at 692-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Grabowski's valuation of the rights as\n   <em>\n    creating\n   </em>\n   a contractual approval to treat goodwill as an asset was therefore predicated on an incorrect interpretation of the nature of those rights, and caused Grabowski to overvalue them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   WMI objects to the Claims Court's interpretation of Memorandum R-31b as having given Home the right to use the purchase method of accounting and to amortize supervisory goodwill. WMI argues that the memorandum simply authorized regulators to approve such amortization upon application by an acquiring thrift. To support that argument, WMI points to the memorandum's reference to an \"application from an association requesting approval for a business combination to be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.\" Appellants Br. 42 (quoting J.A. 4361). We disagree. The memorandum provides that accounting for goodwill in accordance with GAAP is acceptable for regulatory purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 4359 (\"Accounting for business combinations involving insured institutions should be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Branching Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Claims Court also found that it could not assess the value of Home's branching rights because Grabowski's valuation was \"unreasonable,\" \"unsupported,\" and \"unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n    at 695-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While perhaps phrased more harshly than necessary, the court's findings are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   To value the branching rights, Grabowski used an income-based approach in which he forecast the cash flow that a hypothetical willing buyer would have expected to generate as a result of having a right to operate in a state other than the thrift's home state. The \"main assumptions\" he made in his analysis \"were the number of new branches, the growth of deposits in new and acquired branches, and the income the willing buyer would earn on new mortgage loans made with those deposits.\" J.A. 7140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to the number of new branches, Grabowski based his projection in part on Home's own expansion into Northern California. In 1970, Home entered Northern California by acquiring four branches in the San Francisco area with $36.4 million in deposits, or $9.1 million per branch, representing 0.6% of the market. Over the next ten years, Home expanded to forty Northern California branches and increased its total inflation-adjusted deposits to $760.1 million, or $19 million per branch, representing 6.1% of the market. By 1981, Home's California deposits per branch were nearly double the average in the state. Grabowski asserted that a hypothetical buyer would \"expect[ ] to be able to replicate this level of branch network growth in other markets, assuming the markets had similar levels of depositor concentration (i.e., population density).\" J.A. 7139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With respect to the growth of deposits, Grabowski estimated that it took Home five years to \"ramp up\" deposits in Northern California branches, and \"considered this rate of individual branch ramp up to be representative of what any willing buyer would have expected.\" J.A. 7140. Finally, with respect to loan demand, Grabowski asserted that a hypothetical buyer would expect to be able to turn all new deposits into new loans because, historically, that had been Home's experience. Grabowski \"assumed that a willing buyer would have expected the same.\" J.A. 7143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The central problem with this analysis, however, is that Grabowski's assumptions were based on outdated market data and were inconsistent with the actual market conditions facing thrifts when the branching and RAP rights were actually acquired. The conditions during the acquisition period included an unprecedentedly high interest rate and pervasive disintermediation.

In particular, the court found it unlikely that a hypothetical buyer would be able to open new branches at the rate projected by Grabowski given that the timeline for regulatory approval of a new branch was typically a year or longer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court's findings are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   WMI argues that, even if the Claims Court's objections to Grabowski's assumptions were warranted, the court erred by disregarding the valuation\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   . According to WMI, the court should have modified the inputs to Grabowski's model to account for the perceived flaws in his assumptions. To support this argument, WMI points to Grabowski's \"sensitivity analyses,\" in which he valued branching rights under the alternative assumptions that deposit growth for the first two years in a new market would be 50% less than what he projected, or that only half of the deposits would be used to fund loans for the first two years while the other half were invested in Treasury bills. WMI contends that these sensitivity analyses demonstrate the flexibility of Grabowski's approach. In particular, WMI argues that, because Grabowski's\n   <em>\n    methodology\n   </em>\n   was not flawed, the court should have just disregarded his flawed assumptions and injected new ones into the methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. at 12:05-13:35 (\"Q. Is it your position that ... the court then has the obligation to readjust the assumptions and do the economic valuation? A. Yes, absolutely.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Claims Court, however, did not find Grabowski's sensitivity analyses helpful, questioning, among other things, why Grabowski limited his adjustments to only two years, when high interest rates were expected to endure much longer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 697 &amp; n.37.

According to WMI, if the court determined that Grabowski allocated too much basis to the RAP rights, the court should have found that he allocated too little basis to the branching rights. Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As an initial matter, the Claims Court did not reject WMI's branching rights claims solely because it had already rejected its RAP rights claims. Rather, the court noted that, because WMI's allocation of cost basis to the RAP rights was flawed, its allocation to the branching rights must also be \"call[ed] into doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Claims CourtDecision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n    130 Fed.Cl. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then proceeded to give reasons why WMI's cost basis allocation for the branching rights was\n   <em>\n    independently\n   </em>\n   flawed. Indeed, the court stated that, notwithstanding WMI's deficient RAP right valuation, \"the evidence also shows plaintiffs have not established Home's cost basis in the Branching Rights because their fair market value determinations for this asset do not constitute a 'reasonable or rational approximation' of the value of these assets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323698\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/130/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   More importantly, WMI's argument has merit only to the extent the branching rights and RAP rights were the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   assets acquired in the supervisory mergers to which the cost basis must be allocated. WMI has not shown this to be the case. And, as the government points out, the failing thrifts' traditional goodwill could also absorb some of the cost basis, even if such goodwill would have been of low value during the savings-and-loan crisis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deseret Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4133649\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/112/438/#p456\">\n    112 Fed.Cl. at 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that even unprofitable companies possess goodwill).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Grabowski's methodology is only as good as his assumptions, which, as the Claims Court found, were inconsistent with market realities and, at times, unsupported.

WMI argues that it should have received amortization deductions for the 1985 rights, which did not materially change in 1988.
