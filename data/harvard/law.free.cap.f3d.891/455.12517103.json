Section 3731 imposes a thirty-day filing requirement, which can be stopped by a timely filed motion for reconsideration. In this case, the government filed a motion for reconsideration more than thirty days after the District Court entered an order granting defendant-appellee Eric Kalb's motion to suppress. The District Court denied the motion for reconsideration on the merits, and the government appealed both orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on the statute's text and structure, recent clarifying opinions from the Supreme Court, and legislative history, we believe the thirty-day period for appeal in \u00a7 3731 is jurisdictional. As to the timeliness of the government's motion, we conclude that a timely motion for reconsideration under \u00a7 3731, for the purpose of rendering the order nonfinal, is one made within the thirty-day appeal period. To hold otherwise would rejuvenate an extinguished appeal period. Accordingly, we will dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the government's appeal of the order granting Kalb's suppression motion. We will affirm the denial of the government's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eric Kalb was stopped by Upper Merion Township police in the early morning hours of September 13, 2014. Prior to that stop, around 4:00 a.m., an unidentified caller to the Upper Montgomery County 911 Call Center reported that a man had been electrocuted near Valley Forge Park. He also stated the man \"may have been scrapping.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 289. When asked for details, the caller was elusive. He claimed he was calling from a store but that the store was closing. He also refused to give his name\n   and professed ignorance of the model of vehicle he was driving. Police were sent to the scene of the electrocution and to the unidentified caller's location, which police identified as a fast food restaurant. At Valley Forge Park, officers found a deceased man next to an electrical box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the restaurant, the responding officer spoke with a security guard who said a white male driving a small Ford pickup truck had recently used the phone and driven away onto Markley Street. The identifying information was broadcast over the police radio. Approximately four minutes later and only four blocks from the unidentified caller's location, an officer spotted a vehicle matching the broadcast description-driven by Kalb-and stopped it. Kalb immediately admitted he was the caller and his friend had been electrocuted. He was taken to the Upper Merion Township police station to give a statement. Kalb admitted to driving his friend to the scrapping location, seeing his friend \"sitting in front of an electrical box\" while it \"was sparking,\" and driving to use a payphone to call 911. App. 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kalb was indicted by a grand jury on charges of depredation against United States property,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; destruction of property on United States land,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201363\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and aiding and abetting,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, Kalb filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained after police stopped his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After conducting a suppression hearing, the court entered an order granting the motion on October 21, 2016, followed by a written opinion three days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court held a conference call with counsel and scheduled a status conference for November 29. During the conference call, the government \"sought leave to review the transcript of the suppression hearing before proceeding.\" App. 13. On November 29, the government filed a motion to reconsider the suppression order, and Kalb objected to its filing as untimely. The District Court denied the motion to reconsider its suppression order, thereby confirming its suppression of the challenged evidence, on January 13, 2017. In doing so, it rejected the defense's untimeliness argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Preliminarily, the defense argues that the Motion should be rejected as untimely. I disagree. In a conference call with the Court on October 29, 2016, the Government made clear that it sought leave to review the transcript of the suppression hearing before proceeding, and the Court scheduled a status conference for November 29. At a minimum, it would be understandable if the Government interpreted the Court's actions as granting it a 30-day extension. The transcript became available on November 14, and the Government's Motion was filed on November 29, after providing notice to the Court that it would be slightly delayed because of a competing trial listing. Rigid enforcement of the Local Rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   governing timeliness of motions for reconsideration would be inconsistent with the collegial manner in which\n   counsel have dealt with each other, and dealt with the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   App. 13.

But, in so doing, the government overlooks two aspects of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   .

As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Dieter\n   </em>\n   , \"the consistent practice in civil and criminal cases alike has been to treat timely petitions for rehearing as rendering the original judgment nonfinal for purposes of appeal for as long as the petition is pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7350\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/6/\">\n    429 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7350\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/6/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But, in this case, the motion for reconsideration was not filed until the thirty-day appeal period had elapsed. Thus, for the entire thirty-day appeal period under \u00a7 3731, the suppression order remained final-including the day that period expired. Contrary to the government's assertions, this scenario equates to \"an attempt to rejuvenate an extinguished right to appeal,\"\n   <em>\n    Healy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379742\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/75/#p77\">\n    376 U.S. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379742\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/75/#p77\">\n    84 S.Ct. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an action we are not permitted to take.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that a\n   motion for reconsideration must be filed within the thirty-day appeal period specified in \u00a7 3731 in order to keep the appeal period from expiring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the government filed its motion for reconsideration more than thirty days after the suppression order was entered on the docket, the motion did not prevent the appeal period from elapsing, and we must dismiss the appeal of that order for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although we lack jurisdiction to consider the government's appeal of the District Court's order granting Kalb's suppression motion, we do have jurisdiction over the government's appeal of the District Court order denying its motion for reconsideration because the government filed its appeal within thirty days of the issuance of that order. \"The purpose of such a motion is to correct a clear error of law or to prevent a manifest injustice in the District Court's original ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Dupree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773032\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/724/#p732\">\n    617 F.3d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Though '[m]otions to reconsider empower the court to change course when a mistake has been made, they do not empower litigants ... to raise their arguments, piece by piece.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773032\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/724/#p732\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773032\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/617/724/#p732\">\n    at 732-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Solis v.
