Plaintiffs brought suit against the City and their union, the Detroit Fire Fighters Association, Local 344, IAFF, AFL-CIO (\"DFFA\"), alleging that they were laid off in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The district court granted summary judgment to both the City and the DFFA as to Plaintiffs' claims. The court concluded that as against the City, only one Plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies to pursue a Title VII claim, but that even proceeding to the merits, Plaintiffs failed to present direct evidence or to establish a prima facie case under the circumstantial evidence approach, which includes a heightened burden in a RIF. As to the DFFA, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs could not establish that the DFFA breached its duty of fair representation to the Plaintiffs, which the court held Plaintiffs must do to proceed with a Title VII claim against a union. Finally, the district court denied the DFFA's motion for attorney fees and costs. Plaintiffs appeal both rulings. The DFFA cross-appeals the district court's denial of its motion for attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE in part\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 18, 2013, the City of Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection. Prior to the filing, on July 2, 2012 the City notified agencies that the City would initiate RIF activities across different agencies, with a goal to lose 2,227 employees through various means, including layoffs. The Detroit Fire Department (\"DFD\") received notification\n   on June 18, 2012, that the deadline for implementation of layoffs for the July 1, 2012 fiscal year was passing that day, and as of July 2, 2012, the DFD would not be in compliance with its 2012-2013 fiscal budget. Two days later, the City notified the DFFA by letter that layoff notices would be issued in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between the parties and attached a matrix with the number of reductions to be made, detailed by position. According to this initial matrix, twenty-two firefighters would be laid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To effectuate the RIF, Human Resources Officer Roger Williams applied Human Resources Rule 10, which indicated that the RIF should be based on total city seniority, determined by total number of years as a city employee. Plaintiffs were not included in the group to be laid off. According to Williams, after he created the RIF matrix, the DFFA contested the City's methodology and argued that departmental seniority should apply to layoffs, rather than total city seniority. On July 30, 2012, the DFFA provided the City with lists by departmental seniority. Plaintiffs were included in this list. The next day, the DFFA filed Grievance #17-12, a class action grievance alleging that the City's proposed RIF violated the parties' CBA. On August 10, 2012, the City proceeded with the RIF by departmental seniority, as urged by the DFFA, and laid off twenty-seven firefighters, including ten of the Plaintiffs. Plaintiff Anthony McCloud was demoted from firefighter to fireboat deckhand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2012, the DFFA changed its position and agreed that total city seniority was in fact the proper method for layoffs under the CBA. Plaintiffs were recalled to work on October 29, 2012. Their layoff had lasted eighty days. In March 2013, the DFFA and the City finalized a settlement, which provided Plaintiffs with backpay, overtime pay, and medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties agree that in May 2013, four of the Plaintiffs, David Rivera, Erick Peeples, Anthony McCloud, and Perry Anderson, timely filed discrimination charges against the City, as they were filed within 300 days of their layoff on August 10, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rivera received a right to sue letter against the City on June 11, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed similar charges against the DFFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint (\"the complaint\") on May 11, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged one count for disparate-treatment race discrimination in violation of Title VII against the City and the DFFA. The City moved for summary judgment on June 6, 2016, arguing that Plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII. More specifically, the City argued that the Plaintiffs, other than Rivera, could not\n   show they were entitled to bring an action under Title VII because they had either not filed charges timely or had not received right to sue letters. The City also argued that Plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination because they could produce neither direct evidence nor circumstantial evidence that they were targeted for layoffs for impermissible reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The DFFA also moved for summary judgment on June 6, 2016, arguing that Plaintiffs' claim failed because the DFFA did not breach its duty of fair representation to the Plaintiffs, which it urged is \"an essential component of a Title VII race discrimination claim against a union.\" The DFFA also argued that Plaintiffs could not prove damages given that they had been reinstated and made whole, and neither compensatory nor punitive damages were available as a matter of law. Finally, the DFFA argued that it should be awarded attorney fees and costs because Plaintiffs' claims were unmeritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 26, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment to both Defendants on Plaintiffs' claims, but denied the DFFA's motion for attorney fees and costs, which the court construed as a request for sanctions under Rule 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the City, the district court held that only one Plaintiff's claim could proceed for failure to properly exhaust administrative remedies, but that it failed on the merits regardless. In its first finding, the district court contended with almost no argument from Plaintiffs. The City argued that only one Plaintiff, Rivera, was entitled to bring his Title VII claim, because only he had timely filed his EEOC charge and received a right to sue letter. Plaintiffs did not respond to this argument. The district court reviewed the record and concluded that only Rivera had properly exhausted his administrative remedies before bringing his Title VII claim. The City next argued that the \"single filing rule\" should not be applied to allow Plaintiffs who had not exhausted their administrative remedies to \"piggyback\" on Rivera's claim, because Rivera alleged discrimination based on national origin, not race, and the facts of his claim were distinguishable from the other Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' response to the argument consisted of one word:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Does the \"single-filer\" rule under Title VII apply, so that each Plaintiff demonstrate [sic] that he is entitled to bring suit under Title VII?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant City says No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having reviewed the evidence in the record and in the absence of any counter-argument, the district court agreed with the City that only Rivera had exhausted his remedies and that the single filing rule should not apply to allow the remaining Plaintiffs to piggyback on his claim. Proceeding to the merits and assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs could assert their claims, the district court held that Plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination either through direct evidence or circumstantial evidence with a heightened RIF standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the DFFA, the district court held that Plaintiffs failed to establish that the union had breached its duty of fair representation, which the court held was required under Title VII. The court also held that Plaintiffs had been made whole with reinstatement and backpay relief and that other damages were unavailable. The district court denied the DFFA's motion for\n   attorney fees and costs, however, concluding that Plaintiffs' claims were not \"frivolous in their legal position such that sanctions should be imposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Plaintiffs and the DFFA timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Plaintiffs urge that the single filing rule allows them to piggyback \"onto a timely-filed charge and notice of right to sue of a named Plaintiff.\" They argue that failure to obtain a right to sue letter is a condition precedent to filing suit and not a jurisdictional defect, such that Anderson, McCloud, and Peeples should not be barred from pursuing their claims. The City responds that Anderson, McCloud, and Peeples did not receive right to sue letters and that Rivera is the only plaintiff who properly exhausted his administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We must first determine whether Plaintiffs Anderson, McCloud, and Peeples exhausted their administrative remedies to determine how, and to whom, the single filing rule would be applied, if appropriate. Plaintiffs argue for the first time on appeal that the Acknowledgment of Settlement letters suffice for Plaintiffs Peeples, Anderson, and McCloud to have exhausted their administrative remedies under Title VII. Plaintiffs argue that failure to obtain a right to sue letter is not a jurisdictional defect but a condition precedent, and their receipt of Acknowledgment of Settlement letters satisfies the requirement of a right to sue. The City responds that Plaintiffs did not make any argument regarding the Acknowledgment of Settlement letters before the district court and accordingly that they abandoned the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The arguments made at summary judgment reveal that Plaintiffs indeed ignored the City's contention regarding the Acknowledgment of Settlement letters. At summary judgment, the City argued that Plaintiffs' failure to present right to sue letters constituted a failure to exhaust under Title VII. Plaintiffs did not respond in their brief opposing summary judgment with even a mention of the City's argument that their claims should be dismissed for failure to secure right to sue letters. Their failure to make any argument below is further evident in the district court's treatment of the issue, as the court simply concluded that there was no evidence in the record to indicate that Anderson, McCloud, and Peeples had received right to sue letters from the EEOC, and as such, that they could not assert Title VII claims against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that failure to obtain a right to sue letter is a condition precedent, rather than a jurisdictional defect, which we have held is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    Graham-Humphreys v. Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451715\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/552/#p560\">\n    209 F.3d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    Zipes v.

But Plaintiffs did not make any of these arguments before the district court. Plaintiffs had the opportunity to argue that the failure to obtain right to sue letters by Anderson, McCloud, and Peeples was waived, estopped, or should be equitably tolled, but they failed to do so. We review a district court's application or rejection of equitable tolling for abuse of discretion, which we find if the court \"relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 560 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Romstadt v.

Therefore, Plaintiffs' argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next question is whether the single filing rule should apply to allow the remaining Plaintiffs to piggyback on Plaintiff Rivera's timely-filed charge.

But as is clear, Plaintiffs do not allege the exact same claims-Plaintiff Rivera alleges national origin discrimination, and the remaining Plaintiffs allege race discrimination. Therefore, the question is whether national origin and race discrimination are \"substantially related.\" If so, Plaintiffs should be able to piggyback on Plaintiff Rivera's timely filed EEOC charge under the single filing rule, which\n   allows both untimely or never filed claims to be joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs cite no case law, nor do they argue, that discrimination claims for national origin are \"substantially similar\" to those of racial discrimination claims of a different group.

The City was placed on notice that Rivera, and others similarly situated, were alleging discrimination in the layoff process, but only of claims involving national origin.

Here, the district court concluded that the only evidence offered to demonstrate that race played a role in Plaintiffs' layoffs involved multiple levels of inadmissible hearsay, and even if admissible, required an unpermitted inference. On appeal, Plaintiffs assert that they have direct evidence-Peeples' testimony that Williams stated that the union wanted to \"save\" the white firefighters and submitted the layoff list including Plaintiffs to that end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is unclear if Williams' statement is hearsay or contains multiple levels of hearsay. Reviewing Peeples' deposition testimony, as Plaintiffs urge on appeal, does not illuminate. Plaintiffs only state in a footnote that Williams' statement is nonhearsay. Plaintiffs make no legal argument that Williams' statement is not hearsay, nor do they posit how he came to the conclusion that the DFFA was targeting minority firefighters for termination. Regardless, even if the statement was admissible and demonstrated any discriminatory intent, we do not find that it would constitute \"direct evidence\" of discriminatory motive by the City. Rather, the statement suggests that discriminatory intent motivated the actions of\n   <em>\n    the DFFA\n   </em>\n   . Peeples stated that Williams, a City employee, had concluded that\n   <em>\n    the DFFA\n   </em>\n   wanted to \"protect the white boys.\" McCloud testified that he heard from Exander Poe that Williams said that\n   <em>\n    the DFFA\n   </em>\n   did not want to \"lay those white boys off.\" Plaintiffs' argument therefore requires an inference that the City knew of and approved of that discrimination. Accordingly, we find that\n   the statements do not constitute direct evidence of any motive the City harbored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

Plaintiffs argue that there is a \"stark\" statistical disparity in the layoff numbers, between the City list and the DFFA list, which shifted from sixteen to three layoffs of white firefighters, and ten to twenty layoffs of black firefighters. By percentage, white layoffs dropped from 60% to 13%, and black layoffs jumped from 37% to 77.7%. The City argues that Plaintiffs waived the argument, because Plaintiffs did not present the record evidence used to calculate the numbers above to the district court when they opposed the City's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs\n   had not compiled the evidence in a table, as they do in their brief on appeal, nor provided percentages to demonstrate that there was a statistically significant impact by race or national origin, nor did they break out for the court the difference between the City's original layoff list, the DFFA list, and the final list. The City argues that Plaintiffs rely on evidence provided in connection with their motion to compel, which Plaintiffs did not include in their response briefing at summary judgment. The district court was therefore unable to consider the argument of whether there was a statistically significant impact on the minority firefighters, which argues in favor of waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even reviewing the newly compiled evidence, however, we do not find that Plaintiffs' \"statistical evidence\" passes muster. \"Appropriate statistical data showing an employer's pattern of conduct toward a protected class as a group can, if unrebutted, create an inference that a defendant discriminated against individual members of the class.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540616,10540576\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1457/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540616,10540576\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1457/\">\n    at 1466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   , we noted that a sample size of seventeen was \"suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736462\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736462\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/937/\">\n    at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The picture here is similarly incomplete.

Plaintiffs also fail to present the racial makeup of the DFD before and after the RIF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We have stated, \"[u]nless the statistics, standing alone or in comparison, are sufficient to lead the mind naturally to the conclusion sought, they have no probative value; they do not move the proof one way or another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736462\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So too here.

Even if the district court erred in failing to consider sanctions under Title VII, which we do not find, the DFFA is no longer entitled to attorney fees and costs under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christiansburg\n   </em>\n   , 434 U.S. at 421,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183992\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/412/#p421\">\n    98 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a\n   <em>\n    prevailing defendant\n   </em>\n   in a Title VII case ....\" (emphasis added) ).

In its motion for summary judgment, the City claimed that Poe had not filed a charge against the City at all. Plaintiffs failed to argue, or even mention, this issue in their brief opposing summary judgment. Accordingly, the argument is forfeited.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    No other Plaintiff with a timely-filed EEOC charge received a right to sue letter from the EEOC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Neither the timeliness of charges nor receipt of right to sue letters is at issue in the appeal as against the DFFA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Plaintiffs filed their first complaint on September 10, 2013. The district court entered an order to stay the proceeding on October 29, 2013 because of the City's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. On August 13, 2014, the City of Detroit notified the court that the bankruptcy stay had been lifted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The district court also denied the City's motion for sanctions. The City initially cross-appealed this ruling, but then moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal. This Court granted the motion and dismissed the City's appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The City also argues that Plaintiffs abandoned all arguments regarding administrative exhaustion before the district court. We noted Plaintiffs' failure to make any argument\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    in Part I, but given that the district court proceeded to analyze, and reject, the single filing rule's application in this case, we will address it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
