We further clarify that a prevailing party need not establish that the losing party acted in bad faith in order to prove an exceptional case. Therefore, we vacate the district court's denial of the motion for attorney fees and remand for the district court's consideration of the motion under the appropriate legal and evidentiary standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this case and the underlying Lanham Act claims are described in detail in our previous opinion affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment to Appellant XYZ.COM LLC (\"XYZ\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verisign, Inc. v.

In short, XYZ and Appellee Verisign, Inc. (\"Verisign\") both sell internet domain names, and are competitors in the top-level domain industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Verisign operates the .com and .net domains, and in 2014, XYZ began registering domain names ending in .xyz. Verisign sued XYZ, a newcomer to the industry, and its Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Negari, for violations of the Lanham Act. Verisign alleged false advertising based on a false \"gold rush\" scheme, pursuant to which XYZ and Negari allegedly falsely and misleadingly inflated the number of customers who bought XYZ domain names on its launch day. Verisign alleged that XYZ and Negari falsely claimed that it had sold hundreds of thousands of domain names when, in fact, it had given them away for free. It also claimed that Negari disparaged Verisign by making false claims during an interview and on XYZ's blog about the unavailability of domain names on Verisign's registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 15, 2015, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of XYZ. With regard to the alleged \"gold rush\" scheme, the court concluded that the statements regarding XYZ's revenue and number of registrations were true statements and, even assuming they were false, they were not material to consumers. It also concluded that Negari's various statements about the unavailability of domain names were either opinions, statements of fact that had not been shown to be false, or mere puffery. Last, the court concluded that Verisign could not establish damages from the allegedly false statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the district court entered summary judgment in favor of XYZ, XYZ moved for attorney fees under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The court stayed consideration of the motion for attorney fees while this Court considered Verisign's appeal of the summary judgment award. We affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment to XYZ, \"agree[ing] with the district court that Verisign failed to present evidence sufficient to show that any of XYZ's challenged statements [regarding both the \"gold rush\" scheme and the alleged false statements about Verisign's domain name availability] violated the Lanham Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Verisign\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277384\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/292/\">\n    848 F.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In so doing, it held that under the Lanham Act, a prevailing party seeking attorney fees must prove its entitlement to fees with clear and convincing evidence. It then went through the\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factors to analyze whether XYZ had proven that the case was \"exceptional,\" and concluded that XYZ had failed to establish its case with clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1486 (\"Defendants must prove its [sic] claims with clear and convincing evidence. Defendants failed to meet that standard of proof on this factor.\"); J.A. 1487 (\"Again, Defendants have not met their burden to prove with clear and convincing evidence that Plaintiff's case was exceptional.\"); J.A. 1486-87 (\"Defendants argue that Plaintiff abused discovery, but the evidence does not\n   <em>\n    overwhelmingly\n   </em>\n   support this claim.\" (emphasis added)). The court suggested that evidence of bad faith or independently sanctionable conduct was required in order to prove an exceptional case. J.A. 1485 (stating that a \"case is exceptional if the non-prevailing party's conduct was malicious, fraudulent, willful, or deliberate.\" (citation omitted)). It also stated that under the first\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factor, \"[u]nless a claim or defense is so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant would make it, an award of attorney fees is not warranted....\" J.A. 1486.

XYZ argues that the district court relied on an error of law because, under\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , a prevailing party need only prove that a case is exceptional under the Lanham Act by a preponderance of the evidence, and not, as the district court required, clear and convincing evidence.

Though we did not address the burden of proof for proving a Lanham Act \"exceptional case\" in\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   , we specifically noted that the language in the Patent\n   Act was identical to the language in \u00a7 1117(a), and thus \"conclude[d] that there is no reason not to apply the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   standard when considering the award of attorneys fees under \u00a7 1117(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076211\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/710/#p719\">\n    781 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   721 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fair Wind Sailing, Inc. v.

Because we have already adopted the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   standard for awarding these fees, we see no reason not to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   burden of proof as well. And in\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explicitly rejected a clear and convincing evidentiary standard for Patent Act cases in favor of a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   require a party to prove an \"exceptional case\" by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although we find the language in\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   sufficient to require the adoption of the preponderance of the evidence standard here, we are also convinced that this burden of proof is the correct one. This is especially so because we are convinced that the Supreme Court's reasoning for adopting a preponderance of the evidence standard in the Patent Act provision also applies to the fee provision in the Lanham Act. The Supreme Court explained that it had \"not interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees by clear and convincing evidence,\" and the plain language did not justify such a burden because the statute \"demands a simple discretionary inquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much less such a high one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Here, the plain language of the Lanham Act is identical to that of the statute interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , and also \"demands a simple discretionary inquiry\" with no high evidentiary burden. The Supreme Court also noted that the preponderance of the evidence standard \"is the 'standard generally applicable in civil actions,' because it 'allows both parties to share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Herman &amp; MacLean v.

We likewise see no reason to depart from this generally applicable standard in cases seeking attorney fees under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our holding that a preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the \"exceptional case\" analysis under the Lanham Act also comports with the trend in other circuits to apply\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   to motions for attorney fees under the Lanham Act. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits have explicitly held that\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   's preponderance of the evidence standard applies when establishing an exceptional case under the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SunEarth, Inc. v.
