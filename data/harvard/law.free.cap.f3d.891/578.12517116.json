STRANCH, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Atheists, Humanists, and one Jewish Plaintiff challenge the federal statutes requiring inscription of the National Motto, \"In God We Trust,\" on U.S. currency. Plaintiffs allege that the currency statutes cause them to bear, affirm, and proselytize an objectionable message in a way that, for the Atheist and Humanist Plaintiffs, violates their core religious beliefs, and, for the Jewish Plaintiff, renders him complicit in the sins of superfluously printing God's name and destroying God's printed name. Plaintiffs claim that the statutes violate their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court dismissed all claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are nine anonymous children, seven of their anonymous parents, and twenty-four named individuals who identify as Atheist and/or Humanist (or otherwise profess disbelief in a God or Gods); one Jewish individual; and two organizations whose members identify as Atheist, Michigan Atheists and Northern Ohio Freethought Society. Broadly speaking, Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (Complaint) alleges that the inscription of the Motto \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. currency, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205112\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (coins) and \u00a7 5114(b) (bills), violates their individual rights under RFRA and various constitutional provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Motto's inscription on U.S. currency places a substantial burden on their religious exercise in violation of RFRA in three primary ways. The Motto's inscription on the currency allegedly causes Plaintiffs to: (1) \"personally bear a religious message that is the antithesis of what they consider to be religious truth\"; (2) affirm as true a statement they believe to be false (both that God exists and that \"we\" as Americans trust in God) when \"their religious ideologies mandate that they act with honesty\"; and (3) \"proselytize for a religious claim that is completely contrary to their personal religious opinions.\" Most of the allegations state that Plaintiffs object to carrying, affirming, and proselytizing a message whose\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   contradicts their religious beliefs, but some allegations assert that Plaintiffs' religious beliefs specifically forbid the very\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   of carrying, affirming, or proselytizing the Motto. The single Jewish Plaintiff alleges that it is sinful for him to participate in an activity that involves the superfluous printing of God's name on secular documents and that leads to the destruction of that printed name (when currency is destroyed). Plaintiffs allege that carrying and transacting with U.S. coins and bills is often necessary to participate in everyday commerce. By forcing Plaintiffs to choose between not using cash and violating their religious beliefs, Plaintiffs allege, the Government has substantially burdened their religious exercise without a compelling interest as required by RFRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' Free Exercise claim has a similar basis, while further alleging that the challenged statutes are impermissibly \"aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.\" Plaintiffs provide sixty pages of allegations regarding the history of the Motto and its placement on money, which allegedly demonstrate the Government's consistent, longstanding intent to promote Christian monotheism by including the Motto on the currency. Plaintiffs' Free Speech claim alleges that the Government intentionally compels Plaintiffs to proselytize when they pass currency to others. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Government's inscription of the Motto on the national currency denies equal dignity to Plaintiffs' religious views, contributing to cultural stigma, alienation, and denigration of their views in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment, as incorporated by the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2016, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit against Congress, the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Principal Deputy Director of the Mint, and the Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed Congress. Plaintiffs asked the court to declare that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205112\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and 5114(b) violate RFRA and the Constitution and to permanently enjoin Defendants from producing currency inscribed with \"In God We Trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court dismissed all of Plaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). It analyzed the RFRA and Free Exercise claims together and concluded that Plaintiffs had not alleged a substantial burden on their religious exercise. Plaintiffs could avoid cash by using credit cards and checks. The court concluded that cash-only transactions did not compel Plaintiffs to proselytize a message that violates their religious beliefs, analogizing to a Supreme Court case that suggested the Motto's inclusion on currency was not compelled speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wooley v. Maynard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    430 U.S. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    51 L.Ed.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). The court dismissed Plaintiffs' Free Speech claim for the same reason, again relying on\n   <em>\n    Wooley\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the court dismissed Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim because it concluded that the challenged statutes do not treat different classes of people disparately.

The Complaint lists certain allegations specific to individual Plaintiffs, and it is true that some individualized allegations state merely that a Plaintiff feels offense or fears ridicule. The Complaint, however, is not limited to these individual allegations. Read in full, the Complaint's allegations go beyond mere \"observation of conduct with which one disagrees.\"\n   <em>\n    Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams.

The Complaint alleges not only that Plaintiffs take offense at the Motto's inscription on currency, but also that the Government has burdened all the Plaintiffs' religious beliefs by pressuring them to alter personalized conduct in which they regularly engage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washegesic v.

An allegation that the Government is compelling a particular person to violate personal religious beliefs (as opposed to an allegation by a taxpayer that the Government has violated a generalized constitutional mandate) states an Article III injury-in-fact.

The Complaint includes the necessary allegation, but in a conclusory fashion: \"Defendants' acts force Plaintiffs to choose between either relinquishing their rights to participate in much of their everyday commerce (by using the nation's monetary instruments) or violating their religious beliefs.\" The Plaintiffs can survive a motion to dismiss only if they back up this conclusory statement with sufficient factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Omnicare, Inc.

For example, one Plaintiff, as an octogenarian, \"often feels more comfortable using cash rather than credit cards or checks,\" while one child Plaintiff \"uses money almost every week to buy books, magazines, treats and gifts.\" Allegations that Plaintiffs prefer to use cash do not show that the\n   Government has effectively forced them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or suffering a serious consequence.

The first phrase inscribed on American currency was \"Mind Your Business\"; it appeared on the continental dollar and then on the fugio cent.

Congress mandated that the phrase be included on all U.S. coins and bills in 1955, Act of July 11, 1955, Pub. L. No. 84-140 (1955), and subsequently adopted the phrase as the national motto in 1956, Act of July 30, 1956, Pub. L. No. 84-851 (1956).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In their first claim, the plaintiffs argue that the inscription of the national motto \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. coins and bills substantially burdens their exercise of religion in violation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993 (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   All but four of the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded factual allegations demonstrating that the inscription substantially burdens their religion and have thus pleaded a plausible violation of RFRA.

There is a statutory exception to this prohibition, however.

As articulated in Section I.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b) places the burden of proof on the government, this exception acts like an affirmative defense.

Appellee Br. at 33. This argument sidesteps the compelling interest the government has asserted. The compelling interest, as articulated by the government, is not simply having the national motto inscribed on coins and bills. Rather, it claims that the compelling governmental interest is having coins and bills function as a \"primary means by which Congress communicates ... the fundamental values on which our system of government is founded.\" Appellee Br. at 31. Thus, the national motto is not the least restrictive means of achieving this alleged compelling interest because Congress could still use coins and bills as such an advertising device without using the specific phrase \"In God We Trust\" or any other religiously inflected phrase that imposes a substantial burden on users of U.S. coins and bills.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU of Ohio v.
