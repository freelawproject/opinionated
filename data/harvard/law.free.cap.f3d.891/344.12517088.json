Misdemeanor is defined as a\n   <em>\n    crime\n   </em>\n   punishable by the term of imprisonment prescribed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201244.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1244.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To render the alien ineligible, his two prior convictions must be for crimes punishable by more than five days imprisonment, and their adjudication must qualify as \"convictions\" under \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), defined as \"a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.\" It is significant, but not dispositive, that state law classifies the offenses as \"crimes.\" The substantive federal issue is not classification under state law, but whether a judgment of guilt was entered by a court at the end of a criminal proceeding. It is\n   <em>\n    irrelevant\n   </em>\n   whether state law classifies the crimes as \"infractions\" or \"violations,\" rather than \"misdemeanors,\" so long as the punishment that may be imposed under state law meets the federal definition of misdemeanor in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201244.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1244.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude the BIA properly considered this federal law issue to be \"a matter of substance, not of form.\" In determining whether a state law adjudication resulted in a judgment that the alien was guilty of a crime, the most fundamental aspect of a \"criminal proceeding\" in this country is whether \"guilt\" was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If that standard was met, and if the alien was judged guilty of two misdemeanors\n   <em>\n    as defined in the TPS regulation\n   </em>\n   , then the alien is ineligible for TPS, whether or not the \"judgment of guilt\" came at the end of proceedings that state law classified as civil, quasi-criminal, or criminal.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batrez Gradiz v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475778\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/1206/#p1208\">\n    490 F.3d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"\n   <em>\n    Eslamizar\n   </em>\n   does nothing more than reaffirm our traditional standard that findings of guilt must be beyond a reasonable doubt\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rubio's appeal focuses on additional procedural issues, including one relied on by the BIA in\n   <em>\n    Bajric\n   </em>\n   , whether a municipal ordinance conviction may subsequently be used to impeach. Rubio also notes that municipal judges in Missouri lack jurisdiction over some state criminal offenses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20479.170\">\n    Mo.

The government argues we lack jurisdiction to consider many of these arguments because they were not raised to the BIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez Carcamo v.

But in any event, procedural variations in municipal court proceedings across the country do not affect TPS eligibility. To ensure uniform administration of this national immigration program, the question of substance, not form, is whether the municipal proceeding resulted in a judgment of guilt by a court that the alien committed a crime falling within the definition of \"misdemeanor\" in the TPS statute and regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Applying these standards, we agree with the BIA that Rubio's two convictions for municipal ordinance violations were \"convictions\" under \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). As the BIA more than adequately justified this ruling, it is an agency decision entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    Dominguez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277377\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/411/\">\n    850 F.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rubio further argues the second IJ violated his right to due process by not providing sufficient time to respond to the government's motion for reconsideration and not stating reasons for denying his TPS application.

Rubio does not argue prejudice-that the outcome of the proceedings may well have been different. The dispositive issue was a question of law that was thoroughly briefed on appeal and reviewed by the BIA\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .
