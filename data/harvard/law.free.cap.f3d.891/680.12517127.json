The district court dismissed his complaint, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mayle asserts that the motto amounts to a government endorsement of a \"monotheistic concept of God.\" Because Satanists practice a religion that rejects monotheism, they regard the motto as \"an attack on their very right to exist.\" Possessing and using currency, Mayle complains, forces him (and his fellow Satanists) to affirm and spread a religious message \"committed to the very opposite ideals that he espouses.\" In addition, Mayle characterizes the printing of the motto as a form of discrimination against adherents to minority\n   religions because it favors practitioners of monotheistic religions. All this, Mayle asserts, demonstrates that the defendants are violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection clause, and the First Amendment's Free Speech, Free Exercise, and Establishment clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In granting the defendants' motion to dismiss, the district court, citing\n   <em>\n    Newdow v.

It dismissed Mayle's equal-protection claim because the currency's appearance affects all citizens equally.

In\n   <em>\n    Sherman v. Community Consolidated School District 21 of Wheeling Township\n   </em>\n   , we said that the original religious significance of \"In God We Trust\" has dissipated and the motto is now secular.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513594\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/437/#p446\">\n    980 F.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446-48 (7th Cir. 1992). And in\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois v. City of St. Charles\n   </em>\n   , we said that \"the establishment clause is not so strictly interpreted as to forbid conventional nonsectarian public invocations of\n   the deity, a standard example being the slogan on U.S. currency and coins: 'In God We Trust.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1591002\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/265/#p271\">\n    794 F.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (7th Cir. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The inclusion of the motto on currency is similar to other ways in which secular symbols give a nod to the nation's religious heritage. Examples include the phrase \"one nation under God,\" which has been in the Pledge of Allegiance since 1954, see Pub. L. No. 83-396, ch. 297,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Stat.%20249\">\n    68 Stat. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954), as well as the National Day of Prayer, which has existed in various forms since the dawn of the country and is now codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20119\">\n    36 U.S.C. \u00a7 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    465 U.S. at 676-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, when the religious aspects of an activity account for \"only a fraction,\" the possibility that anyone could see it as an endorsement of religion is diluted.\n   <em>\n    Freedom From Religion Found., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516263\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1038/#p1045\">\n    885 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the case of currency, the motto is one of many historical reminders; others include portraits of presidents, state symbols, monuments, notable events such as the Louisiana Purchase, and the national bird. In this context, a reasonable observer would not perceive the motto on currency as a religious endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mayle's Establishment Clause claim fares no better under either of the other two approaches-coercion and purpose-the Supreme Court takes in this area. Under the former, we look to see whether the government has coerced the plaintiff to support or participate in religion.\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece, N.Y. v.

Mayle maintains that he has been coerced into participating in Christianity because credit and debit cards are too risky and he is thus compelled by default to conduct all of his economic transactions using money with a religious message. We grant that using currency is essentially obligatory for someone such as Mayle, who eschews electronic forms of payment. See\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p587\">\n    505 U.S. at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p587\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But no one walking down the street who saw Mayle would have the faintest idea what Mayle had in his pocket-currency or plastic payment cards or perhaps just a smart phone. The government has thus not coerced Mayle into advertising, supporting, or participating in religion; it has merely included on its currency the religious heritage of the country along with other traditions. See\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    465 U.S. at 676, 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And if, as the Supreme Court has held, public or legislative prayer does not force religious practice on an audience, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1824-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is difficult to see how the unobtrusive appearance of the national motto on the coinage and paper money could amount to coerced participation in a religious practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Last, we have the \"purpose\" test, under which we ask whether the motto was placed on the currency for a religious purpose, or, put differently, whether its inclusion \"lacks a secular objective.\"\n   <em>\n    Freedom From Religion Found., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516263\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1038/#p1045\">\n    885 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1049 ; see\n   <em>\n    Lemon v.

Mayle contends that because the Department of the Treasury admits that religious sentiment was the driving force behind the decision permanently to affix the motto to currency in 1955, its attempt now to separate secular \"religious heritage\" from \"religious practice\" is illusory. But his premise is too simplistic. The Cold War was at its height during the mid-1950s, and so it is just as accurate to say that the motto was placed on U.S. currency to celebrate our tradition of religious freedom, as compared with the communist\n   hostility to religion. Moreover, even if the motto was added to currency in part because of religious sentiment, it was also done to commemorate that part of our nation's heritage. See\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    465 U.S. at 676, 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p680\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And having just one secular purpose is sufficient to pass the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    Bridenbaugh v. O'Bannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585856\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/796/#p800\">\n    185 F.3d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800 (7th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Inscribing the motto on currency, Mayle argues next, violates the Free Speech Clause because the national motto conveys a religious message, which he is being forced to convey: that he \"trusts\" in a deity. But Mayle is not in any meaningful way affirming the motto by using currency. See\n   <em>\n    Wooley v. Maynard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    430 U.S. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/\">\n    51 L.Ed.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). He is not wearing a sign or driving a car displaying a slogan.

As the district court noted, most people do not brandish currency in public-they keep it in a wallet or otherwise out of sight until the moment of exchange. And the recipient of cash in a commercial transaction could not reasonably think that the payer is proselytizing. If the recipient thought about it at all, she would understand that the government designed the currency and is responsible for all of its content, including the motto. She would not regard the motto as Mayle's own speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mayle also argues that, in holding and using currency, he is compelled to affirm a religious message that contradicts his Satanist beliefs, and so the motto on currency violates his rights under the Free Exercise Clause and places an undue burden on his exercise of religion for purposes of RFRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb-1(a), (b). Under the Free Exercise Clause, the law authorizing the placement of the motto on currency is constitutional if it is neutral and generally applicable. See\n   <em>\n    Listecki v.

But Mayle's claim fails because the motto's placement on currency has the secular purpose of recognizing the religious component of our nation's history, see\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513594\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/437/#p446\">\n    980 F.2d at 446-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it does not affect current religious practices. The motto appears on all currency, in addition, which means that law in question is generally applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under RFRA, Mayle must allege plausibly that the exercise of his religion is substantially burdened by the motto's placement on currency. See\n   <em>\n    Korte v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722443\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/654/#p673\">\n    735 F.3d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (7th Cir. 2013). Mayle argues that having the motto printed on currency forces him to choose between using cash, a necessary part of life, and violating his sincerely held religious beliefs. Using the currency makes him feel \"guilt, shame and above all else fear,\" and those feelings, he contends, qualify as a substantial burden. He likens himself to a fundamentalist Christian baker who would be forced to endorse gay marriage-a practice that violates his religious beliefs-by selling a couple a wedding cake.

And because using money is not a religious exercise, and the motto has secular as well as religious significance, Mayle has not plausibly alleged that the motto's placement\n   on currency increases the burden on practicing Satanism. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   , a case upon which Mayle relies, does not stand for the proposition that the government must accommodate every person who believes that a particular law is incompatible with the person's sincerely held religious beliefs. 134 S.Ct. at 2760, 2783. Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Mayle's feelings are not insignificant, but the burden he experiences is not substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mayle last attempts to state a claim under the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. He argues that the government's inclusion of what he describes as a Christian message on currency, but not any Satanist or other religious dogma, amounts to irrational government discrimination. (Christianity, of course, is not unique in its monotheism; the same can be said of Judaism and Islam, but this fact does not matter to our analysis.) We approach this as we would an equal-protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, see\n   <em>\n    Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

But as multiple courts have said, the motto's placement on currency is related to at least one legitimate governmental objective-acknowledging an aspect of our nation's heritage.
