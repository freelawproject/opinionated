Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Camick entered the United States in 2006 using the name and birth certificate of his deceased younger brother. In 2011, represented by counsel, Camick conceded removability at a hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ) in New Jersey, admitting that he was removable for procuring admission by misrepresentation and lacking valid entry documents. Removal proceedings were suspended when Camick was detained in the District of Kansas on criminal charges related to use of his brother's identity. A jury convicted Camick on all counts; the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed an obstruction of justice conviction but reversed the other counts.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In December 2015, a New Jersey IJ granted the government's motion to change venue of the removal proceedings to Kansas City, Missouri. Camick appeared pro se before a Kansas City IJ in January 2016. He stated he was pursuing three avenues for relief from removal and requested release from DHS custody under a reduced bond. The IJ set bond in the amount of $7,500 and scheduled a removal hearing for February 11; both parties waived appeal of that ruling. At the end of the hearing, the IJ commented to Camick, \"you're not the typical pro se litigant, sir. You've had a lot of practice it seems.\" He replied, \"Yes, absolutely. I've been an avid student of Immigration law for the past four years now.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the February 11 hearing, Camick had not obtained relief from removal. After the IJ declined his request for work authorization, Camick said he now could not afford a $7,500 bond. The government opposed a continuance, urging the IJ to enter an order of removal unless Camick requested voluntary departure, noting he could pursue a nonimmigrant visa application after removal to Canada. The IJ asked Camick if he would be interested in \"pre-conclusion\" voluntary departure. The IJ explained this would allow him to depart the United States without a removal order and return immediately if he secured a visa, avoiding the ten-year bar on reentering the United States after removal, but he would have to \"waive appeal today of all issues.\" Camick accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure and advised he would have the needed travel funds arranged from Canada. The government stated it would waive appeal of this ruling. The IJ declared, \"it's now a final decision.\" The IJ issued a written order granting Camick voluntary departure, giving him until March 3, 2016 to depart, entering an alternate order of removal to Canada, and stating that both parties had waived appeal. Court staff served the order on Camick the same day, February 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Camick did not voluntarily depart on March 3. He did not ask the IJ for more time to do so,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (IJ may grant up to 120 days for pre-conclusion voluntary departure), nor file a motion to reopen or reconsider the grant of voluntary departure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 3, DHS served Camick a Warning for Failure to Depart, Form I-229(a), listing February 18, 2016, as the date the Kansas City IJ's order of removal became final.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 12, Camick delivered a notice of appeal of the IJ's February 11 decision to detention facility officials for mailing to the BIA. In a lengthy brief, he withdrew his concession of removability and consent to voluntary departure, challenged the change of venue to Kansas City, asserted he was entitled to interim work authorization, and claimed his New Jersey attorney was ineffective for \"failing to proficiently analyze his immigration case and ... actively pursue a defense.\" He accused the detention facility of impermissibly limiting his right to make photocopies and stated he was confused\n   about whether the thirty days to file a notice of appeal did not begin until February 18, based on the Form I-229(a) Warning. The BIA received the notice of appeal on March 17. Camick was removed to Canada on March 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 28, 2016, the BIA dismissed Camick's appeal for three reasons: (i) he waived his right to appeal the IJ's decision at the February 11 removal hearing; (ii) his ineffective-assistance claim did not comply with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lozada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20637\">\n    19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 1988) ; and (iii) the appeal was untimely because the IJ's voluntary departure and alternative removal order became final for appeal purposes with the IJ's February 11 decision, and Camick's notice of appeal was received by the BIA on March 17, more than thirty days later. Camick timely filed a pro se petition for review of the BIA decision in this court and a pro se motion to reconsider with the BIA. Both filings attacked the three reasons given by the BIA in dismissing the appeal. In the motion to reconsider, Camick argued the BIA \"should in good faith and fair play, accept the Appeal of March 12/17, 2016 by Certification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BIA denied the motion to reconsider. The BIA agreed with Camick that he did not knowingly waive his right to appeal but concluded that any error in concluding otherwise was not material because Camick's appeal was untimely. After expressly considering Camick's allegations that the detention facility impermissibly denied him photocopy and law library access and delayed mailing his notice of appeal, the BIA concluded that Camick failed to establish it should exercise its self-certification authority to accept Camick's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BIA denied reconsideration of the ineffective assistance claim because Camick \"has not explained how the attorney's representation is relevant to his motion\" to reconsider dismissal of his appeal from the February 2016 voluntary departure/removal order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Camick filed a separate petition for review of the denial of reconsideration.

Because Camick petitioned for review of the initial decision, our review is not limited to whether the denial of reconsideration was an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boudaguian v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376153\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/825/#p828\">\n    376 F.3d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828 (8th Cir. 2004). However, a motion to reconsider, unlike a motion to reopen, is based upon \"errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Thus, the issues presented in the two petitions for review necessarily overlap, and we will treat the BIA's opinion denying reconsideration as a further explication of its initial decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the petitions for review, Camick argues the BIA should have equitably tolled the filing deadline, or accepted his appeal by self-certification, because he exercised diligence in filing a timely appeal, and circumstances beyond his control explained his late filing. He argues we must remand to the BIA because it did not address his\n   vague invocation of the \"doctrine of Equitable Tolling\" in its orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, he argues his appeal was timely because the thirty-day filing period began on February 18, 2016, when he petitioned for review of the New Jersey IJ's venue order. Camick also argues the BIA erred in denying his motion to reconsider the denial of his claim that his New Jersey counsel provided ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court explained: \"the rule we adopt does not alter the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   between the Government and the alien. If withdrawal is requested prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, the alien has not received\n   benefits without costs; the alien who withdraws ... is in the same position as an alien who was not granted voluntary departure in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We conclude the Court would apply these same principles to the somewhat different circumstances surrounding a\n   <em>\n    pre-conclusion\n   </em>\n   voluntary departure order. In this situation, the IJ has not entered a final order of removal; rather, the alien has conceded removability and waived all defenses and requests for relief from removal. The BIA has not affirmed the IJ's order because the alien waived his right to appeal it. But the consequences of the alien failing to depart voluntarily in the time allowed are the same for both pre-conclusion and post-conclusion orders: \"An order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of [removal] proceedings ... shall become final ... (f) If an immigration judge issues an alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure,\n   <em>\n    upon overstay of the voluntary departure period\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casillas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830921\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/273/#p275\">\n    656 F.3d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Like the alien who agreed to a post-conclusion voluntary departure order in\n   <em>\n    Dada\n   </em>\n   , there were procedures available to Camick to withdraw from his pre-conclusion order while it was still executory, that is, before expiration of the voluntary departure period. Most commonly, an alien who concludes that the process was procedurally unfair will file a motion with the IJ or a timely appeal to the BIA alleging that the appeal waiver was not knowing or voluntary. If he prevails, the BIA may remand to the IJ to permit the respondent to reapply for voluntary departure, or to \"entertain other requests for relief\" should the alien not seek voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    Ocampo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%201301\">\n    22 I. &amp; N.

Dec. 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1323-24 (BIA 2000). Alternatively, the alien may ask the IJ or BIA to extend the voluntary departure period up to the maximum 120 days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By contrast, when an alien who agreed to a pre-conclusion or post-conclusion voluntary departure order overstays the voluntary departure period, his agreement with the government is no longer executory-he has received the voluntary departure benefit offered, and the government is entitled to enforce its side of the bargain, the alternative removal order. Here, Camick made no valid attempt to withdraw from the executory pre-conclusion order by challenging the appeal waiver or seeking rescission on some other ground. After overstaying the allowed voluntary departure period to which he agreed, he filed a lengthy appeal to the BIA challenging the merits of the alternative removal order. But by that time, the alternative order was effective and enforceable, and all challenges to the merits of that order were foreclosed by Camick's concession of removability and waiver of all issues in a pre-conclusion voluntary departure order that was no longer executory. As the Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    Dada\n   </em>\n   , \"among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure,\n   <em>\n    and actually depart\n   </em>\n   , within the [prescribed] period.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    554 U.S. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In these circumstances, we conclude that Camick's belated appeal to the BIA was untimely because it was filed after termination of the voluntary departure period, whether or not it was timely filed under the BIA's procedural regulations. Therefore, any error by the BIA in not taking up this futile appeal of the alternative removal order on the merits was harmless, and the petitions for judicial review must be denied. \"Congress' intent\n   in adopting and then amending the INA was to expedite both the initiation and the completion of the judicial review process.\"\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p405\">\n    514 U.S. at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p405\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The petitions for review are denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Camick's pro se pleadings and arguments to the IJ, to the BIA, and to this court, and his counseled briefs in the second petition for review, repeatedly state that he is entitled to special treatment as a pro se litigant dealing with the complex world of immigration law. We reject these entreaties because they are factually without merit. Our review of Camick's pro se pleadings, briefs, substantive arguments, and procedural maneuvers convince us that, as he told the IJ in January 2016 (before agreeing on February 11 to the pre-conclusion voluntary departure order at issue), he is a pro se litigant who was remarkably well versed in immigration law and practice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    On March 1, Camick filed with the immigration court a Notice of Withdrawal of Consent to Voluntary Departure, based upon the failure of DHS to deliver his birth certificate that was seized when he was arrested in March 2013, which made him unable to apply for a Canadian passport needed to voluntarily depart. There is no authority in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or in the Attorney General's regulations for an alien to unilaterally withdraw from a pre-conclusion voluntary departure order. Camick did not apply to the IJ or BIA for more time to depart, or file a motion to reopen or reconsider the voluntary departure order before the departure period expired, the proper way to assert his claim that the appeal waiver was invalid because the IJ did not adequately explain it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(1).
