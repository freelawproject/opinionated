Spatt,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   .), entered December 16, 2016. Du Purton was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and twenty-one counts of mail fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He was sentenced to 51 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a special assessment of $2,300 and restitution of $1,873,819.50. He served his sentence of incarceration and is no longer in federal custody. He petitioned for\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   relief to vacate his conviction and sentence based on newly discovered evidence, which he claims shows the inaccuracy of expert testimony submitted against him at his trial. The district court denied the petition. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Du Purton owned and managed four companies dealing in rare coins. At the conclusion of a ten-week jury trial in 2001, he was convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in the conduct of the rare-coins business. The evidence showed an elaborate scheme of fraudulent representations to customers designed to induce them to purchase du\n   Purton's merchandise. This included fabrications regarding the source of coins (such as that they came from a recent estate sale, or from a widow in desperate need of money), phony auctions designed to create the appearance of justification for du Purton's prices, assertions regarding resale opportunities known to be nonexistent, role-playing by du Purton's employees designed to create the false appearance of communications from competitors or independent sources, and false representations that the coins had been graded by independent experts as to their overall quality, comparative wear, and attractiveness, when in fact all coins were graded by du Purton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence included 702 coins that were acquired, graded, and offered for sale by du Purton (the \"Trial Coins\"). A government expert, Anthony Swiatek, testified as to both the grade and value of these coins. Relying on pricing guides that were widely used in the coin industry and updated regularly, as well as auction results and personal experience as a coin dealer, Swiatek assessed each of the coins and concluded that du Purton had consistently overstated their value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On direct appeal from his conviction, du Purton challenged both the sufficiency of the evidence and the admissibility of the expert testimony. This Court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Swiatek estimated their value at approximately $430,000 to $460,000, which he deemed \"a ballpark figure.\" App'x at 64. The district court then authorized the government to sell the Inventory Coins so that the proceeds could be applied to satisfaction of the restitution order. Nearly a decade later, in December 2010, the government finally auctioned the coins. The auction yielded $1,827,176 in gross proceeds, roughly four times the value of Swiatek's 2001 appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2015, du Purton, who had completed his sentence of incarceration, filed this petition for a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201651\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking to vacate his conviction and sentence based on the newly discovered evidence of the auction proceeds. Du Purton argued that the disparity between Swiatek's 2001 appraisal of the Inventory Coins and the subsequent proceeds from their 2010 sale at auction showed that Swiatek's testimony about the value of the Trial Coins had been wrong. The district court denied the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    du Purton v.

But a showing that the auction of the 26,612 Inventory Coins yielded substantially\n   more than the value Swiatek had estimated for them nearly a decade earlier does not show that Swiatek's testimony about the value of the 702 Trial Coins was inaccurate or misleading. The two sets of coins are distinct, as were Swiatek's valuations. When dealing with such a large number as 26,612, the discrepancy between Swiatek's initial assessment and the final proceeds at auction might have been attributable to a few outlier coins that, in the nine intervening years, became unexpectedly valuable. Du Purton's argument is nothing more than speculation. In any event, given the strength of the evidence of du Purton's broad fraudulent activity in support of his sale of coins, the issue he raises as to Swiatek's method of valuation does not show circumstances compelling grant of the writ to achieve justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We find that du Purton has failed to show a defect in the evidence at his trial, and accordingly we AFFIRM the order of the district court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
