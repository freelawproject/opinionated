Immigrants who have been ordered removed are detained during their \"removal period\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Criminal aliens\" are detained pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). In this appeal, we are asked to decide whether a \"criminal alien\" is detained under Section 1231(a) when he has exhausted his options for administrative review, even though he has a stay pending resolution of his appeal in this Court. We hold today that when a stay has been issued, an immigrant is not held pursuant to Section 1231(a) because he is not in the \"removal period\" contemplated by statute until his appeal is resolved by this Court. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's determination that Hechavarria was detained under Section 1231(a) and remand for reconsideration of his habeas petition under the correct statutory provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Immigration and Criminal History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Joseph Emanuel Hechavarria is a Jamaican citizen who first arrived in the United States in 1984 on a nonimmigrant visitor visa. Hechavarria overstayed his visa and married a U.S. citizen, who filed a marriage-based conditional permanent resident (\"CPR\") application on his behalf, which was granted in 1987. In 1989, Hechavarria's CPR status was terminated because he and his spouse failed to submit a petition to lift the conditions on his status as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c). In\n   2009, Hechavarria's son filed a Form I-130 petition on his behalf, which was granted by United States Citizen and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") in 2010. Shortly thereafter, Hechavarria was served with a Notice to Appear and was charged with being removable from the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D)(i), the section of the immigration statutes that renders deportable individuals with terminated CPR status. Hechavarria was not detained at the time and instead was released to the Department of Homeland Security's (\"DHS\") Alternatives to Detention (\"ATD\") program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2010, Hechavarria failed to appear for a required check-in in Buffalo and instead called the ATD officers to tell them he was on his way to Florida. Subsequent to this phone call, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) learned that Hechavarria was the subject of a criminal arrest warrant issued in Cheektowaga, New York on December 13, 2010 for, among other things, an alleged rape and assault that had occurred on December 2, 2010. Hechavarria was detained by ICE agents in New York City on December 22, 2010 and transported to Cheektowaga, New York to face the pending charges. In 2011, Hechavarria was convicted of assault in the second degree and sentenced to three years of incarceration and two years of post-release supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While Hechavarria was incarcerated for the December 2010 assault, ICE filed an additional charge of deportability on the basis of Hechavarria's conviction of an aggravated felony under Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F). On July 11, 2013, Hechavarria was released from criminal custody and immediately transferred to DHS custody at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York, where he was ordered removed to Jamaica. Over the course of the next two years, Hechavarria filed two appeals as well as a motion to reopen proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The last of those appeals was dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") on September 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Meanwhile, the stay of removal remains in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 8, 2015, while his stay request was pending, Hechavarria filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Western District of New York. The district court analyzed Hechavarria's detention under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and denied his habeas petition on April 11, 2016. The district court reasoned that \"because the detention challenged by the habeas petition in this action has been prolonged by petitioner's own pursuit of judicial review of the final order of removal, the duration of his detention cannot be found to constitute a violation of his rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Hechavarria v.

Hechavarria and the court-appointed amicus counsel argue that Hechavarria's detention is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\" Section 1226\"), the section of the INA that governs the detention of \"criminal aliens.\" The government argues that Hechavarria is detained pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1231\"), the section of the INA that addresses the \"removal period\" for immigrants facing deportation. We agree with Hechavarria and the amicus counsel that the plain language of the statute dictates that Hechavarria is detained pursuant to section 1226(c). We hold that section 1226(c) governs because he has obtained a stay of removal from this Court pending the disposition of his petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Judicial Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court is currently engaged in two threads of judicial review regarding Hechavarria. The first thread is the one at\n   issue in the instant appeal, namely, the review of the district court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The second is the petition for review of the underlying removal order that was stayed before this Court pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   . The two threads are interwoven in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The INA explicitly provides for judicial review of removal orders in the federal courts of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) (\"[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter ...\".). The INA also contemplates the need for stays of removal during the process of judicial review, observing that filing a petition for review does not stay the removal order, \"unless the court orders otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B).

It also provides for the ability of courts of appeals to issue stays of removal pending the disposition of that review process. The statutory procedural protections of judicial review and stays are essential tools in meeting the government's constitutional obligation to provide procedural due process for immigrants facing removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reno v.

Because the court below applied Section 1231, we begin our analysis by examining this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Section of the INA addresses immigrants in the \"removal period,\" the term used in the statute to describe the 90-day period following an order of removal during which \"the Attorney General shall remove the alien.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).

There is simply nothing ambiguous about the statute at issue. The removal period begins at the latest of three possible scenarios, one of which is when a court issues its final order after having issued a stay.

When a court of appeals issues a stay pending judicial review of an underlying removal order, the removal is not inevitable. A contrary reading assumes that the courts of appeals function as mere ministerial rubber stamps for agencies. Yet this appears to be the view advanced by the government, which suggests that our review of Hechavarria's underlying removal order is a mere formality that simply \"temporarily interrupted\" \"DHS's ability to carry out Hechavarria's removal.\" Appellees' Response to Amicus Br. at 2. Our responsibility to provide meaningful judicial review is one that is grounded in both the statute and the Constitution and may not be dismissed by the government as a mere procedural nuisance.
