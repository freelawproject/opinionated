Jefferson, an African American, worked for Sewon as a clerk in its finance department. While Jefferson was still in her probationary period of employment, she approached a manager in the information technology department, Gene Chung, and expressed interest in transferring to his department. Chung told Jefferson that he supported the transfer and that Jefferson could soon switch departments. But he later informed her that she was ineligible for the transfer because she lacked experience and because a higher-ranked manager \"wanted a Korean in that position.\" Jefferson immediately reported this statement to the human resources department, and a week later, Sewon fired Jefferson. Jefferson then sued, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sewon. We reverse in part because Jefferson presented direct evidence that Sewon failed to transfer her on the basis of her race and nationality and circumstantial evidence that Sewon fired her in retaliation for her complaint, and we affirm in part because Jefferson failed to present substantial evidence that Sewon fired her on the basis of race or national origin. And we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We divide the background in two parts. First, we describe the facts by viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to Jefferson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. UPS Ground Freight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894355\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1283/#p1291\">\n    683 F.3d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1291-92 (11th Cir. 2012). Second, we describe the proceedings in the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2013, Sewon hired Jefferson as a temporary clerk in its finance department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2013, Sewon promoted Jefferson to full-time, but probationary, status in the same position. The next month, Jefferson learned of an open position in the information technology department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jefferson had been taking technology classes at a local college and had the \"career goal\" of working in information technology. She approached the department manager, Gene Chung, who told her that \"he wanted [her] to transition to the department.\" Chung interviewed Jefferson and told her that \"he was willing to transition [her] over\" to the information technology department and that he liked her \"work ethic[.]\" He also encouraged her to continue her coursework and told her that \"he would train [her in] anything [that she] didn't know [from school] if it was related to the job.\" Chung explained that \"the next steps\" were for Jefferson to \"take a test\" and for Nate Jung, a high-level manager, to approve the transition, and Chung told Jefferson that she \"would be transferred over to the [information technology] department by the end of the week.\" After meeting with Chung, Jefferson also spoke to Ken Horton, Sewon's human resources manager, who told her that \"he would talk to [Chung] and work something out\" so that Jefferson could switch departments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August, Chung gave Jefferson a \"basic knowledge\" test about computers. Jefferson admitted that she \"didn't do so [well] on [the test],\" and Chung averred that she \"performed so poorly on [the] test that [he] had no interest in employing her in the [information technology] [d]epartment.\" But Chung told her that the job was not \"dependent on\" the test and, after Jefferson finished the test, Chung went \"over the results with [her],\" told her \"to take it home, research it, [and] correct [her] wrong answers,\" and later reviewed her new research and responses. Jefferson testified that it remained her \"understanding that [Chung] still was going to talk to ... Jung about [the transfer].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around the same time, Jefferson had some difficulty with her managers in the finance department: Esther Kim and Jenny Hong. Kim was Jefferson's immediate supervisor and Kim reported to Hong. Both supervisors told Jefferson that \"they wished [that Jefferson] had come to them first [about the transfer] as opposed to going to ... Chung.\" But Jefferson explained that the managers \"didn't seem mad\" and that there was \"mutual[ ] agreement\" that she could transfer. Jefferson also had irritated the managers by \"coming back [late] from lunch several times\" and failing to silence her phone at work. Despite these issues, on August 16, the managers decided to \"figure out a way to make [Jefferson] continue working for the company in a more productive way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Soon afterward, Jefferson's employment took a turn for the worse. On August 20, Hong completed a negative performance evaluation that awarded Jefferson a total of 64 out of 200 possible points. Notwithstanding Hong's earlier assurance to Jefferson that she would not stand in the way of a transfer, even though Jefferson had not first asked her permission, the evaluation underscored that Jefferson \"disregard[ed] policies and procedures\" that required her to report to \"her direct supervisor\" and that Jefferson did not \"want to work with her direct supervisor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 23, Chung met with Jefferson and told her, for the first time, that she could not transfer to the information technology department. He explained that the open position required \"five years of experience\" and that \"Jung said that he wanted a Korean in that position.\" Jefferson immediately complained about this alleged racial discrimination to Horton, the human resources manager. Horton told\n   her not to \"take it personal[ly]\" and to \"brush it off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the same day that Jefferson complained about racial discrimination underlying the denial of her request to transfer, Kim filled out a performance evaluation that gave Jefferson a score of 68 out of 200. The evaluation underscored that Jefferson \"disregard[ed] policies and procedures and d[id] not inform her direct supervisor [of problems],\" and it concluded that \"there [was] no room for improvement.\" Despite these deficiencies, the review also stated that Jefferson \"c[a]me to work on time every day\" and \"work[ed] well and complete[d] her tasks in a timely manner.\" Kim testified that she had never \"filled out this type of [evaluation] for anyone else\" or \"reprimanded anyone else for\" the same kinds of issues cited in her evaluation of Jefferson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Horton collected Hong's and Kim's evaluations, averaged the scores, and \"applied a pre-established minimum threshold number.\" Jefferson received a score of 32.5, \"below the pre-established threshold [for termination] of 35.\" Horton averred that this method \"was used for other introductory employee evaluations in the past and was not a threshold applied only to ... Jefferson's average score\" and that he \"never advised ... Kim or ... Hong of this pre-established score before they completed [the] evaluations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   One week later, on August 30, Sewon fired Jefferson. Jefferson received no written warning or final warning before her dismissal, despite a \"progressive discipline policy\" that uses a system of \"verbal warnings, ... [a] written warning,\" and a \"final warning\" before an employee is terminated. At a later deposition, Horton testified that \"it [was] important to follow that [particular discipline] policy at [Sewon],\" but that the company might depart from the policy in cases of sexual harassment, violence, illegal conduct, or other egregious misconduct. James Dye, a human resources specialist, met with Jefferson after she was fired. He told her that \"[she] didn't pass [her evaluations]\" but that \"[h]e didn't know [why]\" she had failed. Dye later represented Sewon in state-level unemployment proceedings regarding Jefferson's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Proceedings in the District Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Jefferson filed a complaint that Sewon discriminated against her on the basis of race and national origin when it refused to transfer and later fired her and that Sewon fired her in retaliation for her complaint to Horton, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During discovery, Jefferson submitted an affidavit from Dye, the human resources specialist. One paragraph of the affidavit stated that \"Jefferson was terminated because of her complaint of discrimination.\" But Dye's affidavit failed to describe a basis for any personal knowledge of this fact. Indeed, other portions of the affidavit took the contrary position that \"Jefferson was terminated after failing to score high enough on her 60-day evaluation\" and stated that Dye specifically recalled that Jefferson fell \"just short of the minimum requirement.\" Dye's affidavit also asserted that Sewon subjected \"American employees\" to stricter discipline than \"Korean employees,\" but it again failed to offer specific examples of this disparity or to explain how Dye formed this knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sewon moved for summary judgment and objected to the paragraph of Dye's declaration that alleged retaliation. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that granted the objection to this paragraph on the ground that a declaration must be based on \"a witness's personal knowledge\" and that \"no portion of\n   the declaration establishe[d] the foundation for Dye's opinion.\" The magistrate judge then recommended granting summary judgment in favor of Sewon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of Sewon. With respect to Jefferson's claim that Sewon refused to transfer her for discriminatory reasons, the district court reasoned that Jefferson failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she did not suffer an \"adverse employment action\" when Sewon refused to transfer her to the information technology department. In the alternative, the district court ruled that Jefferson failed to establish that the job qualifications for the information-technology position cited by Sewon were pretextual. With respect to Jefferson's claim that Sewon fired her for discriminatory reasons, the district court concluded that the termination was not discriminatory \"under a holistic view of the evidence.\" Finally, it determined that Jefferson could not establish that Sewon fired her in retaliation for her complaint: it approved the exclusion of Dye's allegation, ruled that Jefferson's complaint was not \"protected conduct,\" and ruled that Jefferson failed to establish that retaliation was the but-for cause of her termination because she \"failed to rebut Sewon's proffered reasons for her termination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We divide our discussion in four parts.

Second, we explain that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment against Jefferson's claim that Sewon refused to transfer her for discriminatory reasons. Third, we explain that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment against Jefferson's claim of retaliatory termination.

For example, her response in opposition to summary judgment presented her allegation of discrimination using the test for circumstantial established in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   , even though she asserted in the same filing that a plaintiff can establish a separate claim for\n   <em>\n    retaliation\n   </em>\n   \"through either\n   <em>\n    direct evidence\n   </em>\n   or circumstantial evidence.\" Only in her objection to the report and recommendation did she dispute the \"fixed formula or framework\" of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   . But, even then, she presented her facts as \"a convincing mosaic of\n   <em>\n    circumstantial\n   </em>\n   evidence\" and insisted that the district court should not distinguish between \"direct or indirect\" evidence. On appeal, she advanced a similar theory about circumstantial evidence. For example, she explained that \"evidence should [not] be treated differently from other evidence because it can be labeled direct or indirect\" and that this Court should weigh \"the totality of the evidence\" as \"\n   <em>\n    circumstantial\n   </em>\n   evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the discriminatory intent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Despite Jefferson's failure to appreciate the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, we must reverse this legal error.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4) demands that an affidavit \"be made on personal knowledge.\" And the district court determined that Dye's affidavit did \"not provide any facts from which to conclude that Dye had personal knowledge about the reasons for her termination.\" Jefferson offered no evidence that Dye controlled or participated in the termination decision, and we have explained that statements of \"non-decisionmakers\" ordinarily are inadmissible unless the record \"reflect[s] some kind of participation [by the affiant] in the employment decision or policy of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048634\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/1196/#p1203\">\n    731 F.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, Horton's uncontradicted testimony established that Dye learned of the reasons for the termination \"[a]fter the fact,\" and Jefferson even testified that Dye told her that \"[h]e didn't know [why]\" she failed her evaluations. Dye also failed to identify any other basis for his assertion, and \"[t]his [C]ourt has consistently held that conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have\n   no probative value.\"\n   <em>\n    Leigh v.

In short, the exclusion of Dye's allegation did not involve \"a clear error of judgment\" or \"appli[cation] [of] an incorrect legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Furcron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174455\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/1295/#p1304\">\n    843 F.3d at 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Jefferson responds that, because Dye was a human resources specialist who handled Jefferson's state-level unemployment proceedings, he presumably would have had insight into why Jefferson was fired, but the scant facts in Dye's affidavit entitled the district court to reject this presumption. Dye failed to identify the source of his information or explain what facts led him to make this accusation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   2. The District Court Erred when It Determined that Jefferson's Complaint Was Not Protected Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The district court reasoned that Jefferson's complaint about Jung's alleged statement was not \"protected activity\" because Jefferson could not have \"reasonabl[y] believe[d] that Sewon engaged in [discrimination],\" but we disagree. A complaint about discrimination is protected if the plaintiff could \"reasonably form a good faith belief that the alleged discrimination existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720045\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/861/#p869\">\n    175 F.3d at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court reasoned that Jefferson's grievance was baseless because \"she was [not] qualified for the [new] position\" and because \"the denial of that position [did not] constitute[ ] an adverse action,\" but an employee need not be correct in her beliefs or consult a lawyer for expert analysis of her complaint-she need only \"reasonably form a good faith belief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Chung's report that Jung stated an intent to hire a Korean could have reasonably led Jefferson to conclude that racial discrimination was at play. Indeed, we explained in\n   <em>\n    Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , that an employee was entitled to complain when \"her manager told her that the [desired] position would not be filled by a black person.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191756\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1453/#p1455\">\n    141 F.3d 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1455 (11th Cir. 1998). Jefferson had a reasonable basis for her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3. The District Court Erred when It Ruled that Jefferson Failed To Produce Sufficient Evidence that Sewon's Reasons for Terminating Her Were a Pretext for Retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Sewon asserts that it fired Jefferson because she received failing scores on a pair of employment evaluations, and it contends Jefferson has offered no evidence to undercut this neutral rationale. It points out that these evaluations were tied to Jefferson's probationary status, that Jefferson knew she was \"subject to termination at any time during this [period],\" and that Jefferson has not produced evidence that other employees kept their jobs after receiving failing scores. And Sewon highlights that Horton testified that neither evaluator knew what number constituted a passing score, so neither evaluator could have intentionally issued a failing report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the above explanation and supporting evidence support Sewon's assertion that it had a non-retaliatory basis for firing Jefferson, we agree with Jefferson that a reasonable jury could nevertheless find that Sewon's explanation was pretextual and that Jefferson's complaint was the \"but-for cause\" of her termination.\n   <em>\n    Trask\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054730\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1179/#p1193\">\n    822 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). First, there is the suspicious timing of the termination, which closely followed Jefferson's complaint of racial and national origin discrimination to the human resources manager. On August 23, Jefferson reported Jung's alleged remark that he wanted\n   to fill the open position with a Korean. Kim filled out an evaluation of Jefferson on the same day, and Sewon fired Jefferson exactly one week later. We have cautioned that \"mere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close\" to suggest causation.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Cooper Lighting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3167839\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/1361/#p1364\">\n    506 F.3d 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3167839\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/1361/#p1364\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough.\"). But we have explained that an employee's termination within days-or at the most within two weeks-of his protected activity can be circumstantial evidence of a causal connection between the two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurlbert v. St. Mary\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    s Health Care Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31263\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1286/#p1298\">\n    439 F.3d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1298 (11th Cir. 2006) (explaining that the \"close temporal proximity between [the plaintiff's] request for leave [under the Family and Medical Leave Act] and his termination-no more than two weeks, under the broadest reading of the facts-is evidence of pretext, though probably insufficient to establish pretext by itself.\"). Here, Jefferson's termination occurred only one week after she complained about discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Jefferson also offered evidence supporting her allegation of pretext. Kim, who was Jefferson's immediate supervisor, testified that she had never \"filled out this type of [evaluation] for anyone else\" or \"reprimanded anyone else for\" the same kinds of issues cited in her evaluation of Jefferson. And Kim's evaluation also stated that Jefferson was \"work[ing] well and complet[ing] her tasks in a timely manner.\" Sewon also failed to follow its \"progressive discipline policy\" that affords employees several warnings, including a \"written warning\" and \"final warning,\" before termination. In short, and taking all the circumstances together, the question whether Sewon fired Jefferson to retaliate for her complaint about perceived racial discrimination, is a question for a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    D. The District Court Committed No Error when It Granted Summary Judgment Against Jefferson's Claim of Discriminatory Termination.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Jefferson also contends that Sewon terminated her for racially discriminatory reasons, but she offers no substantial evidence in support of this allegation. Instead, she reasons that when her managers gave her low evaluation scores for \"going outside the chain of command,\" they were actually punishing her for failing to conform to \"Korean culture\" because \"the chain of command\" is inherent to \"Korean cultural norms.\" Jefferson also points out that a portion of Dye's affidavit that the magistrate judge left intact alleged \"that non-Koreans were targeted for reprimands and harsher discipline than Korean employees.\" She concludes that this evidence supports both a claim of disparate treatment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), and disparate impact,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31263\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1286/#p1298\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We reject Jefferson's reasoning. With respect to the allegation that Sewon subjected Jefferson to disparate treatment when it insisted that she follow the \"chain of command,\" we have explained \"that an employer's neutral policy\" that has \"adverse consequences, without more, is not sufficient to state a claim for disparate treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v.

We see nothing inherently discriminatory about a policy that requires employees to respect corporate hierarchy, and we are not in the business of determining, without more, whether facially legitimate company practices are subtly linked to ethnic or racial groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Jefferson also contends that Sewon enforced this policy against non-Koreans in a discriminatory manner, and she points out that Dye's affidavit alleges that unspecified \"American employees\" were subject to stricter discipline than unspecified \"Korean employees\" at unspecified times. But Dye's affidavit says nothing about the particular policy at issue-the \"chain of command.\" And even if it did, the vagueness of his accusations prevents them from establishing that Korean employees received lesser discipline for \"\n   <em>\n    nearly identical\n   </em>\n   \" behavior.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v.
