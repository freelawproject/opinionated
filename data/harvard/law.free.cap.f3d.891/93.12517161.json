For the following reasons, we will affirm the convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Relevant to Both Foster and Payton\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The events leading to prosecution began on February 5, 2015, when Joseph Turchen, an employee of a barbershop in the Branmar Plaza shopping center in Wilmington, Delaware, observed what he perceived as troubling behavior by occupants of a silver Honda Accord in the shopping center parking lot. Turchen watched the Accord's two occupants for approximately twenty minutes. He testified that the man in the passenger seat had a full beard and wore a hoodie, skull cap, and dark glasses and that the man in the driver's seat was wearing a hoodie and a red or pink scarf over his face the whole twenty minutes he was sitting in the car. Turchen found the occupants' behavior suspicious because they were repeatedly looking around the strip of stores in Branmar Plaza, including the barbershop, a bank, and a jewelry store, and because he thought one of the occupant's movements indicated \"he was pumping himself up to do something.\" (App. at 547.) Turchen also testified that the car's occupants were \"dressed like they was going to go do something.\" (App. at 543.) He could not identify the car's occupants; he could only tell that they were two black males, one with lighter skin. His suspicions resulted in another barbershop employee calling 911 to report the suspicious behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Delaware State Troopers arrived, Turchen saw the Accord's occupants look towards the police cars, which were at the opposite side of the parking lot. The Accord then promptly left the lot. Before the car pulled away, the barbershop's owner, Joseph Strano, got into his truck, followed the Accord, and took a picture of it and its license plate. He provided that picture to Trooper Natalie George, one of the troopers who had responded to the 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Trooper George ran the Accord's license plate number through a police database and discovered that the car had been reported stolen in an armed robbery. She then sent an e-mail to other troopers alerting them of that fact and attaching the picture of the Accord, which revealed a\n   distinct bumper sticker on the rear of the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Trooper William Yeldell was one of the police officers who received George's e-mail. He patrolled the area around Branmar Plaza on a daily basis and the e-mail prompted him to pay particular attention to Branmar Plaza the following morning, February 6, to see if the Accord would return. It did, and he got a clear look at its occupants, but only when he passed right in front of it, dressed in full uniform in an unmarked police car. At that point, he made direct eye contact with those individuals. He saw that the one in the passenger seat was wearing glasses, a red or pink scarf, and a white button-up shirt, and that the one in the driver's seat was a black male with facial hair and a black jacket over a purple shirt. At trial, Yeldell identified the man in the passenger seat as Foster and the man in the driver's seat as Payton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After passing in front of the Accord, Yeldell communicated with other state troopers over the radio that he would need assistance making a vehicle stop. He left the parking lot to meet with the troopers responding to his radio call and to put himself in a better position to make a safe stop. In doing so, he lost sight of the Accord for less than a minute. When the troopers returned to the parking lot, Yeldell noticed one of the men he had seen was now standing outside of the Accord. The second man was no longer in or near the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Foster-Specific Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Yeldell knew, with what he described as 100% certainty, that the man outside of the car was the same one he had observed in the Accord's passenger seat. He testified that he recognized the white button-up shirt and the \"light red or pink colored scarf.\" (App. at 621.) That individual turned out to be Foster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After noticing that Foster was holding an object in his hand, Yeldell pulled out his gun and ordered him to the ground. Foster ran instead. He passed another trooper, who shot him with a Taser. As he fell to the ground, \"a hand gun went flying through the air.\" (App. at 623.) The troopers attempted to subdue Foster, and, after a struggle, he was tased a second time. The officers then placed him in handcuffs and recovered a loaded .380 caliber black Smith &amp; Wesson semi-automatic pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Payton-Specific Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While Yeldell and other officers were detaining Foster, Trooper Daniel McColgan responded to a radio call regarding the Accord's missing second occupant. He began a search of the mixed commercial and residential area around Branmar Plaza to locate the suspect, reported only as a black male. McColgan had also received and read George's e-mail from the previous day, which noted that two potentially \"armed and dangerous\" black men were observed in a stolen Honda Accord at Branmar Plaza. (App. at 301.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At around 10 o'clock in the morning, and within approximately six minutes of receiving the alert about the missing suspect,\n   McColgan saw a black man, later identified as Payton, walking along a road from the direction of Branmar Plaza and about two-tenths of a mile from the shopping center. He observed Payton holding a soda and wearing a white skull cap, a dark jacket, and jeans. Payton was walking \"calmly down the street[.]\" (App. at 235.) McColgan, who was in an unmarked SUV but dressed in full uniform, drove by him and they \"basically both nodded at each other.\" (App. at 208.) The trooper did not stop because he wanted to \"see what kind of reaction\" he would get from Payton by driving by and did not want to approach a potentially armed suspect alone. (App. at 209.) He continued to monitor Payton for a little over four minutes. As he did so, he radioed to ask if \"anybody [had] a better description ... to work with\" because, at that time, he knew simply that he was looking for a black male who had fled on foot. (App. at 210-11.) Payton was the only pedestrian he had seen in the search area matching the generic description relayed over the radio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   McColgan testified that Payton was \"just lackadaisical walking down the street\" and that it didn't \"seem like he[ ] [was] going any place in particular.\" (App. at 214.) He did not observe Payton approach any stores or any other people. Payton continued to walk beside the road at the same calm pace. As McColgan watched Payton and maintained radio contact with other officers who had arrived to assist him, he told his fellow officers to continue searching the area \"in case this person was not the person we believe was involved in this.\" (App. at 221.) None of the officers, however, reported seeing any pedestrians matching the general description of the suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Eventually, McColgan and his colleagues decided to stop Payton. When they were in position to do so, McColgan used his loudspeaker to tell Payton to put his hands on his head. Payton promptly complied. The officers handcuffed Payton, patted him down, and placed him in the back of McColgan's SUV. Payton did not have any weapons with him. McColgan questioned him and learned that Payton did not have identification, that he reported coming from the \"market up the street,\" and that he was from Philadelphia. (App. at 227-28.) What little identifying information Payton chose to provide turned out to be false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   McColgan had fourteen years of experience patrolling the area around Branmar Plaza. He acknowledged that he was not familiar with all of the people who lived in that area and that it was possible that Payton could have been a resident of one of the developments nearby. McColgan explained, however, that it was rare for pedestrians to be walking on the side of the road where he saw Payton. It was a 40 mile-per-hour road with no sidewalks at the location where Payton was stopped. McColgan said that, in his experience, only two pedestrians walked with any frequency along that stretch-both white special needs adults. He further testified that Payton was \"new to the area\" and seemed to have \"no rhyme or reason [for] where he was going[.]\" (App. at 225.) At the time McColgan stopped Payton, he did not have a specific physical description of the missing suspect or of the clothes the suspect was wearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After placing Payton in the back of his SUV, McColgan drove him back to Branmar Plaza for identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Search of the Accord\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following Foster's and Payton's apprehension, the stolen Accord was transported\n   to the state police's \"Evidence Detection Unit.\" (App. at 630.) A search of the car revealed a loaded Hi-Point .9mm rifle, with a scope, inside a carrying case on the back seat, along with multiple rolls of duct tape, a pair of gloves, and a large drawstring bag. Trial testimony later established that the Accord was stolen in December 2014 and that it did not contain the rifle, rolls of duct tape, or gloves when it was stolen. No DNA or fingerprint evidence connected Foster or Payton to the items found in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Relevant Pre-Trial Evidentiary Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants filed several motions in limine, challenging the admissibility of certain evidence and testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two pre-trial rulings in particular are relevant on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, Payton sought to exclude evidence stemming from what he argues was his unconstitutional stop and detention. He asserted that McColgan did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him when he was walking calmly down the road. The government responded that the totality of the circumstances provided reasonable suspicion for the stop. The District Court concluded that McColgan had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop Payton, and thus did not exclude any evidence on that ground. The Court explained that the totality of the circumstances provided reasonable suspicion, despite the vague description of the missing suspect. More specifically, the Court highlighted that McColgan knew that a potentially dangerous suspect had very recently fled on foot, that he saw Payton within a defined search area in which no other individuals matched the broad description of the suspect, that Payton was stopped in close geographic proximity to the last location the suspect was observed, and that McColgan knew from experience that it was unusual to see an unknown pedestrian walking in the area where he spotted Payton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Foster and Payton both sought to exclude the barbershop employees' testimony concerning the events of February 5, arguing that it was impermissible propensity evidence, not relevant to the jury's consideration of the crime charged, and unduly prejudicial. The government responded that the testimony constituted evidence of motive, properly admissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). The government argued that the testimony allowed it to \"provide a motive for Defendants' gun possession\" by demonstrating that they were preparing to commit an armed robbery. (App. at 34.) The District Court agreed with the government and allowed the testimony to show motive. The Court further reasoned that any prejudice to the defendants did not outweigh the testimony's probative value, which was relevant to material facts (i.e., gun possession) that the government had to prove to obtain convictions on the crimes charged. The government was thus able to use the barbershop employees' testimony at trial to support its theory of the case, arguing to the jury that the \"case [was] about two days in a row, two men, two guns, and a plot to commit a robbery.\" (App. at 505.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Convictions and Sentencing Enhancements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Foster and Payton proceeded to a jury trial and were each convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Payton challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n   underlying his conviction. Both men challenge their resulting sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Payton argues that the District Court erred by applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\") \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). That section provides for a sentencing enhancement when a defendant uses a firearm in relation to another felony offense. The enhancement was triggered by the District Court's determination that Payton was involved in a conspiracy with Foster to commit robbery on the day he was arrested. Payton timely objected, arguing that the evidence at trial was insufficient for the government to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was involved in any such conspiracy. The Court rejected Payton's argument and determined that the government had satisfactorily shown use of the firearm at issue \"in connection with another felony offense, namely; conspiracy to commit a robbery[.]\" (App. at 1088.) The Court explained, \"I heard the evidence at trial. I think there is no reasonable conclusion from the evidence other than the two defendants were casing the business in the Branmar Shopping Center with the intent to rob it.\" (App. at 1088.) Payton was sentenced to 37 months of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Foster contends that the District Court erred by applying the enhancement contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) to increase his advisory guidelines range from 63-78 months to 210-262 months. Section 2K2.1(c)(1) provides for a sentencing enhancement if a defendant used the same gun associated with the offense of conviction in connection with another offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1). The District Court applied that enhancement because Foster's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") concluded that he had used the same pistol recovered during his Delaware arrest to commit a string of robberies and a carjacking in Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Foster did not object to that enhancement during his sentencing proceedings, and he was sentenced to 120 months of incarceration, the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Five issues are presented on appeal. First, Payton contends that the District Court erred by concluding that McColgan had reasonable suspicion to stop and question him. Second, both Foster and Payton challenge the Court's evidentiary ruling allowing the government to introduce the barbershop employees' testimony concerning the events of February 5. Third, Payton argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for constructive possession of a firearm. Fourth, Payton asserts that the District Court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) to enhance his sentence. Finally, Foster argues that the District Court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) to enhance his sentence. None of those challenges warrants changing the results of the trial or sentencing proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. There Was Reasonable Suspicion to Stop Payton.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Payton argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress\n   evidence discovered as a result of McColgan's detaining him. He argues that McColgan did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him because the only identifying information available before the seizure was that a black male had fled the Branmar Plaza parking lot. Although Payton is correct that that was the only identifying information, it was not the only relevant information known to McColgan at the time he made the stop. We agree with the District Court that the totality of the circumstances known to McColgan, combined with his experience as a law enforcement officer, provided him with reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop Payton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A law enforcement officer \"may constitutionally conduct a brief, investigatory stop and frisk ... if he has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On February 5, an e-mail was sent to Delaware State Troopers referencing two potentially \"armed and dangerous\" black men in a stolen Honda Accord at Branmar Plaza. (App. at 301.) The following morning, February 6, Yeldell observed two black men in the same car and at the same location. When he and other troopers approached the car, there was only one man, Foster, next to it. After detaining Foster and discovering that he was armed, Yeldell radioed to other police officers that the second\n   suspect was at large. The radio message did not provide any precise description of the suspect, such as defining physical traits or clothing. By way of physical description, the officers receiving the radio alert knew only that they were looking for a potentially armed black male leaving on foot from Branmar Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Payton thus frames the issue at hand as a police officer pulling over the first black man he saw after hearing a report that a black suspect was at large. If viewed in isolation, we agree that so general a description could not support reasonable suspicion.

McColgan received the radio call from Branmar Plaza and quickly worked to coordinate a search perimeter with other law enforcement officers. Within approximately six minutes of receiving the alert, he observed a black male, Payton, walking along a road and coming from the direction of Branmar Plaza. Payton was walking calmly with a soda in his hand. McColgan followed Payton for approximately four minutes and observed him walk a short distance beyond the commercial establishments towards a stretch of road with only residences. At the time McColgan made the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, no law enforcement officer had observed any other pedestrians in the defined search area matching the suspect's description. The suppression hearing established that McColgan was familiar with the area, that McColgan did not recognize Payton as being from the area, that it was rare for individuals to be walking along the stretch of road where Payton was walking, that it was a relatively high-speed road with no sidewalk at that point, and that the two people McColgan did see from time to time walking along that stretch of road were two white adults with special needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[R]elevant circumstances\" like those known to McColgan can overcome a \"vague and imprecise description[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089250\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/552/#p559\">\n    450 F.3d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But we do not ignore context. McColgan knew that a potentially armed suspect had just fled from a nearby stolen vehicle. The trooper observed Payton within a defined search area set up to locate the missing suspect. He saw Payton very soon after the suspect was reported missing and within two-tenths of a mile of the stolen car. After locating Payton within close geographic and temporal proximity of the last sighting of the suspect, McColgan confirmed with other officers that no other pedestrian matching the description, generic as it was, had been observed in the search area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On top of the facts he learned that day, McColgan's fourteen years of experience patrolling the area around Branmar Plaza must be accounted for when weighing whether it was reasonable for him to view Payton's presence as suspicious. Deference is owed McColgan's knowledge that it was rare to see anybody other than two white special needs adults walking along the stretch of road where Payton was stopped. Although an untrained person not familiar with the area might have viewed Payton's behavior as unremarkable, McColgan's experience gave him reason to think otherwise. When he ultimately stopped Payton, he was acting on more than an inchoate hunch of criminal activity premised on an individual matching a generic description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The geographic and temporal proximity of Payton to the stolen car and the lack of any other suspect matching the general description of the suspect, along with McColgan's long experience and familiarity with the area, combine to show there was indeed constitutionally sufficient, reasonable, and articulable suspicion to stop Payton, even if the stop did occur mid-morning in a relatively crime-free area.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the Court explained, testimony concerning the events of February 5, viewed with other evidence in the case, showed that (i) two black males in a silver Honda Accord were \"scoping out\" Branmar Plaza on February 5; (ii) the suspicious activity prompted barbershop employees to photograph the car and its license plate and to contact police; (iii) police discovered that the Accord had been stolen; (iv) Trooper Yeldell later observed the same stolen Accord in the same parking lot \"with two black male occupants who appeared to be feverishly looking about the shopping center\"; (v) law enforcement then found Foster outside of the Accord with a gun on his person; and (vi) a search of the Accord revealed an additional firearm on the back seat. (App. at 35-36 (quotation marks and citations omitted).) No step in that chain of inferences required an impermissible inference about the defendants' propensity to possess firearms. Rather, it helped establish the defendants' motive for possessing firearms on February 6.

That is a stretch, but imaginable. Yet the totality of the evidence was certainly sufficient to allow a jury to reasonably conclude that Foster and Payton were the individuals in the Accord on February 5, and hence the barbershop employees' testimony had relevance to motive.

A barbershop employee observed two suspicious black males in a silver Honda Accord on February 5,\n   whom he perceived to be \"up to no good.\" (App. at 544-45.) The following morning, on February 6, Yeldell observed Payton in the driver's seat of that same car in the Branmar Plaza parking lot, a car that police by then knew was stolen. A subsequent search of the car revealed a gun case containing a rifle in plain view on the back seat. The search also revealed rolls of duct tape, gloves, and a drawstring bag. After Payton saw police arrive at Branmar Plaza, he fled the scene, and after he was stopped, he provided false identification information to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, that evidence demonstrated more than just Payton's proximity to the rifle. The government set forth a plausible motive for Payton to possess the gun-armed robbery-that was supported by the items recovered from the Accord. The evidence also established Payton's evasive conduct, and Yeldell's testimony that he saw Payton in the driver's seat of the Accord further supported a finding that Payton exercised dominion or control over the interior of the Accord,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859730,3574012\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/1081/\">\n    545 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that drivers are \"held to a higher level of accountability for\" contraband found in a car) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, we will not disturb the jury verdict convicting Payton of unlawful possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In making that determination, courts can consider relevant and reliable \"information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial[.]\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3. The District\n   Court applied that enhancement after finding that Payton was conspiring with Foster to rob a store in Branmar Plaza on the morning of February 6, the day of his arrest. For purposes of the enhancement, the Court did not \"think it matter[ed] whether [Payton] was present\" on February 5 (App. at 1083), because it determined that the totality of the circumstances led to \"no reasonable conclusion ... other than the two defendants were casing the business in the Branmar Shopping Center with the intent to rob it,\" (App. at 1088). Moreover, the evidence established by a preponderance that his co-conspirator, Foster, was present on both February 5 and February 6 to case stores in Branmar Plaza. In addition, the Court referred to video surveillance evidence not admitted at trial, but that was properly considered at sentencing, that Foster was also at Branmar Plaza on January 19 casing businesses. Then, on February 6, Payton and Foster were sitting in a stolen car in the same shopping center parking lot, with \"no apparent reason\" for being there and with \"almost nothing with them other than useful tools for a robbery, including the two loaded weapons, the backpack along with the two rolls of duct tape, [and] the gloves[.]\" (App. at 1089.) And, as the Court highlighted, Payton fled the scene on February 6 after \"realiz[ing] the police were there.\" (App. at 1089.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Payton has not pointed to anything in the record disputing the accuracy of the findings described above or to any evidence leaving us \"with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

His argument depends primarily on a line of cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit holding that \"[b]ald, conclusionary statements do not acquire the patina of reliability by mere inclusion in the PSR.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Fifth Circuit has itself stressed that, \"[g]enerally, a PSR bears sufficient indicia of reliability to permit the district court to rely on it at sentencing. ... [T]he defendant has the burden to show that the information relied on in a PSR is inaccurate.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Unlike the cases Foster cites, Foster did not object to the factual statements contained in the relevant PSRs, and the record contains sufficient evidence to support the District Court's determination-by a preponderance of the evidence-that the gun recovered during Foster's arrest in Delaware was the same gun used during robberies and a carjacking he committed in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The PSR stated that the Smith &amp; Wesson .380 caliber semi-automatic pistol gun seized at Branmar Plaza was the same gun as the one Foster used during those earlier crimes. Foster did not object to that conclusion during his sentencing proceedings but on appeal characterizes it as unsupportable. He argues that the PSR in this case relied on the PSR prepared in connection with his Eastern District of Pennsylvania convictions and that that underlying PSR only identifies the gun used in Pennsylvania as being consistent with, rather than the same as, the one recovered in Delaware. Although Foster is correct on that point, the conclusion that the Smith &amp; Wesson recovered in Delaware was the same gun used in the Pennsylvania crimes is supported by at least three categories of direct and circumstantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   First, a relatively short time separated the crimes Foster committed in Pennsylvania, which took place in November and December 2014, from his Delaware arrest in February 2015. It is not unreasonable to conclude that Foster used the same gun over that time period and kept it in his possession to perpetrate future crimes. Second, there is surveillance video from each of the Pennsylvania robberies that allows the conclusion that the gun used in\n   those crimes and the gun recovered in Delaware are the same. Third, although the victims of the robberies could not identify with certainty that the gun recovered in Delaware-and later shown to each of them during the Eastern District of Pennsylvania trial-was the same gun they were confronted with when robbed, they each agreed that the gun looked similar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those facts, coupled with Foster's failure to object to the PSR during his sentencing proceedings before the District Court, lead us to conclude that the District Court did not plainly err by applying \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) to enhance Foster's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
