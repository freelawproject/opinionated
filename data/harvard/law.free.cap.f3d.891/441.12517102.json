We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2010, E.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was a pretrial detainee incarcerated at the Essex County Correctional Facility (\"ECCF\" or \"jail\") in Newark, New Jersey. Shaw was a correctional officer employed at ECCF. Although Shaw had worked at the jail for five years, he had worked in the women's unit only a\n   handful of times. On December 27 and 28, 2010, Shaw was asked to cover the women's unit alone during the overnight shift from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. because the jail was short-staffed due to a snow storm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Shaw arrived for his shift, some of the women including E.S. \"flashed\" him with their buttocks as \"sort of a hazing ritual to the new officer in the unit.\" App. 326. Shaw responded by making sexual comments to E.S., such as asking if he can \"hit that,\" which E.S. understood to be a request to perform sexual acts. App. 327. Shaw also spoke over an intercom connected to the cell that E.S. shared with a cellmate, made explicit sexual advances, and threatened that he was \"going to come in there\" and \"get [her] out of there.\" App. 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly before 3:00 a.m. on December 28, 2010, E.S. awoke to Shaw in her cell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shaw removed E.S.'s pants, \"forced himself on [her],\" App. 332, by \"[p]ressing down\" his hand on her chest so that she was unable to get up, and digitally penetrated her vagina, App. 404. Shaw then removed his own pants and underwear and laid on top of E.S. with the weight of his body. Shaw proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with E.S. who was unable to move and \"felt like [she] couldn't breathe.\" App. 404.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   E.S. did not immediately report the incident, but told a male inmate (via hand signals), her mother and her attorney. The male inmate reported the incident to the jail. When confronted, E.S. formally reported the sexual assault. She was examined by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, and was found to have semen on her cervix. The Government later extracted a DNA mixture. An expert for the Government testified at trial that it was \"approximately 28.9 million times more likely in the African American population\" that E.S. and Shaw were the sources of the mixture, than if E.S. and a \"randomly selected unrelated individual\" were the sources. App. 610. Shaw is African American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government also introduced electronic records of the cell doors at ECCF. The records established that E.S.'s cell door was opened on the night of the incident at 2:43:41 a.m. and closed at 2:50:39 a.m. The computer that opened the door was \"TS 04\" and Shaw was logged into TS 04 at that time. No one else logged into TS 04 during Shaw's overnight shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jail investigators also retrieved surveillance videos. Although there was no video of either E.S.'s cell or the TS 04 work station, the videos did show Shaw going on break and returning to the women's unit slightly before the sexual assault. The surveillance videos refuted Shaw's intimation to investigators that he was on break during the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There was, however, a complication in interpreting the video evidence: the surveillance camera clocks were not synchronized with one another or with the clock associated with the cell door records. To synchronize the time stamps\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   , an ECCF maintenance information technician, Delfin Neves, used \"arithmetic.\" App. 153. Neves calculated the \"difference\" between each surveillance camera clock and the clock for the facility systems. App. 152.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He recorded the results in a chart listing the \"drift\" for each surveillance\n   camera clock. App. 131.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Using Neves' chart, an ECCF investigator, Maria Theodoridis, adjusted the time stamps on the videos showing Shaw leaving and returning from break. After her corrections, the video evidence showed that Shaw left for break at 2:31:06 a.m. and returned at 2:37:46 a.m.-a few minutes before E.S.'s cell door was opened at 2:43:41 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 31, 2010, Shaw gave a statement to investigators at the Essex County prosecutor's office. Shaw denied making sexual advances to E.S., repeatedly and emphatically denied opening her cell door, and repeatedly denied even entering her cell. Shaw told the investigators that he left the women's unit on his break \"at like two thirty, two forty\" for \"about twenty minutes\" and returned \"maybe something about ... three o'clock.\" SA 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Shaw testified consistent with his prior statement. He denied making sexual comments to E.S., denied opening E.S.'s cell door, and denied having sexual intercourse with E.S. Shaw testified that he was on break \"[n]o more than 20 minutes,\" but also agreed that it was more accurate to say that he was \"only gone six or seven minutes.\" App. 764. Shaw also testified that male and female inmates were known to be engaging in sexual intercourse in the ECCF gym.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury convicted Shaw of deprivation of civil rights through aggravated sexual abuse,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and obstruction of justice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court sentenced Shaw to 25 years' incarceration and 5 years' supervised release. This represented a downward variance from the Sentencing Guideline range of life.

In fact, the House Report also purports to define the \"requirement of force\" for Section 2242(1). H. Rep. No. 99-594 at 16. The latter statute, of course, does not contain the element \"using force against th[e] other person.\" Therefore, the \"requirement of force\" defined in the House Report cannot be the element \"using force against th[e] other person\" under Section 2241(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second problem relates to the statutory text. The House Report defines the \"requirement of force\" for Section 2241(a) in three ways. The third is \"the use of a threat of harm sufficient to coerce or compel submission by the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 n.54a.

For the reasons below, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to the text of the jury instructions, Shaw correctly notes that the District Court instructed the jury to consider disparities in power and size as \"factors\" for both a deprivation of civil rights and a deprivation of civil rights through aggravated sexual abuse.

First,\n   the District Court instructed the jury to consider \"the disparity in size between the defendant and [E.S.], and the use of mental coercion\" when determining whether there was unwanted sexual contact. App. 803-04. Second, it instructed the jury to consider \"[t]he disparity in coercive power and size between the defendant and [E.S.] ... when determining whether force was utilized\" for aggravated sexual abuse. App. 808-09. These instructions together could have \"confus[ed] and thereby misle[d]\" the jury into believing that non-consent or coerced consent was equivalent to the use of force.\n   <em>\n    Zehrbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413670,6117654\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1252/\">\n    47 F.3d at 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recently rejected a similar disparities instruction in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, a rational juror could have found that Shaw used actual force when he \"forced himself on [E.S.],\" App. 332, by \"[p]ressing down\" his hand on E.S.'s chest so that she was unable to get up, App. 404, while committing the sexual act of digital penetration, and laid on E.S. with the weight of his body, while having sexual intercourse with her, such that she was unable to move and \"felt like [she] couldn't breathe,\" App. 404. Therefore, Shaw's sufficiency of the evidence claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We now address Shaw's remaining claims: two evidentiary issues and a constitutional speedy trial claim. Each lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In his first evidentiary claim, Shaw challenges a portion of E.S.'s testimony on redirect examination. Specifically, the District Court permitted E.S. to testify on redirect that she is in therapy in connection with the sexual assault. Shaw objected to this testimony, but the District Court overruled the objection on the ground that Shaw opened the door on cross-examination in two ways: (1) by asking E.S. whether she had \"done reasonably well getting [her] life together since this event\" and (2) by asking E.S. whether she had told school students during a presentation that the \"worst\" part of her experience in jail was a fight. App. 369, 375.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We need not determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in allowing E.S. to testify that she is in therapy, as any potential error would be harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Any error in Shaw's case would be harmless \"given the truly overwhelming quantity of legitimate evidence\" against him, including E.S.'s testimony, the DNA evidence, the cell door records, and the surveillance videos, and given that the Government did not mention this testimony in its closing argument.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Arguments raised in such a cursory fashion, without adequate citation to the record and authority, are deemed waived.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kost v. Kozakiewicz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509069\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/176/#p182\">\n     1 F.3d 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 182 (3d Cir. 1993) ; Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A). And regardless, both contentions lack merit. As reference to the letter drafted by E.S., Shaw cites the Presentence Investigation Report. That report contains a victim impact statement requested by the Probation Office in preparation for sentencing. Nothing in the Presentence Report, which is the only record support cited by Shaw, suggests that E.S. prepared this statement or provided it to the Government prior to entry of the jury verdict. With respect to the audio recording, the record establishes that trial counsel initially proposed to play a portion of E.S.'s recorded interview, outside the presence of the jury, to refresh her recollection. However, counsel withdrew the request. As such, neither issue presents a basis for relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
