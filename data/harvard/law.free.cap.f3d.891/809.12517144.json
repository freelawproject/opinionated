The protestors planned in advance to construct an encampment during the rally in violation of university policy. Berkeley administrators became aware of the plan weeks before when protest organizers distributed flyers seeking tents and other camping supplies. Driven by a concern over the health and safety risks that might accompany a long-term encampment, a team of university administrators preemptively developed an operational plan to deal with the protests and asked campus police to be ready to enforce the university's existing no-camping policy. Two days before the rally, university administrators warned students in a campus-wide email that the no-camping policy would be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At noon on November 9, some protestors engaged in a peaceful rally without\n   incident. A few hours later, however, the protestors erected tents. After reading a dispersal order to the protestors, police took the tents down when the protestors refused to do so. Soon, the protestors began setting up more tents in the same area. The police returned wearing riot gear. Many of the protestors formed a human chain to block officers from reaching the tents. Police gave several bullhorn warnings ordering the protestors to take down the tents and disperse, although some protestors could not understand the warnings. When the warnings had no effect, officers then used their hands and batons to move the crowd, gain access to the tents, and maintain a perimeter while dismantling the encampment. Some protestors attempted to grab the officers' batons, shouted, and pushed against them. At least one protestor ended up in the hospital. Following the afternoon's events, university administrators tried to compromise with the protestors, agreeing to round-the-clock protests so long as the protestors did not set up encampments. The protestors rejected the offer, shouting profanities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That evening police made a coordinated effort to take down additional tents protestors had set up. Police again gave bullhorn warnings to take down the tents and disperse, but again some protestors could not understand the warnings. When the protestors continued to block the police, the police again used their hands and batons to access and remove the tents. The police arrested at least thirty-six protestors throughout the day for obstructing the officers and resisting arrest. At least one more protestor ended up in the hospital following the evening's events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequent to the November 9 protests, some of the protestors filed the instant action against university administrators and police officers, alleging the officers used excessive force against them while removing the tents. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. The district court denied summary judgment motions by two University of California Police Department (UCPD) officers as to direct excessive force claims, and by five university administrators and three UCPD officers as to supervisory excessive force claims. In denying the motions, the district court concluded that triable issues of fact existed as to the reasonableness of defendants' actions. Defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the denial of a motion for summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Sjurset v.

Plaintiffs C. Anderson and Crawford assert claims against Officer Lachler, and plaintiffs Uribe and J. Anderson assert claims against Sergeant Tucker. Each plaintiff admits linking arms with other students to block the officers' access to the tents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C. Anderson alleged that Officer Lachler jabbed him in the back with the tip of her baton at least six times at the afternoon protest. C. Anderson did not leave the protest immediately after the alleged incident with Officer Lachler and returned for the evening protest. C. Anderson testified that he received the administration's email warning that tents were not permitted. He also heard dispersal orders and did not leave. He testified that he stayed in the front of the crowd intentionally because \"he could physically withstand the blows.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Crawford alleged that Officer Lachler repeatedly jabbed him with her baton in the torso at the afternoon protest. Crawford left the protest to attend a pre-existing appointment and dinner at a friend's house, and then returned for the evening protest. Crawford did not receive medical attention for any injuries from Officer Lachler. Crawford testified that while he could not hear whether the officer speaking through the bullhorn had given a dispersal order, he \"didn't think that we'd been asked to leave the number of times required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Uribe alleged that Sergeant Tucker pushed and hit him with Sergeant Tucker's baton, including with jab and overhand strikes to Uribe's body and hand. Uribe developed a welt on his hand, which he treated with ice at home. After an interview with a news organization about the events, he returned for the evening protest. Uribe testified that he heard dispersal orders, but never tried or even considered leaving the protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   J. Anderson alleged that Sergeant Tucker caused him to \"tumble to the ground\" when Sergeant Tucker \"knocked back\" another protestor resulting in \"a domino effect.\" He also alleged that Sergeant Tucker hit him \"in the neck and face with [Sergeant Tucker's] baton three times.\" He experienced swelling in his face, but left the student health center without seeing a doctor to meet with friends and returned for the evening protest. J. Anderson testified that he heard dispersal orders and could have left the protest, but\n   chose not to. He responded to police instructions to \"Move, move!\" with \"I'm sorry sir, but I will not.\" He later posted on his blog a photograph from the rally captioned \"[a]n officer gives the dispersal order-though we make him do it our way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We turn to step one of the qualified immunity analysis. To evaluate the nature and quality of the intrusions on plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment interests, we consider the \"type and amount of force inflicted\" against them.\n   <em>\n    Young v. County of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828979\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1156/#p1161\">\n    655 F.3d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (9th Cir. 2011). While baton blows are a type of force capable of causing serious injury,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828979\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1156/#p1161\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828979\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1156/#p1161\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , jabs with a baton are less intrusive than overhand strikes. Defendants' expert opined that officers are trained that tip end jabbing, pushing, shift striking, and chopping are reasonable uses of force when individuals actively resist lawful orders. UCPD's crowd management policy permitted the use of batons \"in a crowd control situation\" \"to move, separate, or disperse people,\" except to strike intentionally a prohibited area, such as the head, unless confronting deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, each plaintiff, except for J. Anderson, alleged that he was hit by a baton in the torso or extremities. C. Anderson and Crawford alleged only jab strikes by Officer Lachler. Uribe alleged jab and overhand strikes by Sergeant Tucker. While J. Anderson did not specify the type of strike Sergeant Tucker allegedly used against him, the portion of the video he points to shows Sergeant Tucker's baton brush across the top of his head. Later in the same video, Sergeant Tucker's baton appears to make contact with J. Anderson's face or head again before Sergeant Tucker falls backward onto the ground. In both cases, the force appears incidental to moving and tousling with the crowd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We may also consider the severity of injuries in evaluating the amount of force used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos v. Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9440715\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/846/#p855\">\n    287 F.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855 (9th Cir. 2002). We may infer from the minor nature of a plaintiff's injuries that the force applied was minimal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. City of Bremerton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949922\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/646/#p652\">\n    268 F.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652 (9th Cir. 2001). While injuries are not a precondition to section 1983 liability, their absence can suggest a lesser degree of force when that force is of the type likely to cause injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9440715\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/846/#p855\">\n    287 F.3d at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

We would generally expect injuries from a forceful use of baton blows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828979\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1156/#p1161\">\n    655 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, none of the plaintiffs suffered injuries from defendants' blows that required medical treatment or kept him from returning to the protest. Thus, we conclude that, even if the force used was of a type that is generally intrusive, the amount of force applied here was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the other side, when evaluating the government's interest, we may consider such factors as \"the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p388\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Five university administrators, Chancellor Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor Breslauer, Vice Chancellor Le Grande, Associate Chancellor Williams, and Associate Vice Chancellor Holmes, and one UCPD police officer, Police Chief Celaya (collectively, the UC administrators) appeal from the denial of summary judgment on supervisory claims by twenty-one plaintiffs.

The UC administrators developed an operational plan for dealing with the protests weeks before they took place. The plan did not specify any particular use of force that would be permitted in enforcing removal of tents that were erected. The plan stated as its goals \"protect[ing] the safety\" of all parties, \"prevent[ing] violence, damage and other criminal activity,\" and \"achieving specific public safety and law enforcements [sic] objectives that arise with only that use of force that is necessary and reasonable.\" It specifically provided that pepper spray should not be used as a first effort to disperse a crowd and tear gas should be used only in extreme circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Chancellor Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor Breslauer, and Police Chief Celaya were in the police chain of command. Each testified he did not direct any police officer to use force, or to use any particular level or type of force in removing the tents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Chancellor Birgeneau was travelling overseas on university business when the protests occurred. He received regular updates on the protests by email. He reaffirmed his support of the university's no-camping policy, telling Executive Vice Chancellor Breslauer that it was \"critical that we do not back down on our no encapment [sic] policy.\" He was aware by the late afternoon that police had used batons at the afternoon protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Executive Vice Chancellor Breslauer observed parts of the afternoon protest but did not see police using batons. He was aware by the late afternoon that police had used batons to access the tents and protestors had been injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Police Chief Celaya was in contact with the police commander in charge, who was responsible for overseeing the operation. Celaya did not witness the afternoon protest. During the evening protest, he was on a balcony fifty yards away. It was dark. Although Celaya could hear an officer using a bullhorn, he could not see individual actions taken by particular officers. After midnight, he reported the day's events to the other UC administrators based in part on information received from the commander in charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Vice Chancellor Le Grande, Associate Chancellor Williams, and Associate Vice Chancellor Holmes were not in the police chain of command and did not have supervisory authority over any police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An official may be liable as a supervisor only if either (1) he or she was\n   personally involved in the constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection exists \"between the supervisor's wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Starr v.

Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as we must, we assume these officials ordered police to remove the tents, acquiesced in the use of batons to effectuate removal of the tents, and learned that batons had been used during the afternoon protest and injuries had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The question, then, is whether these facts show the degree of personal involvement or causal connection required by our precedents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1207\">\n    652 F.3d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that they do not. Plaintiffs' brief does not describe any specific instance of force against those plaintiffs alleging only supervisory claims. Although some submitted affidavits claiming that police officers used force against them, they have not connected the force applied by each officer to the actions of these administrators. Accordingly, they have failed to establish that the three UC administrators in the police chain of command \"set[ ] in motion a series of acts\" that they \"knew or reasonably should have known\" would cause the officers \"to inflict a constitutional injury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1207-08. Without that crucial connection, plaintiffs' argument is nothing more than an attempt to hold the UC administrators liable solely by virtue of their office.

In asking police to remove the tents, the UC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   administrators had no reason to assume that police would use force beyond the bounds of UCPD policy. Their awareness that some protestors had been injured during the afternoon protest hardly shows police exceeded those bounds or that they would during the evening protest. Injuries could be caused by lawful uses of the batons or by others in the crowd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We conclude that Chancellor Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor Breslauer, and Police Chief Celaya did not have sufficient personal involvement in the alleged acts of force. Summary judgment should have been granted by the district court on these claims, and we reverse and remand for the district court to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We next turn to the supervisory force claims against UCPD officers Lieutenant DeCoulode and Sergeant Tucker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs Alvarado-Rosas, Kingkade, Klinger, and Wagaarachchi have not identified any police officer that allegedly used force against them.

She left the front of the crowd after the blows. She had a bruise on her arm and on her abdomen. She was diagnosed with a cracked rib.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff Lynch alleged that at the afternoon protest a named UCPD officer struck him with an overhand baton swing on his right forearm, while acting under the command\n   of Lieutenant DeCoulode.

He returned for the evening protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff Tombolesi alleged that two named UCPD officers jabbed him in his ribcage and chest with their batons, \"perhaps ten times,\" at the afternoon protest. He also alleged that three named UCPD officers hit him \"many more times,\" even after he had fallen over, while acting under the command of Lieutenant DeCoulode and Sergeant Tucker. He was sore and had trouble breathing. He went home for a few hours and returned for the evening protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff Chung alleged that a named UCPD officer jabbed him in his arms and ribcage with the officer's baton, while acting under the command of Lieutenant DeCoulode. At the time, he was recovering from a broken leg and still wearing a walking boot. He went to the emergency room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lieutenant DeCoulode testified that he commanded one of the officers named by plaintiffs Felarca, Mulholland, Lynch, and Tombolesi during the protest. Sergeant Tucker testified he was a supervisor over lower-ranking officers present.

We believe this is a closer call than the direct force claims. Four of the five plaintiffs sought medical treatment for their injuries, and at least one of them alleged experiencing overhand strikes to his arm. None admitted provoking the police. But even assuming, without deciding, that subordinate officers used excessive force against each plaintiff, we conclude that plaintiffs Felarca, Mulholland, Lynch, Tombolesi, and Chung have not met their required burden to show the law was clearly established at the time that the officers' baton strikes violated their constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Sjurset\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060360\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/609/#p614\">\n    810 F.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To decide whether the law was clearly established under the second step, we must first \"defin[e] the law at issue in a concrete, particularized manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Shafer v.

The level of force used here was intermediate, not minimal, and neither plaintiffs nor the other protestors posed a threat to the safety of the officers (or anyone else) that could justify the use of intermediate force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v. County of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828979\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1156/#p1161\">\n    655 F.3d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161-63 (9th Cir. 2011). Yes, plaintiffs were engaged in a mild form of \"active resistance,\" in the sense that they, along with other protestors, locked arms and refused commands to let the officers reach the tents. But the protestors were otherwise peaceful, and the university's interest in overcoming their resistance was insubstantial. There was no urgent need to remove a handful of tents from campus. The tents weren't harming anyone; they weren't even blocking access to campus facilities. The university administrators just wanted to avoid the spectacle of having the tents remain overnight. That desire isn't weighty enough to justify the serious risk of injury posed by striking students with metal batons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nonetheless, the officers are entitled to qualified immunity because the law at the time they acted did not clearly establish the illegality of their conduct. I would rule for the defendants on the direct force claims solely on that basis.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
