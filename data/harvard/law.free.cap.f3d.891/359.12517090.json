All three were found guilty and were sentenced by the court. After carefully considering the several issues raised by the appellants,\n   we affirm the judgments of the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND/PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August 2015, eleven defendants, including the appellants, were charged in a conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine in and around Marshalltown, Iowa. Several of the defendants entered guilty pleas, but the appellants chose to proceed to a jury trial. During the six-day trial, some of the defendants' original co-conspirators cooperated with the government and testified, hoping for more favorable sentencing recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to trial, Perez-Trevino moved to suppress evidence obtained during an August 12, 2015, traffic stop in Oklahoma. Perez-Trevino argued that the vehicle was improperly impounded and the inventory search was unlawful. The motion was heard by the chief magistrate judge, and Chouteau (Oklahoma) Police Officer Thomas Scott Fisher testified at the hearing. The chief magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion be denied. The district court overruled Perez-Trevino's objections, adopted the report and recommendation, and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Castellanos brought a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained from the interception of wire and electronic communications of a cell phone identified as Target Telephone #16, arguing that the application for the wiretap: (1) lacked sufficient specificity to establish probable cause, and (2) failed to sufficiently show the wiretap was necessary as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(c). After argument on the motion without any additional evidence, the chief magistrate judge, finding the affidavit sufficient, issued a report and recommendation that the motion be denied. The district court overruled Castellanos's objections, adopted the report and recommendation, and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the five-day trial, the government witnesses testified about information gleaned during the investigation including evidence obtained from intercepts of several telephones. The cooperating co-conspirators testified about their own participation in the conspiracy and their knowledge of the participation of the three defendants. Following the procedures outlined in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913878\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/573/1040/\">\n    573 F.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1978), the trial court conditionally admitted hearsay evidence from alleged co-conspirators. Much of the testimony referenced Mario Murillo-Mora, a member of the conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, who was connected by evidence to each of the defendants, as well as to other members of the conspiracy. The evidence revealed that the reason the government targeted various electronic devices, including telephone #16, was their connection to communications to and from Murillo-Mora related to the distribution of narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the end of the government's case, the court entertained objections to the co-conspirator hearsay testimony. The court overruled the objections, finding that each of the admitted statements was made by a co-conspirator in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The court denied Perez-Trevino's request for a jury instruction on multiple conspiracies and an instruction regarding a mere buyer/seller relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The jury found Perez-Trevino guilty of conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a substance containing a detectable\n   amount of methamphetamine, which contained more than 50 grams of pure methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. Flores and Castellanos were found guilty of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 846. The district court sentenced Perez-Trevino to 292 months' imprisonment and sentenced Flores and Castellanos to 240 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Perez-Trevino-Search of Automobile and Contents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 12, 2015, Officer Fisher noticed a 2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue with North Dakota license plates traveling north on Highway 69 in Oklahoma. He stopped the vehicle for a taillight violation. As he approached the vehicle, Officer Fisher observed two occupants in the car. Perez-Trevino presented an identification card to Officer Fisher but claimed to be licensed in Texas. Officer Fisher had separate conversations with Perez-Trevino and the passenger. The two gave conflicting stories as to their destination: Perez-Trevino indicating Iowa City and the passenger claiming Marshalltown. Officer Fisher ran Perez-Trevino's identifying information and determined that he did not have a valid license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A license check for the passenger revealed that his license was suspended. Officer Fisher arrested Perez-Trevino for driving without a license. Having been instructed by the chief of police that stopped vehicles are not to be left abandoned on the roadside, Officer Fisher arranged to have the vehicle towed. Before the vehicle was towed, Officer Fisher prepared to do an inventory search of the vehicle in order to log any valuables. Officer Fisher testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Any time we have arrested someone out of a vehicle or we have made contact with somebody where a vehicle-where we have become liable for it because of an action from us, we must impound that vehicle with the two wrecker services we have on rotation and then we have to conduct a thorough vehicle inventory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When Officer Fisher leaned inside the vehicle to begin the inventory, he smelled raw marijuana \"directly over the center console.\" He checked the contents of the center console because, according to his testimony, \"[i]t's a common place, along\n   with the glove box, for valuables or anything somebody is going to store in the vehicle.\" When he lifted the console, he discovered a plastic bag containing a green leafy substance, which was later determined to be marijuana. The inventory search further uncovered various food items and drinks. A one dollar bill containing a clear substance, later determined to be methamphetamine, was found under the passenger seat. Located in the back seat was a large cooler. Upon opening the cooler, Officer Fisher found more food and drinks and a Ziploc bag \"containing a large amount of methamphetamine.\" It was later determined that the bag contained 877 grams of methamphetamine. A list of items found in the search was reported on a \"CHOUTEAU POLICE DEPT. STORED VEHICLE REPORT\" which indicated the vehicle was registered in North Dakota to Marcos and Maria Perez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Chouteau Police Department has a published policy for \"Impoundment of Vehicles\" that provides guidance for impounding and inventorying vehicles. Among the several stated reasons for impounding vehicles are safekeeping of evidence and \"public assistance towing.\" The public assistance towing section specifically requires towing \"[w]hen, following arrest of the owner/operator or for other reasons, the vehicle cannot be left at the scene without substantial risk of theft from or damage to the vehicle or personal property contained therein.\" The policy's inventory procedure provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. It is the duty of all officers, who impound motor vehicles, to perform an inventory of those vehicles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. The purpose of this inventory will be to ensure a proper accounting of all property in or attached to the vehicle in order to protect the officer from liability of assumed damages and/or missing property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. The officer performing the inventory will conduct a thorough and uniform inventory of the vehicle and its compartments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   One of the regulations listed in the policy statement provides that \"[o]fficers should take all necessary precautions when towing a vehicle to properly search and inventory a vehicle. An inventory search is intended to protect the citizen, the officer and the wrecker company from claims of loss and theft.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

We conclude that the Chouteau Police Department towing policy contained sufficiently standardized police procedures for Officer Fisher to inventory the contents of the vehicle and its compartments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We do not decide whether the Chouteau inventory policy provided Officer Fisher with authority to open the cooler.

Furman, a Task Force Officer with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At the time he prepared the affidavit, Officer Furman had over twenty years experience in law enforcement and had been with the DEA for over five years. His experience provided him with knowledge of the language and terminology used by illegal narcotics dealers to disguise their illegal activity. The affidavit informs the court of the facts which led the investigators to Target Telephone #16. For example, Murillo-Mora was known to be operating mostly out of the Marshalltown, Iowa, area and was using multiple telephones to communicate with co-conspirators to facilitate the drug trafficking. Murillo-Mora was identified as using Target Telephone #16 to conduct business with other known co-conspirators using targeted telephones already subject to court-authorized wiretaps. Transcripts of specific conversations involving the facilitation of narcotics deliveries are included in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The affidavit contains more than twenty-five pages, including nineteen separate paragraphs, detailing information known to the Task Force that supported the application to intercept communications from Target Telephone #16. Castellanos contends that because Furman repeatedly used the phrase \"I believe\" to introduce his factual references, the statements are not facts that the magistrate can rely on but are instead mere beliefs, hunches, and speculative opinions. Such hyper-technical parsing of phrasing is inconsistent with the evidence and common sense. While it might have been more appropriate for Officer Furman to have written \"it is my opinion, based on my experience in law enforcement and narcotics investigations,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   rather than \"I believe,\" his choice of words did not negate the factual information he related to the court in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Based on all of the circumstances, we conclude that the district court's grant of authority to intercept communications to and from Target Telephone #16 was the result of a \"practical, common-sense decision\" that there was a \"fair probability that contraband or evidence\" of criminal activity would be found.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504402\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/977/#p984\">\n    690 F.3d at 984-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   , we reiterated that \"[a] conspiracy conviction requires a showing that the alleged individuals joined together to further an agreed-to criminal purpose: here, distribution of cocaine.\" 942 F.2d at 1285 (citations omitted).

Witnesses, who included six co-conspirators, confirmed the existence of a dynamic conspiracy, in which several individuals participated. Perez-Trevino, along with Murillo-Mora and Flores, participated as higher-level suppliers of methamphetamine, supplying some of the same customers. Perez-Trevino was caught several times with substantial amounts of methamphetamine in his possession. Perez-Trevino resided with other co-conspirators, exchanged multiple telephone calls with co-conspirators, including Murillo-Mora and Jessica Ceniceros, and purchased a vehicle from one of the co-conspirators. Perez-Trevino used Ceniceros's garage to store two pounds of methamphetamine. In exchange, Ceniceros kept a quarter of a pound to sell for herself. Vania Guadarrama, a member of the conspiracy who testified at trial, purchased methamphetamine from a source known as El Bote, who also supplied methamphetamine to Perez-Trevino. Guadarrama testified that she purchased methamphetamine from Perez-Trevino. There was also evidence that Perez-Trevino \"fronted\" methamphetamine to Guadarrama and later\n   went to her residence to collect an undischarged debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Substantial evidence supports the jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carper\n   </em>\n   are clearly distinguishable.

Flores-Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Flores challenges the admission of testimony by co-conspirator Frances Gasca. During cross-examination of Gasca, Flores's attorney asked about two letters Gasca sent to Flores while she was in pretrial detention. The government was unaware of the correspondence between Gasca and Flores before the questioning began. While answering the questions regarding her letters to Flores, Gasca attempted to explain that she was responding to communications she had received from Flores. Her explanation was truncated by defense counsel. On redirect, the government's counsel asked Gasca to explain what she wanted to explain during cross-examination. Gasca began, \"I wrote that because he wrote a letter to Daniela Castellanos saying for me to tell everybody that ...,\" at which time Flores's counsel interrupted with an objection for lack of foundation. The court, apparently sensing a failure in the foundation, directed the government to \"break that down a little bit so that we don't have an objection.\" The following redirect ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q.

The testimony informed the jury that Gasca was not a handwriting expert and provided a basis for Gasca's lay belief that the letters were from Flores. The jury then had the information it needed to appropriately weigh the testimony. Even if the admission of the testimony were the result of an abuse of discretion, the error would be harmless considering the mass of evidence supporting Flores's conviction and the lack of any indication that Flores's substantial rights were prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275378\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/830/#p837\">\n    870 F.3d at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Flores\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Flores argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court attributed improper amounts of methamphetamine to him, denied his motion for downward departure, and failed to properly consider his history and character. At sentencing, the court informed the parties that it considered every factor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Based on the evidence at trial, the court calculated that Flores \"should be held accountable for 2,265.9 grams of ice methamphetamine, resulting in a score of 36.\" The court then found obstruction of justice because Flores tried to influence the testimony of a witness and he used a false name and birth certificate in an attempt to confuse law enforcement. This resulted in a two-level upward adjustment\n   to 38. Flores had a criminal history of I. The Guideline range for the offense was 235 to 293 months. The court sentenced Flores to the statutory maximum of 240 months, a sentence near the low end of the Guideline range. In explaining the sentence the court noted Flores's substantial criminal behavior even while under court supervision and his high risk to recidivate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The sentence is within the correctly-calculated Guideline range. Nothing in the record supports a finding that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. The court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Flores to 240 months' incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Castellanos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Castellanos challenges her 240-month sentence on three grounds. She first asserts that the court attributed too much methamphetamine to her. She also contends that the court miscalculated her criminal history score. Finally, she argues that the court erred by failing to apply a two-level decrease to her offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, as a minor participant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   At sentencing the district court heard arguments regarding the evidence relating to the amount of methamphetamine attributable to Castellanos, including evidence that Castellanos had delivered five pounds of methamphetamine on one occasion. The record supports the court's conclusion that Castellanos be held accountable for over 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine (\"ice\"), specifically 4,819.5 grams, putting the base offense level at 38. The record supports the court's decision that Castellanos did not meet her burden of proof for the two-level reduction for minor role in a conspiracy. The court further noted that the calculation of 240 months would be the same even with the reduction. The court also did not err in calculating Castellanos's criminal history score by including two prior felony convictions for driving while barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The statutory maximum of 240 months is well below the Guideline range of 292 to 365 months. Nothing in the record supports a conclusion that the sentence is substantively unreasonable.
