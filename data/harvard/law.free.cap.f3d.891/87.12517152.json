Sorto Bonilla argues that his due process rights were violated because the IJ conducted the proceeding without his counsel. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sorto Bonilla, a native and citizen of El Salvador, first attempted to enter the United States illegally in 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") deemed him inadmissible and he was removed to El Salvador. He returned to the United States shortly thereafter without inspection or permission. In May 2017, Sorto Bonilla was arrested and found to be the subject of a removal order. He expressed a fear of persecution or torture if returned to El Salvador and was referred to a United States Customs and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") asylum officer for an interview to determine whether his fears were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)-(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sorto Bonilla met with an asylum officer on four occasions. The first three meetings ended before the reasonable fear interview began because Sorto Bonilla stated he wanted his attorney present. At the fourth meeting, with his attorney present via telephone, Sorto Bonilla sat for a full reasonable fear interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sorto Bonilla told the asylum officer that he was afraid to return to El Salvador because he had been extorted by a gang there, and gang members attempted to recruit him because they thought he had received money from his family in the United States. Sorto Bonilla said the gang members never physically harmed or threatened him and he did not report these incidents to the police, but he was afraid of being robbed or harmed by gang members on account of his \"political beliefs\"-as an individual returning from the United States-and because he has light skin color. A.R. 47. At the end of the interview, the asylum officer summarized Sorto Bonilla's claim, which he and his attorney confirmed, and Sorto Bonilla's attorney reiterated only that the gang targeted him for money because he came from and has family ties in the United States, and \"because of his color.\" A.R. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The asylum officer issued a negative reasonable fear determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The officer concluded Sorto Bonilla had testified credibly, but the harm he experienced failed to rise to the level of severe physical injury or mental pain, and he thus failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that he would be persecuted or tortured in El Salvador. Sorto Bonilla requested review by an IJ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)-(g), and a hearing was set for June 1, 2017. The notice setting the hearing informed Sorto Bonilla that the \"Immigration Judge may allow you to be represented in this proceeding, at no expense to the Government, by an attorney,\" and that \"[i]f you wish to be so represented, your attorney or representative should appear with you at this hearing.\" A.R. 34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 1, Sorto Bonilla appeared before the IJ. The IJ began the proceedings by stating that Sorto Bonilla was \"present, and he does not have legal consultation today.\" A.R. 22. Sorto Bonilla did not request that the IJ postpone the hearing or contact his attorney. In an affidavit submitted four days after the hearing, Sorto Bonilla declared that he did not request that his attorney be present because he believed his attorney was listening on the phone and his counsel submitted a letter notifying the IJ of counsel's error in not appearing at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The IJ reviewed Sorto Bonilla's reasonable fear interview, and Sorto Bonilla reiterated (1) he \"felt fear\" but was not physically threatened or harmed by gang members who attempted to recruit him or asked him for money, A.R. 25; (2) he did not report the incidents to the El Salvadorian police; and (3) he was afraid to return to El Salvador because he believed the gangs would assume he has money since he would be returning from the United States. He added that \"I have [a] fear of returning, because I don't feel safe in El Salvador.\" A.R. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the record and Sorto Bonilla's statements, the IJ concluded that although Sorto Bonilla had a subjective fear of returning to El Salvador, resistance to gangs and a generalized fear of crime were not grounds for protection because they were not tied to a protected ground. As a result, the IJ concurred with the asylum officer's negative reasonable fear determination and returned Sorto Bonilla's case to DHS for his removal to El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sorto Bonilla petitions for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") and implementing regulations provide for the streamlined removal of an alien who was previously subject to a removal order but illegally returned to the United States.

No counsel, however, could change the fact that Sorto Bonilla had not faced past persecution, and he has provided no facts or case law showing the El Salvadoran society would recognize repatriated El Salvadorians as a particular social\n   group.
