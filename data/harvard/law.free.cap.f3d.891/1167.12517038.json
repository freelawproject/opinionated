(Nike). Throughout these proceedings, Havensight has portrayed its action as a battle between David and Goliath. In reality, however, it is more akin to Don Quixote's tilting at windmills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The action from which this appeal was brought concerns allegedly wrongful conduct by Nike against Havensight (the tortious interference action). The tortious interference action was filed after Havensight's prior action against Nike, alleging infringement upon a soccer brand owned by Havensight (the infringement action), was dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the prior action is not before us on appeal, the two cases are somewhat intertwined. Havensight's infringement action was dismissed with prejudice on November 19, 2014. The following day, Havensight filed the tortious interference action, and six days later filed its Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached to the Amended Complaint was an affidavit purportedly reflecting an interview of a sporting goods retailer who reported that Nike used its market strength to force retailers to purchase its goods, thereby excluding competitors like Havensight. After the tortious interference action was reassigned to the same judge who presided over the infringement action, Nike filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At this juncture, Havensight departed sharply from ordinary procedure, filing multiple motions for default on the basis that Nike's motion to dismiss was untimely. Before the district court could rule on the motions, Havensight filed a writ of execution with the Clerk of the Court, claiming a default judgment in excess of $600 million. Of course, because Nike had timely filed its motion in lieu of an answer, no default judgment was warranted, and the district court ordered the writ of execution stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nike subsequently filed a Motion for Relief Regarding [Havensight's counsel's] Ethical Violations. Undeterred, Havensight moved to recuse the assigned judge from the tortious interference action and from the (dismissed) infringement action. The judge assigned to Havensight's recusal motions denied both. Nike subsequently sought sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( Rule 11 )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to Havensight's false and frivolous filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 18, 2015, the district court granted Nike's motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint without leave to amend, and imposed sanctions under Rule 11 against Havensight's counsel in the form of attorneys' fees and expenses. No separate judgment was entered for this order. The following day, Havensight filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and the Rule 11 sanctions (motion for reconsideration). Included in Havensight's motion was yet another motion to recuse the judge who decided the earlier recusal motions. Although the judge had previously requested that Havensight refrain from filing further recusal motions, Havensight decided to Just Do It. Understandably, the court did not look favorably upon Havensight's audacity, and denied the motion on April 22, 2015, while issuing an order to show cause why additional sanctions should not be imposed under Rule 11 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These sanctions were imposed on March 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court entered a separate order declaring Havensight to be a vexatious litigant, and Nike moved for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to the Rule 11 sanctions imposed in the February 18 order. The district court granted Nike's motion in full in an order entered on September 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Havensight filed its Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2015. In its notice, Havensight referenced only the dismissal of the Amended Complaint and the granting of the Rule 11 sanctions. Havensight now seeks to expand the scope of rulings of its\n   appeal to include the additional sanctions imposed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the vexatious litigant order, the denial of Havensight's motion to strike \"Nike's alleged illegal deposition and felonious entry of a confidential customer communication into the public record,\" and denial of Havensight's Application for Default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Accordingly, Havensight's appeal is dismissed as to the sanctions imposed under \u00a7 1927, the vexatious litigant order, the denial of Havensight's motion to strike and the denial of Havensight's Application for Default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valadez-Lopez v.

Dismissal of the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court did not enter a separate judgment after it dismissed Havensight's Amended Complaint on February 18, 2015. Judgment was therefore deemed entered on July 18, 2015, pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ( Rule 58 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ordinarily, this analysis would resolve the matter-if Havensight filed its notice of appeal after July 18, we would lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Classic Concepts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047340\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1282/#p1284\">\n    716 F.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Havensight filed its notice of appeal on October 15, well after judgment was deemed entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case, however, presents an unusual wrinkle. One day after the district court dismissed the Amended Complaint, Havensight filed a motion for reconsideration. When a party files a motion for reconsideration, the time period to appeal is tolled pending resolution of that motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Hoggett v. Univ. of Phoenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276089\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1105/#p1107\">\n    863 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107-08 (9th Cir. 2017) (\"[I]f a party files one of the motions listed in [ Rule] 4(a)(4)(A), the time to file a notice of appeal is tolled during the motion's pendency....\"). Included within this category of motions is a motion to alter or amend the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276089\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1105/#p1107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1107 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FRAP 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). The title of the pleading does not control this determination. Rather, we \"look to the substance\" of the pleading \"to determine whether it is in substance a motion to alter or amend the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoggett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276089\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1105/#p1107\">\n    863 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the motion \"involves reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits,\" it is properly characterized as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 4(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276089\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1105/#p1107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Havensight styled its pleading as a motion to vacate the judgment and re-open the case, the motion actually sought reconsideration of the district court's decision on the merits as contemplated in Rule 4(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276089\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1105/#p1107\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the difficulty in applying Rule 4(a) in this case stems from the fact that the motion that would ordinarily toll the time for filing the notice of appeal was resolved prior to entry of the underlying judgment. The proceedings evolved along the following timeline:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Dismissal of Amended Complaint-February 18, 2015\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Filing of Motion for Reconsideration-February 19, 2015\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Denial of Motion for Reconsideration-April 22, 2015\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Judgment deemed entered pursuant to Rule 4(a)(7)(A)(ii) -July 18, 2015\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We have not previously addressed this precise scenario. More typically, we are called upon to address the timeliness of an appeal when a pending motion for reconsideration is being relied upon to extend the appeal period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lolli v. County of Orange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048906\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/410/#p414\">\n    351 F.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (9th Cir. 2003). In this case, however, there was no motion for reconsideration pending when\n   the judgment was deemed entered pursuant to Rule 4(a)(7)(A)(ii). But, if Rule 4 is interpreted as tolling the appeal period for the sixty-two days during which the motion for reconsideration was pending, the appeal period would expire on October 18, 2015, after adding the thirty days provided for in Rule 4(a)(1)(A) (providing that the notice of appeal must be filed \"within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from\"), rendering Havensight's October 15 notice of appeal timely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menken v.

The district court denied the motions in minute orders entered on May 15, 2003, and on July 30, 2003, ABF filed notices of appeal for both cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because the court never set forth judgments in a separate document as provided in Rule 58, ABF had 180 days to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although ABF filed its notices of appeal within that 180-day period, the Appellees urged the court to declare ABF's appeal untimely due to ABF's premature filing of a motion to alter or amend the judgments.

We noted that accelerating the appeal period due to the filing of a premature motion to alter or amend the judgments would not be consistent with the considered interplay between Rule 58 and Rule 4, and would lessen the degree of certainty that was the goal of the Advisory Committee when amending the rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n    at 1064-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the district court decided Havensight's motion on April 22, 2015, we are presented with a question not often encountered: when an appellant files a post-judgment motion that is resolved before entry of the underlying judgment, is the time period to file a notice of appeal extended? In\n   <em>\n    ABF\n   </em>\n   , we held that a \"premature post-judgment motion may not accelerate the deadline for appeal before a separate judgment has been entered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972568\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/1061/\">\n    at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We see no principled basis for reaching a different outcome in the converse scenario: when an Appellant seeks to lengthen the period for appeal due to the filing of a premature post-judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although a litigant is not to be penalized for prematurely filing a post-judgment motion, neither should it gain a tactical advantage by doing so. Nor does anything in the text of Rule 4 suggest otherwise. Accordingly, we apply the same rationale we articulated in\n   <em>\n    ABF\n   </em>\n   to conclude that Havensight's premature filing of the post-judgment motion did not extend the otherwise applicable appeal period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court's judgment was deemed entered on July 18, 150 days after its February 18 order dismissing the Amended Complaint. Although Havensight filed a motion for reconsideration on February 19, the motion was resolved on April 22, well before judgment was deemed entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, Havensight had thirty days from the entry of judgment, or until August 17, to file its notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FRAP 4(a)(1)(A). Nevertheless, Havensight failed to file its notice of appeal until October 15, nearly two months later. Havensight's appeal is therefore untimely, and we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction its appeal challenging dismissal of the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Classic Concepts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047340\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1282/#p1284\">\n    716 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1284 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611264\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/13/#p16\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
