We now consider whether forcing someone to withdraw money from an ATM and then stealing the money has a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to support jurisdiction under the Hobbs Act. Concluding that it does, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At around 9:20pm on June 10, 2015, a soon-to-be robbery victim deposited money into his account at a Citibank located on West 32nd Street in Manhattan. A short time later, defendant Floyd Rose asked the victim for directions to a church. James Arberry (Rose's codefendant) approached and said he could help them find the church. As they were walking, Arberry placed a hard object against the victim's back and told him that he was being robbed. Arberry and Rose, however, did not take any money or property from the victim's person. Instead, with Rose waiting on a bench, Arberry and the victim went to the Citibank, where the victim used an ATM to withdraw $900 from his account. Arberry and the victim returned to the bench, where the victim gave Rose the $900. The victim was then released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a hearing on June 24, 2016, Rose pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of Hobbs Act robbery. As Rose concedes on appeal, the district court held a \"thorough\" plea colloquy that \"address[ed] all the required aspects of Rule 11.\" Br. of Appellant at 3. During the hearing, Rose stated that \"[o]n June 10, 2015, [he], with another, took a person's property by force and made them withdraw money from an ATM machine.\" App. 32. The government agreed that that was a sufficient factual basis for the plea and \"proffer[ed] that the withdrawal from the ATM machine was from a bank that does business in interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court accepted the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 4, 2016, Rose, acting\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sent a letter to the district court claiming that his attorney, Robert Soloway, had coerced him into pleading guilty and seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. On August 23, 2016, Rose submitted a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion and affidavit to the same effect. The affidavit asserted in passing that Rose was legally innocent because he did not use\n   \"force or violence\" during the robbery. The district court appointed new counsel for Rose and held an evidentiary hearing at which the sole witness was Rose's original counsel. Soloway testified that he or an associate had met with Rose multiple times, that their relationship was uncontentious, that he thought the government had a \"formidable\" case, and that Rose had instructed him to get the best possible deal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    at 46-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court credited Soloway's testimony, found that Rose had knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty, and denied Rose's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court sentenced Rose to a 60-month term of imprisonment, substantially below his Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. Judgment was entered the following day. This appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, as below, Rose argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. \"[A] defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty after it is accepted, but before sentencing, only if the defendant can show a 'fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R. Crim.

To prevail, Rose must \"establish the existence of (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; (4) and that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to Rose, the victim was not himself engaged in interstate commerce, nor was the victim targeted because of his status as an employee of a firm engaged in interstate commerce. The money belonged to the victim, not Citibank, and thus no assets of a firm engaged in interstate commerce were depleted. Similarly, Rose argues that he was not targeting a firm's assets, but the individual victim's. Accordingly, although Rose concedes that he committed a state-law crime, he contends that did not commit a federal robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We conclude that Rose's robbery falls within the scope of the Hobbs Act because Rose \"targeted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce rather than an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645445\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/717/#p729\">\n    361 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rose did not rob the victim of property on his person. Rose instead targeted the funds held in the victim's account at Citibank. These assets were the property of Citibank at the time that Rose initiated the robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

Accordingly, although the victim withdrew the funds from an ATM and physically handed them to Rose (under implicit threat of violence), the target of the robbery remained the same-Citibank. Indeed, Rose admitted as much in his plea\n   agreement by consenting to pay restitution of the stolen money\n   <em>\n    directly to Citibank\n   </em>\n   , not to the victim.

In\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that where a robber forces someone to withdraw money from an ATM and then steals the money, the robber has not taken anything \"belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of\" a bank for the purposes of the federal bank fraud statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550525\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/1008/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550525\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/1008/\">\n    at 1011-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis omitted)). The court reasoned that the bank no longer had custody over the funds after the withdrawal; thus, when the robber took the $150 that the victim withdrew, he robbed only the victim. The court also reversed the defendant's Hobbs Act conviction, summarily agreeing without discussion that it must fall because the bank robbery conviction fell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   to the extent that it concluded that a forced ATM withdrawal, by itself, cannot support Hobbs Act jurisdiction. The mere fact that the bank did not have \"custody\" over the funds at the precise moment that the robber stole the victim's money (the key question for bank robbery, under the\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   framing) does not mean that the crime lacked a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   effect on interstate commerce (the key question for Hobbs Act robbery). For the reasons set forth above, we find that Rose's robbery had a sufficient impact on interstate commerce to establish Hobbs Act jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rose accordingly has failed to assert his legal innocence, and the district court committed no error by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carreto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756328\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/152/#p157\">\n    583 F.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We have considered Rose's remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit.
