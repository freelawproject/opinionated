Fluker appeals, arguing principally that the district court improperly designated him as a career offender under the 2016\n   <em>\n    United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n   </em>\n   , and that this incorrect designation led to the further error of applying the wrong version of the Guidelines Manual to determine his Guidelines range.

Fluker was sentenced as an armed career criminal under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii). As an armed career criminal, Fluker was subject to a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence, as well as to heightened penalties under the then-mandatory sentencing Guidelines. The district court sentenced Fluker to 340 months' imprisonment on Counts 1 and 3, to run concurrently, and to a mandatory sixty months' imprisonment on Count 2, to run consecutively, yielding a total sentence of 400 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Five years later, the district court modified Fluker's sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) and resentenced him to 327 months' imprisonment on Counts 1 and 3, to run concurrently. The consecutive 60-month sentence on Count 2 remained unchanged, so Fluker's total sentence became 387 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Supreme Court of the United States held in 2015 that the residual clause of the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

We granted Fluker's motion for permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    In re: Eddie Dean Fluker\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-414 (4th Cir. May 5, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted Fluker's \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding that-without the residual clause-Fluker's prior convictions no longer served as ACCA predicates. It vacated Fluker's sentence and directed a probation officer to prepare a revised pre-sentence report (PSR).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although the revised PSR did not apply the ACCA to Fluker's advisory Guidelines calculation, it designated Fluker as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and \u00a7 4B1.2 based on two prior convictions for Georgia robbery. As a result of changes to the Guidelines Manual between Fluker's original sentencing and resentencing, applying the career-offender designation to Fluker's Guidelines calculation resulted in a higher Guidelines range than the one applied to Fluker in his original sentencing hearing. Under these circumstances, the Guidelines direct that the court should use the Manual in effect at the time of the original sentencing to calculate the Guidelines range so as to avoid violating the Ex Post Facto Clause. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peugh v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p533\">\n    569 U.S. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p533\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p533\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (holding that using a higher Guidelines range at sentencing than was authorized for the offense at the time of its commission violates the Ex Post Facto Clause). Under the 1991 Guidelines Manual, Fluker was also subject to the career-offender designation, and his Guidelines range was 210 to 262 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fluker objected to the career-offender designation, arguing that Georgia robbery is not a \"crime of violence\" under the 2016 Guidelines Manual definition. And because Fluker's Guidelines range without application of the career-offender designation would be lower under the 2016 Guidelines Manual than under the 1991 Guidelines\n   Manual, Fluker argued the Court did not need to change editions in order to avoid an Ex Post Facto Clause problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court overruled Fluker's objection and held that Georgia robbery was a crime of violence under the 2016 Guidelines Manual. It noted the absence of any published or unpublished Fourth Circuit opinions on point and relied on an unpublished Eleventh Circuit decision holding that Georgia robbery is a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20Fed.%20Appx.%20901\">\n    689 Fed.Appx. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017). Given the Ex Post Facto concerns, the court used the 1991 Guidelines Manual to calculate Fluker's Guidelines range for resentencing, as required by\n   <em>\n    Peugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p533\">\n    569 U.S. at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p533\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before resentencing Fluker, the district court allowed the Government to call Officer Thomas Caldwell to testify as a victim-witness to Fluker's offense conduct. In so doing, it overruled Fluker's objection that Officer Caldwell could not testify during resentencing because he had not testified during the original sentencing hearing. The district court explained that the Government could call Officer Caldwell given that the proceeding was a full resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the district court sentenced Fluker to 240 months' imprisonment (the statutory maximum) on Count 1, a concurrent sentence of 248 months' imprisonment on Count 3, and the statutorily-mandated 60 months' imprisonment, to run consecutively, on Count 2. This sentence yielded a 308-month term of imprisonment, which essentially equaled Fluker's time served on the Virginia convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the resentencing hearing, however, Fluker was not released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) because soon after he began serving his sentence for the Virginia convictions, he committed additional crimes while in custody. For those offenses, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida sentenced him to 120 months' imprisonment, to be served \"consecutive to the term of imprisonment ... from the Western District of Virginia\" (\"Florida sentence\"). Supp. J.A. 33. After Fluker was resentenced for his Virginia convictions, the BOP recalculated his custody computation, including administrative Good Conduct Time, and determined that on January 6, 2015, Fluker finished serving his Virginia sentence and began serving his Florida sentence. The BOP currently projects that Fluker will be released in September 2023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fluker noted a timely appeal, and this Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Fluker argues the district court committed two errors during resentencing. First, he contends that it procedurally erred in calculating his Guidelines range. In particular, he posits that he is not a career offender under the 2016 Guidelines Manual because his Georgia robbery convictions do not constitute \"crimes of violence.\" He maintains that this initial error resulted in several additional errors related to his Guidelines range, including using the incorrect (1991) edition of the Guidelines Manual. Second, he challenges the district court's decision to allow Officer Caldwell to testify during the resentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government acknowledges that two decisions from this Court issued since the resentencing hearing support Fluker's contention that he was improperly designated as a career offender. And it concedes that if the career-offender designation was improper, then the district court should have used the 2016 Guidelines Manual to calculate\n   Fluker's Guidelines range. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Government contends that the Court should not vacate Fluker's sentence because Fluker's appeal is moot because he is no longer in BOP custody as a result of his Virginia sentence. It further asserts the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Officer Caldwell to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review Fluker's sentence \"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\" looking first to whether the district court committed a \"significant procedural error\" such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under this edition of the Guidelines, Fluker would be a career offender if, among other things, his two Georgia robbery convictions were for a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). In relevant part, a \"crime of violence\" is an offense \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... is ... robbery\" (the enumerated offense clause).

First, the Court identifies the \"generic\" definition of robbery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078881\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/432/#p436\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the Court determines whether Georgia robbery categorically matches generic robbery, meaning that an individual convicted of the state offense necessarily was convicted of the generic offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078881\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/432/#p436\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When Fluker was resentenced, this Court had no case law addressing either of these inquiries. In the intervening months, that's changed. For purposes of the first step, we have now defined \"generic robbery\" as \"the misappropriation of property under circumstances involving immediate danger to the person,\" in which \"the immediate danger element ... is categorically satisfied by the taking of property from a person or a person's presence by means of force or putting in fear.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    United States v.

We are bound to use that definition of generic robbery. Relevant to the second step, we have now held that Georgia robbery does not align with generic robbery because Georgia robbery can be committed \"[b]y sudden snatching,\" and case law has construed that term more\n   broadly than generic robbery\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    .

Because Georgia robbery does not always require this amount of force, it is broader than generic robbery, and therefore is not a crime of violence. The Government acknowledges as much, noting that \"\n   <em>\n    Gattis\n   </em>\n   makes clear that under its definition of generic robbery, some sudden snatching offenses can constitute generic robbery, but some will not.\" Response Br. 40. Georgia robbery is thus broader than generic robbery, and a conviction for Georgia robbery is not \"robbery\" under the enumerated offense provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although the current controlling case law was not available to the district court at the time of sentencing, Fluker's Georgia robbery convictions are not predicates for the career-offender designation under current Fourth Circuit law. And because Fluker's Guidelines range should have been calculated without the career-offender designation, there was no basis for turning to the 1991 Guidelines Manual in order to avoid a non-existent Ex Post Facto Clause problem. The court should have used the 2016 Guidelines Manual to calculate Fluker's Guidelines range. Therefore, Fluker's resulting sentence was the product of cognizable procedural error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Government does not dispute the above analysis or the conclusion that the district court erred, but it contends that Fluker's claim is moot. As support, the Government points to the BOP's determination\n   that Fluker stopped serving his Virginia sentence in January 2015 and is currently serving only his Florida sentence. In the Government's view, Fluker has been released from custody for his Virginia sentence, which renders moot his challenge to the length of that sentence. Further, the Government asserts that Fluker's continued custody on the Florida sentence is entirely unrelated to the length of his Virginia sentence and thus is not a collateral consequence that would allow the Court to exercise jurisdiction. Finally, it contends that the district court's error makes Fluker only\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for a lower sentence and whether Fluker would actually receive a lower sentence that might affect his ultimate release date is pure speculation. We disagree with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The doctrine of mootness \"derives from the requirement of [Article] III of the Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    DeFunis v.

The Florida court's instruction could not be plainer: \"this term shall be consecutive to the term of imprisonment in Dkt. #92-00031-001 from the Western District of Virginia.\" Supp. J.A. 33. The start date for Fluker's Florida sentence was always and remains contingent on when he finishes serving the Virginia sentence. The BOP's adjustment to Fluker's administrative records following the prior resentencing reinforces the direct nexus between the two sentences. In consequence, Fluker continues to have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this appeal. If he prevails, his ultimate\n   release date may once again shift to an earlier date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fluker's interest is not speculative. Certainly, as the Government observes, Fluker has to prevail on appeal, and then persuade the district court to resentence him to a lower term of imprisonment before his ultimate release date is moved forward. But these hurdles do not make his claim moot. They are common to nearly all defendants whose sentences are appealed and then vacated and remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The cases the Government relies on to suggest otherwise are inapposite because they concerned speculative collateral consequences in\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   proceedings as opposed to the normal course of appeal and remand in the case pending then before the court.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

That concept has no application here, where a prisoner is alleging a concrete and already-identifiable effect of a sentencing error that could be rectified by prevailing on appeal and receiving a different sentence on remand. To hold otherwise would moot most sentencing appeals given that a defendant must persuade both the appellate court of an error and then persuade the district court to exercise its discretion to impose a different sentence. But those hurdles are not the sort of speculative impact identified in our case law that would affect the mootness inquiry. For these reasons, Fluker's claim is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In conclusion, Fluker's claim is justiciable. The district court committed procedural error during sentencing by finding that Fluker's Georgia robbery convictions qualified him for the career-offender designation. As a result, the district court also erred in using the 1991 Guidelines Manual to determine Fluker's Guidelines range. Consequently, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent\n   with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fluker raises an additional challenge to the district court's evidentiary decision at resentencing.

Nor does this case fit neatly into the \"collateral consequences\" analysis because those cases presuppose a petitioner's actual release from incarceration and look to other circumstances that might render the case not moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Fluker points out that he may be eligible for immediate release from BOP custody after resentencing. The Government accurately counters that this may not be true because the district court could impose the same sentence by varying or departing upward. It is for the district court to select an appropriate sentence, but it can do so only after properly calculating Fluker's Guidelines range.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    To show that this case is not moot, it is sufficient to rely on the conclusion set out above: the length of the Virginia sentence-whatever it is-affects the Florida sentence's start date and thus the date on which Fluker will ultimately be released from custody. Indeed, as Fluker notes, it is possible he may be immediately released from custody. As noted, his sentence for Count 2 is a statutorily-mandated 60-month term of imprisonment to be served consecutive to any other sentence. As the Government observes in its Response Brief, Fluker's Guidelines range for Counts 1 and 3 could drop to 51 to 63 months as a result of using the 2016 Guidelines Manual non-career-offender provisions. If Fluker were sentenced to a within-Guidelines sentence of 63 months' imprisonment for those counts, his Virginia sentence would be 123 months. Hence, Fluker's total federal sentence (Virginia plus Florida sentences) would be 243 months. But he has already served more than 300 months in BOP custody. This possibility further demonstrates the real and concrete consequences of the Virginia sentence's length on his eventual release date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Fluker challenges a separate aspect of his Guidelines range as well, asserting that the PSR incorrectly contained two criminal history points for having committed his offense while on parole. He did not challenge this issue before the district court, and the two points did not matter in setting Fluker's criminal history category below because the improper career-offender designation automatically set Fluker's criminal history category at VI regardless of any other factors. But whether those points are proper will matter at resentencing. Moreover, the Government concedes that these criminal history points are not supported by the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Based on the record before us and the Government's concession, it was plainly erroneous to include these criminal history points in Fluker's criminal history computation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. McLaurin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183017\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/372/#p387\">\n     764 F.3d 372\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 387-88 (4th Cir. 2014) (stating the Court reviews for plain error a district court's criminal history computations that were not objected to at the time and setting out the standard for plain error).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In view of the potential attendant consequences, we encourage the district court upon remand to expedite the resentencing hearing and entry of the new sentencing order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
