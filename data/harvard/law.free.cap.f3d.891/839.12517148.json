Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with the hotel workers' union, Local 5 of UNITE HERE (\"Local 5\"), Ohana contributed to the Plan for its Hotel employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A private equity group consisting of Heavenly Hana LLC, Green Tree Management, and their parent company Amstar-39 (collectively \"Amstar\") entered into a purchase and sale agreement (\"Agreement\") with Ohana on December 31, 2009, to purchase the Hotel and related assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Amstar had prior experience with multiemployer pension plans. It had previously owned and operated a hotel that participated in a multiemployer pension plan. In prior business transactions, Amstar had also \"instructed its agents to inquire about whether Amstar could incur liability to a multiemployer pension plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Agreement indicates that employees at the Hotel were unionized and that Ohana had previously made contributions to a multiemployer pension plan. Although the Agreement required Ohana to provide Amstar with notice of Plan funding deficiencies, Amstar did not receive any to review. Amstar also secured legal advice prior to closing, which turned out to be incorrect, that \"[a]bsent an express assumption of liability, the Buyer does not assume the [withdrawal] liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A four-person Amstar due diligence team undertook an investigation of the Hotel, which included a review of relevant documents and the condition of the hotel. At the conclusion of Amstar's due diligence, the purchase price fell from $17 million to $14.5 million to account for deferred maintenance costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ten days before the deal closed, Ohana stopped contributing to the Plan, and on closing day Ohana formally withdrew from the Plan. The existence of unfunded vested benefit liabilities on the day of Ohana's withdrawal resulted in withdrawal liability for Ohana under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plan was underfunded for years before Ohana withdrew. In 2008 and 2009, the Plan's administrator, Benefit and Risk Management Services (\"BRMS\"), issued annual funding notices to Ohana indicating that the Plan was underfunded for each plan year since 2006-2007. These funding notices were publicly accessible on BRMS's website and Local 5's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After closing, Amstar continued to use the same buildings, grounds, and equipment to operate the Hotel, which continued to appeal to beach vacationers. Employees' responsibilities largely remained the same under Amstar. A majority of the seventy-seven employees that worked for Amstar, including the general manager, previously worked for Ohana. Accordingly, Amstar recognized Local 5 as the employees' bargaining unit, but developed its own employment terms, including benefit plans, rather than adopting the CBA Ohana had negotiated with Local 5. Amstar also changed the Hotel's name a year after the purchase and began to market to adventure travelers rather than luxury travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plan had knowledge of Ohana's withdrawal, but did not make a formal claim for withdrawal liability against either Ohana or Amstar until after the Agreement had been finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Plan sent its first demand letter to Amstar in December 2012, requesting $757,981 in withdrawal liability paid in a single lump sum or quarterly installments of $74,566. In response to the letter, Amstar made five quarterly payments totaling $372,780 before filing the present lawsuit to contest its responsibility for the withdrawal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After a bench trial on the papers, the district court concluded that Amstar was not responsible for the withdrawal liability. Although sufficient continuity in operation of the hotel existed for Amstar to qualify as Ohana's successor, the district court determined that Amstar was not liable because it lacked \"actual notice\" of the withdrawal liability. In reaching this conclusion, the district court rejected the Plan's proposed \"constructive notice\" standard. However, the district court alternatively noted that even under a \"constructive notice\" standard, Amstar lacked notice because it acted diligently and reasonably under the circumstances and still did not discover the withdrawal liability. Judgment was then entered directing the Plan to return the $372,780 in withdrawal liability payments, plus interest, to Amstar. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Resilient Floor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340904\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/1079/#p1088\">\n    801 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Amstar does not dispute that it qualifies as a successor, and the Plan concedes that Amstar did not have actual notice of withdrawal liability.

Requiring purchasers to make reasonable inquiries into the existence of withdrawal liability advances the congressional interest in preventing underfunding in multiemployer pension plans. Imposing this burden would also have little negative impact on the fluid transfer of corporate assets. Purchasers would simply \"investigat[e] the possible liability and negotiat[e] a purchase price,\" an indemnity provision, or a security bond \"that would take it into account.\"\n   <em>\n    Full Circle Grp.\n   </em>\n   , 826 F.3d at 997 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden State Bottling v.

Here, Amstar's due diligence inquiries as to maintenance costs led to exactly such a negotiated purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In short, put on constructive notice, purchasers can account for withdrawal liability in an asset purchase. Indeed, as the Plan observes, of the three relevant parties to successor withdrawal liability-the seller, the purchaser, and the pension plan-purchasers are in the best position to ensure withdrawal liability is accounted for during an asset sale. Sellers have no incentive to disclose potential liabilities\n   because \"[s]uch liabilities are likely to drive the sale price in one direction only: down.\" Pension plans cannot be asked \"to investigate sale[s] rumors, track down the identity of all potential purchasers, avoid confidentiality or contract interference concerns, and send notice of its (publicly-available) funding status directly to potential purchasers.\" Rather, pension plans are only responsible for \"(1) determin[ing] the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability, (2) notify[ing] the employer of the amount of the withdrawal liability, and (3) collect[ing] the amount of the withdrawal liability from the employer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201382\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Purchasers, in contrast, have the incentive to inquire about potential withdrawal liability in order to avoid unexpected post-transaction liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A constructive notice standard would not create a strict liability standard for asset purchasers, as Amstar contends. Constructive notice would only exist when three conditions are met: (1) the purchaser qualifies as a successor; (2) the relevant pension plan is underfunded; and (3) a purchaser using reasonable care or diligence would have discovered the withdrawal liability. Additionally, successor liability would only be imposed when it is fair to do so. The fairness requirement stems from the fact that \"the origins of successor liability are equitable,\" making \"fairness [ ] a prime consideration in its application.\"\n   <em>\n    Resilient Floor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340904\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/1079/#p1088\">\n    801 F.3d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790299\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/770/#p782\">\n    623 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   782 ). Even when the requirements for constructive notice are met, in certain instances fairness could militate against imposing successor liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, congressional purpose, the liberal remedial construction of the MPPAA adopted in previous cases, the adoption of a constructive notice standard in other contexts, and the practical realities of asset purchases all support a conclusion that constructive notice of withdrawal liability is sufficient to trigger successor withdrawal liability under the MPPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Applying a constructive notice standard in this case leads us to conclude that Amstar had constructive notice because a reasonable purchaser would have discovered Ohana's withdrawal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Amstar previously operated a hotel that participated in a multiemployer pension plan, and, in prior acquisitions involving multiemployer pension plans, Amstar had required its agents to determine whether it could incur withdrawal liability from the transactions. The Agreement plainly informed Amstar that the employees at Ohana were unionized and that Ohana had contributed to a multiemployer pension plan. Finally, the Plan's annual funding notices, which indicated a state of underfunding, were publicly available on the internet. These undisputed facts indicate that Amstar should have determined that, like most withdrawing employers, Ohana would incur withdrawal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Full Circle Grp.\n   </em>\n   , 826 F.3d at 997-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In these circumstances, a reasonable purchaser would have taken additional actions to determine if withdrawal liability existed. As the district court recognized, \"[Amstar] could have [1] reviewed Plan documents publicly available on the internet, [2] asked Ohana to provide all Plan notices rather than rely on Ohana to parse whether the notices revealed unfunded liabilities, or [3] reached out to the Plan directly.\" Amstar also could have required Ohana to [4] request from the Plan \"the estimated amount which would be the amount of such employer's withdrawal liability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201021\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tsareff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287374\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/841/#p845\">\n    794 F.3d at 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the\n   successor employer could have required its predecessor \"to obtain an estimate of [its] withdrawal liability\" (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201021\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l) ) ). Any of these four reasonable actions would have revealed Ohana's withdrawal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ohana's failure to provide Amstar the deficiency notices required by the Agreement, and Ohana's representatives' statements that, \"to their knowledge,\" the pension plan was not underfunded, do not change this conclusion. Allowing a seller's conduct to absolve a purchaser from responsibility for withdrawal liability conflicts with both a liberal construction of the MPPAA and fairness where, as here, a purchaser can undertake simple steps to gain knowledge of the withdrawal liability. Notably, Amstar had a four-person due diligence team undertake various investigations prior to the sale's closing. The team \"hire[d] engineers to ... look at the roofs, look at the termites, look at the condition of all the structural [features] and give estimates on what it will take to fix it.\" As the Plan notes, Amstar did \"not rely on the seller's representation regarding termites,\" but surprisingly did \"rely on the seller's representation over a multimillion-dollar issue like withdrawal liability.\" This reliance is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Amstar's reliance on incorrect legal advice also does not render its conduct reasonable. The letter Amstar received from counsel stated that \"[a]bsent an express assumption of liability, the Buyer does not assume the [withdrawal] liability.\" Even assuming, as the district court did, that it was not \"entirely clear before the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Resilient\n   </em>\n   decision in 2015 that the Ninth Circuit would follow the Seventh Circuit in applying successor liability in the context of MPPAA withdrawal liability,\" the legal advice was still incorrect. Accurate advice would have noted that law on this issue was lacking or unclear. Moreover, the application of successor liability in other ERISA contexts reveals a likelihood that this Court would hold successors liable for withdrawal liability, at least in certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haw. Carpenters Tr. Funds v. Waiola Carpenter Shop, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736372\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/289/#p294\">\n    823 F.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294-95 (9th Cir. 1987). Accordingly, Amstar cannot rely on this incorrect legal advice to justify its actions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jerman v.
