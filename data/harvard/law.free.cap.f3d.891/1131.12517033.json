Brad Hester, a sheriff's sergeant, conducted an after-hours dog search of Richard Pike's locked office. Pike successfully petitioned a state court for an order of protection against Hester. Pike later sued Hester in federal district court, claiming that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. In district court, Pike moved to preclude from relitigation certain issues he said the state court had already decided. The district court granted the motion in part. Pike later moved for offensive summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claim. The district court granted the motion, concluding that Hester's search violated the Fourth Amendment and that Hester was not entitled to qualified immunity because Pike's right to be free from such a search was clearly established. Hester appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We too conclude that Hester violated Pike's clearly established constitutional rights, although we depart from the district court's analysis in some respects. First, we hold that the state justice court's conclusion that Hester violated the Fourth Amendment is precluded from relitigation. Second, because it was clearly established at the time of the search that Hester's conduct violated Pike's rights, Hester is not entitled to qualified immunity. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2011, Hester was a sergeant in the Elko County Sheriff's Office. Pike was the Elko County recreation director and the assistant high school football coach in the Elko County unincorporated town of Jackpot, Nevada. In his role as recreation director, Pike worked out of an office-shared with his assistant-at the Jackpot Recreation Center (the \"Center\") in Jackpot. Pike and Hester did not have a friendly relationship, which Hester attributed to Pike's alleged mistreatment of one of Hester's sons in 2007. Hester and Pike's relationship soured in October 2007, when, Hester alleges, Pike hit Hester's son, a high school football player, during a football game that Pike was coaching. Hester's son was then benched for the second half of the game and suspended for the following game for arguing with Pike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Search of Pike's Office\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August or September 2011, Hester activated the sirens on his patrol car to pull over Lynn Forsberg, the county director of public works and Pike's boss. Hester had a request for Forsberg. Hester told Forsberg that he believed that certain Center employees, including Pike, were \"dealing drugs\" out of the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hester asked Forsberg if he \"would care\" if\n   Hester searched the Center. Forsberg and Hester dispute how Forsberg responded. Forsberg says he told Hester that \"if he wanted to search the recreation center, he could call me, I would come up and let him in.\" Hester says that Forsberg gave him unconditional permission to search the Center \" '[a]nytime, day or night.' \" Hester also told Forsberg that he already had a key to the Center, which prompted Forsberg to change the Center's locks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Soon thereafter, and without further talking to Forsberg, Hester led a nighttime search of the Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hester, who was off duty and in plainclothes, was accompanied by Deputy Sean Munson, K-9 Deputy Mike Moore, and Moore's drug dog. Hester used his key to unlock the Center. The dog searched the entire building in about ten minutes. As part of the search, Hester unlocked the door to Pike's office and entered with Moore and the dog. The dog did not alert to drugs anywhere in the office. The officers did not open any drawers or touch any items in the office. Hester asked Moore to have the dog sniff a file cabinet outside Pike's office a second time because the dog had scratched it on the first pass, but the dog did not alert on the second pass. The officers did not take any notes during the search and did not file a report afterward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The animosity between Pike and Hester escalated. Pike learned of the search a few weeks later and filed a grievance with the sheriff's office. Some time after the search, Hester met with the high school athletic director, Kim Smith, to complain about Pike's conduct as a football coach. Hester also told Smith that Pike was \"one of the biggest potheads in town.\" When Pike learned about that conversation, he asked Smith to write a letter documenting her meeting with Hester. Pike then complained to a sheriff's office lieutenant a second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2012, after an internal affairs investigation, the sheriff's office suspended Hester without pay for 30 hours because the search of Pike's office was \"conduct unbecoming\" an officer. The letter informing Hester of the discipline did not mention the Smith meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Justice Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 15, 2011, Pike petitioned the Elko County Justice Court for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") because, he alleged, Hester was stalking him in violation of state law. Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 200.575(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A person who, without lawful authority, willfully or maliciously engages in a course of conduct that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a family or household member, and that actually causes the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a family or household member, commits the crime of stalking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Among the bases for Pike's TRO petition was Hester's search of Pike's office. Pike also claimed that after he had filed the second grievance, Hester \"repeatedly drove by [Pike's] residence and/or stopped and stared at him.\" Without holding a hearing, the justice court issued a TRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pike then applied for a two-month extension of the protective order. The justice court held a hearing on December 12, 2011, at which Pike, Hester, Forsberg, and other witnesses testified. The court extended the protective order and explained its decision in an addendum. It was not\n   disputed that Pike actually felt intimidated by Hester; thus, the court explained, \"The issue ... is really whether Hester 'without lawful authority' willfully engaged in a course of conduct that would cause a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   person to feel intimidated.\" The justice court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Neither party disputes that Hester directed a \"dog sniff\" search of the Jackpot Recreation Center without a warrant and outside the presence of Forsberg ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Given Forsberg's testimony, and especially given the animosity that existed between Pike and Hester at the time of the search, the court concludes that Hester did not have lawful authority to search Pike's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In a footnote, the court elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The court certainly cannot conclude that there was probable cause to search Pike's office on\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   record. On\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   record, the court concludes that Hester's desire to search was colored by his animosity toward Pike. At this point, the court cannot conclude that the search was either lawful under the Fourth Amendment ... or done with NRS 200.571\"lawful authority.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The justice court extended the protective order once again in March 2012. Hester did not appeal from either justice court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In May 2012, Pike sued Hester and other defendants in federal court, claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the office search violated the Fourth Amendment. Pike then moved the district court to apply issue preclusion based on the justice court's conclusions that \"Forsberg did not give Defendant Hester authority to search the Jackpot Recreation Center outside of Mr. Forsburg's [sic] presence\" and \"Defendant Hester did not have lawful authority at the time of the search.\" The district court granted the motion in part, explaining, \"The justice court also found that ... 'Hester did not have lawful authority to search Pike's office.' ... These specific findings, except for the last finding insofar as it concerns an ultimate Fourth Amendment violation, are precluded from relitigation.\" In a footnote, the district court clarified why it was not granting preclusive effect to the justice court's Fourth Amendment conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the alleged Fourth Amendment violation was not directly at issue in the justice court, the justice court does appear to have held that Hester exceeded his lawful authority as a Nevada peace officer to conduct the search. Still, because the ultimate issue (whether to issue an [extended protective order] ) did not require a finding of a Fourth Amendment violation, that issue was not necessarily determined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Pike then moved for offensive summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claim. Initially, the district court granted the motion without the benefit of responsive briefing, as the court had concluded that defendants failed to timely respond. On appeal, this court vacated the order because the district court had miscalculated the due date of defendants' opposition and remanded for the district court to consider Pike's motion in light of defendants' brief.\n   <em>\n    Pike v. Munson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20Fed.%20Appx.%20887\">\n    623 Fed.Appx. 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On remand, the district court granted Pike's motion for summary judgment against Hester. In so doing, the district court noted that in its earlier issue preclusion order it had concluded that the \"ultimate issue of a Fourth Amendment violation had not been directly litigated\" and was not precluded. The district court then assessed, on the merits, whether Hester's search violated the Fourth Amendment. The court determined that Pike had a\n   reasonable expectation of privacy in his office and that Forsberg never consented to the search. The district court further held that \"it would have been clear to a reasonable officer in Hester's position that the warrantless dog sniff of Plaintiff's private office space was unlawful.\" As a result, the district court granted Pike's motion for summary judgment and denied Hester qualified immunity. Hester timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Nevada courts have not confronted the precise question of whether an extended protective order is final for issue preclusion purposes.

To determine that Hester lacked probable cause and consent, the justice\n   court necessarily determined that Pike had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office and that the Fourth Amendment applied to Hester's search. If the Fourth Amendment were not implicated, Hester would not have needed consent to search the office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ziegler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711704\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/1184/#p1190\">\n    474 F.3d at 1190-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (addressing government's consent justification only after determining that employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this case, the district court concluded-without explanation-that the \"ultimate issue of a Fourth Amendment violation\" was not precluded from relitigation because it was not essential to the justice court's ruling. At the same time, the district court held that the justice court's conclusion that \"Hester did not have lawful authority to search Pike's office\" was precluded from relitigation. However, the justice court's two conclusions necessarily go hand-in-hand, both were essential to the judgment. The court could only have issued the protective order if it concluded that Hester lacked lawful authority-meaning the search was not \"protected or authorized by constitutional or statutory law,\" such as the Fourth Amendment-to take the actions in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20200.575\">\n    Nev.

The justice court's conclusion that Hester's search was not \"lawful under the Fourth Amendment\" was therefore essential to its lawful authority determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the justice court's conclusion that the search was conducted without lawful authority was essential to the judgment. Although the search was one of three factual bases for Pike's protective order petition, the justice court discussed only the search at any length. The justice court also explicitly tethered Hester's search to the Nevada statute at issue, concluding that Hester \"did not have lawful authority to search Pike's office.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20200.575\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 200.575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). As to the other bases for Pike's application, the justice court concluded that testimony about Hester's \"stop-and-stare\" activities was credible, but did not conclude that Hester lacked lawful authority to so act. The justice court did not even discuss Hester's meeting with Smith. Only the search supports the justice court's stalking finding. The justice court's resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue was therefore essential to the extension of the protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The issue was also actually litigated. Both Pike and Hester presented witness testimony at a one-day hearing. Forsberg and Hester testified about whether Forsberg consented to Hester's search. The justice court found that Forsberg was credible and rejected Hester's version of the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Hester had an incentive to litigate in the justice court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 (1982). Although the dissent seizes on Pike's attorney's statement in the justice court that \"there was no Fourth Amendment rights violated here,\" Pike's attorney went on to emphasize that \"[t]he question is what was the basis for the search\" and to contend that Hester lacked Forsberg's consent.

Brad Hester. Pike applied on behalf of himself and his two children, and the application rested on several bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, he alleged that Hester made false statements about Pike to others. Hester apparently told Kim Smith, the high school athletic director, that Pike was \"one of the biggest potheads in town.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, Pike alleged that Hester improperly searched his office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. Part I.A. The genesis of this dispute dates back to August 2011, when Hester and two deputies conducted a search of the Jackpot Recreation Center (Center), which included walking a drug dog through Pike's office in the Center. The search of\n   the Center lasted 10 minutes and uncovered no drugs. Hester claims that Lynn Forsberg-the county supervisor and Pike's boss-authorized him to search the Center \"[a]nytime, day or night.\" Forsberg claims that he told Hester \"if he wanted to search the recreation center, he could call me, I would come up and let him in.\" Pike acknowledges that, under County policy, Forsberg has authority to search his office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, Pike alleged that on at least several occasions, Hester drove by Pike's house and glared at him and his family. Pike also claims that Hester drove by his place of employment in a similar manner. This final incident prompted Pike to file an application for a restraining order against Hester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Justice Court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) against Hester on November 15, 2011. The TRO was converted into a two-month extended order of protection (EOP) on December 14, 2011. In granting the EOP, the Justice Court explained that it could not \"conclude that the search was either lawful under the Fourth Amendment or done with NRS 200.571 'lawful authority.' \" But the Justice Court also relied on \"testimony about Hester's 'stop and stare' activities in front of Pike's residence,\" finding testimony on the incident \"both reliable and credible.\" Additionally, the court credited the testimony of Smith, to whom Hester made the disparaging remarks about Pike. Thus, the Justice Court concluded that \"for all of the foregoing reasons,\" the EOP would be granted for two months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Pike later filed this suit against Hester and other defendants in the District of Nevada, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Hester violated the Fourth Amendment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pike seeks compensatory damages expected to exceed $10,000, as well as punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Pike moved the district court to give issue-preclusive effect to several of the Justice Court's findings. The district court, while granting issue preclusion on some findings, declined to grant issue preclusion on Pike's constitutional claim, since \"the ultimate issue (whether to issue an EOP) did not require a finding of a Fourth Amendment violation, that issue was not necessarily determined.\" Thus, the Justice Court's conclusion that Hester did not have lawful authority to search Pike's office was not precluded from relitigation \"insofar as it concern[ed] an ultimate Fourth Amendment violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Pike later moved for summary judgment on the question of qualified immunity. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Pike, finding that there was no genuine question of material fact that Hester's search violated clearly established Fourth Amendment law. However, the court reaffirmed that \"the ultimate issue of a Fourth Amendment violation had not been directly litigated\" in the Justice Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Pike does not argue that the district court erred by refusing to grant issue-preclusive effect to the Justice Court's Fourth Amendment determination; indeed, Pike explicitly abandons any argument to this effect, admitting that \"[t]he findings by the Elko Justice Court in its extended protection order were entitled to preclusive [effect] against Mr. Hester but only as to Mr. Pike's invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress torts,\n   <em>\n    not his Fourth Amendment claim\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7 1983.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On appeal, Hester instead challenges the merits of the district court's order granting summary judgment to Pike on the issue of qualified immunity. Nonetheless, the majority, fashioning an argument that Pike declines to raise, affirms the district court's summary judgment order by stretching the issue preclusion doctrine to\n   cover a situation that neither party, nor the district court, presses upon us. Because I cannot agree with the majority's opinion, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Federal courts \"can give the state proceedings no greater preclusive effect than the state courts would.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.
