Cradler collaterally attacked his sentence through a motion filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asking the district court to vacate his sentence and re-sentence him. The district court denied Cradler's motion, and this appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, the district court's decision is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and the case is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, a jury convicted Cradler of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) (\" \u00a7 922(g)(1)\"), which prohibits convicted felons from possessing a firearm. This offense typically carries a maximum imprisonment penalty of 10 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). However, under the ACCA, a defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) after being convicted of at least three violent felonies or serious drug offenses becomes subject to a mandatory minimum imprisonment penalty of 15 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). At sentencing, the district court found that Cradler had been convicted of four violent felonies prior to violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) and, therefore, sentenced him under the ACCA, to an imprisonment term of 222 months (18.5 years). This court affirmed Cradler's judgment on September 9, 2011. Cradler did not file a petition for a\n   writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 8, 2014, Cradler, through counsel, filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate his sentence (\" \u00a7 2255 motion\"). Cradler argued that, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), two of his prior convictions-(1) sexual battery and (2) third-degree burglary-no longer qualified as violent felonies for ACCA purposes. Therefore, Cradler asserted that his record no longer contained the three violent felonies necessary to subject him to the ACCA's mandatory minimum imprisonment penalty. Based on this, Cradler concluded that his sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, entitling him to a vacating of his sentence and a remand for appropriate re-sentencing, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the following 31 months, Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion was litigated at length in the district court. The protracted nature of the litigation was due, in part, to the publishing of two Supreme Court cases during that time-\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) and\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

During this time, the United States conceded that it lacked the requisite information to support the argument that Cradler's sexual battery conviction qualifies as a violent felony for ACCA purposes. Since that time, this dispute has involved only Cradler's third-degree burglary conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 29, 2016, the district court denied Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits, concluding that his third-degree burglary conviction qualifies as a violent felony. The district court also denied Cradler's motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. On July 11, 2017, this court granted Cradler's motions for a certificate of appealability and to proceed in forma pauperis. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Cradler argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion because it misapplied the proper procedure for determining if a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony. The United States argues that Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion was properly denied, for three reasons: (1) the motion is untimely; (2) Cradler procedurally defaulted his claim; and (3) the district court properly determined that Cradler's third-degree burglary offense qualifies as a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

One-Year Limitations Period\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The United States' first argument against Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion is that the motion is untimely. Motions under \u00a7 2255 are subject to a one-year period of limitation. Normally, this period runs from \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). When, as here, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a criminal judgment, but the defendant did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, his judgment is deemed to be final when the time for filing such a petition expired (i.e., 90 days after the U.S. Court of Appeals entered judgment).\n   <em>\n    Clay v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191337\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/522/#p525\">\n    537 U.S. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525, 527,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191337\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/522/#p525\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191337\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/522/#p525\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Because we affirmed Cradler's judgment of conviction on September 9, 2011, his judgment became final in December 2011. Cradler filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in May 2014, well after the one-year period of limitation had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, subsection (f)(3) of \u00a7 2255 gives federal prisoners a second chance to attack their sentences, but only under special circumstances. Subsection (f)(3) can restart the one-year period of limitation only if the U.S. Supreme Court (1) announces a \"newly recognized\" right that affects the prisoner's conviction and/or sentence, and (2) makes that new right retroactive to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). In such cases, the one-year limitation period restarts on \"the date on which the right asserted [in the \u00a7 2255 motion] was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Throughout the pendency of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Cradler argued that the motion was timely under (f)(3) based on three different Supreme Court cases: first\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , then\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and lastly\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   . The United States argues that none of these cases allows Cradler to successfully assert timeliness under (f)(3). However, before this court can consider the United States' timeliness defense, it is important to note that the United States did not raise this defense in the district court-instead, it was first raised in the United States' brief on appeal. When a party fails to preserve a defense by neglecting to raise it in the district court, that defense is usually deemed to have been forfeited.\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Due to the protracted nature of the litigation in the district court, the United States had ample opportunity to raise this defense below. In the absence of a timeliness argument from the United States, the district court expended considerable time and energy considering the merits of Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion over a period of 31 months. Therefore, we decline to exercise our authority to consider the forfeited timeliness defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Procedural Default\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The United States' second argument against Cradler's \u00a7 2255 motion is that Cradler procedurally defaulted his claim because he did not challenge on direct appeal the classification of his burglary conviction as a violent felony. However, like the timeliness defense, the United States also failed to raise this procedural default argument in the district court, thereby forfeiting it.

According to Cradler, the ACCA does not apply to him because he has not been convicted of three violent felonies.

Mindful of such situations, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   court suggested that courts may need to \"go beyond the mere fact of conviction\" and look to the facts underlying a conviction in order to determine which element or set of elements was the basis of the defendant's conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   So, when courts attempt to apply the categorical approach but are stymied by a divisible statute, they are permitted \"to consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative [set of elements] formed the basis of the defendant's prior conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   is an interpretation of what became the first paragraph of \u00a7 39-904-the basis of Cradler's prior conviction and the subject of his \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After quoting \u00a7 10913, the\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   court held, \"[O]ne,\n   <em>\n    although lawfully in a business house\n   </em>\n   , commits the offense described in \u00a7 10913 when he breaks and enters into a room of that business house, which he has no right to enter, for the purpose of committing a felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20S.W.2d%2098\">\n    98 S.W.2d at 98-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The Tennessee Supreme Court rejected their argument, saying, \"[The defendants'] specific point is that the breaking [referred to in the statute] is determined from how they accomplished the entrance into the booth proper, and not by the subsequent opening of the coin receptacle.\n   <em>\n    This is not the law in this State\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Respectfully, though, that approach only gets in the way of applying the Act here. Nobody disputes that the indictment for Cradler's offense charged him only with conduct amounting to generic burglary (a violent felony for purposes of the Act).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Thus, we can readily tell that Cradler was in fact convicted of a violent felony. Yet under the categorical approach we cannot consider that reality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Instead we must look to the elements of the relevant Tennessee offense, which by their terms likewise seem to describe only generic burglary. But we are also bound by the Tennessee caselaw for the offense, which includes one case-from over fifty years ago and rarely cited since-where the Tennessee Supreme Court seems to have read the relevant statutory provision (notwithstanding its plain terms) to cover certain acts that are not generic burglary. So construed, the Tennessee offense encompasses more than generic burglary, and thus we are bound to hold that Cradler's generic burglary was not generic burglary for purposes of the Act. Whatever the merits of this approach, accuracy and judicial efficiency are not among them, at least not here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 284-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., dissenting). Meanwhile, Cradler will not serve the sentence mandated by Congress (and served by many similarly situated defendants) for carrying a gun after being convicted of three violent felonies, including one \"that ... is burglary[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii). Admittedly, the federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular have had a tough hand in trying to make sense of the Act's violent-felony provisions. But cases like this one make one wonder about the categorical approach's fairness too.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
