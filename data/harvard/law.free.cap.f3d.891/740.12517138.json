After the Sentencing Commission reduced the offense level for methamphetamine trafficking in 2014, Helm moved for a reduction of sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), but the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied the motion. We conclude that Helm was not eligible for a reduction, and we therefore affirm the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Helm pleaded guilty in 2011. Applying the sentencing guidelines, the district court calculated a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of VI, which resulted in an advisory guideline range of 130 to 162 months' imprisonment. Starting from the minimum of the guideline range, the court adjusted the sentence downward by 17 months based on time that Helm served on an undischarged sentence in Oklahoma for conduct relevant to the offense of conviction in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(1). The court then varied downward from 113 months to 96 months based on considerations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 782 to reduce the offense level for many drug offenses, and applied the amendment retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG App. C., Amend. 782 (2014); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(d). As applied to Helm's case, the change reduced his base offense level by two, and diminished his total offense level from 27 to 25.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(8) (2014),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7) (2011). The advisory guideline\n   range for offense level 25 and criminal history category VI is 110 to 137 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Helm sought a reduction in sentence under \u00a7 3582(c), but the district court denied his motion as follows: \"The defendant was granted a downward variance. His current sentence is below the amended guideline range. Therefore, he is not eligible for a reduction.\" The district court also denied a motion to reconsider, and Helm appeals. We review the district court's interpretation of the statute and sentencing guidelines\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276464\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/569/#p571\">\n    859 F.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (8th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Helm argues that the district court erred by concluding that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. His eligibility turns on whether his current sentence of 96 months is greater than the minimum of the amended guideline range. This is so because \u00a7 3582(c) requires that any reduction be \"consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" The applicable policy statement is USSG \u00a7 1B1.10,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillon v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    560 U.S. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), and that provision forbids a court (with one exception not applicable here) to \"reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\" \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted, the advisory guideline range corresponding to Helm's amended offense level and criminal history was 110 to 137 months' imprisonment. Helm's theory is that the 17-month adjustment that the district court applied under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) for service of an undischarged sentence reduced the bottom of his guideline range. On that view, the minimum of his amended range was 93 months, not 110 months, and the court could reduce his sentence from 96 months to 93 months without running afoul of \u00a7 1B1.10. Whether Helm is correct depends on whether the adjustment under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) enters into the calculation of the amended guideline range or merely adjusts the defendant's sentence after the guideline range already has been determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains that the amended guideline range is \"the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.1(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\" \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A) ). Section \u00a7 1B1.1(a), in turn, provides eight steps for determining \"the kinds of sentence and the guideline range as set forth in the guidelines.\" The first five steps instruct the sentencing court how to calculate a defendant's offense level while the sixth step tells how to determine the criminal history category. \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(1)-(6). Step seven then requires the court to \"[d]etermine the guideline range in Part A of Chapter Five that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined above.\" \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(7). The key to Helm's appeal, \u00a7 5G1.3(b), comes into play at step eight. That subsection provides: \"\n   <em>\n    For the particular guideline range\n   </em>\n   , determine from Parts B through G of Chapter Five\n   <em>\n    the sentencing requirements and options\n   </em>\n   related to probation, imprisonment, supervision conditions, fines, and restitution.\" \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(8) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As we understand the instructions, the calculation of an \"amended guideline range\" is complete at step seven of \u00a7 1B1.1(a); step eight and an adjustment under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) does not enter into the calculation. Step seven is where the court determines \"\n   <em>\n    the guideline range\n   </em>\n   in Part A of Chapter Five that corresponds to the\n   offense level and criminal history category determined above.\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(7) (emphasis added). Step eight assumes that the court already has calculated the guideline range and instructs the court to determine the \"sentencing requirements and options\" that apply \"[f]or the particular guideline range\" that was previously determined. \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(8). Therefore, as we said in\n   <em>\n    United States v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276464\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/569/#p571\">\n    859 F.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017), \" \u00a7 5G1.3(b) does not reduce the defendant's\n   <em>\n    guideline range\n   </em>\n   ; it allows for a 'sentence reduction'\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the court has determined the applicable range.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276464\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/569/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276464\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/569/#p571\">\n    at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Helm is correct that \u00a7 5G1.3 does not provide for a \"variance\" or \"departure,\" but neither does it factor into calculation of the \"amended guideline range.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Helm suggests that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758991\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/894/\">\n    652 F.3d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2011), implies that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) does play a role in determining the guideline range. In\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , the district court calculated an advisory guideline range of 84 to 105 months' imprisonment, and the defendant urged a downward adjustment of 24 months under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) for time served in state custody. The district court imposed a sentence of 105 months, and we characterized the sentence as a \"variance from the guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758991\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/894/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758991\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/894/\">\n    at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Helm says that if the sentence was a \"variance,\" then the defendant's guideline range must have been reduced based on \u00a7 5G1.3(b), because otherwise a term of 105 months would have been within the guideline range and not a \"variance.\" This is not so. A \"variance\" leads to a sentence different from what the guidelines recommend. Section 5G1.3(b), by directing the court to \"adjust the sentence,\" affects a defendant's guideline\n   <em>\n    sentence\n   </em>\n   , even though it does not alter the guideline\n   <em>\n    range\n   </em>\n   . So when the district court in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   declined to sentence the defendant to a term that reflected both the advisory guideline range and the adjustment under \u00a7 5G1.3, the court varied from the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Better authority for Helm's cause is the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzalez-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277992\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1329/#p1336\">\n    852 F.3d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1336-39 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). There, the court said that it was bound by\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hippolyte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556681\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/535/\">\n    712 F.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2013), to apply all eight steps of \u00a7 1B1.1(a) before it could arrive at the amended guideline range for purposes of \u00a7 1B1.10.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277992\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1329/#p1336\">\n    852 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hippolyte\n   </em>\n   , however, did not involve \u00a7 5G1.3(b) ; it appeared to assume that because \u00a7 5G1.1(b) provides that a statutory minimum sentence greater than the guideline range will become the \"guideline sentence,\" the court must take into account Part G of Chapter 5 when determining the \"amended guideline range.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556681\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/535/\">\n    712 F.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We think this analysis, like Helm's argument regarding our decision in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , conflates \"guideline range\" with \"guideline sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061939,3664678\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/361/\">\n    722 F.3d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369-70 (D.C. Cir. 2013). The Sentencing Commission's own example concerning \u00a7 5G1.3(b) demonstrates the point: it describes a defendant with a \"guideline range\" of 12-18 months, but a \"sentence\" of seven months after an \"adjustment\" under \u00a7 5G1.3(b). USSG \u00a7 5G1.3, comment. (n.2(D) ). Although the distinction is sometimes subtle, the guidelines manual differentiates between the guideline range that is determined from the Sentencing Table based on an offense level and criminal history category,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(7) ; USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A) ), and other factors-such as statutory penalties-that \"affect\" or \"restrict\" the guideline range when the court considers \"sentencing requirements and options\" at step eight of the application instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5G1.1, comment.; \u00a7 5G1.2, comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (n.1);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In earlier years, this court reached a different conclusion and held that the \"guideline sentence\" dictated by a statutory minimum penalty became the \"guideline range.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Golden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546117\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/1229/#p1232\">\n    709 F.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 (8th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In 2014, however, the Sentencing Commission superseded the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   in Amendment 780 and USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c). The Commission noted the conflict between\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   and decisions of the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061939,3664678\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/361/\">\n    722 F.3d at 369-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Savani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715616\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/56/#p66\">\n    733 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66-67 (3d Cir. 2013), and \"generally adopted\" the approach of the other circuits that the bottom of the amended guideline range is \"the bottom of the Sentencing Table guideline range.\" USSG App. C., Amend. 780 (2014). This court then acknowledged that \"the Sentencing Commission overruled\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bogdan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355618\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/805/#p807\">\n    835 F.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (8th Cir. 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court correctly concluded that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and a sentence adjustment for time served on an undischarged term of imprisonment does not enter into the calculation of Helm's amended guideline range. Helm's current sentence of 96 months is therefore less than his amended guideline range of 110 to 137 months, and he is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We can imagine policy arguments for allowing a district court to reduce a sentence under this statute when a defendant's current sentence is less than the minimum of an amended guideline range but greater than an amended guideline sentence after application of \u00a7 5G1.3(b). But \u00a7 1B1.10 embodies a different policy choice. As we noted in a prior decision, the present system has the effect of treating discharged and undischarged sentences alike in \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276464\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/569/#p571\">\n    859 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   572 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277992\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1329/#p1336\">\n    852 F.3d at 1342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rosenbaum, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Honorable Brian C.
