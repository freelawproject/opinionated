This law was in force when the tax complained of was levied by the board of supervisors, and the town' was complying with the requirement that it should maintain its own streets. By the terms of Code, 1904, sec. 944-a, cl, 11, (as amended by Acts 1915, ch. 86), the property within the town iwas exempted from the tax in question. The case is ruled by <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Barrow, </em>121 Va. 236, 92 S. E. 908, and <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Prince Edward, County, </em>121 Va. 1, 92 S. E. 910, where the contentions here made were resolved adversely to defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
