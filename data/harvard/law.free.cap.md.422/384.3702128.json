Briscoe was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and convicted of the crimes of possessing a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in a vehicle; possessing cocaine; and driving on a suspended license. Those convictions were based on evidence the police recovered while searching Petitioner\u2019s vehicle at the time of his arrest. At that time, the police found cocaine in the center console of the passenger compartment and a handgun in the locked glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Petitioner did not challenge the seizure of the cocaine, but he did seek suppression of the handgun, claiming that it was the fruit of a search forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. The suppression court denied the motion, finding that the evidence was lawfully obtained either as a valid inventory search under <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976), and its progeny, or as a valid search incident to arrest under <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner challenged the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the handgun. While the case was pending in that court, the Supreme Court decided <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009). The State conceded that, under <em>Gant, </em>the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The State argued, though, that Petitioner was not entitled to suppression of the handgun, by application of the good-faith exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule. In the State\u2019s view, the police conducted the search \u201crely[ing] in good faith on controlling judicial precedent.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals did not reach the <em>Gant </em>issue, holding instead that the handgun found within the locked glove compartment was recovered during a valid inventory search. Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1. Did the circuit court err in finding that a search of a vehicle was a valid inventory search where the State failed to establish (a) that there was a legitimate need to tow the vehicle, (b) that the officer made an inventory list and gave a copy to the driver, (c) that the towing of the vehicle and the opening of the locked glove compartment were permitted by established standardized policies, or (d) that the opening of the locked glove box was necessary to safeguard property against loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">2. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>[556 U.S. 382, 129 S.Ct. 1710] (2009), did the circuit court err in finding that a search of a vehicle, which included a search of the locked glove compartment, was a valid search incident to arrest where the State failed to establish that the arrestee was unsecured and within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search, and where the police had the keys to the locked glove compartment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">At the time of briefing and oral argument in this case, the parties and the Court were aware that the issue generated by the State\u2019s good-faith argument was in material respect identical to an issue then pending <em>certiorari </em>review in the Supreme Court. The Court granted the writ in <em>Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 502, 178 L.Ed.2d 368 (2010), and on June 16, 2011, issued its opinion in the case. 564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 180 L.Ed.2d 285.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The <em>Davis </em>Court held, much as the State has argued in the present case, \u201cthat searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2423-24. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The holding of <em>Davis </em>applies to the second question before us. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (holding that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past\u201d); <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 78, 18 A.3d 60, 86 (2011) (stating same). Applying <em>Davis </em>to that question, we must determine whether, incident to Petitioner\u2019s arrest, the police searched the locked glove compartment in objectively reasonable reliance on then-binding Maryland appellate precedent, namely <em>Belton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">For reasons we shall explain more fully, we hold that the search of the glove compartment was not a valid inventory search. We further hold that, under <em>Davis, </em>the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies to what, at the time, was a lawful search of the glove compartment, under <em>Belton. </em>We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, albeit on a ground not relied upon by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">A. <em>The Suppression Motion Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Baltimore City Police Officer Lavgh Bormanshinov was the sole witness at the hearing on Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the handgun. Officer Bormanshinov testified as follows about the sequence of events before and during the search of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">On June 26, 2007, at 12:50 a.m., Officer Bormanshinov observed a minivan traveling near the 1200 block of Presstman Street in Baltimore. Its taillights were not illuminated. Officer Bormanshinov activated his lights and trained his spotlight on the minivan, indicating to the driver that he pull over. The driver, Petitioner, immediately stopped the minivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Officer Bormanshinov approached the vehicle and asked Petitioner for his driver\u2019s license and the vehicle\u2019s registration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Petitioner could not produce his driver\u2019s license, but he did provide the officer with the registration. The registration showed that the minivan was owned by Ms. Luella Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Officer Bormanshinov returned to his vehicle and, using the information Petitioner supplied him, discovered that Petitioner\u2019s license was suspended and there was an open arrest warrant for him. Officer Bormanshinov returned to the minivan and asked Petitioner for the keys, which Petitioner gave him. Officer Bormanshinov then went back to his vehicle and, upon further investigation, learned that the warrant was \u201cpositive.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Bormanshinov removed Petitioner and his passenger, Jeremy Ringgold, from the minivan. Officer Bormanshinov arrested Petitioner, searched him, and sat him on the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">At some point during the preceding events, Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s Sergeant, whose name is not reflected in the record, arrived on the scene. The Sergeant stood next to the passenger door to monitor the then-still-seated front seat passenger, Ringgold, while Officer Bormanshinov further investigated the warrant for Petitioner. When Officer Bormanshinov returned, he asked Ringgold for identification for the purpose of running a \u201cwarrant check.\u201d Ringgold was unable to comply. Consequently, Officer Bormanshinov and his Sergeant removed Ringgold from the minivan, as well. Officer Bormanshinov searched Ringgold (evidently finding nothing of relevance to the present case) and sat him on the curb next to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Officer Bormanshinov testified that, \u201c[sjince [Petitioner] was arrested,\u201d he \u201cdid an inventory search of the vehicle.\u201d Using the keys Petitioner gave to him, Officer Bormanshinov unlocked the glove compartment and found a handgun inside. He also found several vials of suspected cocaine, one in the coin slot to the left of the steering wheel and two more in a Colt 45 can that was in the vehicle\u2019s center console.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The State did not ask further questions of Officer Bormanshinov concerning the purported \u201cinventory search.\u201d Neither did the State introduce any evidence of a Baltimore City Police Department policy or procedure regarding inventory searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">At some point, Officer Bormanshinov decided to have the minivan towed to the \u201cCity yard.\u201d Officer Bormanshinov tried without success to have Ms. Lane, the owner of the vehicle, contacted to let her know that her car would be towed to the impound lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">During cross-examination, Officer Bormanshinov testified that Petitioner was calm, polite, cooperative, and sober during the traffic stop, arrest, and search of the minivan. Defense counsel then asked Officer Bormanshinov when the decision was made to tow the minivan, and he responded simply, \u201cMy plan was to tow the vehicle. But I had to do a search of the vehicle before\u2014that\u2019s our procedure\u2014before it gets towed.\u201d Defense counsel propounded further questions on this point, resulting in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Defense Counsel: Are you familiar with the general order that requires you to follow all of the procedures for towing a car or impounding a car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">Officer Bormanshinov: I believe once the driver\u2019s suspended and he or she is not the registered owner, then the car, car can be towed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">Defense Counsel: But do you have any policies or procedures that direct you what you\u2019re supposed to do in that situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">Officer Bormanshinov: I have not come across that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">Defense Counsel: You\u2019re not familiar with any general orders describing what you should be doing in that situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">Officer Bormanshinov: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Defense Counsel: You\u2019re not familiar with the towing procedures that require you to do a complete and total inventory of everything that\u2019s in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Officer Bormanshinov: I\u2019m familiar with that, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnE\">Defense Counsel: You are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Officer Bormanshinov: With the inventory, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">Defense Counsel: So then you completed your vehicle report; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">Officer Bormanshinov: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">Defense Counsel: And your vehicle report notes everything that was inventoried in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">Officer Bormanshinov: I believe there was nothing of value to be inventoried in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">Defense Counsel: But don\u2019t your own general orders require you to write down everything that belongs to the owner in order to protect them and protect the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASn\">Officer Bormanshinov: I, I\u2019m not sure of that, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlyZ\">Defense Counsel: Can you tell us what was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmU\">Officer Bormanshinov: Yes, an empty oxygen tank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">At the conclusion of Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s testimony, defense counsel sought suppression of the handgun on the ground that the search of the locked glove compartment was not a valid inventory search. Defense counsel argued that \u201cthe officer was [unjable to articulate what the procedure was. He was unable to produce any of the orders. He was unable to repeat any training that he\u2019s had in this case.\u201d For those reasons, defense counsel maintained that the search was not a \u201clegitimate\u201d inventory search, but instead was \u201can excuse [for] further investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">The State disagreed. In the State\u2019s view, Officer Bormanshinov conducted a valid inventory search of the vehicle, including the glove compartment. The State further argued that, even if the search was not valid as an inventory search, the search of the glove compartment was authorized as a part of a search incident to arrest under the then-prevailing Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>preme Court authority of <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. at 460, n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 2860.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The motions court denied the motion to suppress. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">I think it was a valid inventory search and I think, although the officer didn\u2019t have the administrative order at hand to cite, he was certainly familiar with it and it was a routine that he was familiar with and followed the steps.... Also, in light of <em>[Hamel v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 1, 943 A.2d 686 (2008),] [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] ... given to me by the State which bears a recent date, which indicates that the Court of Appeals hasn\u2019t had its say on that yet.... But certainly, this search would fall within the ambit of what was found to be under the Constitution in a search incident to arrest. I mean, they just clearly held that a locked glove compartment is within the ambit under the latest Supreme Court decision. So, under either theory, it was a valid search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">B. <em>The Trial and Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Petitioner was subsequently convicted by a jury on all counts and sentenced to imprisonment for five years, without the possibility of parole. On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress because the search was neither a valid inventory search nor a valid search incident to arrest, under <em>Belton. </em>In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of conviction, holding \u201cthat the inventory search of the minivan in this case was reasonable.\u201d The court therefore did not address whether the search of the glove compartment was a valid search incident to Petitioner\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Searches done without a warrant are \u201cpresumed to be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Henderson v. State, </em>416 Md. 125, 148, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>A.3d 1072, 1085 (2010) (stating that a search unaccompanied by a warrant \u201cis presumptively unreasonable\u201d). There are, however, recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, two of which are relevant to the present case. The first is known as the \u201cinventory search,\u201d which generally authorizes the search of a vehicle in lawful police custody for the purpose of cataloging property located therein. <em>See Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 376, 96 S.Ct. 3092; <em>Duncan v. State, </em>281 Md. 247, 259, 378 A.2d 1108, 1116 (1977). The second is the \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 768, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969) (holding that a search incident to arrest permits the law enforcement officer to search the person of the arrestee and the area around the arrestee where the arrestee might reach to grab a weapon or evidence); <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. at 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860 (applying <em>Chimel\u2019s </em>holding to the search of a vehicle incident to the arrest of a recent occupant). As with any warrantless search, the State bears the burden to overcome the presumption of unreasonableness. <em>Paulino v. State, </em>399 Md. 341, 348, 924 A.2d 308, 313 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In reviewing the ruling of the suppression court, we must rely solely upon the record developed at the suppression hearing. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 148, 12 A.3d 1238, 1245 (2011). We view the evidence and inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party who prevails on the motion, <em>id., 12 </em>A.3d at 1245, here, the State. We give deference to the first-level factual findings made by the suppression court, and we accept those findings unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., Elliott v. State, </em>417 Md. 413, 427, 10 A.3d 761, 769 (2010). We, however, make an independent appraisal of the constitutionality of a search, \u201capplying the law to the facts found in each particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 10 A.3d at 769 (quoting <em>Belote v. State, </em>411 Md. 104, 120, 981 A.2d 1247, 1256 (2009)) (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>A. <em>Inventory Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We first address the State\u2019s contention that the search of the locked glove compartment was undertaken in the course of a lawful inventory search, under <em>Opperman, Duncan, </em>and related jurisprudence. Pursuant to this well-defined exception to the warrant requirement, a search of a vehicle for the purpose of itemizing the property therein is constitutional, so long as the vehicle is in lawful police custody at the time of the search and the search is carried out pursuant to \u201cstandardized criteria or [an] established routine\u201d established by the law enforcement agency. <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1, 4, 110 S.Ct. 1632, 109 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The purposes of an inventory search are three: to protect the police from danger, to protect the owner\u2019s property, and to protect the police against claims and disputes over lost or stolen property. <em>Duncan v. State, </em>281 Md. 247, 257, 378 A.2d 1108, 1115 (1977) (citing <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092). As with all exceptions to the warrant requirement, use of the inventory search must be limited to those circumstances that are tied to the precise justifications for it, which do not include criminal investigation. <em>See Wells, </em>495 U.S. at 4,110 S.Ct. 1632 (\u201c[A]n inventory search must not be a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence.\u201d). Therefore, the State must ensure that the record of the suppression hearing reflects both that the vehicle was in lawful police custody at the time of the search <em>and </em>that the search was conducted in accordance with a sufficiently standardized departmental policy or routine. <em>See Wells, </em>495 U.S. at 4-5, 110 S.Ct. 1632; <em>Duncan, </em>281 Md. at 259, 378 A.2d at 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Petitioner advances several arguments in support of the contention that the State failed to establish that the search of the vehicle falls within the limited purview of an \u201cinventory search.\u201d He argues: (1) the State failed to establish at the suppression hearing that, at the time of the search, the vehicle was in lawful police custody; (2) Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s list<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ing of only the contraband (cocaine and handgun) on the purported inventory list undermines the State\u2019s assertion that Officer Bormanshinov was conducting a valid inventory search; and (3) the record contains no evidence of a departmental policy that permitted, authorized, or otherwise regulated the search of closed or locked containers, rendering the motion court\u2019s ruling fatally flawed under <em>Wells.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Officer Bormanshinov testified that, once he determined that the vehicle was not owned by Petitioner, he attempted to contact the owner, Ms. Luella Lane, to advise her that her car would be towed to the impound lot. When asked by defense counsel why it was necessary to tow the vehicle, Officer Bormanshinov replied that he \u201cbeliev[ed that] once the driver\u2019s suspended and he or she is not the registered owner, then the car ... can be towed.\u201d However, he had \u201cnot come across,\u201d and was not familiar with, any procedures or orders governing the appropriate action in that situation. Moreover, Officer Bormanshinov could only testify that \u201cI had to do a search of the vehicle before\u2014that\u2019s our procedure\u2014before it gets towed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We shall assume, without deciding, that Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s references to a \u201cprocedure\u201d (without any mention of a specific rule or regulation) sufficed to establish the existence of a sufficiently routinized, general departmental inventory search policy. Even so, Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s testimony gives no indication that the supposed policy provides standardized criteria governing the search of closed or locked containers and, if so, that the search of the locked glove compartment was done according to that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The State correctly notes that, in the context of inventory searches, \u201cnothing ... prohibits the exercise of police discretion <em>so long as </em>that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 375, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987) (emphasis added). Such discretion, however, must be exercised pursuant to standardized criteria, which, with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>spect to the search of closed and/or locked containers, are not present in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Supreme Court addressed this precise point in <em>Wells. </em>The defendant in that case was stopped for speeding and subsequently arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. 495 U.S. at 2, 110 S.Ct. 1632. In an inventory search that followed, a locked suitcase was found within the locked trunk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The suitcase was forced open, revealing a garbage bag containing marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The defendant asserted that the search of the locked suitcase exceeded the scope of a valid inventory search. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3,110 S.Ct. 1632.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Court agreed with Wells that the search of the locked suitcase could not be upheld as an inventory search, because \u201cthe record contained no evidence of any Highway Patrol policy on the opening of closed containers found during inventory searches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 110 S.Ct. 1632. Nor did the Court assume that there was one, in the absence of any indication in the record of a departmental policy on the subject; rather, the Court analyzed the case as if there were no such policy, stating that the department \u201chad no policy whatever with respect to the opening of closed containers encountered during an inventory search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 110 S.Ct. 1632. Consequently, the Court held that the search \u201cwas not sufficiently regulated to satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u201d and therefore the evidence found incident to the search was correctly suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 110 S.Ct. 1632.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The case at bar suffers from the same lack of evidence in the record of a Baltimore City Police Department policy concerning the opening of locked containers during an inventory search. In the absence of evidence that such a policy existed, it is impossible to distinguish a valid inventory search from a general investigatory search. As in <em>Wells, </em>we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>constrained to conclude in the present case that the search of the locked glove compartment was not \u201csufficiently regulated to satisfy the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>Wells, </em>495 U.S. at 5, 110 S.Ct. 1632, to qualify as an inventory search.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIq\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The State, perhaps predicting that we would reach this conclusion, argues that, even if \u201cOfficer Bormanshinov\u2019s on-scene search was not a proper inventory, the evidence was nevertheless admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u201cThe exception [to the warrant requirement] for exigent circumstances is a narrow one.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 402, 813 A.2d 231, 241 (2002). Under the inevitable discovery doctrine, \u201c[ejvidence obtained as a result of an illegal search is admissible where, absent the illegal conduct, the evidence inevitably would have been discovered through legal means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 813 A.2d at 248. According to the State, that doctrine is applicable here, because \u201c[t]here can be no question that the police had authority to, and ultimately did, tow and impound [Petitioner\u2019s] minivan. Thus, the search of the vehicle undoubtedly would have occurred regardless of Officer Bormanshinov\u2019s on-scene investigatory search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The problem with the State\u2019s argument is that the record before us is devoid of evidence demonstrating that the vehicle\u2019s locked glove compartment would have been inventoried according to departmental policy, once it was towed to the impound lot. Without such evidence in the record, we are unable to conclude that the handgun would have been discovered inevitably, in a later inventory search of the locked glove compartment. <em>See United States v.

The Supreme Court held in <em>Belton </em>that, \u201cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d 453 U.S. at 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860 (footnote omitted). The Court considered that rule to be an application, in the vehicle context, of its analysis in <em>Chimel. Id. Chimel </em>\u201cestablished that a search incident to arrest may not stray beyond the area within the immediate control of the arrestee.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Belton </em>Court reasoned \u201cthat articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or eviden[ce].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chimel, </em>395 U.S. at 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034).

Maryland courts were no different in this regard. <em>See, e.g., Gee v.

The Court adopted the following rule in <em>Gant: </em>\u201cPolice may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of the arrest.\u201d 556 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 1723.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">2. <em>Application of the Good-Faith Exception?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gant </em>has generated the second question Petitioner presents, which is whether Petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the rule established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>that case, thereby requiring suppression of the handgun that was seized during the search of the minivan. The State has conceded that the search of the minivan was unlawful, under <em>Gant. </em>We shall accept that concession and assume, <em>for discussion purposes only, </em>that the State was correct to concede that issue. The State argues that, although the search was not proper under <em>Gant, </em>Petitioner is not entitled to suppression of the handgun, by operation of the \u201cgood-faith\u201d principles announced in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). This is so, the State argues, because Officer Bormanshinov acted in objectively reasonable reliance on appellate precedent then-binding in Maryland, namely, Belton,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State asserts the very argument that since has carried the day in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The search at issue in <em>Davis </em>had its genesis in a routine traffic stop that resulted in the arrests of the driver, for driving while intoxicated, and the passenger, Willie Davis, for giving a false name to police. 556 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2425. The police handcuffed the driver and Davis and placed them in the back of separate patrol cars. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2425.

The district court denied that motion. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2426. Davis was convicted and, while his appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, the Supreme Court decided <em>Gant. Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2426. Davis argued that, under <em>Gant, </em>the search of the vehicle was unconstitutional, and therefore he was entitled to suppression of the revolver found during that search. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>598 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed that the search was unconstitutional but refused to exclude the evidence, holding instead that the good-faith exception was applicable. <em>Id. </em>The court explained that, \u201clike most other courts, [it] had read <em>Belton </em>to mean that police could search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest regardless of the occupant\u2019s actual control over the passenger compartment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. The court emphasized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-18\">[although an officer\u2019s mistake of law cannot provide objectively reasonable grounds for a search, the mistake of law here was not attributable to the police. On the contrary, the governing law in this circuit unambiguously allowed [the officer] to search the car.

The <em>Davis </em>Court began by noting that the parties agreed that the search in question, when conducted, was authorized by binding Eleventh Circuit precedent, and the parties agreed that the search did not comport with the requirements of <em>Gant. Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2428. The parties disagreed, however, about whether <em>Gant </em>was to be applied retroactively, <em>id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2430, and, if so, whether the good-faith exception would preclude application of the exclusionary rule, <em>id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2431.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">The Supreme Court had no difficulty deciding that <em>Gant </em>was to be retroactively applied. <em>Id. </em>at---, 131 S.Ct. at 2431. The Court then turned to the more difficult question: whether the exclusionary rule must also be applied. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2431. The Court framed the questions as \u201cwhether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2423. The Court held: \u201cBecause suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-21\">The <em>Davis </em>Court noted that \u201c!e]xclusion is \u2018not a personal constitutional right,\u2019 nor is it designed to \u2018redress the injury\u2019 occasioned by an unconstitutional search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2426 (quoting <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976)).

It was for that reason, the Court explained, that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule was developed in <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (declining to apply the exclusionary rule where police officers conducted a search in \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance\u201d on a warrant later determined invalid), and subsequently applied in <em>Illinois v. Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 349-50, 107 S.Ct. 1160, 94 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987) (applying the good-faith exception to a police officer\u2019s search that was conducted in accordance with a statute later deemed unconstitutional), <em>Arizona v. Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 14, 115 S.Ct. 1185, 131 L.Ed.2d 34 (1995) (applying the good-faith exception to searches incident to arrests based on arrest warrant information contained within a database maintained by judicial employees later determined to be erroneous), and <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (applying the good-faith exception to searches conducted following execution of outstanding arrests warrants later determined to be erroneous due to police record-keeping error). <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2427-28. The <em>Davis </em>Court noted that the common theme throughout those cases was a lack of police officer culpability. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2427-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The <em>Davis </em>Court concluded that application of the exclusionary rule was unwarranted in the case before the Court, given the same absence of police culpability; that is, the police, when conducting the search under <em>Belton, </em>did not \u201cdeliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence[ ]\u201d violate Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2428. The Court pointed out that <em>Davis </em>had arisen out of the Eleventh Circuit, which had interpreted <em>Belton </em>\u201cto establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2428.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The principle that emerges from <em>Davis </em>is that operation of the exclusionary rule is suspended only when the evidence seized was the result of a search that, when conducted, was a \u201cpolice practice\u201d specifically authorized by the jurisdiction\u2019s precedent in which the officer operates. To decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the particular search at issue in the present case\u2014the search of the locked glove compartment\u2014comes within the <em>Davis </em>rule, we must examine what Maryland law dictated at the time of that search.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The search of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle was conducted on June 26, 2007. At that time, the search of the minivan incident to Petitioner\u2019s arrest was governed by the then-prevailing <em>Belton </em>bright-line rule. <em>See Gee, </em>291 Md. at 668, 435 A.2d at 1389-90; <em>McCain, </em>194 Md.App. at 276, 4 A.3d at 66. Under <em>Belton, </em>a glove compartment is included in the <em>Belton </em>perimeter. <em>See Belton, </em>453 U.S. at 461 n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 2860. At the time of the search at issue, no reported decision of this Court or the Court of Special Appeals had addressed specifically whether a police officer conducting a <em>Belton </em>search could open a <em>locked </em>glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Petitioner takes the position that, because, at the time of the search at issue, no reported decision in Maryland expressly authorized police to open a locked glove compartment as part of a <em>Belton </em>search, there did not exist at that time \u201cbinding appellate\u201d Maryland authority upon which Officer Bormanshinov could have \u201creasonably relied\u201d in searching the glove compartment. The State acknowledges that there was no then-existing reported Maryland decision specifically authorizing the search of a locked glove compartment. The State points out, though, that, \u201cjust prior to the suppression hearing in this case, the Court of Special Appeals [in <em>Hamel, </em>179 Md.App. at 18, 943 A.2d at 696] made it clear that <em>Belton </em>permitted the search of a locked gloved compartment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner replies that <em>Hamel </em>is of no benefit to the State, because it was filed two months after the search in question and thus could not serve as precedent upon which Officer Bormanshinov could objectively and in good faith rely. We are in general accord with the State that the <em>Davis </em>good-faith excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion applies to the search at issue, although we take a slightly different tack in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We understand the <em>Davis </em>Court\u2019s reference to binding appellate precedent to mean that the caselaw of the jurisdiction must have been clear about whether that jurisdiction had adopted the bright-line rule of <em>Belton. </em>Petitioner and the State do not disagree that, until <em>Gant </em>was decided, <em>Belton </em>was a part of Maryland law. And, under <em>Belton, </em>the police are entitled to search the entire passenger compartment of a vehicle, including the glove compartment. To repeat, the <em>Belton </em>Court made clear that, in a search for both weapons and destructible evidence incident to a valid arrest of a vehicle\u2019s occupant, police may search \u201cinside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment\u201d of the vehicle, and may \u201cexamine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment[.]\u201d 453 U.S. at 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860. The <em>Belton </em>Court defined \u201ccontainer\u201d for this purpose as \u201cdenoting] any object capable of holding another object. It thus includes closed or open glove compartments, consoles, or other receptacles located anywhere within the passenger compartment, as well as luggage, boxes, bags, clothing, and the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460-61 n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 2860. We believe it to be clear, under <em>Belton </em>itself, that a locked glove compartment is within the scope of the rule announced in that case, notwithstanding that the Court made no effort to include that detail or, for that matter, any other fact-specific details concerning the scope of the search. Indeed, the <em>Belton </em>Court expressly eschewed a fact-specific rule in favor of a bright-line rule that could be easily applied by officers in the field. <em>See id. </em>at 458, 101 S.Ct. 2860 (\u201c[A] single, familiar standard is essential to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Petitioner is correct that, before the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Hamel, </em>no reported Maryland appellate decision expressly held that the police, in conducting a <em>Belton </em>search, may open a locked glove compartment. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>bright-line nature of the <em>Belton </em>rule, however, it would be unfaithful to its very design and purpose to have its application and, in turn the application of the <em>Davis </em>good-faith exception, depend on whether a container, undeniably within the so-called <em>Belton </em>perimeter, is locked or unlocked. In other words, the Court of Special Appeals, in deciding <em>Hamel </em>as it did, merely applied the <em>Belton </em>rule to the specific facts of the case. <em>Hamel </em>did not create new \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d in Maryland; rather, that case merely applied what was at the time, and had been since 1981, Maryland law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We therefore hold that, before <em>Gant, </em>binding appellate precedent in Maryland, namely <em>Belton, </em>dictated that searches incident to arrest of recent occupants of vehicles included searches of all containers, whether locked or unlocked, within the passenger areas of the vehicles. Officer Bormanshinov acted in objectively reasonable reliance on that authority when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>he searched the locked glove compartment. It follows then, that the good-faith rule of <em>Davis </em>applies, and the suppression court correctly denied the motion to suppress the handgun found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which had affirmed the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">BELL, C.J., joins in judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\">. Both counsel in the case at bar correctly anticipated the arguments that were advanced by the parties in <em>Davis, </em>and both were well prepared to respond to this Court\u2019s questions concerning how the Supreme Court\u2019s potential decision on the issue might apply to Petitioner. In particular, counsel addressed whether binding appellate precedent in Maryland at the time of the search at issue here would permit the search of the locked glove compartment of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle. We therefore find it unnecessary to order (and the parties have not requested) post-Davis reargument of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">.

Other courts seemingly have been untroubled by <em>Belton </em>searches of locked containers. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>360 F.3d 1243, 1246-47 (10th Cir.2004) (holding that delay in unlocking and searching glove box to allow defendant to be removed to patrol car did not extinguish justification for protective search of locked glove box); <em>United States v. Valiant, </em>873 F,2d 205, 206 (8th Cir.1989) (upholding search under <em>Belton </em>of locked briefcase within vehicle after placing defendant under arrest); <em>State v. Hanna, </em>173 Ariz. 30, 839 P.2d 450, 452 (1992) (upholding search under <em>Belton </em>of locked glove compartment and listing cases upholding \u201cwarrantless searches incident to arrest where the possibility of an arrestee\u2019s grabbing a weapon or evidence were equally as remote\u201d); <em>State v. Farr, </em>24 Conn.App. 259, 587 A.2d 1047, 1050 (1991) (upholding search of locked glove compartment where defendant was removed from vehicle and placed in patrol car because area was within searchable zone under Belton); <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>632 A.2d 383, 388 n. 11 (D.C.1993) (noting that, although <em>Belton </em>did <em>not </em>apply because defendant had locked the vehicle and walked away before arrest and search, \"[i]f the car could validly be searched under <em>Belton, </em>then the search could lawfully include the glove compartment, locked or unlocked\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
