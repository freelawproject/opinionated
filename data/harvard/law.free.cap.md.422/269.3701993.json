At the close of all of the evidence, the petitioner having testified in his own defense, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte </em>and over the petitioner\u2019s objection, \u201cdeclare[d] a mistrial on herself,\u201d intending to set the case in for a new trial before another judge. This decision was upheld by both the motions judge, from whom the petitioner initially sought relief, in the form of dismissal of the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy, and by the Court of Special Appeals, to which he appealed the adverse rulings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to determine whether, under the facts and circumstances <em>sub judice, </em>there was \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the trial judge\u2019s declaration of mistrial, thus permitting the petitioner\u2019s retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Before the start of this trial, the petitioner had been convicted in two separate, unrelated cases of sexual offenses involving young women who were minors, \u201cunder the age of 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>or 16.\u201d Those judgments of conviction were being appealed at the time. The trial judge was aware of these convictions and, as to at least one of them, so too were the prosecutor and defense counsel. Indeed, the trial judge had presided over one of the unrelated sexual offense cases, a jury trial, in which both the prosecutor and defense counsel in this case had participated. In addition, she was aware of the other case involving a different minor, which had been presided over by a retired, recall judge. These convictions were not discussed prior to trial; although she mentioned the convictions during the trial, after jeopardy had attached, thereby acknowledging that she was aware of them, the trial judge did not mention them before jeopardy attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Prior to trial, it was clear that the complaining witness had not reported the sexual offenses she accused the petitioner of committing promptly or within a reasonable time of their commission. The charging documents alleged that the offenses occurred in 2005 but that they were not reported by the complaining witness until 2008. In fact, in preliminary discussions of the ease, the State advised the trial judge that the complaining witness had not reported immediately the sexual offenses lodged against the petitioner and that it expected her to testify that, nearly three years after the event, after she heard a sermon at the church she attended, she decided to come forward with the sexual assault allegations against the petitioner. The State also apprised the court that it intended to call five other witnesses, none of whom had personal knowledge of the alleged offenses or would provide forensic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">For the defense, defense counsel informed the court that it intended to call the petitioner, and only the petitioner, to testify. Moreover, during its brief opening statement, the defense made clear what its defense would be and what the petitioner would testify to, that the alleged incident \u201cdid not happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As expected, consistent with the preliminary discussions, the State\u2019s case consisted of the complaining witness, her mother, a former friend to whom it was alleged the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ing witness related the sexual offense during the summer in which it occurred and three other witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaining witness testified that she had been sexually assaulted by the petitioner, a friend of the family, in August of 2005, when she was thirteen years old and that she reported the incident in 2008. She explained the circumstances: the petitioner had been hired by her parents to do work on the family\u2019s house, which was located next to the trailer where the family resided. After she delivered the glue that the petitioner had requested, she said that the petitioner asked her whether she had ever had sex. When she did not respond, the complaining witness testified that the petitioner told her that, unless she had sex with him, he would tell her parents that she was sexually active. She concluded that, after she had performed fellatio on the petitioner for a brief time, she and the petitioner engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The complaining witness\u2019s mother testified that, in May of 2005, the petitioner was hired to redo the family\u2019s kitchen but quit, without notice, before completing the job. She further testified that, after a June 2008 meeting with her husband, their pastor, two former youth leaders, and the complaining witness, at which the complaining witness first alleged that she had been raped by the petitioner in the summer of 2005, she then went to the police to report the incident. The complaining witness\u2019s former friend was offered to corroborate her testimony that the sexual assault occurred. She testified that the complaining witness told her, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>summer in which it allegedly occurred, that the complaining witness had \u201csex with the guy that was working on the house.\u201d She also said that the complaining witness did not say \u201cit was rape or anything.\u201d None of the State\u2019s other witnesses had any knowledge of the alleged offense until some years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The subject of the petitioner\u2019s prior sexual convictions was brought up three times, each time by the trial judge, before the defense presented its case. During the testimony of the complaining witness, the trial judge inquired whether the complaining witness and her parents had ever discussed \u201cthe fact that [the petitioner] had been charged in two other cases involving alleged rape.\u201d Subsequently, she asked the complaining witness\u2019s mother directly, whether she was aware of the \u201cother allegations involving\u201d the petitioner and whether she had \u201cany recollection of having conversations about [the] allegations\u201d involving petitioner. Finally, prior to the petitioner being called to give testimony, the trial judge asked the State if it intended to use the petitioner\u2019s two prior sexual convictions to impeach his testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">When the petitioner took the witness stand, he testified as counsel, in opening statement, said he would: he denied ever having sexual contact with the complaining witness. He did, on the other hand, corroborate the complaining witness\u2019s testimony that, in August 2005, he was engaged to, and did, perform repairs to the complaining witness\u2019s family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">At the close of the evidence and after a brief recess, the trial judge, over the petitioner\u2019s objection, <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial. She explained, first, \u201cthe dilemma that I have\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201cThis case basically comes down to a he said/she said situation and if one chooses to believe [the complaining witness\u2019s] version of what happened, which was certainly credible, then a fact finder can make a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that [the petitioner] is guilty. Now if the fact finder elects not to believe [the complaining witness] and finds [the petitioner\u2019s] version more credible, then the Court would then have to return a verdict for, of not guilty. This is the dilemma that this Court has. Not placed into evidence, either by way of an impeachable conviction or evidence if admissible of other past wrong acts, this Court has knowledge that [the petitioner] has two convictions, sexual-related convictions involving young women under the age of 17 or 16. I did the first case____and Judge Cal Sanders did the second case____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Then she explained why she believed that it\u2014her knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s prior convictions and the partiality it engendered\u2014made it manifestly necessary for her to declare a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cI cannot extract out of my brain and my analysis of whether to believe [the petitioner] what I know from those other two cases. Now had there been other evidence in this case, forensic evidence, if, if perhaps [the complaining witness] had made a, a prompt report of the sexual assault, if [the petitioner] had made a statement in admission, all those things would alter my decision today, but I\u2019m basically left as a fact finder for deciding who I\u2019m going to believe just based upon their testimony. And it\u2019s a moral dilemma to me and I told counsel I don\u2019t take this lightly____[I]f this had been a jury trial, I wouldn\u2019t be in this dilemma, cause the jury\u2019s the fact finder, not the Court. I\u2019m the fact finder and I\u2019m not able to do it, knowing what I know about [the petitioner]. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m declaring a mistrial....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The petitioner subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. He argued that \u201cthere was not manifest necessity for the granting of the mistrial where [the trial judge] had knowledge of the prior [sexual assault] cases well before the trial began.\u201d The motion\u2019s judge denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s motion. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322 A.2d 880 (1974), he concluded that the trial judge \u201chad no choice but to declare a mistrial\u201d once she had \u201cperceived that the trial of [the] case could not proceed because of some prejudice to\u201d the petitioner. According to the motions judge, it is inconceivable that the trial judge could have known, prior to jeopardy attaching, that, to resolve the case, she would be required to weigh the credibility of the complaining witness against that of the petitioner, that the case would devolve into, in the words of the trial judge, a \u201che said/she said situation.\u201d He elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201c[The trial judge] had no way of knowing how this case was going to proceed. She could not know in advance what the victim was going to say. She could not know in advance that the Defendant might take the stand. And she certainly could not know in advance that this case would come down to what she determined to be a question of credibility of two witnesses. And only that. [Apparently there was no other evidence, DNA or scientific evidence to establish ..., one way or the other ..., the guilt or innocence of the Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling. The intermediate appellate court agreed with the petitioner \u201cthat an alternative in this case would have been a recusal prior to the attachment of jeopardy.\u201d Nevertheless, chiding the petitioner for \u201cimproperly focus[ing] on the process rather than the result,\u201d it rejected his argument in other respects. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that, knowing that the information she possessed about the petitioner\u2019s earlier convictions would be to his \u201cdetriment,\u201d the trial judge \u201cwas unable to see any other alternative to a mistrial.\u201d It also was persuaded that a mistrial was necessary because \u201cthe public\u2019s confidence in the rule of law would be harmed ... by having a partial judge decide [the] case.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The petitioner sought certiorari review of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision. We granted his petition, <em>Mansfield v. State, </em>415 Md. 40, 997 A.2d 791 (2010), to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>whether, where a trial judge, over defense counsel\u2019s objection and on the basis of information known by the judge prior to trial, declares a mistrial at the conclusion of all of the evidence in a bench trial, the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy is excused by the doctrine of manifest necessity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We shall hold that it is not, that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy remains applicable under such circumstances. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contains a Double Jeopardy Clause. That clause, like the Amendment itself, <em>see Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), is made applicable to State criminal prosecutions through the Fourteenth amendment. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 (1969) (holding that \u201cthe double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d); <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 691, 827 A.2d 68, 75 (2003) (\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides the criminally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>accused with protection from, <em>inter </em>alia, multiple punishment stemming from the same offense.\u201d); <em>State v.

State, </em>286 Md. 193, 201, 406 A.2d 909, 913 (1979) (\u201c[T]he prohibition against twice placing an accused in jeopardy contained in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is applicable to state criminal prosecution by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d); <em>Pugh v.

Providing that no person \u201cshall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb,\u201d \u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy[, the double jeopardy clause,] prohibits both successive prosecutions for the same offense as well as multiple punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 236, 772 A.2d 283, 299 (2001); <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 263, 373 A.2d 262, 264 (1977) citing <em>United States v.

State, </em>273 Md. 435, 444, 330 A.2d 169, 173 (1975) quoting <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 480, 91 S.Ct. 547, 555, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 554 (1971). Jeopardy, it is well settled, attaches when the defendant has been \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts, whether the trier be a jury or a judge,\u201d and thereby \u201csubjected to the risk of conviction.\u201d <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388-392, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 1062 -1065, 43 L.Ed.2d 265, 274-275 (1975). Indeed, that is said to be \u201cthe basic test of initial jeopardy.\u201d <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 688, 566 A.2d 120, 125 (1989), citing <em>Serfass, supra. </em>In Maryland, jeopardy, generally, attaches at a bench trial \u201cwhen the judge begins to hear or receive evidence.\u201d <em>See In re Kevin, </em>402 Md. 624, 636, 938 A.2d 826, 833 (2008); <em>In re Bennett, </em>301 Md. 517, 524, 483 A.2d 1242, 1245 (1984); <em>Blondes v. State, </em>273 Md. 435, 444, 330 A.2d 169, 174 (1975) <em>See also Daff, </em>in which, explicating <em>Serfass, </em>420 U.S. at 388, 95 S.Ct. at 1062, 43 L.Ed.2d at 274, we said: \u201c[i]n a nonjury trial, jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence.\u201d 317 Md. at 688, 566 A.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">It is now well settled that the double jeopardy clause will not bar a new trial when a mistrial, the abortion of the trial before verdict and without the defendant\u2019s consent, was declared out of \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165, 165 (1824); <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 461, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1069, 35 L.Ed.2d 425, 429 (1973); <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 480-481, 91 S.Ct. 547, 555, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 554 (1971); <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 368-69, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 1526, 6 L.Ed.2d 901, 905 (1961). In <em>Perez, </em>the United States Supreme Court, addressing the issue of a mistrial\u2019s impact on double jeopardy for the first time, enunciated the rule still followed today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cWe think, that, in all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favour of the prisoner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">22 U.S. at 580, 6 L.Ed. at 165. Although the mistrial reviewed in <em>Perez </em>and, thus, the rule announced, involved a jury trial, the same rule, and analysis, applies when the mistrial is declared in a bench trial. <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 315, 322 A.2d 880, 883 (1974). In that case, this Court applied the test announced in <em>Perez </em>to determine whether retrial of a defendant, who was on trial for murder, \u201cfollowing the trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial would violate the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 322 A.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The facts of <em>Cornish </em>and the Court\u2019s analysis are instructive. The defendant was charged with murder and related offenses. <em>Id. </em>Subsequent to requesting a jury trial and informing the trial court of his intent to file a motion to suppress if the State, which had not answered his discovery motion, attempted to introduce his inculpatory statement, the defendant elected a bench trial. <em>Id. </em>at 314, 322 A.2d at 882. The prosecutor called one witness, a police officer, who \u201ctestified as to the details of the crime and certain clothing and other objects found near the victim\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He then addressed the court: \u201cNow, Your Honor, inasmuch as it was anticipated that this case was going to be a guilty plea [on aj statement of facts, that is the only witness the State has available,\u201d thus, indicating his understanding that the defendant had agreed either to plead guilty or \u201callow the State to present the remainder of its case on an agreed statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Disagreeing with the State\u2019s recollection\u2014indicating instead that the agreement was to proceed on an agreed statement of facts \u201cif we could agree on a statement of facts\u201d\u2014defense counsel rejected the trial judge\u2019s suggestion that the case be continued, and, although willing to stipulate to the testimony of other police officers, objected to the use of his statement because of the discovery violation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The trial judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s statement, whereupon the defendant moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that he had been denied a speedy trial and \u201che is now in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 322 A.2d at 882. The State requested a continuance. <em>Id. </em>Denying both motions, <em>id. </em>at 315, 322 A.2d at 882, the trial judge declared a mistrial. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cSecondly,[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] is the fact that it was stated clearly, perhaps too clearly, that it was anticipated that a guilty plea was going to be entered. Now that was stated to the trier of the facts who had to judge the case and give a verdict on the issue of guilt or innocence, and I know that trial judges, experienced trial judges, are supposed to be able to, and I hope we can, as far as possible ignore prejudicial remarks during the course of trial where we are sitting as the trier of the facts and yet judges are human also, and subconsciously perhaps, this reference to the guilty plea was implanted in my mind, and keep in mind this was a murder case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">- \u201cAil criminal cases are serious but this probably is the most serious with which any defendant or any court can be faced. This was, I think, a prejudicial remark which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>have been very difficult for me to overcome in the ultimate judgment of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"><em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. at 315, 322 A.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The petitioner moved to dismiss the case on the ground of double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 322 A.2d at 883. That motion was denied by the motion judge. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 322 A.2d at 883. We affirmed that judgment. In doing so, we relied on \u201cthe basic principles for determining the permissibility of a retrial following a mistrial,\u201d set forth in <em>Perez, supra, </em>\u201cthe \u2018fountainhead decision\u2019 on the application of the Federal Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause to a retrial following the declaration of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. at 316, 322 A.2d at 883. We gleaned from it and subsequent Supreme Court cases addressing the issue that \u201c[t]he most significant guideline for the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion is that a mistrial is to be declared only where it is \u2018manifestly necessary,\u2019 or \u2018under urgent circumstances,\u2019 or \u2018only in very extraordinary and striking circumstances,\u2019 and declaring a mistrial is not \u2018to be lightly undertaken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 322 A.2d at 884 citing and quoting <em>United States v.

Comparing the situation of the trial judge in that case to that of an occurrence during a jury trial \u201cwhen it is made to appear to the court that ... the jurors, or any of them, are subject to such bias or prejudice as not to stand impartial between the government and the accused,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 321, 322 A.2d at 886, quoting <em>Simmons v.

Sartori, </em>730 F.2d 973, 975-976 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>Sartori, </em>albeit a jury case, is instructive. There, the Fourth Circuit held that the double jeopardy clause was violated when, after only four witnesses, during the first day of the trial of a case involving charges arising out of the defendant\u2019s practice of \u201cwholistic\u201d medicine in the treatment of cancer patients, the trial judge, who was an American Cancer Society (\u201cACS\u201d) lay leader, declared a mistrial, over the defendant\u2019s objection. The trial judge\u2019s involvement with the American Cancer Society and its potential impact on the ability of the trial judge to preside over the defendant\u2019s case was known by the parties prior to the start of trial. <em>Sartori, </em>730 F.2d at 974. Indeed, the prosecutor requested that the judge place his involvement on the record, which the judge did, noting that he was \u201cnot involved with the \u2018committee of unproven methods\u2019 which reviews alternative approaches to cancer cures similar to those advocated by practitioners\u201d like the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge\u2019s offer to recuse himself, if requested, was not accepted, either before or after the jury was empaneled. <em>Id. </em>at 974-75. After the third of the Government\u2019s witnesses had testified, the trial judge informed counsel \u201cthat he contemplated declaring a mistrial [because, according to his memorandum opinion, [he] believed at this point that because of his long involvement with the ACS, his continued presence at trial was not consistent with the appearance of judicial propriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730 F.2d at 975. He rejected a proposed alternative to mistrial\u2014the substitution of the trial judge pursuant to <em>Fed. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>R.Crim.P. </em>25(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014and, determining that there was no other, the trial judge declared a mistrial at the conclusion of the next witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">While the Fourth Circuit held that Fed.R.Crim.P. 25(a) provided a reasonable alternative to declaring a mistrial in that case, it was only one of several alternatives, in lieu of declaring of mistrial, that existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201cIn addition to the alternative authorized by <em>Fed. R.Crim. P. </em>25(a), other obvious and adequate alternatives to a mistrial were available in this case. If the [trial judge] had serious doubts about his ability to remain impartial, he should have recused himself before empaneling the jury. Similarly, his concerns about the appearance of judicial impropriety should have been addressed before jeopardy attached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 976. With regard to the latter, when recusal is premised on perception, the court noted, relying on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the ground for disqualification may be waived, after full disclosure. <em>Id. </em>We find the reasoning of, and the conclusions drawn by, the Fourth Circuit persuasive with regard to the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">There can be no question that the petitioner was placed in jeopardy once he was put to trial and the trial judge began to hear evidence. <em>See In re Kevin, </em>402 Md. 624, 636, 938 A.2d 826, 833 (2008) (Jeopardy, generally, attaches at a bench trial \u201cwhen the judge begins to hear or receive evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>dence.\u201d). We are left, thus, to determine whether, in the instant case, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to declare a mistrial. We hold that, rather than proceeding to try the petitioner, knowing what she did of his criminal history, the trial judge should have recused herself. It follows that the trial judge erred when, taking all the circumstances in consideration, she declared a mistrial, and thus, retrial of the petitioner is barred by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Prior to jeopardy attaching, the trial judge was aware that the petitioner had twice been convicted of committing sexual offenses against minors. She, herself, had presided over one of these earlier, unrelated sexual offense cases and she was well aware of the second case, which was presided over by a different trial judge. Moreover, the trial judge was aware of the substance of the State\u2019s case, at least that portion critical to the credibility of the complaining witness and its assessment. Before jeopardy attached, the State informed the court that the complaining witness would testify that the petitioner sexually assaulted her in the summer of 2005 and that she reported the assault some three years later, in June 2008, after hearing a sermon. The trial judge also knew who the other State\u2019s witnesses would be and, therefore, that there was not going to be forensic evidence. Finally, the trial judge knew, prior to jeopardy attaching, that the petitioner was the only defense witness expected to testify and, more important, that his testimony would be that the alleged offenses \u201cdid not happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The trial judge explained that her decision to declare a mistrial was made necessary because her knowledge of petitioner\u2019s two \u201csexual-related convictions involving young women under the age of 17 or 16\u201d could not be used to decide the case since the convictions were \u201cnot placed into evidence, either by way of an impeachable conviction or evidence if admissible of other past wrongs.\u201d As a result, although there was evidence tending to undermine the complaining witness\u2019s testimony, but, apparently none, other than the convictions, which were not themselves final, tending to undermine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>petitioner\u2019s,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the trial judge, being \u201cunable to extract out of [her] brain and [her] analysis of whether to believe [petitioner] knowing what [she knew] from those other two cases,\u201d could not proceed with the trial. The justification offered by the motions judge and the intermediate appellate court is the unforeseeability of the credibility determination that the judge was faced with at the close of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The trial judge knew, as any trial judge would, that part of her function in this trial was to make credibility determinations. After all, \u201c[determining the credibility of witnesses is the primary function of a fact finder.\u201d <em>Douglas v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 311, 317, 360 A.2d 474, 477 (1976). <em>See Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1991) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that ... the credibility of witnesses [is] always [a] matter for the [court] to determine when it is the trier of facts.\u201d) <em>Abbott v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 595, 615, 989 A.2d 795, 807 (2010) (\u201c[W]eighing the credibility of witnesses [is] always [a] matter for the fact finder.\u201d) And the credibility determinations that a trial judge will be required to make are not neatly catalogued or easily, if at all, predictable. Nor are they, or should they be, easy decisions. As fact-finder, the trial judge should have known and, indeed, anticipated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>possibility, that the case could come down to a \u201che said/she said\u201d case, that she would have to choose directly, and only, between the credibility of the complaining witness and that of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">This pre-jeopardy knowledge possessed by the trial judge, bearing as it did on the credibility of both the complaining witness and the petitioner, had direct significance to the ultimate issue she had to decide, the petitioner\u2019s guilt. That the information was not direct evidence of guilt, but pertained to credibility, is of no consequence. To be sure, consistent with the <em>Cornish </em>analysis, <em>see </em>272 Md. at 321-322, 322 A.2d at 886-887, the information that the trial judge, who was the trier of fact in this case, possessed about the petitioner\u2019s past criminal involvement, in particular that of a sexual nature with regard to minors, was of the kind that implicated, and undermined, the trial judge\u2019s impartiality. Unlike in <em>Cornish, </em>however, where the information, on the basis of which the trial judge declared a mistrial, was conveyed to the trial judge in remarks made by the prosecutor during trial\u2014after jeopardy had attached\u2014here, the information known by this trial judge predated the trial and, thus, the attachment of jeopardy. In this case, what the trial judge knew when she declared a mistrial and which prompted the mistrial was the same information she had prior to jeopardy attaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">It is when a trial judge\u2019s pre-jeopardy knowledge has a direct significance to the matter to be decided by the court that the impact of that knowledge on the trial judge\u2019s impartiality must be assessed. Where the trial judge is aware of the substance of the defense case; is knowledgeable of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions that have a direct significance to the case before the trial judge; and, through her own personal assessment, knows that she will be unable to assess the defendant\u2019s credibility in the absence of an admission by the petitioner or other evidence tending to undermine his credibility, retrial of the defendant, after a mistrial has been declared, is barred by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Under these circumstances, when it is the court that is the trier of facts, and the court\u2019s impartiality, whether due to a personal bias or prejudice towards a criminal defendant or an inability to resolve disputed factual allegations, is impaired, manifest necessity does not exist when the reasonable alternative of recusal existed prior to jeopardy attaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY.

This also is Maryland common law. In <em>State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 489, 659 A.2d 876, 879 (1995), we said: \"Under the Maryland common law of double jeopardy, a defendant cannot be 'put in jeopardy again for the same offense-in jeopardy of being convicted of a crime for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>which he had been acquitted; in jeopardy of being twice convicted and punished for the same crime.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 347, 577 A.2d 795, 800 (1990)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">. The trial judge also declared a mistrial because of the defendant\u2019s \u201csudden change of mind\u201d to have a bench trial in lieu of a jury trial; that it was \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to the petitioner when the State failed to respond to the petitioner\u2019s motion to obtain a copy of a statement given by the petitioner to the police; and that a continuance was impractical because the trial judge would have been unable to \"sit in fair and impartial judgment.\u201d <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 315, 322 A.2d 880, 883 (1974). The Court agreed with the defendant that none of these reasons sufficed to justify a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 321-322, 322 A.2d at 886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. These examples are by no means exhaustive of under what circumstances it is manifestly necessary, or not, to declare a mistrial. Whether manifest necessity to declare a mistrial and avoid double jeopardy exists is based upon the unique facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>395 Md. 73, 90, 909 A.2d 270, 280 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\"Of course, many different occurrences might lead to a concern that a juror's impartiality is impaired, but the same events might not be deemed to affect a judge's impartiality. This is because a judge\u2019s training and experience render him less susceptible to influence by improper remarks or occurrences at a trial. Thus, an event which would necessitate a mistrial where the trial is before a jury, might not require a mistrial in a non-jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\"><em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. at 322, 322 A.2d at 886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">. <em>Fed.R.Crim.P. </em>25(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\"If by reason of death, sickness or other disability the judge before whom a jury trial had commenced is unable to proceed with the trial, any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court, upon certifying that he has familiarized himself with the record of the trial, may proceed with and finish the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The trial judge did not believe the Rule provided an alternative for recusal; however, the Fourth Circuit disagreed, holding that \"disability\u201d was encompassed in the reasons for \u201crecusal.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sartori, </em>730 F.2d 973, 976 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b315-11\">. \"(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate [magistrate judge] of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\">. Although it is conceivable that forensic evidence may have supported the petitioner\u2019s denial of sexual contact, the tenor of the trial judge\u2019s remarks suggests that she was looking for evidence that would confirm the propriety of the use of the impeachment evidence. That certainly is the thrust of the examples she gave, one relating to the promptness of the complaining witness\u2019 reporting of the incident and the other, involving the petitioner\u2019s making an admission. As disturbing, if the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals are correct, is that information that implicates partiality may be known to the trier of fact, without the obligation of disclosure, and may be used if the proper predicate is presented and, if the proper predicate is not presented, will be the basis for a mistrial. This runs counter to the use of safeguards, such as <em>voir dire, </em>which are designed to make potential fact-finders disclose information that could implicate partiality before being selected. <em>See Jenkins v. State, </em>375 Md. 284 331, 825 A.2d 1008, 1035 (2003) (\"[Ojne of the ways to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial [fact-finder] is to expose the existence of factors which could cause a [fact-finder] to be biased or prejudiced through the process of <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d) The instant case is a bench trial, however, and no voir dire was available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
