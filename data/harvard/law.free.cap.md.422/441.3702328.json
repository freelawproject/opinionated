The petition concerned Respondent\u2019s conduct related to the representation of a client, Sylvia Robinson-Green, in a civil matter. Bar Counsel alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d): 1.1 (competence), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5 (fees), 1.16 (terminating representation), 8.1 (bar admission and disciplinary matters), and 8.4 (professional misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On March 2, 2010, we assigned the matter to the Honorable Larnzell Martin, Jr., of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, to conduct hearings and make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>unable to achieve personal service upon Respondent. On February 4, 2011, Petitioner served the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland, pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-753 and 16-811(c)(l)(x).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 10, 2011, Petitioner filed an Affidavit of Service and Certification of Compliance with Maryland Rule 16-753. Respondent filed no answer. Petitioner filed a Motion for Order of Default and requested that the matter be scheduled for a hearing. The Motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>granted on March 25, 2011, and a Notice of the Order of Default was sent to Respondent at his last known address.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Judge Martin held a hearing on April 27, 2011, that was then continued for further hearing on May 18. Respondent failed to appear on both dates. At the hearing, the factual allegations in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action were deemed admitted, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-323(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In an Opinion dated May 25, 2011, Judge Martin found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1 (competence), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5(a) (unreasonable fee), 1.16 (termination of representation), and 8.4(d) (professional misconduct).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Judge Martin made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">The Respondent was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals on December 28, 2004. On or about October 2008, Respondent was de-certified by Order of the Court of Appeals for failing to comply with his Pro-Bono Reporting requirement. On or about April 6, 2009, Respondent was decertified by Order of the Court of Appeals for failing to pay his annual assessment to the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">Respondent is also a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia. On or about April 30, 2009, the Respondent\u2019s right to practice law in the District of Columbia was suspended for non-payment of dues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>During times relevant to this matter, Respondent maintained an office for the practice of law in Montgomery and/or Prince George\u2019s Counties, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">On or about April 21, 2009, Petitioner received a complaint from Sylvia Robinson-Green, (hereafter \u201cRobinson-Green\u201d). The complaint alleged that Respondent represented the Complainant in a civil matter beginning on or about July 2006, that on or about April 2009 Respondent, without prior notification, failed to appear for a hearing and that Respondent\u2019s failure to appear resulted in the dismissal of her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Beginning on or about May 1, 2009, and continuing through June 5, 2009, Bar Counsel sent Respondent a series of letters notifying Respondent that Robinson-Green had made a complaint against him and requested that Respondent provide a written response to the allegations contained in Robinson-Green\u2019s complaint. Some of these letters were returned by the Postal Service, but others were not returned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">In a letter dated May 1, 2009, Respondent was also informed that it had come to Bar Counsel\u2019s attention that he was not currently in good standing due to his de-certification for non-compliance with the Pro Bono Reporting requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Respondent failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters requesting information concerning the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">On or about June 12, 2009, in an effort to locate the Respondent, Petitioner\u2019s investigator, Dennis F. Biennas, contacted the company that leased office space to the Respondent and determined that Respondent no longer maintained an office at that address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">Respondent failed to notify the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland of the change of his business address within 30 days of the change in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-811(e) 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">On or about June 9, 2009, Investigator Biennas was unable to locate Respondent at a residential address ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tained by Petitioner. He subsequently determined that the residence had been sold three months previously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">Respondent failed to notify the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland of the change in his residential address within 30 days of the change in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-811(e) 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">At trial, Robinson-Green testified that in the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006, she was looking for a lawyer because of problems she had with the purchase of her home. She went online and found Respondent\u2019s name. She contacted Respondent and he went over the contract and other paperwork for the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">Robinson-Green and Respondent met to discuss her problems at her home on more than one occasion. They never met at Respondent\u2019s office. Respondent agreed to file a lawsuit against two business entities from which Robinson-Green purchased her home. Respondent did not indicate that there would be any limitations on the amount of time he would be able to devote to her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">On or about July 9, 2007, Respondent provided Robinson-Green a Legal Services Agreement, (hereafter \u201cthe Agreement\u201d), providing that Respondent\u2019s firm would \u201cbring or defend all claims and/or proceedings [against three or more entities] with respect to the settlement and construction defects at [Robinson-Green\u2019s] residence ... and assert or controvert all issues therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">The Agreement also called for an hourly fee of $220 per hour for member attorneys and lesser amounts for other attorneys and assistants. Only Respondent provided legal services to Robinson-Green.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">The Agreement called for an initial deposit of $1,300. Robinson-Green was told to make payments in the amount of $1,300 on the first of each month. Robinson-Green made the initial payment and beginning in August 2007, made $1,300 monthly payments. The first payments were made through a service called PayPal. Subsequent payments were made by personal check. Robinson-Green made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>monthly payments even though she did not receive statements indicating how many hours Respondent spent on the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Robinson-Green provided all information requested by Respondent. She also made all payments of fees requested by Respondent up until the time she tried to contact him to ask about the status of the case and was unable to get in touch with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">Court records reflect that on June 15, 2007, Respondent filed a civil action on behalf of Robinson-Green and her then husband against Caruso Homes, Inc., and Maryland Homes CY LLC. Respondent subsequently filed an Amended Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">On October 19, 2007, both defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint, or in the Alternative to Stay Action Pending Arbitration, and for Other Relief. On November 21, 2007, Caruso Homes, Inc., filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint. Although Respondent filed a Line on December 13, 2007, indicating that the plaintiffs time for filing a responsive pleading was extended by agreement of the parties until December 24, 2007, Respondent did not file a response to either Motion on behalf of Robinson-Green. On November 30, 2007, the Court dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs Amended Complaint as to Caruso Homes, Inc., and Stayed the proceedings pending arbitration as to Maryland Homes CY, LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Respondent did not tell Robinson-Green about the defense Motion to Dismiss when it was filed in November 2007. She found out about the motion when she attended the Status Conference on March 21, 2008, and had not instructed him not to respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">On March 21, 2008, Robinson-Green attended a hearing in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for her case. She had received a notice from the Court and thought she might be needed as a witness that day. Prior to this hearing she had not heard from Respondent for at least a week to ten days. She expected that Respondent would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>there to represent her since Respondent had not informed her otherwise. Court records reflect that a Status Conference was scheduled for March 21, 2008, and that it was continued until May 2, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">Robinson-Green did not hear from Respondent between March 21 and May 2, 2008. She tried to find another attorney to represent her before the May 2, 2008, Status Conference; however, she was not successful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Robinson-Green has not heard from Respondent since prior to March 21, 2008. He never provided an explanation for not continuing to represent her. It is her opinion that Respondent did not earn the approximately $10,000 which she paid him. He has not refunded any of the fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Robinson-Green\u2019s complaint was dismissed. Her subsequent efforts to have it reinstated were not successful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">Robinson-Green would not have engaged Respondent to represent her if he had told her that he would be unable to continue to represent her through to the conclusion of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">In the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC): 1.1, dealing with competence, 1.3, dealing with diligence, 1.4, dealing with communications with the client, 1.5(a), dealing with the reasonableness of fees, 1.16, dealing with the termination of representation, and 8.4(d), dealing with conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. For the reasons set out below, this Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated each of these rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\n<em>A. MRPC 1.1</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">MRPC 1.1 provides: <em>A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>In June/July 2007, Respondent was engaged to represent Ms. Robinson-Green in connection with civil litigation. Although Respondent filed both an initial Complaint and a subsequent Amended Complaint, and obtained an extension of time in which to respond to the defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, he never filed a response to these Motions. On or about March 21, 2008, without explanation or prior notice to the client, Respondent failed to appear at a Status Conference thereby abandoning his client. The clear and convincing evidence established that, following the commencement of the litigation, Respondent completely failed to act to protect the client\u2019s interests. <em>See, Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guido, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006) (Even if an attorney possesses the necessary legal knowledge and skill to handle a particular case, the attorney may violate MRPC 1.1 by doing virtually nothing to pursue the case.); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 402-403, 784 A.2d 516, 531-32 (2001) (An attorney\u2019s failure to appear in court for scheduled proceedings for which he was retained, without an acceptable explanation for the absence, violated MRPC 1.1.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>B. MRPC 1.3</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">MRPC 1.3 provides that: <em>A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">As demonstrated above, there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent failed to respond to the defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss, failed to appear for a status conference on March 21, 2008 and abandoned the representation of Ms. Robinson-Green without notice or explanation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>C. MRPC 1.4</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">MRPC 1.4 provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\n<em>(a) A lawyer shall:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\n<em>(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\n<em>(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>(S) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>(Jt) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">Respondent violated MRPC 1.4 when he failed to keep Ms. Robinson-Green informed concerning the status of her case, failed to inform her about the pending Motions to Dismiss, failed to respond to Robinson-Green\u2019s reasonable requests for information about the case and failed to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation. Respondent abandoned the client in the midst of litigation without prior consultation or notice. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\n<em>D. MRPC 1.5</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">MRPC 1.5(a) provides: <em>A lawyer shall not make an agreement for; charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable am,ownt for expenses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">While Respondent\u2019s hourly rate of $220 per hour was reasonable at the time of the engagement, the total fee paid of approximately $10,000 was clearly unreasonable in light of the lack of services provided and Respondent\u2019s abandonment of the representation. <em>See, Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006) (When an attorney agreed to represent clients in an adoption case, and they paid him an agreed fee, while that fee was not, on its face, unreasonable for handling such a case, it became unreasonable, under MRPC 1.5(a), because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the attorney did virtually no work after he received the fee.); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 392, 794 A.2d 92, 103 (2002) (A fee for representing a client is unreasonable when the attorney provides little or no services in return for the money paid.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\n<em>E. MRPC 1.16</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">MRPC 1.16 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\n<em>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\n<em>(1) the representation will result in violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\n<em>(2) the lawyer\u2019s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer\u2019s ability to represent the client; or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\n<em>(3) the lawyer is discharged.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">\n<em>(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">\n<em>(1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">\n<em>(2) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer\u2019s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">\n<em>(3) the client has used the lawyer\u2019s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">\n<em>(h) the client insists upon action or inaction that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">\n<em>(5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer\u2019s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\n<em>(6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\n<em>(7) other good cause for withdrawal exists.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and properly to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Respondent terminated the representation when he abandoned Ms. Robinson-Green in the course of the litigation. He failed to give the client reasonable notice of his intent to cease representing her, did not allow time for her to engage another attorney and failed to take any steps to protect her interests. He also failed to refund any portion of the approximately $10,000 paid to him by Robinson-Green for the representation. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\n<em>F. MRPC 8.4(d)</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">MRPC 8.4(d) provides, in relevant part, that: <em>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. </em>Conduct that reflects negatively on the legal profession and sets a bad example for the public at large is prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 22, 922 A.2d 554, 566 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">Respondent\u2019s failure to act to protect Robinson-Green\u2019s interests and abandonment of her in the midst of litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>without notice or explanation after taking approximately $10,000 from Robinson-Green certainly reflects negatively on the legal profession. There is, therefore, clear and convincing evidence that Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Commission v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 82, 753 A.2d 17, 41 (2000) (holding that failure to represent a client in an adequate manner violated MRPC 8.4(d).); and <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Singleton, </em>315 Md. 1, 7-8, 553 A.2d 222, 224 (1989) (A lawyer\u2019s neglect and lack of competence constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">(footnotes and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Judge Martin found no mitigating factors.

Comm\u2019n v. Carithers, </em>421 Md. 28, 42, 25 A.3d 181, 190 (2011). In the course of this independent review, \u201cthe hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 25 A.3d at 190. Because neither party filed exceptions, we may treat the hearing judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). We conduct an independent review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Md. Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Neither party filed exceptions to Judge Martin\u2019s findings of fact. Thus, we accept those findings as established for the purpose of determining an appropriate sanction. For the reasons that follow, we also agree with Judge Martin\u2019s conclusions of law that Respondent violated Rules 1.1,1.3,1.4, 1.5(a), 1.16, and 8.4(d). We consider each of those conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Rule 1.1 requires competence in representation of clients. A violation occurs when there is \u201c[e]vidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006). The finding of a violation does not depend upon a showing that the attorney lacked the requisite legal knowledge. <em>Id., </em>891 A.2d at 1097. Rather, it can be established by evidence that the attorney was not sufficiently thorough or prepared. <em>Id., </em>891 A.2d at 1097. Respondent began his representation of Robinson-Green in a competent manner: He filed the initial Complaint; he then filed an Amended Complaint; and he sought an extension of time to respond to the defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss. That said, Respondent\u2019s failure to file a reply to the Motions to Dismiss or to appear at the scheduled Status Conference in connection with the matter clearly establishes a violation of Rule 1.1. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 736, 28 A.3d 1196, 1213 (2011) (holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>attorney in that case violated Rule 1.1 when, knowing of a pending Motion to Dismiss, the attorney failed to file any motion to prevent dismissal, causing his client\u2019s case to be subsequently dismissed).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Rule 1.3 requires diligence and promptness in the representation of a client. Respondent failed to file a response to the Motions to Dismiss his client\u2019s complaint. He also failed to appear for a scheduled Status Conference. These actions show, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent neglected entirely to represent Robinson-Green as of March 21, 2008. Such neglect constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>violation of Rule 1.3. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 371, 974 A.2d 331, 354 (2009) (finding an attorney\u2019s failure to respond to motions to dismiss and attend a court hearing constituted unjustifiable inattentiveness to the client\u2019s interests and was a violation of Rule 1.3); <em>see Patterson, </em>421 Md. at 736, 28 A.3d at 1213 (finding a violation of Rule 1.3 based on evidence that the attorney failed to pursue his client\u2019s claim by neglecting to undertake research or collect documents in support of the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Rule 1.4 requires prompt communication with clients. Respondent failed to keep Robinson-Green informed of the status of her case despite Robinson-Green\u2019s repeated attempts to reach him. Additionally, Respondent never informed Robinson-Green that the defendants in her case had filed Motions to Dismiss, or that a Status Conference had been scheduled. Rather, Robinson-Green learned about the Status Conference upon receipt of the court\u2019s notices. She attended the Status Conference, and she expected that Respondent would be present, too. Respondent did not appear. Respondent\u2019s failure to inform the client of these important motions and a scheduled court matter reflects a blatant failure to communicate promptly with the client, a clear violation of Rule 1.4. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Fox, </em>417 Md. 504, 532, 11 A.3d 762, 778 (2010) (finding a violation of Rule 1.4 when an attorney did not keep clients reasonably informed and ignored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>clients\u2019 requests for information about the progress of their cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Rule 1.5(a) requires reasonableness in the charging and collection of fees. Respondent violated this rule by collecting a fee disproportionate to services rendered and continuing to collect fees after he had abandoned the representation of Robinson-Green. Respondent\u2019s hourly rate of $220 was not unreasonable on its face at the outset of Respondent\u2019s representation of Robinson-Green. Yet, Respondent ultimately collected $10,000 in fees without providing commensurate services. Respondent\u2019s neglect in and abandonment of his representation of Robinson-Green provide clear and convincing evidence that the $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees he received from Robinson-Green was wholly disproportionate, and unreasonable, in relation to the services he provided, constituting a violation of Rule 1.5(a). <em>Patterson, </em>421 Md. at 731-32, 28 A.3d at 1210 (explaining that an otherwise-reasonable fee may become excessive, under Rule 1.5(a), when an attorney wholly fails to provide diligent or competent representation for a matter); <em>Guida, </em>391 Md. at 52-53, 891 A.2d at 1096-97 (concluding that a fee can be initially reasonable, yet become unreasonable once the fee is collected but the attorney performs little to no work for the client).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Rule 1.16 requires an attorney to provide adequate notice and care when terminating the representation of a client. Respondent abandoned Robinson-Green\u2019s case by neglecting to respond to the defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss, failing to appear at a scheduled court date, failing to inform Robinson-Green that he intended to end his representation, and failing to refund any unearned portion of the $10,000 fee Robinson-Green paid him. This obvious failure to protect the client\u2019s interests is clear and convincing evidence of a violation of Rule 1.16. <em>Patterson, </em>421 Md. at 734-35, 28 A.3d at 1212 (finding that an attorney\u2019s failure to refund attorney\u2019s fees after providing no meaningful services and being subsequently terminated constituted a violation of Rule 1.16); <em>Fox, </em>417 Md. at 532-33, 11 A.3d at 778 (abandonment of a client matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>without notice disregarded client\u2019s interests in pursuing the matter with a new attorney and was a violation of Rule 1.16).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Rule 8.4(d) prohibits an attorney from \u201cengaging] in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d After Respondent abandoned his representation of Robinson-Green, she was unable to reinstate her claims. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s conduct severely obstructed the administration of justice. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Thaxton, </em>415 Md. 341, 356, 1 A.3d 470, 479 (2010) (attorney\u2019s failure to appear at two hearings, which resulted in the dismissal of his client\u2019s case, was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d)). We have said that \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d is that which \u201creflects negatively on the legal profession and sets a bad example for the public at large[.]\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 556, 16 A.3d 181, 194 (2011) (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 22, 922 A.2d 554, 566 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Respondent abandoned representation of a client during the course of litigation without notice. He accepted a fee of $10,000 without rendering appropriate services. These actions reflect negatively on the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In sum, based on our independent review of the record, we conclude that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), 1.16, and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Petitioner recommends disbarment as the sanction for Respondent\u2019s violations of the MRPC. Petitioner argues that disbarment is appropriate because Respondent\u2019s violations \u201cconstituted a betrayal of the trust placed in him by his client.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u201cIt is well-settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev.

Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 760-61, 736 A.2d 339, 343-44 (1999) (internal quotation mark and citations omitted)). This goal is generally accomplished \u201cthrough deterrence of \u2018the type of conduct which will not be tolerated\u2019 and by removing those unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev.

Post, </em>379 Md. 60, 70, 839 A.2d 718, 724 (2003)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 655-56, 835 A.2d 542, 547 (2003), this Court held that disbarment was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d) and 8.4(d). Like Respondent in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>Tinsky\u2019s conduct resulted in his client\u2019s case being dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 835 A.2d at 544. Tinsky further neglected to respond to his client\u2019s attempts to contact him, failed to keep the client informed as to the status of the case, and failed to refund any unearned portion of the fee previously collected. <em>Id., </em>835 A.2d at 544. This conduct amounted to effective abandonment of the client, and was sufficient to justify disbarment as the appropriate sanction, regardless of Tinsky\u2019s lack of any previous disciplinary history. <em>Id. </em>at 654-55, 835 A.2d at 547. We have reached the same conclusion in other comparable matters. <em>See, e.g., Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545 (holding that disbarment was the appropriate sanction for an attorney despite the fact that \u201cthe case at bar does not indicate that respondent has received any previous reprimands or sanctions from this Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Accordingly, we order disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ANDRE LEVELL BRADY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-10\">.
