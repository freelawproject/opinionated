Brisbon, Respondent, was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 20, 1977, and was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law on March 17, 2005. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brisbon, </em>385 Md. 667, 676, 870 A.2d 586, 591 (2005). On August 23, 2010, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, Petitioner, filed a PETITION FOR DISCIPLINARY OR REMEDIAL ACTION against Respondent. On August 24, 2010, this Court ordered that the charges against Respondent \u201cbe heard and determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Judge Charles J.

Three exceptions complain that the Hearing Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions did not include any discussion of (1) Respondent\u2019s background, (2) the fact that there were two \u201cimmigration consultant\u201d signs outside Respondent\u2019s office, and (3) the fact that Respondent used a computer program to complete the immigration forms that she prepared for Mr. and Mrs. Nkrumah. Two exceptions complain that the Hearing Judge made erroneous factual findings. Two exceptions involve Respondent\u2019s assertion that (in the words of her Exceptions), \u201cBar Counsel failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that [Respondent] committed unauthorized practice of law.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we shall overrule each of Respondent\u2019s exceptions, and order that she remain suspended indefinitely from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">MRPC 1.1, in pertinent part, states that a lawyer \u201cshall provide competent representation to a client.\u201d MRPC 1.4(a)(4), in pertinent part, states that a lawyer \u201cshall consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\u201d MRPC 1.5(a), in pertinent part, states that a lawyer \u201cshall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses.\u201d MRPC 5.5(a), states that \u201ca lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">MRPC 8.4, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The record includes the following \u201cSTIPULATIONS OF FACT\u201d signed by the Respondent, Respondent\u2019s hearing counsel, and Bar Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">The Petitioner, the Attorney Grievance commission of Maryland, by its attorney, Gail D.

That since Respondent was indefinitely suspended on March 17, 2005, she has not been reinstated to the Maryland State Bar or admitted to any State Bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">6. On June 20, 2008, Kobina Nkrumah met with the Respondent at her office in Baltimore City</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">7. On June 20, 2008, Respondent accepted a $100.00 fee for her consultation with Kobina Nkrumah about handling Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s immigration matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">8.

Mr. Nkrumah and Mrs. Smoot-Nkrumah paid Respondent $1,200.00 to handle Kobina Nkrumah\u2019s immigration matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">11. Respondent gave Kobina Nkrumah a July 2008 receipt for payment of $600.00. That receipt identified the Respondent as an attorney.

Mr. Nkrumah and Mrs. Smoot-Nkrumah gave Respondent two money orders totaling $1,365.00 to be submitted with their application forms to The Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The two money orders totaling $1,365.00 are attached hereto and incorporated herein as exhibit number 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">15. Respondent prepared Mr. Nkrumah and Mrs. SmootNkrumah\u2019s application forms that were submitted to The Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Respondent failed to appear at Mr. Nkrumah and Mrs. Smoot-Nkrumah\u2019s January 22, 2009 scheduled interview/meeting with The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. She had been admitted to the hospital the day before the scheduled meeting, and was not discharged until January 26, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The Hearing Judge\u2019s FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">The Court finds the following facts have been established by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">7. In 2006 or 2007, the Respondent opened an office as an \u201cImmigration Consultant at 228 East 25th Street, First Floor, Baltimore, Maryland 21218. On the Respondent\u2019s \u201cImmigration Consultant\u201d stationary, the Respondent listed the same telephone number, (410) 467-3833, and facsimile number, (410) 467-1165, used by the Respondent for her law practice ... The Respondent also produced business cards listing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">BRENDA C. BRISBON, P.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abi\">Immigration Consultant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">Although the Respondent used the title of \u201cBrenda C. Brisbon, P.A.,\u201d she was unable to state whether or not her professional association was still in existence in 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>8. Other than chance observations by the Respondent of two unidentified men who claimed to be immigration consultants, the Respondent failed to take any steps to familiarize herself with the legal limitations and duties of an immigration consultant. The Respondent was not familiar with the Maryland Immigration Consultant Act (\u201cMICA\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 14-3301 to -3306 of the Commercial Law Article. The Respondent worked as an immigration consultant for clients other than the Complainant in this case. The number of clients, however, was never provided to the Court. As part of her duties as an immigration consultant, the Respondent testified that she would fill out forms, assist clients in filling out forms, and submit the completed forms to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">9. On June 20, 2008, Kobina Nkrumah (\u201cNkrumah\u201d or \u201cMr. Nkrumah\u201d) met with the Respondent at her office located at 228 East 25th Street, First Floor, Baltimore, Maryland 21218. At that meeting the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">a. Nkrumah advised the Respondent that he had recently married an American citizen and that he wanted his new wife to sponsor him for status as a permanent resident in the United States. According to Respondent, Nkrumah\u2019s case presented a \u201cpotential difficulty,\u201d as Nkrumah had made the same request to the USCIS on a previous occasion based on an earlier marriage to another American Citizen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">b. The Respondent agreed to fill out the necessary forms for this process and submit the forms to the USCIS. The Respondent provided Mr. Nkrumah with a list entitled \u201cAdditional Documents Needed for Adjustment of Status (Form 1-285)\u201d... The Respondent also wrote information about fee on this list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">c. Nkrumah and the Respondent agreed that the fee for these services would be $1,000. The Respondent charged Nkrumah $100 as an initial consultation fee. No written contract or agreement was ever executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">d. The respondent filled out a form entitled \u201cInitial Consultation Sheet\u201d with the following heading:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Law office of </em>BRENDA C. BRISBON, P.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">The Court does not find that this form was shown to Mr. Nkrumah. The Form shows that the Respondent engaged in an extensive interview with Mr. Nkrumah and obtained significant personal and legal information, including Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s marital status and employment history, as well as the history of any prior immigration filings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">10. On July 11, 2008, Mr. Mkrumah and his wife, Nicole Smoot-Nkrumah, met with th Respondent. At that meeting, the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">a. The respondent prepared the following forms:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">(1) 1-130, Petition for Alien Relative ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">(2) 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">(3) 1-765, Application for Employment Authorization ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4u\">(4) G-325A, Biographic Information for both Mr. Nkrumah and Mrs. Smoot-Nkrumah ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">(5) 1-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the Act ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-13\">Although the 1-130, 1-485, and 1-765 forms had signature lines for the \u201cperson preparing\u201d such forms, the Respondent failed to sign any of the forms or note that she prepared the forms. Although the Respondent testified that these omissions were an \u201coversight,\u201d the Court does not find her testimony credible. The court finds that an oversight may have been failing to sign one form but not failing to sign all of the forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">b. The Nkrumahs provided the Respondent with two money orders in the total amount of $1365 payable to the USCIS to cover the filing fees ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-15\">c. The Respondent agreed to accompany the Nkrumahs to their interview with the United States Immigration Officer for an additional fee of $200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>d. The Nkrumahs paid the Respondent $600, and the Respondent gave them a receipt for the payment ... The receipt was signed by the respondent and had the following heading:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">LAW OFFICE OF BRENDA C. BRISBON</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">22 EAST 25TH STREET</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A09\">Baltimore, MD 21218</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQi\">TEL. (410) 467-3833</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al-\">FAX: 410 467-1165</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">On the same date, prior to this meeting, the Respondent received in the mail a letter from a health insurance company ... denying the Respondent health insurance coverage. The letter included laboratory results indicating that the Respondent was (gravely ill]. The Respondent was emotionally distraught after the receipt of this information. Nonetheless, the Respondent decided to go ahead with the meeting with the Nkrumahs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">11. On July 15, 2008, the Respondent sent to the Nkrumahs by facsimile an \u201cI 864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\u201d ... The facsimile copy shows that the form had been sent \u201cFROM THE LAW OFFICE, BRENDA BRISBON PHONE NO.:4104673833 Jul. 15 2008 02:14 P.M.\u201d The I-864A form sent by facsimile was executed by the Nkrumahs and then returned to the Respondent. The executed form was located in the Respondent\u2019s office file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">12. On or about July 22, 2008, the Respondent filed with the USCIS the documents she prepared on behalf of the Nkrumahs ... With these documents, she also submitted a cover letter, which identified the Respondent as an immigration consultant. She did not copy that letter to the Nkrumahs, nor was there testimony that she gave the Nkrumahs a copy of that letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">13. On or about August 1, 2008, the Respondent sent a letter to Mr. Nkrumah stating that there had been \u201cdifficulties regarding the Form 1-765 (Application for Employment Authorization)\u201d... The first Form 1-765 submitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Respondent was outdated, and the Respondent enclosed a current version of Form 1-765. The Respondent prepared the form, but once again, she failed to sign the form as the preparer. Respondent\u2019s letter further explained to Mr. Nkrumah that there was no additional filing fee required and requested that the form be mailed directly to USCIS. The Respondent\u2019s letter was not on her Immigration Consultant letterhead. The Court finds that the Respondent never gave the Nkrumahs any document that would have identified the Respondent as an immigration consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">14. On or about October 22, 2003, the Respondent, as stated on \u201cStatus Notes and Communications\u201d in Respondent\u2019s office file ... called Mr. Nkrumah, and Mr. Nkrumah stated that he would send the Respondent a check for $300. The Respondent noted that the balance due as of that date was $600 for a total fee of $1200. This fee included the $200 charge for the Respondent\u2019s attendance at the Nkrumahs\u2019 interview with the United States Immigration Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">15. On or about October 27, 2008, the Nkrumahs received from the USCIS a \u201cRequest for Applicant to Appear for Initial Interview\u201d scheduling the interview for December 18, 2008 ... On or about November 13, 2008, the interview was cancelled by the USCIS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">16. On or about November 26, 2008, the Nkrumahs received another \u201cRequest for Applicant to Appear for Initial Interview\u201d rescheduling the interview for January 22, 2009 ... The Respondent was notified of this date. It is noted on the \u201cRequest for Applicant to Appear for Initial Interview\u201d that the Nkrumahs could be accompanied by an \u201cattorney or authorized representative.\u201d The Respondent testified that although she believed that this was a \u201cgray area,\u201d she believed that she could accompany the Nkrumahs as an authorized representative. Under federal regulations, a person appearing before the USCIS may only be \u201crepresented by an attorney in the United States ..., an attorney outside of the United states ..., or an accredited representative.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2(a)(3). An accredited representative is defined as \u201c[a] person representing an organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>described in [8 C.F.R. \u00a7] 292.2,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.1(a)(4), which is \u201ca non-profit religious, charitable, social service or similar organization established in the United States and recognized as such by the Board [of Immigration Appeals],\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.2(a). The Respondent did not qualify as an accredited or authorized representative. The Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s testimony about a \u201cgray area\u201d was not credible. The Court finds that the Respondent, having practiced exclusively as an immigration lawyer for over ten years with approximately 2000 clients, would have been aware of the federal regulations governing such proceedings. The Respondent further testified that, in retrospect, her decision to agree to attend the interview was a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d This Court finds that this statement was merely a post hoc characterization to disguise the Respondent\u2019s decision to attend the interview knowing that, as a suspended attorney, she was not authorized to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">17. The Respondent agreed to represent the Nkrumahs at their January 22, 2009, interview with the USCIS in Fair-fax, Virginia. The Respondent, however, failed to appear at the Nkrumah\u2019s interview on January 22, 2009, because she was admitted to the hospital the day before the interview and was not discharged until January 26, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">18. On or about January 25, 2009, the Respondent received a telephone call from the Nkrumahs, who were enraged by the failure of the Respondent to attend the interview. The Respondent testified that, at some point, she met with the Nkrumahs and offered to refund the fee she received from them. The Respondent testified, however, that the Nkrumahs told her to keep the money. The Court does not find this testimony credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">19. As stipulated by the parties, the Respondent never told the Nkrumahs that she was not currently admitted to the Maryland State Bar and could not practice law. Although the Court finds that the Respondent was, at the very least, grossly negligent in her use of stationery and a facsimile transmission listing the Respondent as an attorney over three years after her suspension, because the Nkrumahs did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>not testify and the Petitioner did not offer the testimony of any other client of the Respondent, this Court cannot find by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent affirmatively represented herself as an attorney to the Nkrumahs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">C. Respondent engaged in the Unauthorized Practice of Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">This court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. In acting as an \u201cimmigration consultant\u201d for the Nkrumahs, the Respondent went far beyond \u201cpurely mechanical type functions[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">... The Respondent engaged in an in-depth interview with Mr. Nkrumah in which the Respondent obtained significant personal and other legal information with the obvious intention of developing information to prepare the appropriate forms for an application to the USCIS to adjust Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s status to a permanent resident. In doing so, the Respondent necessarily analyzed what legally needed to be done, made a determination as to which forms would be needed for the application, and provided Mr. Nkrumah with a list of documents that he had to produce so that such documents could be attached to the proper forms submitted to the USCIS. At this first meeting alone, the Respondent engaged in the \u201cpreparation of legal documents, their interpretation, the giving of legal advice, [and] the application of legal principles to [complex] problems.\u201d <em>Lukas [v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Montgomery County </em>], 35 Md.App. [442], 448, 371 A.2d [669], 673 (1977). Consequently, she engaged in the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">At the July 11, 2008 meeting, moreover, this unauthorized practice of law continued. The Respondent finalized which forms were needed to obtain Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>resident status. She also prepared a form for an employment authorization for Mr. Nkrumah. As noted in <em>[Unauthorized Practice Comm. v.] Cortez, </em>692 S.W.2d [47], 50 [ (Tex.1985) ], the Respondent\u2019s \u201cselecting and preparing the various immigration forms required legal skill and knowledge.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he choice of a form and the information to include in its blanks can turn on subtle facts that may not be apparent to those without legal training.\u201d <em>[State ex rel. Indiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v.] Diaz, </em>838 N.E.2d [433], 445 [ (Ind.2005).] The Court would also note that under federal regulations, the practice of immigration law includes \u201cthe preparation or filing of any brief or other document, paper, application, or petition on behalf of another person or client before or with the [USCIS].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 l.l(i). Finally, the Respondent agreed to appear with the Nkrumahs in an interview with officials at the USCIS. Although the Respondent ultimately failed to appear, the Respondent engaged in the practice of law when she agreed to appear. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 l.l(i) (\u201cThe term practice means the act or acts of any person appearing in any case ... on behalf of another person or client before or with DHS.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">The Respondent, thereafter, prepared additional forms, including \u201cI-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\u201d ... The preparation of this \u201ccontract,\u201d along with the earlier preparation of the companion 1-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the Act\u201d ... gives this Court great concern. Under the terms of the \u201ccontract\u201d and the \u201caffidavit,\u201d Mrs. Nkrumah agreed \u201cto be jointly and severally liable\u201d for significant financial support for Mr. Nkrumah. As noted in Gordon Mailman &amp; Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure, \u00a7 63.05, \u201c[t]he 1-864 process has caused much confusion, and ... [b]ecause 1-864 and any I 864A is a legally binding contract, [family] sponsors [i.e. Mrs. Smoot-Nkrumah] should take care in its execution.\u201d The Form 1-864 itself has the following warning: \u201cPlease read the following information carefully before you sign the Form 1-864. If you do not understand the obligations, you may wish to consult an attorney or accredit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ed representative\u201d ...

In many States it has been held that the legislative branch cannot constitutionally exercise that judicial function although it may make implementing regulations. In Maryland there has always been a comfortable accommodation in this area ... The legislature has forbidden the practice of law by one not a lawyer ... but it consistently has recognized that the courts can and should decide in any instance presented to what does and what does not constitute the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\">The fact that the legislature has occasionally spoken in specified areas on unlawful practice does not mean that it has attempted to exclude judicial or quasi-judicial bodies from acting at all or in other areas. For example, the legislative choice to specify that no person but a lawyer should be allowed a fee for appearing before the Unemployment Security Board means no more, it would seem, than the desire to offer simple protection to extremely vulnerable people, largely unable or unwilling as a practical matter to defend themselves, from being preyed on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><em>Id. </em>583-584, 253 A.2d at 851. (Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We reject the argument that the Hearing Judge erred in finding by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent \u201cengaged in the unauthorized practice of law [i]n acting as an \u2018immigration consultant\u2019 for the Nkrumahs.\u201d In its \u201cdesire to offer simple protection to extremely vulnerable people, largely unable or unwilling as a practical mater to defend themselves, from being preyed on,\u201d the General Assembly has enacted the <em>Maryland Immigration Consultant Act </em>(MICA), which is codified in \u00a7\u00a7 14-3301 to -3306 of the Commercial Law Article. The legislative history of this statute makes it clear that MICA was enacted to curtail some of the \u201cegregious practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that ... immigration consultants [had engaged in].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 14-3301, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\u00a7 14-3301.

Accordingly, we sustain the Hearing Judge\u2019s finding that Respondent violated Rule 5.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The Respondent also noted exceptions to the Hearing Judge\u2019s conclusions that she had violated rules 1.1,1.4,1.5 and 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). As Respondent concedes, however, these exceptions have no merit unless this Court holds that she was not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Because she did engage in the unauthorized practice of law, these exceptions are also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">II. Respondent\u2019s Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">In imposing the appropriate sanction, this Court has repeatedly emphasized three vital considerations. First, \u201ceach attorney grievance case rests on its own merits.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 529, 979 A.2d 146, 159 (2009). Second, \u201cthe purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the erring attorney, only to protect the clients whom attorneys serve.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Elmendorf, </em>404 Md. 353, 363, 946 A.2d 542, 548 (2008). Third, as this Court stated in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 955 A.2d 755 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">The public is best protected when sanctions are imposed commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>conduct and the intent with which it was committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 223, 892 A.2d 533, 541 (2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">The severity of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case, taking account of any particular aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). In determining the appropriate sanction, we have often looked to the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, reprinted in LAWYERS\u2019 MANUAL ON PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT (2003) (ABA Standards). <em>Id. </em>at 488, 671 A.2d at 483. These standards create an organizational framework that calls for a consideration of four questions: (1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances? See ABA Standards, Standard 3.0, at 17. Also relevant are the following [\u201cmitigating\u201d] factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (quoting ABA Standards, Standard 9.32, at 41-42).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 955 A.2d at 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Petitioner recommends that Respondent be disbarred. That is not an unreasonable recommendation, and would ordinarily be imposed on a former lawyer who engaged in the unauthorized practice of law at a time when\u2014by order of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Court\u2014the former lawyer had no right to do so. In the case at bar, however, Respondent\u2019s counsel requests that this Court continue Respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension. In support of that request, Respondent\u2019s counsel asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">As [Respondent] told the [C]ircuit [C]ourt, she has no intention of ever practicing law again. Nor does she intend to work as an immigration consultant. This is partly due to her declining health, and partly due to her plans to go to Africa in the near future to pursue a non-legal job there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Because [Respondent] will never practice again, and will never seek reinstatement, the public would be adequately protected by her continued suspension....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">Finally, [Respondent] has done a lot of good in her career, and she respectfully asks that the Court consider this. She has helped hundreds of clients, and gained neither fame nor fortune. The mistakes she made, and for which she has accepted responsibility, occurred at the end of her career, at a time when her physical health was failing. She only hopes now her name will not be permanently tarnished by disbarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the case at bar, it is not necessary to disbar Respondent in order to send a clear message to the Bar that the sanction of disbarment will ordinarily be imposed for the unauthorized practice of law by a lawyer at a time when he or she was suspended from practice by order of this Court. Because Md. Rule 16-760(f) provides for the protection of the public by authorizing Bar Counsel to take further action against Respondent in the unlikely event that Respondent ever again engages in the unauthorized practice of law, in light of Respondent\u2019s failing health and intent to return to her homeland, we hereby order that the indefinite suspension imposed by this Court on March 17, 2005, be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AND AGAINST BRENDA C.
