On appeal, Derr challenges the admission of forensic evidence introduced at trial through the testimony of an expert witness who did not take part in or observe the physical testing of the evidence, or independently determine the test results. In the Court of Special Appeals, Derr presented the following questions for review:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">1. Whether Derr\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights of confrontation were violated when the State was permitted to introduce the opinion of a serology examiner and the results of DNA testing of biological evidence through the testimony of an expert who did not participate either directly or in a supervisory capacity, without calling the analyst who performed the testing as a witness or showing that the analyst was unavailable and Derr had a prior opportunity to cross-examine? <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">2. Whether Derr\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to discovery were violated when the State used a statistical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>method to describe the rarity of a DNA profile that did not quantify the chance of a coincidental match where the coincidental match number was required to demonstrate the limitation of the State\u2019s chosen statistic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">3. Whether a \u201cmatch\u201d derived from a trawl of a DNA database was sufficient evidence to sustain Derr\u2019s convictions in the absence of any other evidence that corroborated his identification as the perpetrator of the offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">4. Whether the court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on the meaning of the phrase \u201creasonable degree of scientific certainty\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We shall answer the first question in the affirmative. In this case, there are three pieces of evidence and related testimony that implicate the Confrontation Clause: a 1985 serological report, and the DNA analysis from 2002 and 2004. We shall hold that a testimonial statement may not be introduced into evidence without the in-court testimony of the declarant, unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Here, the testing procedures and method employed, the DNA profile created, and the conclusion that there is a match are testimonial in nature, and therefore the analyst who performed the DNA testing is a witness subject to confrontation and cross-examination within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause. In addition, the DNA profile and analysis constituted testimonial statements prepared in anticipation of trial, which were offered into evidence through the testimony of a surrogate who did not participate in or observe the testing procedures. Derr was thus not able to confront the witnesses who made testimonial statements against him, and he was not provided with a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. Therefore, the testimony offered by the surrogate and the admission of the serological reports and DNA evidence were subject to the protections of the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">On September 27, 2004, Norman Bruce Derr was charged with multiple sexual offenses relating to the rape of Alida Berman on December 9, 1984.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of the rape, the victim was transported to Physicians Memorial Hospital where she was examined by a nurse and a physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) was used to collect biological evidence. Using the PERK, the nurse collected a genital swab, two vaginal swabs, and an anal swab. The physical evidence was taken to the FBI crime lab for serological testing, which was performed by the lab technician who was a serological examiner. In 1985, the serological examiner conducted serological testing, identified sperm and semen on parts of the swabs, and detailed his findings in a serological report. Despite the testing and other investigation, the case remained unsolved and became inactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Seventeen years later, in 2002, a detective reviewed the case and submitted the PERK to the FBI crime lab for forensic analysis. Dr. Maribeth Donovan, an FBI DNA analyst, performed the DNA analysis of the biological evidence. A DNA profile of the suspect, consisting of thirteen genetic markers, was generated from the DNA on the vaginal swabs. This profile was entered into a national database containing 2.5 million DNA profiles, referred to as the Combined DNA Identification System (CODIS). In 2004, a match was discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ered between Derr\u2019s existing profile in CODIS and the profile generated in 2002 by Dr. Donovan. The State then obtained a search warrant to seize additional DNA from Derr, in order to create a new \u201creference DNA sample\u201d and to verify that Derr\u2019s profile in CODIS was accurate. The testing of the new sample was performed by an unnamed team of biologists and supervised by Dr. Jennifer Luttman, a DNA analyst with the FBI, in 2004. Upon interpretation of the biologists\u2019 results, Dr. Luttman determined that the reference sample matched Derr\u2019s profile in CODIS. Dr. Luttman was not, however, involved with the 1985 serological testing or the 2002 DNA testing of the PERK that resulted in the DNA profile of the alleged assailant. Further, Dr. Luttman did not perform the actual DNA testing in 2004, but rather merely \u201csupervised\u201d or reviewed her team\u2019s analysis, with no indication that she observed the \u201cbench work\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the time it was performed by her team. Based on the match between Derr\u2019s CODIS profile and the DNA profile obtained from the DNA analysis of the evidence, Derr was arrested and charged with the crimes mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The defense filed preliminary motions in the Circuit Court for Charles County challenging the admission of Dr. Luttman\u2019s proposed testimony. Two hearings were held <em>in limine </em>to determine whether the State could introduce the opinion of the serological examiner and the results of the PERK analysis solely through the use of \u201csurrogate testimony,\u201d with Dr. Luttman as the surrogate. The term \u201csurrogate testimony\u201d refers to expert testimony rendered by a lab supervisor, rather than by the analyst who performed the tests. Derr argued that he had a right under the Confrontation Clause to confront and cross-examine the original analysts. The Circuit Court ruled that the serological report was not testimonial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>was, therefore, admissible through Dr. Luttman under the business records exception to the hearsay rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and under Maryland Rule 5-703<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the basis of Dr. Luttman\u2019s expert opinion. The court also ruled that, while the opinion of the DNA analyst from 2002 was testimonial, the underlying analysis of the DNA was nontestimonial and was admissible both as a business record and as the basis of Dr. Luttman\u2019s opinion. At trial, the State did not request that Mrs. Berman, the alleged victim, make an in-court identification of Derr or identity him as the assailant based on photos of Derr taken in 1982 and 1986, which were entered into evidence. The State also did not call the serological examiner or Dr. Donovan, the FBI DNA analyst who performed the 2002 DNA testing, to connect Derr to the results of the investigation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Instead, the State relied solely on testimony from Dr. Luttman, who was accepted by the court as an expert in the fields of forensic serology and forensic DNA analysis, and who was permitted to testify regarding the 1985, 2002, and 2004 testing results. During her testimony, Dr. Luttman explained the procedure for identifying sperm and semen, as well as the procedure for creating a DNA profile. Dr. Luttman also testified regarding the opinion of the 1985 serologist and the DNA testing procedures and results of the 2002 test. She testified that it was her opinion, based on the tests conducted, that Derr\u2019s DNA profile matched that of the suspect. She supported her opinion by stating it was based on a \u201creasonable degree of scientific certainty.\u201d The jury found Derr guilty of four counts relating to the sexual assault of Mrs. Berman.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Derr filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Appellate argument in the intermediate appellate court was deferred while the Supreme Court of the United States considered <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (Melendez). Subsequently, this Court granted <em>certiorari </em>on its own motion, prior to the Court of Special Appeals rendering a decision in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AGg\">A. DNA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In order to determine the application of Confrontation Clause, principles to a DNA case, a brief explanation of the tests performed and the procedures followed is necessary. In describing the science of DNA evidence, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5X\">Deoxyribonucleic acid (\u2018DNA\u2019) is the organic material that provides the genetic instructions for all individual hereditary characteristics. The importance of DNA for forensic purposes is that DNA does not vary within an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>and, with the exception of identical twins, no two individuals have the same DNA configuration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">The molecular structure of DNA is commonly referred to as a \u2018double helix,\u2019 which resembles a spiraling ladder, and which is composed of twisted double strands of repeated sequences of \u2018nucleotides.\u2019 The sides of the ladder are composed of the \u2018nucleotides,\u2019 which are organic bases that pair with one another to form the \u2018rungs\u2019 of the double helix. It is the repeating sequence of base pairs along the DNA double helix that comprise \u2018genes,\u2019 which determine the unique physiological traits of human beings. The specific position that a gene occupies is called its \u2018locus.\u2019 An individual\u2019s entire complement of DNA is known as the \u2018genome.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">The vast majority of the base pair sequences of human DNA are identical for all people. There are, however, a few DNA segments or genes, called \u2018polymorphic loci,\u2019 which are highly variable among individuals. The alternative forms of these individual polymorphic gene fragments are called \u2018alleles.\u2019 It is these polymorphisms that have great significance for forensic DNA analysis because they provide the basis for DNA identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Young v. State, </em>388 Md. 99, 106-07, 879 A.2d 44, 48-49 (2005) (internal citations omitted) (quoting <em>Gross v. State, </em>371 Md. 334, 339-40 n. 1, 809 A.2d 627, 630 n. 1 (2002)). The DNA analysis begins when a sample is transported to a DNA laboratory by law enforcement personnel. Office of the Inspector General, <em>The FBI DNA Laboratory: A Review of Protocol and Practice Vulnerabilities </em>(May 2004), http://www. justice.gov/oig/special/0405/index.htm [hereinafter <em>FBI Proto</em>col]. Forensic scientists visually examine the evidence for indications of bodily fluid which may contain DNA evidence. <em>Id. </em>The scientists then perform tests to determine if DNA is present. <em>Id. </em>Typically, a cotton swab is used to remove dried body fluid, and the DNA is extracted from the cotton swab. <em>Id. '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The common procedure used in DNA analysis is called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is \u201can amplification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>procedure that reproduces repeatedly a short segment of DNA, making it possible to analyze minute or degraded samples.\u201d <em>Young, </em>388 Md. at 108, 879 A.2d at 49. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGq\">PCR analysis begins with a three-step process to amplify the DNA sample: (1) denaturization (the DNA is heated to separate the two strands); (2) annealing (primers containing nucleotide sequences that are complementary to the DNA region being amplified are added to the DNA sample, which bond to the gene when cooled); (3) extension (the gene is \u201ccopied\u201d repeatedly in order to produce a larger sample of DNA for analysis).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">Once PCR amplification has been completed, analysis of the DNA profile and match determination can be conducted through the utilization of several different genetic markers. The markers employed by the laboratory in the instant case are short tandem repeats (\u201cSTR\u201d). STRs are DNA sequences consisting of two to six base pairs. STRs particularly are useful in analyzing small DNA samples, because loci containing STRs are present with great frequency throughout the chromosomes. The loci have a large number of alleles and usually are susceptible to unique identification. The FBI has designated thirteen core STR loci and a sex-typing marker (amelogenin) for identification in its national database of convicted felons, the Combined DNA Index System (\u201cCODIS\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">DNA profiling typically is used to compare a suspect\u2019s DNA with a sample of DNA taken from a crime scene. \u201cDNA profiling\u201d is a catch-all term for a wide range of methods employed to study genetic variations, including RFLP and PCR/STR typing. All types of DNA analysis involve three basic steps: (1) processing or typing of the DNA samples (to produce x-ray films that indicate the lengths of the polymorphic fragments); (2) match determination (comparison of the films to determine whether any sets of fragments match); and (3) statistical analysis (to determine the statistical significance of any match between the two DNA samples). This three-step process produces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>two distinct, but interrelated, types of information: (1) molecular biological information (whether a match exists between an unknown DNA sample and a sample taken from a suspect); and (2) population genetics information (if a match exists, the statistical probability that the unknown sample came from a third party with the same DNA pattern as the suspect).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">DNA evidence cannot be attributed conclusively to one person unless examiners analyze the entire DNA molecules of the DNA evidence and the DNA sample from that person respectively. Two unrelated individuals can have identical DNA fragments that are examined in a particular type of DNA <em>analysis\u2014ie., </em>identical DNA patterns at the targeted loci. The underlying theory of the forensic use of DNA testing is that as the number and variability of the polymorphisms analyzed increases, the odds of two people coincidentally sharing the same DNA profile becomes vanishingly small.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">Therefore, when a DNA \u201cmatch\u201d has been declared, a conclusive identification of a crime suspect as the source of the unknown DNA sample is not being made. Rather, the suspect simply has been \u201cincluded\u201d as a possible source of the DNA material, because the suspect\u2019s DNA sample has matched the crime scene DNA sample at a certain number of critical alleles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\"><em>Young, 388 </em>Md. at 108-11, 879 A.2d at 49-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">It is important to explain what a DNA profile is composed of, and how it is created. As referenced above, the DNA is heated to separate the nucleotides. The chemical in which the DNA is heated contains markers that identify \u201cthe starting and ending points of the DNA fragment that is duplicated.\u201d <em>FBI Protocol. </em>After the DNA fragments are copied, the fragments are sorted according to length in a process called electrophoresis. <em>Id. </em>Special software measures the length of the varying DNA fragments. <em>Id. </em>This process produces \u201can electropherogram, or graph that displays a series of different-colored peaks of different heights.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>916 A.2d 922, 927 (D.C.2007). The electropherogram reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the primers used during amplification which contain fluorescent markers. \u201cThe machine and the software then represent the lengths of the various fragments as peaks on a graph.... \u201d <em>FBI Protocol. </em>Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[Sjoftware has two components, GeneScan\u00ae and Genotyper\u00ae. Data viewed in GeneScan\u00ae, as appears above, is the raw, unanalyzed, collection data that reflects everything the laser detects, including interference that is common in electrophoresis instruments (Genescan\u00ae data). Genotyper\u00ae allows forensic scientists to take GeneScan\u00ae data and display it in a format that conceals background noise and peripheral information, and to focus their review on the results of the control and evidence samples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\"><em>FBI Protocol. </em>A DNA analyst, or examiner, interprets the data displayed on the electropherogram, which reveals the alleles seen at all the examined loci. <em>Roberts, </em>916 A.2d at 927. The DNA examiner then works with the Genotyper graph and documents the allele values at each chromosomal location or loci, forming the DNA profile. <em>FBI Protocol. </em>This DNA profile is then compared to profiles from known individuals or inputted into CODIS to find a match within the database, which contains DNA profiles obtained from known sources. <em>See Roberts, </em>916 A.2d at 927. With this information in mind, we turn to the legal implications and requirements of DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">B. Applicable Law and Legal Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The Sixth Amendment provides, in part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The same right is secured by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which states that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him ... [and] to examine the witnesses for and against him on oath[.]\u201d <em>See Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 211, 383 A.2d 1097, 1098 (1978). As we have stated, \u201c[t]here are few subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 219, 634 A.2d 464, 467 (1993) (quoting <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 721, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1320, 20 L.Ed.2d 255, 258 (1968)). Further, \u201c[t]wo significant purposes lie at the core of the right of confrontation. One is to provide the defendant with an adequate opportunity for cross-examination. The other purpose is to give the judge and jury opportunities to observe the testifying witness\u2019s demeanor.\u201d <em>Breeden v.

Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court of the United States set forth a framework for evaluating violations of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50-56, 124 S.Ct. at 1363-67, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192-96. The Court stated that the Confrontation Clause \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 192. Quoting the American Dictionary of the English Language from 1828, the Court defined testimony as \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to state that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to protect against out-of-court statements, specifically formal statements to government officers, being admitted without an opportunity to confront the declarant. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193. <em>Crawford </em>concluded that testimonial statements are subject to the protections of the Confrontation Clause and cannot be admitted without live testimony, unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365-66, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In defining the term \u201ctestimonial statement,\u201d the Court in <em>Crawford </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">Various formulations of this core class of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements exist: <em>ex parte </em>in-court testimony <em>or its junctional </em>equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or <em>similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; </em>extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; <em>statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. </em>These formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the Clause\u2019s coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. (Emphasis added.) (Internal citations and quotations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193. Hence, in <em>Crawford, </em>the Court referred to the purpose of the use of material in a later trial in two contexts. First, \u201cpretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d and second, \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). The Court subsequently held in <em>Davis v. Washington, 547 </em>U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), that if \u201cthe primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\u201d then the statement is testimonial. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237. In contrast, statements \u201care nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237. Likewise, in <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d 93, 107 (2011), the Court held that \u201c[w]hen, as in <em>Davis, </em>the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause.\u201d The Court further stated that \u201c[t]he existence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining the primary purpose of the interrogation because an emergency focuses the participants on something other than \u2018prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct.

These cases combined reveal the Court\u2019s emphasis on the purpose for which a statement was made in determining its testimonial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Melendez, </em>the trial court \u201cadmitted into evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine.\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2530, 174 L.Ed.2d 314, 319 (2009). At trial, the prosecution placed into evidence the three certificates of analysis, which were certified by the analysts who performed the drug testing, but without the testimony of the analysts or any other witness qualified to testify about the methods used or the results obtained. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>2531, 174 L.Ed.2d at 320. In <em>Melendez, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the certificates of drug analysis were testimonial because \u201cthere is little doubt that the documents at issue in this case fall within the \u2018core class of testimonial statements\u2019 \u201d as defined by <em>Crawford. Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321. The Court explained that the certificates were \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \u2018precisely what a witness does on direct examination,\u2019 \u201d opining that had an analyst been called, he or she would have been expected to testify as to the identity and weight of the substance, which was the precise evidence presented by the certificates. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d at 242). The Court continued that the certificates were \u201cquite plainly affidavits\u201d because they were \u201cineontrovertibly a \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192). The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">[N]ot only were the affidavits \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. [at 1364], 158 L.Ed.2d [at 193], but under Massachusetts law the <em>sole purpose </em>of the affidavits was to provide \u201cprima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\u201d of the analyzed substance[.] (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, \u00a7 13). Thus, \u201c[t]he analysts who swore the affidavits provided testimony against Melendez-Diaz, and they are therefore subject to confrontation[.]\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2537 n. 6, 174 L.Ed.2d at 327 n. 6. Further, in <em>Melendez, </em>the Court noted that \u201c[l]ike expert witnesses generally, an analyst\u2019s lack of proper training or deficiency in judgment may be disclosed in cross-examination.\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2537, 174 L.Ed.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In <em>Melendez, </em>the Court made two important conclusions relevant to our analysis here: \u201cthe analysts\u2019 affidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts were \u2018witnesses\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>purposes of the <em>Sixth Amendment.\u201d Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 322. The Court therefore held that the certificates were inadmissible absent the analysts\u2019 testimony or a showing that they were unavailable and that the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. <em>Id. </em>The holding in <em>Melendez </em>left unanswered the question of how to apply the principle to cases involving surrogate testimony, where a supervisor for a lab testifies, but the actual person who created the data or report does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Recently, in <em>Bulleoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n analyst\u2019s certification prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution\u201d is testimonial and therefore the accused has the right to be confronted with the analyst who performed the testing. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2713-14, 180 L.Ed.2d at 620. The Court also stated that <em>Melendez </em>\u201crefused to create a \u2018forensic evidence\u2019 exception to [the rule in <em>Crawford </em>that testimonial statements are not admissible unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has a prior opportunity to cross-examine].\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d at 620. In <em>Bullcoming, </em>the evidence against the petitioner included a forensic laboratory report certifying Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2709, 180 L.Ed.2d at 617. At trial, the State did not call as a witness the analyst who performed the test and signed the certification; rather, over defense objection, the State called to testify \u201canother analyst who was familiar with the laboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test\u201d to introduce into evidence the test results. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2709, 180 L.Ed.2d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">In <em>State v. Bullcoming, </em>147 N.M. 487, 226 P.3d 1, 8-9 (2010), the New Mexico Supreme Court held that although the laboratory report introduced at Bullcoming\u2019s trial was testimonial under <em>Melendez, </em>the report was validly admitted because the analyst was a \u201cmere scrivener,\u201d and therefore the surrogate testimony was sufficient to satisfy Bullcoming\u2019s confron<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tation right. The United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Does the Confrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce a <em>forensic laboratory report </em>containing a <em>testimonial certification, </em>made in order to <em>prove a fact at a criminal trial, </em>through the in-court testimony of an analyst <em>who did not sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance </em>of the test reported in the certification. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\"><em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619. In answering the question, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court reversed the holding of the New Mexico Supreme Court. The Court first addressed the issue of surrogate testimony, and New Mexico\u2019s holding that the analyst merely transcribed the results generated by the machine without interpretation or independent judgment. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2714, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619-20. The Court stated that the certification \u201creported more than a machine-generated number,\u201d and went on to list all of the representations made in the report \u201crelating to past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data[.]\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2714, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621. The Court held that such representations are \u201cmeet for cross-examination\u201d and continued that even if the certification was just a machine-generated number, \u201cthe comparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2714-15, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">The Court, explaining why surrogate testimony does not satisfy the Confrontation Clause, noted that the testimony \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the kind [the expert] was equipped to give could not convey what [the analyst] knew or observed about the events his certification concerned, <em>i.e., </em>the particular test and testing process he employed.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2715, 180 L.Ed.2d at 622. The Court concluded that \u201cthe analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation even if they possess \u2018the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2715, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621 (quoting <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2537 n. 6, 174 L.Ed.2d. at 327 n. 6). Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cthe [Confrontation] Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the [trial] court believes that questioning one witness about another\u2019s testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination,\u201d highlighting the premise that \u201c \u2018the purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2716, 180 L.Ed.2d at 622 (quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2562, 165 L.Ed.2d 409, 417 (2006)). The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cno substitute procedure can cure the violation\u201d and therefore the surrogate testimony at issue in the case violated the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\"><em>Bullcoming </em>clarified the Confrontation Clause analysis regarding forensic testing that began in <em>Melendez. </em>In <em>Melendez, </em>the Court held that drug analysis certificates were testimonial because the contents of the certificates were \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \u2018precisely what a witness does on direct examination,\u2019 \u201d and the statements were \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321 (citations omitted). The Court in <em>Melendez </em>thus held that the certificates were inadmissible absent the analysts\u2019 testimony or a showing that they were unavailable. <em>Melen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>dez, 557 </em>U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 322. Following <em>Melendez, </em>in <em>Bullcoming </em>the Supreme Court further explained the definition of testimonial as including those statements \u201cmade for the purpose of proving a particular fact.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616. In explaining <em>Melendez, </em>the Court in <em>Bullcoming </em>stated that the report in <em>Melendez </em>\u201chad been created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding\u201d and therefore could not be introduced without \u201coffering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2709, 180 L.Ed.2d at 615. The Court also stated that such reports are testimonial because they are \u201ccreated solely for an \u2018evidentiary purpose,\u2019 \u201d <em>ie., </em>\u201cin aid of a police investigation[.]\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2717, 180 L.Ed.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Although the Supreme Court has not yet answered the specific question of who must testify in cases involving scientific analysis, it has provided guidance as to which people involved with a case are witnesses whose statements will be considered testimony against the accused. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the dissent in <em>Melendez </em>argued vigorously that there are certain types of witnesses who are exempt from the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. The majority, however, rejected each of the justifications in turn. <em>See Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2533-40, 174 L.Ed.2d at 323-30. First, the Court rejected the argument that the analysts are not \u201caccusatory\u201d witnesses and are thereby not the type of witnesses covered by the Confrontation Clause. <em>Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2533-34, 174 L.Ed.2d at 323. Massachusetts based this argument on the notion that an analyst is not accusatory because his or her testimony is only inculpatory when considered in conjunction with other evidence. The Court dispelled this theory, stating that \u201cthere is not a third category of witnesses <em>\\i.e., </em>non-accusatory], helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.\u201d <em>Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2534, 174 L.Ed.2d at 323. The Court read the Clause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>literally mean that the defendant has the right to be confronted with <em>the </em>witnesses against him or her, and stated that the Clause only \u201ccontemplates two classes of witnesses\u2014those against the defendant and those in his favor. The prosecution <em>mvjst </em>produce the former[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The Court also rejected a claim that the Confrontation Clause applies only to \u201cconventional\u201d witnesses. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at --\u2022, 129 S.Ct. at 2535, 174 L.Ed.2d at 324-25. The dissent in <em>Melendez </em>advanced three reasons why analysts were not conventional witnesses: analysts report near contemporaneous observations (as opposed to relating events observed in the past), analysts do not have personal knowledge of the crime, and analysts\u2019 statements are not the product of interrogation. <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected each argument in turn, stating that none of these contentions had adequate support in case law, and emphasizing that the determining factor is that the analysts were witnesses <em>against </em>the defendant and were responding to a police inquiry, not whether they were \u201cconventional.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Most importantly, the Court rejected the contention that analysts were somehow neutral witnesses based on the scientific nature of their statements. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at ---, 129 S.Ct. at 2536-38, 174 L.Ed.2d at 325-328. The Court held that the supposed reliability of scientific evidence is not sufficient grounds to admit such statements absent live testimony. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2536-37, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326-27. Rather, \u201cthere are other ways\u2014and in some cases better ways\u2014to challenge or verify the results of a forensic test. But the Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have license to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Melendez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2586, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326. The Court also stated, \u201cConfrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well.\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2537, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326. The Court then detailed the deficiencies of forensic evidence, highlighting the need to question the person who actually performed the test. In rejecting the idea of separate classes of witnesses, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of confronting the person actually responsible for the testimonial statements. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2537-38, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326-27. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>651 F.3d 30, 71, 73-74 (D.C.Cir.2011) (applying <em>Bull-coming </em>to support the court\u2019s holding that the testimony at trial of a medical examiner and a forensic chemist regarding autopsy reports and drug analyses, respectively, was testimonial evidence that implicated the Confrontation Clause because the witnesses neither performed nor observed the underlying tests about which the reports concerned, and those reports were admitted into evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Prior to <em>Bullcoming </em>and <em>Melendez, </em>this Court endorsed a purpose-driven test when we held that the proper test for determining if a statement is testimonial focuses on whether the statement was \u201cmade under circumstances that would lead an objective declarant reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 83, 867 A.2d 314, 325 (2005). We evaluated a Confrontation Clause challenge in <em>Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 496, 897 A.2d 821, 845-46 (2006), and held that the autopsy reports at issue were business records and were not testimonial based on relevant statutory requirements. We stated that the Supreme Court \u201cindicated in <em>Crawford </em>that the hearsay exceptions, such as the business records exception, can exempt evidence from scrutiny under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Rollins, </em>392 Md. at 479, 897 A.2d at 835. Subsequent to our opinion in <em>Rollins, </em>however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Melendez </em>undercut this line of reasoning, as it specifically stated that the business records exception would not permit an otherwise inadmissible testimonial statement to be admitted. <em>Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2539-40, 174 L.Ed.2d at 329-30. The Supreme Court pointed out that although documents kept in the regular course of business are ordinarily admitted into evidence under the hearsay exception, this will not be the case \u201cif the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d <em>Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2538, 174 L.Ed.2d at 328. The Court further related this distinction to police reports, stating that \u201c[t]he analysts\u2019 certificates\u2014like police reports generated by law enforcement officials\u2014do not qualify as business or public records[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the testimonial nature of a statement must be determined under the guidelines set forth in <em>Crawford, Melendez, </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>and whether the statement falls under a hearsay exception is irrelevant. For example, in <em>Rollins, </em>we held that the autopsy reports qualified under the business records exception to the hearsay rule because the records were kept \u201cduring the regularly conducted business activity of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\u201d as sanctioned by statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Rollins, </em>392 Md. at 482-83, 897 A.2d at 837. We also stated that, although an autopsy report \u201cmight eventually be used in a criminal trial, [the report] was not created for that express purpose, and was statutorily required to be determined by the medical examiner.... \u201d <em>Rollins, </em>392 Md. at 484, 897 A.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Under <em>Melendez </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>however, it is now clear that the \u201cexpress purpose\u201d of the statement need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>for later use at trial, but instead, any statement that was \u201c\u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial\u2019 \u201d is considered to be testimonial. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193). The statute under which autopsy reports are completed, Md.Code (1982, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-311 of the Health-General Article, clearly contemplates that the declarant in an autopsy report, the medical examiner or assistant, would reasonably expect the report to be used prosecutorially in the case of any non-accidental or assisted death. Subsection (c) of the statute itself requires the medical examiner to deliver a copy of the report to the State\u2019s Attorney when the \u201cmedical examiner considers further investigation advisable.\u201d Consequently, to the extent <em>Rollins </em>was undermined by <em>Melendez </em>with regard to the business records exception, <em>Rollins </em>is no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">C. Confrontation Clause Analysis as Applied to DNA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A23\">When reviewing a case under the Confrontation Clause, the following principle must be followed: a testimonial statement may not be introduced into evidence, through admission or testimony, without the in-court testimony of the declarant. A court must first identify what statements are being offered as evidence in a criminal trial. Then, a court must determine whether the statements are testimonial in nature. Unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, when \u201can out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial,\u201d and its admission invokes the Confrontation Clause. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619. This is because \u201cthe prosecution may not introduce such [evidence] without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2709, 180 L.Ed.2d at 615. In the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>DNA testing, the DNA profile is a statement of the analyst that essentially says: \u201cThis is the DNA profile for this person.\u201d If the DNA profile is inputted into CODIS and a match is obtained, then that match is derived from the statement of the analyst. In light of <em>Bullcoming </em>and <em>Melendez, </em>it is inescapable that the testing procedures and method employed, the DNA profile created, and the conclusion that there is a match are testimonial in nature, and therefore the analyst who performed the DNA testing or the supervisor who observed the analyst perform the DNA testing must testify in order to satisfy the Confrontation Clause, unless the witness is unavailable and the defense had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>See Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2713-17, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the DNA profile and report are made for the primary purpose of establishing facts relevant to a later prosecution, and an objective analyst would understand that the statements will be used in a later trial. Stated differently, the analyst who generated the report must have known that the purpose of the testing was ultimately to establish the perpetrator\u2019s identity through DNA evidence. Second, the testing results, and the resulting DNA profile, can be considered an affidavit because they are the functional equivalent of in-court testimony, offered to establish <em>prima facie </em>evidence of guilt, which constitutes formalized testimonial material. Third, the statements produced by DNA testing are testimony under <em>Crawford </em>because the statements are solemn declarations made to prove a fact, namely the identification of the sample and possible match. Finally, the analyst who performs the DNA analysis is a witness for the purpose of the Confrontation Clause because the DNA profile created is a representation \u201crelating to past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data[.]\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2714, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621. Therefore, the DNA profiles created by lab analysts, the reports they produce, and the conclusions or opinions they form contain testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>statements that are subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>In reaching this holding, we find support in the jurisprudence of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which has determined repeatedly that DNA evidence is comprised of the conclusions, and therefore the testimonial statements, of the analysts who performed the testing, and is thus subject to the Confrontation Clause. <em>Gardner v. United States, </em>999 A.2d 55, 58-59 (D.C.2010); <em>Veney v. United States, </em>936 A.2d 811, 831 (D.C.2007); <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>916 A.2d 922, 938 (D.C. 2007). In each of these cases, an expert testified as to his or her own \u201cconclusions\u201d based on DNA testing results, despite the fact that the expert took no part in the actual testing. <em>Roberts </em>is particularly instructive because, similar to the case at bar, the defendant in <em>Roberts </em>argued that the expert relied on the conclusions of others in forming his opinion, while the government countered that the expert performed an independent analysis based on the raw data produced by the analysts, and that the admission of the evidence was valid under Federal Rule of Evidence 703. <em>Roberts, </em>916 A.2d at 937-38. The facts in <em>Roberts </em>were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Dr. Baechtel was not the original examiner; that job had been performed by Dr. Maribeth Donovan, who no longer worked for the FBI and was not called as a witness by either side. As Dr. Baechtel acknowledged, he had not done the original \u201chands-on work\u201d in the case and in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>sense was \u201ctestifying in the place of Dr. Donovan.\u201d At the same time, Dr. Baechtel testified that the opinions he was testifying to were his own. He explained that all FBI DNA reports are subjected to two levels of review before being issued. In the first or more intensive review, the original examiner\u2019s report is given to a second examiner who \u201csit[s] down with that information and go[es] through it as if it was his or her own case.\u201d That was Dr. Baeehtel\u2019s role here. He took \u201cthe case ... as having been given to [him]\u201d without regard to \u201cwhat the actual examiner [had] decided.\u201d He went \u201cthrough it as if it\u2019s my case ... and [came] to [his own] conclusions and ... interpretation,\u201d only then comparing them to the first examiner\u2019s interpretation. After this \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201cpeer review\u201d was complete, he transmitted the report, which he signed only because he agreed with its conclusions, to the unit chief for a final \u201cadministrative review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>Id. </em>Despite the government\u2019s contention that Dr. Baechtel formed his own independent conclusion, the court held that \u201c[o]ur review of the record confirms that, at least in part, Dr. Baeehtel\u2019s opinion that appellant could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA evidence rested on the conclusions reached by the team that did the actual laboratory analysis and set forth those conclusions in the report he reviewed.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>916 A.2d at 9B8. Further, the court explained that there is \u201cno room for dispute that the conclusions of FBI laboratory scientists ... [that were] admitted as substantive evidence at trial are \u2018testimonial\u2019 under <em>Crawford, </em>.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">This holding was affirmed in <em>Gardner, </em>in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals stated, \u201cIn light of the fact that the conclusions of FBI laboratory scientists have been indisputably held to be \u2018testimonial,\u2019 the <em>Roberts </em>court concluded that the appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation rights could have been satisfied only by cross-examination of those scientists who actually conducted the testing.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>999 A.2d at 61. The court also emphasized that, just as in <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Veney, </em>the \u201cexperts [in <em>Gardner </em>] quoted and directly referred to the conclusions of the lab analysts\u201d and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>that the experts \u201crepeatedly read from and directly referenced the testing results and conclusions of the analysts who conducted [the] test.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>999 A.2d at 61, 61 n. 12. Importantly, in addressing whether Fed.R.Evid. 703<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> survived <em>Crawford, </em>the court stated, \u201c[T]hat determination does not help the government in this case, where the experts did not simply rely upon inadmissible hearsay in forming their expert opinions. Rather, here, the experts repeatedly directly referred to the inadmissible hearsay evidence and thus used it to prove the \u2018truth of the matter asserted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gardner, </em>999 A.2d at 60 n. 11 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Veney, </em>\u201cthe trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>admitted Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony, which was based on FBI laboratory reports, while neither the serologist who tested the items for blood and semen, nor the PCR/STR technician who extracted and amplified the samples from these items, testified at trial.\u201d <em>Veney, </em>936 A.2d at 831. The government emphasized that \u201cDr. Luttman was the supervisory analyst, she was the only member of the three-person DNA team in this case who interpreted the DNA test results, and the only one who prepared a report based on those results,\u201d and further that \u201cDr. Luttman based her interpretation of the DNA profiles on her reading of a computer-generated graph, called an electropherogram, that was produced by the PCR/ STR machine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Dr. Luttman made references to the serology tests and the data produced by operation of a DNA-typing instrument, both carried out by other scientists on the team that she managed, which indicated that the DNA in semen stains found on S.P.\u2019s clothing matched appellant\u2019s DNA. These test results, therefore, arguably were offered as substantive evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Id.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In evaluating a Confrontation Clause claim of this sort, involving surrogate testimony and scientific testing, we must address the continued validity and application of Md. Rule 5-703. We shall hold that, because of the Confrontation Clause, an expert may not render as true the testimonial statements or opinions of others through his or her testimony. Although the Rule allows for an expert to base his or her opinion on inadmissible evidence, to the extent that Md. Rule 5-703 offends the Confrontation Clause, such testimony will not be admissible. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Crawford, </em>\u201c[w]here testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of \u2018reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199. Specifically, if the inadmissible evidence sought to be introduced is comprised of the conclusions of other analysts, then the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of such testimonial statements through the testimony of an expert who did not observe or participate in the testing. Conversely, if the evidence relied upon by an expert in his or her testimony assembles nontestimonial information from one or more sources, and then draws a conclusion based on that information, then the expert is not merely serving as a surrogate to convey the conclusions of other analysts, but rather, is forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and testifying as to the expert\u2019s own independent opinion. In such a case, Md. Rule 5-703, as applied, would not appear to offend the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The key distinction in this type of case is whether the testifying expert relies on raw data in forming his or her conclusions, as opposed to relying on the conclusions and opinions of others when testifying. As the United States Supreme Court made clear in <em>Bullcoming, </em>a certification is more than \u201cmachine-produced data,\u201d and instead constitutes representations \u201crelating to past events and human actions.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2714, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621. This is important because the testifying witness must be able to convey \u201cwhat [the analyst] knew or observed about the events his certification concerned, <em>ie., </em>the particular test and testing process he employed,\u201d which cannot be achieved through surrogate testimony. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2715, 180 L.Ed.2d at 622. Further, \u201csurrogate testimony [cannot] expose any lapses or lies on the certifying analyst\u2019s part.\u201d <em>Id; see also Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2537, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326 (stating that \u201c[confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Based on this explanation, we view the term \u201craw data\u201d in the context of a Md. Rule 5-703 inquiry to be limited to the data or materials which have not yet been subjected to scientific testing. Therefore, we hold, in accordance with <em>Bullcoming, </em>that the testimonial statement of the analyst is comprised of more than just the results of the testing. Instead, the testimony includes the underlying procedure or process because the \u201cmethodology requires the exercise of judgment and presents a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2537, 174 L.Ed.2d at 327. Accordingly, we agree with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that, although Dr. Luttman used the data to inform her testimony, the data itself was both substantive and testimonial evidence, and therefore the analysts who actually performed the testing were also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>required to testify in order to satisfy Derr\u2019s right to confrontation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Turning specifically to the case <em>mb judice, </em>there are three pieces of evidence and related testimony that implicate the Confrontation Clause: (1) the serological report from 1985 in which the biologist identified sperm and semen on genital and vaginal swabs taken from the victim; (2) a DNA profile generated in 2002 by Dr. Donovan when the sample was submitted to the FBI for DNA testing, which provided a match between the profile generated from the sample taken from the victim at the time of the crime and Derr\u2019s DNA profile stored in CODIS; and (3) a DNA profile created from a new sample of Derr\u2019s DNA in 2004. Similar to the prosecution in <em>Bullcoming, </em>the State in this case employed surrogate testimony, calling \u201canother analyst who was familiar with the laboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test[s]\u201d to testify as to the forensic examinations and results, providing evidence to establish Derr\u2019s guilt. This scientific evidence was presented through the testimony of Dr. Jennifer Luttman, an FBI forensic examiner who supervised the laboratory work of biologists on her \u201cteam.\u201d Dr. Luttman took no part in the 1985 serological testing or the 2002 DNA testing. She did not perform the actual bench work with regard to the 2004 test, nor is there any indication that she actually observed the biologists per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>form the test, notwithstanding the fact that the test was conducted by her team and she reviewed the results. Dr. Luttman therefore acted as a surrogate for the analysts who actually performed the tests, thereby creating a Confrontation issue because the testimonial witnesses involved in the process were not available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Derr argues that he was denied \u201cthe opportunity to confront and cross-examine the analysts who performed the scientific testing of the biological evidence that was the foundation for the DNA \u2018match\u2019 evidence[.]\u201d He continues that \u201ctestimonial statements (the opinion of the serology examiner, and the DNA test results) of witnesses (the serology examiner and the DNA analyst) who did not appear at trial were introduced against Mr. Derr\u201d and therefore \u201c[t]he admission of these testimonial statements violated Mr. Derr\u2019s Confrontation Clause right....\u201d Derr maintains that the testing is a \u201chighly analytical and complex scientific test that involved the exercise of judgment and interpretation in anticipation of a criminal prosecution.\u201d Derr argues that by not allowing him to confront the analysts, \u201cthe jury was [led] to believe that the match itself established the reliability of the underlying serological examination and DNA analysis____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In addition, Derr asserts that Dr. Luttman\u2019s \u201cforensic testimony served the dual purpose of providing the <em>sole </em>identification evidence of appellant Norman Derr as the perpetrator of a rape and sexual assault, while simultaneously shielding the forensic testing from any effective cross-examination.\u201d Further, Derr claims that the State never \u201cexplains precisely <em>how </em>Mr. Derr\u2014or any other criminal defendant confronted with scientific evidence\u2014could meaningfully challenge the actual conduct of the forensic testing, when the results of the testing (whether in the form of opinions or \u2018raw5 data) are introduced into evidence through surrogate forensic testimony.\u201d Relying on Melendez, Derr asserts that \u201c[allowing expert witnesses ... to testify about forensic tests performed by third party analysts strips defendants of the opportunity to probe the analyst\u2019s \u2018honesty, proficiency, and methodology,\u2019 thus making it impossible to \u201cweed out\u2019 fraudulent analysts as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>incompetent ones.... \u201d Derr concludes that \u201c[t]he opinion of the serologist, and the DNA test results, are testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>because they were made under circumstances that would lead an objective analyst reasonably to believe the statements would be available for use at a later trial\u201d and further that \u201c\u00a1tjhe information about the perpetrator\u2019s DNA profile conveys in a graphic form precisely what the analyst would be expected to testify about on direct examination at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The State bases much of its argument on Md. Rule 5-703, maintaining that the DNA results were not testimonial. The State characterizes the DNA results as \u201craw data\u201d and states that the data was not introduced for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather, as the basis of Dr. Luttman\u2019s opinion, and therefore the data is not hearsay. The State also argues that data is not testimonial hearsay because it is not a statement made by a person. The State then argues that even if the information is hearsay, it is not testimonial under <em>Crawford, </em>because it \u201cis not an affidavit, a certified record, a deposition, or anything else intended to be a \u2018weaker substitute for trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d The State concludes that \u201cexperts are entitled to base opinions on data generated by others,\u201d and maintains that Dr. Luttman delivered her own opinions and conclusions in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We shall hold that the trial judge erred in admitting the 1985 serological test, and the 2002 and 2004 DNA test results because the reports were testimonial statements and their admission through the testimony of Dr. Luttman violated Derr\u2019s right under the Confrontation Clause. Specifically, we address the results of the 1985 serological test. Dr. Luttman testified regarding the opinion and conclusion of the serologist that semen and sperm were present on the swabs. Dr. Luttman testified that a serology examiner at the FBI in 1985 performed the test by viewing the sample under a microscope and concluding that the cells he viewed were sperm cells. The actual test and the procedures used are unknown. Dr. Luttman knew only that the serological examiner was an FBI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>agent named \u201cBabiak\u201d; she did not know whether Babiak did the bench work <em>(ie., </em>the testing, calculations, and reporting), what his credentials were, how long he worked at the FBI, his proficiency ratings, or any other information regarding who actually performed the bench work. Dr. Luttman knew only that Babiak interpreted the results of testing performed by a biologist, who analyzed the serology sample. Someone wrote a report analyzing the serology sample and an agent named Babiak signed that report. Specifically, the following exchange took place during a bench conference regarding the admissibility of the 1985 serology evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Defense Attorney: [The report] contains his <em>[ie., </em>the serologist\u2019s] conclusions with regard to his interpretations of the tests, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">Luttman: Those notes contain the biologists\u2019s [sic] results and then the examiner took those results and drew their conclusions, just like I do today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Defense Attorney: All right. But I thought you said you didn\u2019t know if Babiak [the serologist] was a biologist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Luttman: No. Babiak was a forensic examiner, forensic serology examiner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">Defense Attorney: Okay. So who was the biologist then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">Luttman: I do not know who the biologist was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">Defense Attorney: So there\u2019s actually more than one person involved in this process then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">Luttman: Yes. Just like it\u2019s current practice now. There was a biologist and an examiner who did the work. And I do no[t] know in 1985 who the biologist was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">Defense Attorney: And at that time in '85 were lab examiners special agents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">Luttman: Yes they were. Babiak was a special agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">Defense Attorney: So he was actually a sworn law enforcement official, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">Luttman: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-17\">Defense Attorney: And I guess it\u2019s pretty obvious that he knew he was examining a sex crime kit, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Luttman: That\u2019s correct. He did not do the actual bench work a biologist did, but he knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">Defense Attorney: So he was, the FBI officer was doing the interpretation of whatever bench work was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4i\">Luttman: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The State then asked Dr. Luttman about notations on the report that was admitted into evidence. Dr. Luttman said, \u201cThey were by the person who did the bench work. And then the report was written by Babiak, that has the conclusions.\u201d Finally, in her testimony Dr. Luttman relied on the serological examiner\u2019s conclusion that sperm cells were present, and she stated that it is the \u201cFBI\u2019s policy not to repeat tests where ... we have reports from laboratory results.\u201d Ultimately, Dr. Luttman conceded that she could not form an independent basis for her conclusions without trusting the report.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is clear that Dr. Luttman did not testify as to her own independent conclusions, but rather, relied on the conclusions of Babiak, which in turn were based on the lab work of an unknown biologist. Furthermore, those conclusions were clearly prepared for possible later use at trial because the serologist was a sworn law enforcement officer engaging in a criminal investigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, the findings contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the serological report indicating the presence of sperm and semen are testimonial because the report contains a solemn declaration of fact, reflecting the functional equivalent of in-court testimony, and the report was prepared for later use at trial. <em>See Melendez, 557 </em>U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321; <em>see also Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2712, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619. Therefore, the trial court erred in admitting the serology report and Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">As to the DNA profile created in 2002, the trial judge erred in concluding that, although Dr. Donovan\u2019s report was testimonial, the underlying data was not. The DNA profile was based on the test performed by Dr. Donovan, an FBI examiner who did not testify at trial, and it provided the basis for the match between the unknown sample and the profile in the CODIS database. Dr. Luttman testified as to the methodology used and the results obtained from the 2002 test, and she also testified that neither she nor her team were involved in the testing. When asked whether she was involved in the 2002 test, Dr. Luttman responded, \u201cNo. But I interpreted those tests that were done in 2002.\u201d When asked to clarify, she then stated, \u201cI do not do any of the bench work tests, whether it was in 2002, 2004 or 2006. I interpret the results.\u201d Clearly, Dr. Luttman relied on the report authored by Dr. Donovan as the basis for her testimony. Dr. Luttman revealed that once the sample was submitted for testing, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>biologist who did that documented the day she did it, the steps she took to do that and then a portion of that sample was then further characterized through DNA typing.\u201d Dr. Luttman also described the roles of the various analysts who were involved, stating that \u201cthe extraction of the DNA started May 31, 2002 and then the DNA for the biologist was finished I think it was June 17, 2002. And then the examiner did the interpretation in September of 2002,\u201d thus explaining that multiple parties were involved in the testing process, none of whom were Dr. Luttman. Despite her lack of involvement, Dr. Luttman testified on direct examination: \u201cMy opinion is that specimen K10, which is Norman Derr, is the source of the DNA found on specimens Q 15 and Q 16 [from the PERK kit] to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Derr argues that \u201c[tjhe DNA test results, although computer-generated in their final form, were the end product of a highly analytical process that required the analyst to exercise judgment and interpretation,\u201d and were therefore testimonial statements of the analyst. Derr continues that the \u201ctest results, although computer generated during the final stage of the DNA analysis, were produced with the assistance and input of the analyst and must, therefore, be attributed to the analyst.\u201d Finally, Derr contends that \u201c[a] DNA analyst must follow a detailed protocol that requires the exercise of judgment and discretion at each stage of the process,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe results cannot be attributed solely to a machine.\u201d We agree. As stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Melendez, </em>whatever testimony is introduced must be live. <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532 n. 1, 174 L.Ed.2d at 322 n. 1. The prosecution does not have discretion in determining who may testify regarding testimonial statements at issue; its discretion lies in deciding which testimonial statements it chooses to admit. While Dr. Luttman had a \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d of the procedures employed in the lab, she did not have first-hand knowledge of the actual procedures performed in this case, and thus she could not be cross-examined regarding Dr. Donovan\u2019s statements without violating the Confrontation Clause. The DNA test results and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>report were therefore not admissible without Dr. Donovan\u2019s testimony. As stated in <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u201cthe analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation,\u201d and therefore the admission into evidence of the 2002 DNA analysis and DNA profile through the surrogate testimony of Dr. Luttman violated the Confrontation Clause. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2715, 180 L.Ed.2d at 621. Hence, it was improper to receive into evidence Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding Derr\u2019s DNA profile created in 2002, merely because she was a supervisor and had been designated by the court as an expert in the field of DNA analysis. As stated in <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u201csurrogate testimony of the kind [the supervisor] was equipped to give could not convey what [the analyst] knew or observed about the events his certification concerned, <em>ie., </em>the particular test and testing process he employed.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2715,180 L.Ed.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Finally, with regard to the 2004 test, the record regarding the full extent of Dr. Luttman\u2019s involvement in developing the DNA profile is unclear. In <em>Bullcoming, </em>the Court opined that the in-court testimony of a scientist who performed tests or who observed tests being performed could satisfy the constitutional requirements of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2709-10, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616. Although the Court did not go so far as to define the extent of observation necessary to satisfy the Confrontation Clause, it is indisputable that some level of actual observation of the testing would be necessary to safeguard the principles underlying this constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Dr. Luttman indicated that she supervised the team of biologists who conducted all of the bench work and, according to her testimony, the supervisor evaluates the analyst\u2019s results before formulating the report. Dr. Luttman reiterated several times throughout her testimony that she did not perform any of the actual testing in the 2004 analysis. In addition, it is not clear whether she was present and observed the actual procedures. Nowhere in Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony did she indicate that she was physically present to observe the biolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>gists conduct the relevant tests. In fact, when asked whether she \u201cmight be at a conference or testifying and [her] team is back at the lab doing the bench work,\u201d Dr. Luttman responded, \u201cYes they are.\u201d Dr. Luttman\u2019s consistent description of her involvement with the 2004 analysis was that she reviewed the results of the bench work performed by the biologists. Therefore, on the basis of the record before us, we cannot say that Dr. Luttman observed the 2004 testing being performed. Because our disposition of this case is to reverse and to remand to the Circuit Court for further proceedings, further probing of Dr. Luttman\u2019s involvement in the 2004 testing procedures can be done at that time. Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bullcoming, </em>if on remand to the Circuit Court evidence is presented by the State indicating that Dr. Luttman did in fact observe the 2004 testing, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause, indeed, may be satisfied, and the 2004 DNA analysis may be properly admissible through surrogate testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Charles County and hold that the trial judge erred in admitting the results of scientific testing through a surrogate analyst who did not, on the basis of this record, perform or observe the actual testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR PURPOSES OF A NEW TRIAL.

Although the Majority opinion here accepts wholly these eases as controlling in the present case, the Majority ignores, to my thinking, several critical factual distinctions between the present case and the latest Supreme Court decisions. I believe these distinctions render the 1985 and 2004 scientific reports (and Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding these reports) admissible, because these reports are distinguishable from the specific facts with which the Supreme Court dealt in <em>Bullcoming </em>and Melendez-Diaz.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Working within the confines of these cases (and subsequent cases applying their holdings), I would hold that, on this record extract, Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the 1985 serological test and the 2004 DNA test (and the reports themselves), are admissible, as they do not frustrate Derr\u2019s confrontation rights. I agree with the Majority, however, that Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the 2002 test is inadmissible in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bullcoming. </em>That is, because I agree that the 2002 test is <em>\u201ca </em>forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification\u2014made for the purpose of proving a particular fact\u2014through in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616, I believe the Majority opinion is correct to hold that the admission of testimony regarding the 2002 test was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">I. <em>1985 Serology Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In 1984, when hospital personnel collected evidence using a physical evidence recovery kit (\u201cPERK\u201d) on Alida Cook (now Berman), and the FBI conducted tests on the physical evidence, DNA testing\u2014prolific today\u2014was not a standard procedure utilized in the course of rape investigations. The FBI personnel (a biologist and a forensic serological examiner), therefore, did not conduct DNA testing on the physical evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dence; rather, the serological test performed in 1985 identified merely the existence of sperm and semen in the swabs collected from the PERK.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">A. <em>Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Before this Court engages in a Confrontation Clause analysis, \u201cthe first question is whether the rules of evidence, including but not limited to the hearsay rule, exclude it.\u201d Lynn McLain, Maryland Practice, Maryland Rules of Evidence 189 (3d ed.2007). Not until we determine that the evidence or testimony is admissible under our evidentiary rules do we reach the separate question of whether the Confrontation Clause excludes such evidence and/or testimony. <em>See id. </em>The State entered into evidence the 1985 test, conducted by FBI analysts and biologists, to explain the conclusion that Dr. Luttman attested to; namely, that the sample from the 1984 PERK matched a DNA sample obtained from Derr in 2004. Maryland Rule 5-801 defines hearsay as, \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence <em>to prove the truth of the matter </em>asserted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) I would hold that, in the present case, the State presented underlying facts and raw data (i.e., the report), which Dr. Luttman used to support her conclusions, \u201cnot for the truth of the matter asserted, but for the purpose of explaining the basis for h[er] opinion.\u201d <em>People v.

In <em>State v. Snelling, </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Ariz. 182, 286 P.3d 409, 414 (2010)\u2014a <em>post-Melendez-Diaz </em>case\u2014the Arizona Supreme Court found that the testimony of a medical examiner was not hearsay, and thus, the admission of the testimony did not violate Snelling\u2019s confrontation rights. Although the appellate court recognized that the medical examiner relied on an autopsy report that she did not conduct or observe, the court determined that she was not a \u201cconduit\u201d merely for the admission of otherwise inadmissible hearsay evidence because she also studied crime scene photographs and used her own training to come to an independent conclusion. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, I would hold that an expert witness, relying reasonably on facts and underlying data in order to show the basis of his or her opinion, is not testifying to \u201cprove the truth of the matter asserted by an out-of-court declarant\u201d and the testimony is not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The Supreme Court of Illinois, in <em>Williams, </em>supra,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> discussed a situation similar to <em>SneUing </em>and the present case. At trial, the court allowed the prosecution\u2019s expert witness to testify concerning a DNA report, which she did not prepare. <em>See Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 277. Williams argued that the report was introduced to establish the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that Williams\u2019s DNA matched the DNA profile created using physical evidence collected from a rape kit. <em>See Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 270, 278. The prosecution argued that the report was used only to explain how the expert formed her opinion and that her opinion alone was the only statement offered for the truth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the matter asserted. <em>See Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The <em>Williams </em>Court explained that expert witness testimony regarding underlying facts and data, which may be otherwise inadmissible, is not considered hearsay when done for the purpose of explaining his or her opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 278; <em>Snelling, </em>236 P.3d at 414; <em>see also Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 499, 897 A.2d 821 (2006). The appellate court held that the expert was not a \u201cconduit\u201d merely for regurgitating the exact words of the report, because the expert \u201cmade her own visual and interpretive comparisons ... to make a conclusion on the critical issue: that there was a match to the defendant\u2019s profile.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Williams, </em>345 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Ill.Dee. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 280. Further, the court noted that, as the testimony in question did not constitute hearsay, \u201cthe trial court and appellate court properly concluded that <em>Crawford </em>[i.e., Confrontation Clause] considerations did not apply here.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Snelling, </em>therefore, stand for the proposition that, as long as expert witnesses interpret, compare, or otherwise draw their own conclusions regarding tests completed by other analysts (as was the case with the 1984 serology test in the present case) the testimony regarding the test and the test itself are not hearsay and thus, <em>ipso facto, </em>its admission does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>not violate the Confrontation Clause. In other words, \u201cthe constitutional dividing line\u201d should be drawn between \u201cexpert testimony that is merely a \u2018conduit\u2019 for someone else\u2019s analysis versus expert testimony in which the live witness offers their own independent analysis.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 280. The evidence Dr. Luttman provided in court was her opinion, based on a comparison and interpretation of the reports, that the sample from 1984 matched the sample from 2004. <em>See Williams, </em>345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d at 279 (\u201cThe evidence against the defendant was [the expert\u2019s] opinion, not [the crime lab\u2019s] report ... [the expert] testified to her conclusion based upon her own subjective judgment about the comparison of the [crime lab] report with the existing ... profile.\u201d). The report conducted in 1985, therefore, should not be considered hearsay because it was a basis merely for Dr. Luttman\u2019s subjective opinion. Accordingly, I would hold that the 1985 report, being admissible non-hearsay, does not implicate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">B. <em>Confrontation Clause Implications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In holding that Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the 1985 serology report is inadmissible, the Majority states that the report is not \u201craw data,\u201d which includes only \u201cdata or materials which have not yet been subjected to scientific testing.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 244, 29 A.3d at 554. Even if the 1985 serology report and Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the report are hearsay (a belief I do not harbor), I believe the 1985 serology report contains merely \u201craw data,\u201d and testimony relating to that report is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d within the contemplation of the Confrontation Clause. I would hold, therefore, that both the report and Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding that report do not violate Derr\u2019s confrontation rights and were, therefore, admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The Court of Appeals of New York held in <em>People v. Brown, </em>13 N.Y.3d 332, 890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d 927, 931 (2009)\u2014 a post <em>Melendez-Diaz, pre-Bullcoming </em>case\u2014that a laboratory testing report was not testimonial because \u201cit consisted of merely machine-generated graphs, charts and numerical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>data.\u201d In <em>Brown, </em>a young woman was raped allegedly in 1993; when she escaped her attacker, a friend brought her to a local hospital. <em>See Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 928. The hospital collected evidence using a rape kit, but, due to back-log in the system, DNA testing was not completed for almost nine years. <em>See id. </em>The laboratory that conducted the test isolated a male DNA specimen and produced a DNA report, which implicated Brown in the rape. <em>See Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 929. At trial, an expert witness testified to the findings in the DNA report, even though he did not participate directly in the testing procedure. <em>See Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 930. In holding that the DNA report constituted \u201craw data\u201d alone, the New York court explained that such \u201craw data\u201d could be introduced at trial properly, with accompanying live witness testimony, without running afoul of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The facts of <em>Brown </em>vary greatly from those with which the Supreme Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>dealt. The prosecution in <em>Brown </em>called a live witness to attest to the findings in the original DNA test and the later match found in CODIS, <em>see Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 931, whereas, in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the prosecution entered into evidence, without live testimony by a witness, \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d signed by law enforcement officials, which stated that a substance seized from the defendants was cocaine of a certain weight. <em>See Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 314. The <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>Majority dismissed the prosecution\u2019s argument that, for Confrontation Clause purposes, the affidavits were \u201cthe result of neutral, scientific testing\u201d because the affidavits \u201ccontained only the bare-bones statement that \u2018the substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 2536-37, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326-27 (internal citations and alterations omitted). Moreover, the prosecution in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>did not present a live witness to review or verify the results contained in the affidavits. <em>See Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2536, 174 L.Ed.2d at 326 (\u201c[The Confrontation Clause] commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d) (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61-62, 124 S.Ct. at 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d at 177). In contrast, in <em>Brown, </em>the laboratory\u2019s original DNA report contained no conclusions, interpretations, or comparisons; therefore, according to the appellate court, it was \u201craw data ... in the form of nonidentifying graphical information.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 931 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The analyst herself testified that \u201cshe had personally examined the [laboratory] file; she interpreted the profile of data represented in the machine-generated graphs; and she made the critical determination linking the defendant to the crime;\u201d she further testified that she was familiar with the laboratory\u2019s procedures and protocols. <em>Id. </em>As the data presented in <em>Brown </em>was merely \u201craw data\u201d and the prosecution provided live witness testimony interpreting the report, the testimony was admissible. <em>Brown, </em>890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d at 932. The facts of the present case, where Dr. Luttman testified in court regarding the 1985 serology report, which consisted of raw data merely, are closer to <em>Brown </em>than <em>Melendez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Bullcoming, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent Confrontation Clause gift,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was decided after <em>Brown, </em>and does not alter, in my view, the viability of the holding in <em>Brown. </em>In <em>Bullcoming, </em>which involved a forensic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration (\u201cBAC\u201d) was above the threshold for purposes of a driving while intoxicated (DWI) charge, the Supreme Court held that the admission of surrogate testimony of a witness who did not \u201csign the certification or <em>perform or observe </em>the test reported in the certification\u201d violates the Confrontation Clause. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2710, 180 L.Ed.2d at 616 (emphasis added). A witness for the prosecution testified regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>BAC report, which contained not only facts, but also subjective conclusions of the analyst. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, the report in question included: (1) the reason Bullcoming was stopped by police officers; (2) a certification by the nurse who drew the blood; (3) a \u201ccertificate of analyst\u201d; (4) Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol level; (5) an affirmation that the sample was received intact; (6) a statement that the bulk of the report was correct; (7) a statement that the proper procedures were followed; and (8) a certificate of the reviewing analyst. <em>See id. </em>The report, therefore, was clearly not \u201craw data,\u201d but rather was a detailed description of \u201cpast events and human actions.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he report was \u2018functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Melendez-Diaz, 557 </em>U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321)). Because the analyst who performed the test and wrote the report included conclusions in the report\u2014that the test complied with standard procedures, and that the statement of the report was correct\u2014the Supreme Court held that report was testimonial in nature and afforded Bullcoming no opportunity to confront the analyst in hopes of \u201cexposing] any lapses or lies on the certifying analysts part,\u201d and the use of a surrogate witness who neither observed nor supervised the test did not cure that. <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014- U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2722, 180 L.Ed.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Although the record extract is not clear as to what exact data the 1985 serology report included, Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony and the serology report itself resembles closely the factual situation in <em>Brown, </em>and is distinguishable readily from the factual scenarios in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. </em>First, as in <em>Brown, </em>and unlike <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the State here did not provide merely a \u201cbare-bones\u201d statement without live testimony, instead the state called a witness, Dr. Luttman, to testify regarding her interpretation of the 1985 serology test. Second, similar to the expert in <em>Brown, </em>who testified regarding the accuracy of a DNA report based on her knowledge and expertise, Dr. Luttman testified that she reviewed personally the report and could state, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>scientific certainty,\u201d that semen and sperm were present on the physical evidence obtained from the PERK because, in her experience, \u201c[s]perm cells have a very distinct shape that\u2019s very different from other cells ... when you see those cells on the microscope slide you know that there\u2019s semen present.\u201d Third, Dr. Luttman, an FBI DNA analyst; used her experience and knowledge, combined with findings of the later DNA reports, much like the witness in <em>Brown, </em>and determined that the physical evidence in the PERK was in fact semen and sperm and a match to Derr\u2019s DNA profile.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the report, unlike in <em>Bullcoming, </em>did not contain, on the present record, an affirmation or certification, by either the biologist or the forensic serology examiner, that the findings in the report were \u201ccorrect.\u201d Because I believe <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming </em>are distinguishable factually from the present case and because I believe the holding in <em>Brown </em>may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>applied neatly to the present case, even if the 1985 serology report and Dr. Luttman\u2019s testimony regarding the report are considered hearsay (but admissible under Maryland evidence rules), I do not conclude that its admission violated Derr\u2019s confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">II. <em>200k DNA Results</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In 2002, eighteen years after the alleged rape, FBI personnel conducted chemical tests on the evidence obtained from the PERK. The FBI lab created a DNA profile from the biological evidence, and matched the profile to Derr\u2019s DNA profile then-existing in the CODIS database. In order to confirm this match, FBI personnel performed DNA testing on a buccal swab (taken from Derr in 2004). Dr. Luttman testified that her role as supervisor of the 2004 testing was \u201cto do the comparisons between known samples and question samples, to draw all the conclusions, to do the statistical calculations and write the report in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In <em>Bullcoming, supra, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that surrogate testimony may violate the Confrontation Clause when the surrogate is ill-equipped to convey what the actual analyst knew or observed, and therefore is unable to attest to any lapses or lies on the analyst\u2019s part. <em>See Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at -, 180 L.Ed.2d at 622. Of particular importance in <em>Bullcoming, </em>the certifying analyst was put on unpaid leave prior to the trial and the testifying expert witness did not know the reason for the analyst being put on unpaid leave. <em>See id. </em>Further, the prosecution did not notify Bullcoming until the day of the trial that the certifying analyst would not be testifying at trial. <em>See id. </em>These issues raised questions concerning the competence and honesty of the certifying analyst. <em>See id. </em>Because the surrogate witness did not observe or oversee the testing process in person, she could not confirm that the proper procedures were followed, and, thus, her testimony regarding the certifying expert\u2019s analysis did not fulfill Bullcoming\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him. <em>See Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>-, 180 L.Ed.2d at 623.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, after <em>Bullcoming, </em>the testifying witness must either (1) perform the actual test, or (2) observe or otherwise supervise the test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Majority opinion in the present case discounts the 2004 test quickly, noting that Dr. Luttman\u2019s team relied on the results of the 2002 test (which I agree was inadmissible). <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 250-51, 29 A.3d at 557-58.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The 2004 DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>testing results are distinguishable from the situation in <em>Bull-coming </em>in a significant way: Dr. Luttman actually observed the testing and performed the analysis necessary to write the report. Unlike the witness in <em>Bullcoming, </em>Dr. Luttman, as the supervisor of the testing, was able to testify as to the procedures followed by the analysts performing the bench work. Further, even though Derr does not raise an issue with the competence or honesty of the testing analysts, Dr. Luttman could attest presumably to the competence or honesty<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the analysts under her supervision. Also in contrast to the facts of <em>Bullcoming, </em>Derr does not complain that the State did not notify him properly of its intention to call Dr. Luttman, the supervisor of the test rather than the actual testing analyst. The facts of this case, therefore, are distinguishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>in several ways from <em>Buttcoming, </em>but most notably, in line with the general holding of <em>Buttcoming, </em>Dr. Luttman <em>observed </em>the 2004 testing and <em>performed </em>the analysis necessary to interpret the results and write the report.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Does the Confrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign the certification <em>or personally perform or observe tine performance of the test </em>reported in the certification[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\"><em>Bullcoming, </em>- U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d at 619 (emphasis added).

State, </em>28 So.3d 838, 853 (Fla.2009), the defendant asserted that his confrontation rights were violated when the prosecution failed to produce the biologist that performed the DNA sample taken from Smith and the sample obtained from the victim\u2019s clothing. The prosecution instead called the FBI supervisor who interpreted the results by evaluating the \u201craw test results\u201d and compared those results to the sample from the victim\u2019s clothing; the supervisor also authored the official report that stated the two samples matched. <em>See Smith, </em>28 So.3d at 854. The appellate court found this situation distinguishable from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>because \u201cthe FBI team supervisor who interpreted the data, formulated the conclusions, and prepared the report that implicated Smith in the sexual battery <em>actually testified during trial.\u201d Smith, </em>28 So.3d at 855 n. 13. The critical distinction, therefore, from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>is that, in <em>Smith, </em>the prosecution presented at trial a witness who interpreted data and formed <em>independent </em>conclusions from the bench work completed by analysts; when the prosecution presents a report alone or a mere recitation of the report, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>controls. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Because the State\u2019s expert witness in the present case observed the 2004 DNA sampling, performed the analysis of the sampling, and wrote the report that indicated that the DNA obtained from Derr matched the DNA obtained from the 1984 PERK, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>does not control. The 2004 test is distinguishable further from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>because Dr. Luttman actually testified at trial and stated that she interpreted the results, did statistical calculations, and wrote the report. Dr. Luttman testified that her role in the 2004 testing included writing the official report, as did the FBI supervisors in <em>Smith </em>and <em>Pendergrass v. State, </em>913 N.E.2d 703, 707 (Ind.2009).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As such, she did not attest to the accuracy of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cbare-bones\u201d statement, but rather attested to her personal conclusions from observing and interpreting the 2004 test and its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I would hold, therefore, on this limited record, that Dr. Luttman was fit to testify to and answer questions (and respond to cross-examination) regarding the 1985 serology report and the 2004 DNA report. Nonetheless, Derr gets a new trial because the 2002 report, offered solely through Dr. Luttman, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\">.

Thus, hearsay and the Confrontal ion Clause present two separate evidentiary hurdles which must both be satisfied before a piece of evidence may be properly admissible at trial.

We are not alone in our determination that DNA reports are testimonial and subject to the Confrontation Clause. For example, in <em>People v.

Although the witnesses who actually testified concerning the laboratory reports at issue here had basic knowledge concerning DNA testing and the methods used to prepare the reports in general, they had not personally conducted the testing, had not personally examined the evidence collected from the victims, and had not personally reached any of the scientific conclusions contained in the reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACj\">Similarly, in <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>916 A.2d 922, 937-39 (D.C.2007), the court held that the Confrontation Clause is violated when a DNA expert testifies based on DNA test results that were performed by a nontestifying DNA analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has vacated and remanded two State court opinions that allowed the surrogate testimony of an expert who did not perform the actual testing. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Crager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 369, 879 N.E.2d 745, 746-48 (2007), the Ohio Supreme Court upheld a ruling of the trial court that allowed testimony regarding the results of a DNA test by an expert who had engaged in a \"technical review\u201d of the work of the analyst who had actually performed the blood test and generated the DNA profile. The trial court admitted the reports under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, a rationale that was expressly discredited in <em>Melendez.

The defendant appealed the decision of the California Court of Appeal for the Second District to the Supreme Court of California, but the petition for review was denied. <em>People v. Barba, </em>No. S 159091, 2008 Cal. LEXIS 2502 (Cal. Feb. 27, 2008). The defendant then petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States; the petition was granted, and the judgment was vacated and the case remanded to the California Court of Appeal for the Second District in light of <em>Melendez. Barba v. </em>California, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2857, 174 L.Ed.2d 599 (2009). On remand to the California Court of Appeal for the Second District, the court found that <em>Melendez </em>was distinguishable from the facts in <em>Barba, </em>and thus the court held, once again, that the Confrontation Clause had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>not been violated. <em>People v.

Friedman, who has researched and written extensively about the Confrontation Clause, in addition to authoring and contributing to textbooks and treatises on evidence in general, and who has argued two Confrontation Clause cases before the Supreme Court. We are persuaded by his explanation in his blog, \"The Confrontation Blog,\u201d regarding whether the testimonial reports must be formally admitted in order to trigger the Confrontation Clause. He recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">Formal admission of an out-of-court statement is not necessary to invoke the Confrontation Clause.... It should be enough if the prosecution is effectively asking the jury to infer that the in-court witness is communicating some or all of the substance of an out-of-court testimonial statement., and that this substance is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Professor Richard D. Friedman, <em>Initial thoughts on Williams, </em>The Confrontation Blog (July 9, 2011, 2:26 AM), http://confrontationright. blogspot.com/. In applying this principle to a pending United States Supreme Court case, Friedman continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">In considering application of this principle to <em>[People v. Williams, </em>238 Ill.2d 125, 345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d 268 (2010), <em>cert. granted, Williams </em>v. Illinois, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3090, 180 L.Ed.2d 911 (2011) ], note first that the existence of the statement was made clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to the jury. In other words, this is not a case in which an expert assembles information from one or more sources and then draws an inference based on that information without disclosing what it is or what its sources are---- Furthermore, it was clear what the substance of the statement was: It indicated that the vaginal swab taken from the crime scene reflected the same DNA profile as the swab taken from [Williams], It is as if an in-court witness reports, \"Somebody at the scene described the person she saw commit the crime, and the description closely matched Williams.\u201d So far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, the report was presented to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqu\"><em>Id. </em>In this way, it is clear that a DNA profile is submitted for its truth, and therefore cannot be considered as mere support on which \"an expert bases an opinion or inference\u201d under Md. Rule 5-703, but rather, must be considered a testimonial statement that is admitted as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted. This is because of the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFg\">simple point that if a statement supports the expert's opinion only if it is true then it is a sham to say that it is being presented to support the opinion but not for its truth; ... the application of this principle is perfectly clear: If the profile revealed by the vaginal swab was not what the ... report said it was, then that report provided no support whatsoever for the expert\u2019s opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">. The court in <em>Veney </em>held that although Dr. Luttman testified as to the test results produced by other analysts, the appellant could not prove plain error and therefore the violation did not result in reversal. <em>Veney, </em>936 A.2d at 831-32. <em>Veney </em>also held that Dr. Luttman \"used her own interpretations of the DNA evidence in arriving at the conclusion\u2014that appellant could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA evidence\u2014 to which she testified at trial.\u201d <em>Veney, </em>936 A.2d at 831. We highlight this case to show the court\u2019s interpretation of the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 703, and we note that the case was decided prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>Bullcoming </em>that the actual testing procedures, in addition to the results, constitute testimonial evidence against the accused. Thus, in light of <em>Bullcoming, </em>we do not believe the United States Supreme Court would accept <em>Veney\u2019s </em>determination that Dr. Luttman testified as to her own conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">. The concurring opinion in <em>Bullcoming </em>noted that the majority opinion in that case did not address whether, under Fed.R.Evid. 703, a testifying analyst could rely on the report of a nontestifying analyst in forming his or her own independent opinion, so long as the <em>actual </em>report containing the testimonial statements of the nontestifying analyst was not itself admitted. <em>See </em>Bullcoming, - U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2722, 180 L.Ed.2d at 629 (Sotomayor, L, concurring in part). We note, however, that the case before us is not such a case because, like in <em>Bullcoming, </em>the reports of the nontestifying analysts were admitted into evidence and their substance was admitted through the testimony of Dr. Luttman. In the present case, Dr. Luttman relied entirely on the testimonial statements of others in forming her conclusions. The serology report and DNA profiles were admitted into evidence, through Dr. Luttman, for their substance, and the Confrontation Clause was therefore violated because the documents contained testimonial statements of nontestifying witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. The dissent expresses a concern that if forensic testing such as the 1985 serology analysis and the 2004 DNA profile are subjected to the Court's holding in <em>Bullcoming, </em>cold cases will be nearly impossible to prosecute without calling the specific analyst who performed the test to appear in court. The Court in <em>Bullcoming, </em>however, presented a solution to this problem, positing that \u201cNew Mexico could have avoided any Confrontation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.\u201d Bullcoming, - U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2718, 180 L.Ed.2d at 624. Thus, by preserving the physical evidence in a laboratory and having it retested by another analyst, the new analyst may testify in court as to his or her independent findings from the retest. The testimony by the new analyst, who actually performed or observed the retest, could satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">. <em>Melendez </em>clarified and <em>Bullcoming </em>affirmed, a point the dissent overlooks, that \u201c[a] document created solely for an \u2018evidentiary purpose,\u2019 \u201d and \"made in aid of a police investigation, ranks as testimoni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>al.\" <em>Bullcoming, </em>- U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2717, 180 L.Ed.2d at 623 (quoting <em>Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321). The Supreme Court went further to point out in <em>Bullcoming </em>that \"[a]s the New Mexico Supreme Court recognized, 'the absence of [an] oath [i]s not dispositive\u2019 in determining if a statement is testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193). Thus, the conclusion by the FBI analyst, as reflected in the 1985 serology report and as introduced into evidence, that semen and sperm were present in the biological evidence tested, clearly \"[fell] within the core class of testimonial statements,\u201d whether that assertion was sworn or unsworn. <em>See Melendez, </em>557 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d at 321; <em>see also Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 236-37; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">.

Although the Majority opinion in <em>Bullcoming </em>did not discuss expressly these factual situations, and Justice Soto-mayor declined to elaborate on the strength of these specific arguments for admissibility, the limited nature of the holding in <em>Bullcoming </em>allows for at least the possibility of the admission of both Dr. Luttman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>testimony regarding the 1985 and 2004 reports and the reports themselves in the present case. As discussed in further detail <em>infra, </em>Dr. Luttman had a personal connection to the 2004 testing through her role as a supervisor, gave her expert opinion about \"underlying testimonial reports\u201d that were not necessarily admissible (i.e., the 2002 report) and interpreted and compared the raw data from the 1985 report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. Unfortunately, the direction the Supreme Court has taken seems to inhibit significantly the Government\u2019s ability to prosecute \u201ccold cases\u201d similar to the present case. If the Supreme Court extends further the holding in <em>Bullcoming, </em>to include under the now vast umbrella of \u201ctestimonial hearsay,\u201d tests similar to the 1985 serology and the 2004 DNA sampling, it may become next to impossible to prosecute \"cold cases\u201d without every FBI or private crime lab analyst or technician appearing in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">.

State, </em>392 Md. 455, 505, 897 A.2d 821, 850 (2006), this rule is a well-settled, back-door hearsay exception: \"Federal courts and a majority of state courts permit an expert witness to express an opinion that is based, in part, on hearsay of a kind customarily relied on.... This rule has been long accepted in Maryland.\u201d (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.). While \"the proffered evidence [may not] meet the definition of hearsay, it [may] be admitted \u2018for the limited purpose of explaining the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Although <em>Rollins </em>is a <em>pre-Melendez-Diaz </em>case, both state and federal courts have applied their evidence rules analogous to Md. Rule 5-703 in the <em>post-Melendez-Diaz </em>landscape. <em>See, e.g., Morris v. United States, </em>2010 WL 1752030, at *3, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53583, at *9 (D.S.D. 29 April 2010) <em>(\"Melendez-Diaz </em>did not dispose of Federal Rule of Evidence 703.\u201d); <em>People v. Johnson, </em>406 Ill.App.3d 114, 346 Ill.Dec. 264, 940 N.E.2d 264 (2010) (that <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>does not abrogate Illinois Rule 703).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">. In <em>United States v. Blazier, </em>69 M.J. 218, 222 (C.A.A.F.2010), the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces held\u2014in the context of an expert witness who did not conduct a test, but testified as to the results of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>lest and his own interpretation of those results\u2014that an expert is permitted to rely on, repeat, or interpret non-hearsay data and/or rely on, but not repeat hearsay that is a basis for his or her opinion, as long as the expert forms his or her independent opinion. In <em>Blazier, </em>the prosecution attempted to enter into evidence two drug testing reports signed by two different individuals; the prosecution\u2019s expert witness was the \"Laboratory Certifying Official,\u201d and testified as to the accuracy of the reports. <em>See Blazier, </em>69 M.J. at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In reaching its conclusion, that some, but not all, of the expert's testimony was admissible, the appellate court applied three established principles of the rules of evidence; (1) machine-generated data and printouts are not statements and thus are not hearsay (and, <em>ipso facto, </em>the data is not \"testimonial\u201d); (2) expert witnesses may rely on and review \"work of others, including laboratory testing conducted by others, so long as they reach their own opinions in conformance with evidentiary rules regarding expert opinions\u201d; and (3) expert witnesses are not permitted to \"act as a conduit for repeating testimonial hearsay.\u201d <em>Blazier, </em>69 M.J. at 224-25. Therefore, the federal appeals court concluded, the expert\u2019s testimony that explained and analyzed the documents was admissible because it was not hearsay; the expert's conclusions were his own, based on his training, education, and experience. <em>See Blazier, </em>69 M.J. at 225-26. Portions of the expert\u2019s testimony, however, consisted of statements conveying exact language from the documents\u2014i.e., what tests were conducted, what substances were identified, and what level of each substance was detected\u2014such statements, the court held, were inadmissible hearsay. <em>See Blazier </em>69 M.J. at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">As applied to the present case, Dr. Luttman relied on the work of the hospital personnel who collected the physical evidence and the FBI biologist and forensic serologist, and, based on her experiences as an FBI DNA analyst and supervisor, she came to the conclusion that the 1985 sample contained sperm and semen. Although this conclusion is the same as the conclusion that was in the report, Dr. Luttman was not acting as a \"conduit for repeating testimonial hearsay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">. As the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Bullcoming </em>is very recent, very few lower courts have had the opportunity to apply the decision to a different set of facts. On 29 July 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit interpreted <em>Bullcoming </em>in deciding <em>United States v. Moore, </em>651 F.3d 30 (D.C.Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. In an analogous situation to the present case, the Kansas Supreme Court held, in <em>State v. Appleby, </em>289 Kan. 1017, 221 P.3d 525, 552 (2009), a <em>post-Melendez-Diaz </em>case, that admitting testimony of an expert witness regarding DNA statistical population data, generated by comparing DNA profiles, did not violate the Confrontation Clause. The appellate court found that DNA profiles are \"physical evidence\u201d and, therefore, are non-testimonial. <em>See Appleby, </em>221 P.3d at 551. Simply combining physical evidence, such as DNA, in a database with other physical evidence \"does not convert the nature of the evidence, even if the purpose of pooling the profiles is to allow comparisons that identify criminals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the mere fact that humans took part in the creation of a report or database does not convert immediately \"raw data\u201d to \"testimonial data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">When completed in 1985, serology tests were presumably less automated than similar tests today. Computers have revolutionized such testing, and it is likely, though not known on this record, that true \"machine-produced\u201d data was all but non-existent. Holding such tests, common in \"cold\u201d cases from the 1980s and 1990s (and earlier), to the same standards of sophisticated forensic testing methods utilized today is analogous to comparing the accuracy of a complex mathematical problem solved by slide rule in the 1980s to the same mathematical problem analyzed today with the use of a high-tech calculator. Of course, there is less human action involved in using a calculator, but that does not mean necessarily that the data is \"testimonial\u201d rather than \"raw data.\u201d Likewise, there is less human action involved inherently in producing a DNA report today than there was in producing a serology report in 1985; however, the data is still \"raw\u201d despite the change in the amount of required human action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. The question presented in <em>Bullcoming </em>was:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\">. The Majority in <em>Bullcoming </em>noted that \u201d[i]t would be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who observed\u201d a test testified regarding the results of the test or to a report of the results. Bullcoming,-U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2722, 180 L.Ed.2d at 629. The Supreme Court declined to discuss the degree of involvement necessary to eliminate Confrontation Clause concerns because the witness in <em>Bullcoming </em>had \"no involvement whatsoever in the relevant test and report.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b292-15\">. In forming this opinion regarding the 2004 test, the Majority opinion seems to ignore Maryland Rule 5-703(a), which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type <em>reasonably relied upon </em>by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data <em>need not be admissible </em>in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">(Emphasis added.) Even if the 2002 report is inadmissible, courts have often held that DNA testing results are \"of the type reasonably relied upon by experts\u201d in the field to draw independent conclusions. <em>See, e.g., People v. Williams, </em>238 Ill.2d 125, 345 Ill.Dec. 425, 939 N.E.2d 268, 277 (2010) (\"[The expert witness] testified that it is a commonly accepted practice in the scientific community for one DNA expert to rely on the records of another DNA analyst to complete her work.\u201d); <em>Appleby, </em>221 P.3d at 552 (\"[A] database and [a] statistical program are accepted sources of information generally relied on by DNA experts.\u201d); <em>Vann v. State, </em>229 P.3d 197, 207 (Alaska Ct.App.2010) (\"[C]ourts have allowed DNA analysts to give their opinion of the significance of DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>lest results even when those test results were obtained from testing performed by another laboratory analyst.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\">. In another <em>post-Melendez-Diaz </em>case, <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>686 F.Supp.2d 382, 383 (S.D.N.Y.2010), the defendant objected to the government's use of an expert witness who did not perform the DNA testing, but who made the final determination as to the DNA match. DNA testing, the appellate court explained, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_s\">the 'gold standard\u2019 for forensic testing, [but] is not immune from error or falsification, and, thus, even if the overall error rate in properly conducted DNA testing is extremely low, a defendant must be given, consistent with the mandates of the Constitution, a reasonable opportunity to determine through cross-examination if any such error or falsification is present in any DNA testing admitted into evidence. That opportunity cannot be boundless, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Boyd, </em>686 F.Supp.2d at 384 (internal citations omitted). If the testing requires merely that technicians perform mechanical or ministerial tasks, the Court explained, without any indication of falsification or error, the need to call the technician is not a \"constitutional necessity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Court held that as long as the testifying expert can testify in detail to the ministerial nature of the steps performed in completing the DNA testing, and to the technical accuracy of the results, the defendant's confrontation rights are not frustrated. <em>See Boyd, </em>686 F.Supp.2d at 385. In any event, falsification or contamination of DNA data would result in \"blank spots, but would not otherwise alter the data to form an erroneous DNA profile.\u201d <em>People v. Brown, </em>13 N.Y.3d 332, 890 N.Y.S.2d 415, 918 N.E.2d 927, 932 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Dr. Luttman, as a supervisor, could testify as to the procedures and the ministerial nature of the tasks necessary to complete the DNA profile. In fact, Derr did not indicate that there was a suspected error or falsification in the results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. In <em>Pendergrass v. State, </em>913 N.E.2d 703, 707 (Ind.2009), the prosecution chose to call a laboratory supervisor, rather than a processor, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>testify to the results of a DNA test. The appellate court found, as in <em>Smith, </em>that the supervisor was permitted to testify as to the accuracy of test results as well as the standard operating procedures of the lab and, as a supervisor, was \u201cperhaps the ideal witness, against whom to lodge such challenges.\u201d <em>Pendergrass, </em>913 N.E.2d at 707-08. Because one who supervised lab testing is permitted to testify regarding such testing, <em>a fortiori </em>Dr. Luttman, who, <em>herself </em>supervised the testing, interpreted the results, and wrote the report (that she attested to at trial), should be allowed similarly to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
