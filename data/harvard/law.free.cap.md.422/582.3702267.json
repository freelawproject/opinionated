Zorzit, </em>418 Md. 397, 15 A.3d 298 (2011). For the reasons that follow, we hold that because the Circuit Court is authorized by \u00a7 7-107(f) of the Family Law Article to enter a judgment in favor of the law firm, Md. Rule 2-214(a)(2) provides the law firm with the right to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, on August 19, 2010, Tydings &amp; Rosenberg, LLP, Appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a MOTION TO INTERVENE in the case of Julie Zorzit, <em>Plaintiff, </em>v. John Zorzit, <em>Defendant </em>(Appellee). Appellant\u2019s motion included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-214, Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP hereby moves to intervene in the captioned action. As more fully appears herein, Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP (T &amp; R) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede that interest, which is not adequately represented by existing parties. T &amp; R asks this Court to invoke Maryland Code, Family Law Art., \u00a7 7\u2014107(f), and order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that \u201cany amount awarded for counsel fees be <em>paid directly to the </em>lawyer\u201d and <em>\u201center judgment in favor of the lawyer.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">2. On February 3, 2009, T <em>&amp; </em>R, on behalf of Plaintiff, instituted this action by filing a Complaint for Absolute and Limited Divorce and <em>Pendente Lite </em>and Other Relief against Defendant John Zorzit, seeking an order granting absolute and limited divorce, a monetary award, <em>pendente lite </em>and permanent alimony and child support, custody, attorney\u2019s fees, suit money, and litigation costs. These prayers were reasserted in a later filed Amended Complaint. In the normal course of events, the claims for attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs would be adjudicated as part of the overall action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">3. The Family Law Article empowers the Court to order that \u201cany amount awarded for counsel fees be <em>paid directly to the lawyer,\u201d </em>and the Court may <em>\u201center judgment in favor of the lawyer.\u201d </em>See Maryland Code, Family Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7 7-107(f)(divorce) (emphasis supplied), 8-214(f)(monetary award), 11110(f) (alimony). T <em>&amp; </em>R seeks this Court to award counsel fees to be paid directly to it as the lawyer for Julie Zorzit, and to enter judgments for same in its favor, and against John Zorzit, with costs. The Court of Special Appeals has endorsed the invocation of these statutes \u201cirrespective of whether a fee agreement exists between the client and attorney,\u201d even where a party was not obligated to pay counsel. <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>185 Md.App. 465, 486 [971 A.2d 345] (2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">9. On August 4, 2010, counsel for Plaintiff received a letter from Defendant\u2019s counsel advising that the parties were in a direct dialogue, without counsel, in an attempt to resolve all matters in the case, and requesting that the August 6 conference with the Court be postponed so that the parties would have until August 16, 2010 (the date a hearing on Plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>a threatened eviction from the family home had been scheduled) to reach a comprehensive agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">12. In addition to the fact that the terms laid out in the proposed Judgment are unfair and unconscionable to Plaintiff, the purported settlement is largely an attempt to deprive T &amp; R of payment for Plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees and costs. As detailed above, this Court has already determined that proper claims for attorney\u2019s fees and costs exist relating to both the child custody and support issues, and litigating the validity and interpretation of the Agreement, which represent substantial portions of the total fees. Moreover, under the terms of the proposed Judgment, Plaintiff, who has an independent obligation to pay T <em>&amp; </em>R for fees incurred on her behalf, will not have assets, effectively becoming judgment proof. Endorsement of the proposed Judgment of Divorce would work significant harm and prejudice upon T &amp; R\u2019s rights, and civil conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">16. This Court is exercising its jurisdiction over a divorce proceeding with respect to which it \u201chas all the powers of a court of equity.\u201d Code, Family Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7 1-201(a)(4), l-203(a). Equity regards and treats as done that which ought to be done, parties seeking relief in equity, and equity is concerned with substance not mere form. <em>Peninsula Methodist Homes &amp; Hosps., Inc. v. Cropper, 256 </em>Md. 728, 735-36, 261 A.2d 787 (1970); <em>Merryman v. Bremmer, </em>250 Md. 1, 11-12, 241 A.2d 558 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">It is a well established principle that courts of equity will not permit the forms of law to be made the instruments of injustice, but will interpose against parties attempting to avail themselves of the rigid rules of law for unfair purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\"><em>Hyatt v. Romero, </em>190 Md. 500, 505, 58 A.2d 899 (1948). <em>See generally Williams v. Williams, </em>306 Md. 332, 341-42, 508 A.2d 985 (1986) (judicial power exists to void a separation agreement containing unjust and unfair terms, where con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sideration is grossly inadequate and burdens on one spouse are oppressive).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">18. That the existing parties to this action are not protecting T <em>&amp; </em>R\u2019s interests, and, indeed, are acting in concert to the detriment of those interests, is apparent. In any event, the movant\u2019s burden of showing that existing representation may be inadequate is a minimal one. <em>Citizens Coordinating Committee on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Assocs., </em>276 Md. 705, 714, 351 A.2d 133 (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">WHEREFORE, Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP prays that its Motion to Intervene be granted, and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">A. It be permitted to intervene as a Plaintiff in the captioned action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">B. This Court decline to endorse the proposed Judgment of Divorce;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">C. This Court conduct further proceedings to ascertain the attorney\u2019s fees, and costs attributable to the work of Tydings <em>&amp; </em>Rosenberg LLP on behalf of the Plaintiff in this action until such time as the Court granted the motion of Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP to withdraw as Plaintiffs counsel, which would have been, and should be, awarded to Plaintiff and/or Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP in this action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">D. This Court enter judgment in favor of Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP, and against John Zorzit, in an amount to be determined after an evidentiary hearing, representing attorney\u2019s fees, and costs which would have been awarded to Plaintiff and/or Tydings &amp; Rosenberg LLP in this action; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">E. This Court enter such other and further relief as justice may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">On August 20, 2010, the Circuit Court (1) denied Appellant\u2019s Motion to Intervene, and (2) entered a JUDGMENT OF ABSOLUTE DIVORCE AND FOR ANCILLARY RELIEF that included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The parties having reached a comprehensive settlement of all issues pending before the Court, as set forth below, the same appearing to the Court to be in the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor children, in the interests of justice, and consented to by the parties, it is therefore ordered this 20th day of August 2010 by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">1. The parties be, and they are hereby, DIVORCED ABSOLUTELY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">12. Each of the parties be and is hereby DENIED ANY AND ALL OTHER RELIEF available therein, WITHOUT RESERVATION, including without limitation, any relief available pursuant to the parties\u2019 Post-Nuptial Agreement (the validity of which was upheld by the Court in a ruling from the Bench on July 27, 2010 but which is expressly superseded by the provisions of this Judgment) any further or other use and possession of any real and/or personal property (except as addressed above (Para.l0.a.)), any contribution to attorney\u2019s fees, etc., and all such rights are hereby deemed RELEASED and/or WAIVED by each party as against the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">14. By agreement of the parties, excepting on Paras. 2 and 3 above, (custody and child support) each and all of the provisions of this Judgment shall be and are non-modifiable in any and all aspects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Circuit Court\u2019s signature appears between paragraph 14 and the following sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">THIS JUDGMENT IS CONSENTED TO BY THE PARTIES, AS TO BOTH ITS FORM AND ITS CONTENT, AS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THEM AND AS AN ORDER OF COURT.

The following writings appear below those signatures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>CC Julie Zorzit, pro se</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxM\">\n<em>John Zorzit, Defendant</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A81\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On August 24, 2010, Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Professors Wright and Miller describe \u201cintervention\u201d as a \u201cprocedure by which an outsider with an interest in a lawsuit may come in as a party though the outsider has not been named as a party by the existing litigants.\u201d 7C Charles Alan Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1901, (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cWright &amp; Miller\u201d). In federal courts, an \u201coutsider\u2019s\u201d right to intervene is governed by Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">(a) Intervention of Right. On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">(2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\u2019s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">In Maryland circuit courts, an \u201coutsider\u2019s\u201d right to intervene is governed by Md. Rule 2-214, which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Rule 2-214. Intervention</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">(a) Of right. Upon timely motion, a person shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when the person has an unconditional right to intervene as a matter of law; or (2) when the person claims an interest relating to the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>or transaction that is the subject of the action, and the person is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the ability to protect that interest unless it is adequately represented by existing parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">As Md. Rule 2-214 is modeled after FRCP 24, this Court has \u201cpointed out that intervention decisions under [the federal rule] serve as a guide to interpreting the Maryland intervention rule.\u201d <em>Coalition For Open Doors et al. v. Annapolis Lodge No. 622, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, </em>333 Md. 359, 368 n. 10, 635 A.2d 412, 416 n. 10 (1994). Professors Wright and Miller have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">It has been recognized that \u201cinterests in property are the most elementary type of right that Rule 24(a) is designed to protect.\u201d Thus, many of the cases in which a sufficient interest has been found under amended Rule 24(a)(2) have been cases in which there is a readily identifiable interest in land, or some other form of property, such as intellectual property or personal property. A sufficient interest also has been found when the intervenor claims an identifiable interest in funds that are the subject of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFG\">Wright <em>&amp; </em>Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1908.1. (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\"><em>Gaines v. Dixie Carriers, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 52 (5th Cir.1970) was cited by Professors Wright and Miller for the proposition that legal fees earned by a law firm permit the firm to intervene on the ground that the earned fees provide the firm with \u201can identifiable interest in funds that are the subject of litigation.\u201d In that case, after signing a contingent fee agreement with a law firm that asserted a Jones Act claim on his behalf, the plaintiff \u201cattempted to discharge his counsel and substituted another law firm as counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. After the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana dismissed the law firm\u2019s motion to intervene, that decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">We think it clear that the appellant law firm here claimed an interest in the subject of the action against [the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>dant], and is so situated that the final disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest. Neither of the existing parties is concerned with protecting the appellant\u2019s interest....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">Appellee\u2019s brief suggests that the case having been dismissed by joint consent the intervention falls with it, there being no case open in which appellant can now intervene. There is, nevertheless, a res, the $14,150.88 held in the registry of the district court, which must be allocated as law and justice require between Gaines\u2019 former and present counsel. This seems to us sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In <em>United States v. Eilberg, </em>89 F.R.D. 473 (E.D.Pa.1980), which is also cited by Professors Wright and Miller, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted the motion to intervene filed by two former law partners of a defendant who had been sued by the federal government. In this case, the government was seeking the defendant\u2019s \u201cdistributive share\u201d of a fee that had been paid to the law firm, while the intervenors asserted that \u201cthe share belongs to them rather than to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. After finding that \u201cthe existing parties [to the federal litigation] clearly will not adequately represent the interests of [the defendant\u2019s former partners],\u201d the Court noted that \u201cthe United States argues that [the defendant\u2019s former partners] have no interest in the property that is the subject of this suit, but only, at best, an interest in the contractual arrangement that existed among the firm partners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While rejecting that argument, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">But this argument elevates form over substance. The interest requirement of amended Rule 24(a)(2) is a practical guide designed to dispose of lawsuits \u201cby involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.\u201d <em>Nuesse v. Camp, </em>128 U.S.App. D.C. 172, 385 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C.Cir.1967). The rule does not require that the petitioner claim an interest in the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>that is the subject of the suit, but only an interest \u201crelating to\u201d that property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Traditionally, an award of counsel fees and/or suit money was considered \u201cto be for the spouse and should be made to the spouse and not to the parties who perform services or to whom the spouse becomes indebted in connection with the litigation.\u201d 27B C.J.S. <em>Divorce </em>\u00a7 542 (2011) (citing cases). A Maryland circuit court, however, has statutory authority to award counsel fees directly to a party\u2019s lawyer. Section 7-107 of the Family Law Article [FL \u00a7 7-107], in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u00a7 7-107. Award of reasonable and necessary expenses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">(a) Definition.\u2014In this section, \u201creasonable and necessary expense\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">(1) suit money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">(2) counsel fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">(3) costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">(b) Award authorized.\u2014At any point in a proceeding under this title, the court may order either party to pay to the other party an amount for the reasonable and necessary expense of prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">(c) Considerations by court.\u2014Before ordering the payment, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">(1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">(2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">(d) Lack of substantial justification and good cause.\u2014Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall award to the other party the reasonable and necessary expense of prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>(e) Reimbursement.-The court may award reimbursement for any reasonable and necessary expense that has previously been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">(f) Counsel fees.\u2014As to any amount awarded for counsel fees, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">(1) order that the amount awarded be paid directly to the lawyer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">(2) enter judgment in favor of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In states with similar statutes, there is a split of authority as to ownership of the fees. Some cases hold that, because an award of attorneys fees is for the \u201cbenefit of the client rather than for the protection of the attorney, ... the attorney has no separate interest in [the fees] even where a statute provides that the court may order the payment of fees directly to the attorney.\u201d 27B C.J.S. <em>Divorce </em>\u00a7 542 (2011). In California, a discharged attorney is entitled \u201cto pursue a request for direct fee payment from the former client\u2019s spouse if the request is expressly or impliedly authorized by the former client.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Erickson &amp; Simpson, </em>141 Cal. App.4th 707, 46 Cal.Rptr.3d 253 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">We agree with the jurisdictions holding that statutes similar to FL \u00a7 7-107 \u201cclearly provide[ ] that an attorney may enforce an order requiring a party to pay a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in his own name.\u201d <em>Knott v. Knott, </em>395 So.2d 1196, 1198 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.3d Dist.1981). In <em>Knott, </em>the Circuit Court for Dade County ordered that the former husband pay the former wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, and the former husband argued for reversal of that order on the ground \u201cthat the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the award following the parties\u2019 reconciliation and voluntary dismissal of the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197. In affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, the Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">The husband contends that the voluntary dismissal filed by the parties upon their reconciliation deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to enter the order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In addition, he argues that [the] attorneys[ ] lacked standing to seek attorneys\u2019 fees or to cross-appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The question of standing has been determined by the enactment of 61.16, Florida Statutes (1979) [which states:]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYk\">The court may from time to time, after considering the financial resources of both parties, order a party to pay a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees, suit money and the costs to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this chapter, including enforcement and modification proceedings. The court may order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in his name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The statute clearly provides that an attorney may enforce an order requiring a party to pay a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in his own name. The authorities cited in appellant\u2019s brief preceded the enactment of section 61.16 in 1971 and are inapplicable. The attorneys have standing to enforce their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The husband\u2019s argument that the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction by the voluntary dismissal fails to persuade us for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Where the parties to a divorce action become reconciled, the cause may be dismissed as to the divorce action and permitted to continue for allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">... The attorneys retain the right to sue in an independent action on a contract with their client.... Indemnification, however, as a practical matter, may be the only way an attorney can obtain his fee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">We know of no principle of law by which a woman, who has a meritorious cause of action for divorce and employs an attorney to institute and prosecute such an action, can, after it has been instituted and carried on for some time, deprive him of his right to compensation for the services so rendered in that action by a reconciliation with her husband, followed by a resumption of cohabitation. It would seem that upon the clearest principles of common honestly, as well as law, that an attorney in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>predicament ought to be compensated for the services rendered, and that the wife should be allowed suit money for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>Hadlock v.

Pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237(a), a lawyer who represents a nonmonied spouse may seek attorneys\u2019 fees from the monied spouse in the divorce action. This appeal raises the question whether attorneys may do so after their clients have discharged them without cause. A divided Appellate Division said no. We disagree and reverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">In <em>O\u2019Shea v. O\u2019Shea </em>(93 N.Y.2d 187, 711 N.E.2d 193, 689 N.Y.S.2d 8 [1999]), we considered whether a trial court had discretion to award fees under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237(a) for legal services rendered before and after the divorce action---- In concluding that courts could award counsel fees for services performed both before and after the divorce action itself, we looked not only to this textual change but also to the policy underlying fee shifting in the divorce context. This is a dramatic departure from the American rule that usually requires litigants to pay their own legal expenses. We explained that giving courts the power to order a spouse to pay the other\u2019s counsel fees \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>designed to redress the economic disparity between the monied spouse and the non-monied spouse\u201d and ensure that \u201cthe matrimonial scales of justice are not unbalanced by the weight of the wealthier litigant\u2019s wallet\u201d <em>([Id.) </em>at 190 [689 N.Y.S.2d 8, 711 N.E.2d 193]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">That is true here. If lawyers terminated without cause lose their right to petition the court for a fee award from an adversary spouse, the less affluent spouse would suffer the consequences. The spouse with ready and ample funds would have a wide choice of counsel, and the financial wherewithal to maintain the litigation, while the nonmonied spouse would struggle to find a lawyer who might have to go unpaid. A matrimonial lawyer may be willing to carry a client on its accounts receivable books, but not as to accounts that will prove unreceivable. In this regard, the Legislature designed Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237(a) to eliminate the disparity between the monied and the nonmonied spouse. The husband\u2019s interpretation would thwart the statutory intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">The husband argues that a rule allowing a wife\u2019s discharged attorney to proceed against him would impede settlements. We disagree. Allowing the application would enable a global settlement that takes into account property distribution and other equities that affect the outcome. Otherwise, the case would be \u201csettled,\u201d leaving unadjudicated the amount of the attorney\u2019s rightfully earned fees and shifting the venue to a plenary proceeding\u2014another lawsuit, with the unpleasant prospect of a judgment against the nonmonied spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">781 N.Y.S.2d 59, 814 N.E.2d at 37-39.
