Rich</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>ardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). We consider in this case whether Petitioner, Mark Denisyuk, a noncitizen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who in 2006 pleaded guilty to a deportable offense, is entitled to postconviction relief based on the claim that his defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to notify him of the deportation risks of his guilty plea. The answer to the issue posed is governed to a great extent by <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). In <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court held that it is ineffective assistance to misadvise, or fail altogether to advise, a client that deportation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a likely consequence of the guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1483. The central question to be decided in this case is whether <em>Padilla </em>applies to Petitioner\u2019s collateral challenge to his conviction, and, if so, whether he has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to provide proper advice concerning immigration consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that <em>Padilla </em>applies to postconviction claims arising from guilty pleas obtained after the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (effective April 1, 1997), and, applying <em>Padilla </em>to the plea at issue here, defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise Petitioner of the deportation consequence of his guilty plea was constitutionally deficient. We further hold, based on the record developed at the postconviction hearing and the court\u2019s express finding on the subject, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced Petitioner. He therefore is entitled to the requested relief of vacation of the plea and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On November 2, 2006, in the Circuit Court for Harford County, Petitioner pleaded guilty pursuant to a binding plea agreement to the charge of second degree assault, in return for a sentence of 10 years of incarceration, with all but two years suspended. At that proceeding, the court engaged Petitioner in a colloquy to ensure that the plea was knowing and voluntary. The State then recited the factual basis for the plea and the court accepted the plea. At a subsequent hearing on December 7, 2006, the court imposed the sentence agreed upon, and included three years of supervised probation. The record of the plea hearing reflects that Petitioner was not advised by defense counsel, the court, or the State, of the immigration consequences of the plea. At the time of the conviction, Petitioner was a 31-year-old Latvian citizen who immigrated to the United States at the age of fourteen. As a result of the conviction, Petitioner is facing deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Petitioner did not file an application for leave to appeal the guilty plea conviction. On October 15, 2007, he filed, through counsel, a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, seeking vacation of the conviction and a new trial. Petitioner asserted two grounds in support of the petition: (1) the plea was rendered involuntary by the omission of advice concerning the potential immigration consequences of the plea; and (2) the failure of defense counsel to advise him of those potential consequences of his conviction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Petitioner was unable to be present at the hearing on the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He therefore submitted an affidavit to the postconviction court in which he swore that he would have rejected the plea offer and gone to trial had he been made aware of the immigration consequences of the plea. Petitioner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>In light of the fact that neither my counsel, nor the prosecutor, nor the judge advised me that I could be deported, I had no idea that the guilty plea would not only result in my being incarcerated, but that a direct consequence of that guilty plea would result in the filing of deportation proceedings against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">Had I been aware of the aformentioned immigration consequences I now face, including an order or [sic] deportation, I never would have proceeded in the manner I did, rather, I would have exercised my right to a court or jury trial and any other right or defense which would have prevented the entry of a conviction for a deportable offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The postconviction court granted Petitioner relief in the form of a new trial, based on Petitioner\u2019s ineffective-counsel claim. The court, aware of the standard for identifying ineffective assistance of counsel in the guilty-plea context, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), found that defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise Petitioner of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea fell below the range of conduct expected of reasonable defense counsel, and Petitioner was prejudiced thereby. With regard to the latter, the court relied on Petitioner\u2019s uncontroverted affidavit testimony that \u201cbut for trial counsel\u2019s conduct he would not have pled guilty and would have proceeded to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The State filed an application for leave to appeal the grant of postconviction relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals granted the petition on February 9, 2009, set the case on its regular appeal docket, and, in a reported decision, <em>State v. Denisyuk, </em>191 Md.App. 408, 461, 991 A.2d 1275, 1306 (2010), reversed the grant of postconviction relief. Citing caselaw from Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and elsewhere, the intermediate appellate court reasoned that the \u201cline that has historically been drawn between advice as to the consequences of a guilty plea that is constitutionally required and advice as to other consequences that is not constitutionally required, no matter how valuable such advice might be, is the line that separates direct consequences from collateral consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 991 A.2d at 1292. The Court followed decisions of federal courts of appeal in concluding that deportation is a collateral consequence of a criminal conviction and therefore does not fall within the scope of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 451-61, 991 A.2d at 1300-05. The Court of Special Appeals held: \u201cThe Sixth Amendment does not impose on a lawyer a duty to inform a client contemplating a guilty plea about collateral consequences generally or the risk of deportation specifically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 991 A.2d at 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The decision of the Court of Special Appeals pre-dates by two days the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla. </em>The <em>Padilla </em>Court rejected as \u201cill-suited\u201d the distinction between consequences of a guilty plea that are \u201cdirect\u201d and those that are \u201ccollateral\u201d insofar as immigration consequences are concerned, and the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel requires defense counsel to notify his or her client of the deportation consequences of the guilty plea. 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We granted a writ of certiorari to address the following questions presented by Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">1. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>[559] U.S. -, [130 S.Ct. 1473] (filed March 31, 2010) [ (2010) ], did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that defense counsel can never be ineffective for failing to advise his or her client of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">2. Is Petitioner, a Latvian immigrant, entitled to postconviction relief as a result of his attorney\u2019s failure to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is only realized, though, if defense counsel provides <em>\u201ceffective </em>assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>McMann, </em>397 U.S. at 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court set forth a two-pronged test to determine whether a criminal defendant is entitled to relief as a result of constitutionally deficient representation. \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient____ Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Court explained: \u201cPrevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). To satisfy the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u201c[T]he two-part <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 58, 106 S.Ct. 366. In the guilty plea context, the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>is established if there \u201cis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [Petitioner] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59,106 S.Ct. 366; <em>accord Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 733, 744, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011) (explaining that the prejudice inquiry \u201cis whether [the defendant] established the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel\u2019s deficiency\u201d); <em>Yoswick v. State, </em>347 Md. 228, 245, 700 A.2d 251, 259 (1997) (explaining that, under <em>Hill, </em>the defendant who has pleaded guilty and claims ineffectiveness of counsel in connection with the plea \u201cmust show that but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\u201d). If a defendant satisfies both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test, then \u201cthe Constitution requires that a criminal judgment be overturned because of the actual ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Whether Petitioner is entitled to relief by application of the <em>Strickland </em>test to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ultimately depends, in part at least, on whether he is entitled to the benefit of the <em>Padilla </em>decision. The State, though recognizing the import of <em>Padilla </em>on current and future cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argues that Petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of its holding. The State reasons that the <em>Padilla </em>Court announced a new rule of criminal procedure concerning claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, rendering it inapplicable to cases, like Petitioner\u2019s, that are on collateral review of a final judgment. Petitioner counters that he is entitled to have the holding of <em>Padilla </em>apply to his conviction, thereby dictating the conclusion that his defense counsel, in failing to apprise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea, was constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">To resolve the debate and determine ultimately whether the postconviction court was legally correct in deciding that Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tioner satisfied the performance prong of <em>Strickland, </em>we must examine <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Padilla, </em>which, as we have noted, was decided two days after the Court of Special Appeals issued its opinion in this case, goes to the core of Petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Padilla\u2019s conviction of transporting a large amount of marijuana was based on a guilty plea. 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1477. As a result of that conviction, Padilla faced automatic deportation under federal immigration law. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006). He sought post-conviction relief on the ground that his trial counsel affirmatively misadvised him that \u201che did not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\u201d 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478 (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court of Kentucky assumed the truth of the allegations and denied relief, holding that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant from erroneous advice about deportation because it is merely a \u2018collateral\u2019 consequence of his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">The Supreme Court issued a writ of certiorari \u201cto decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\u2019s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478. The Court answered \u201cyes\u201d to that question, stating: \u201cWe agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">The Court began its analysis with the recognition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anf6\">[t]he landscape of federal immigration law has changed dramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>tion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation. The drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Court traced the evolution of this country\u2019s immigration law from its earliest iteration in the 17th century through the 1996 amendments to the immigration statutes, <em>see generally </em>The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (effective April 1, 1997) (amending various sections of 8 and 18 U.S.C.) (hereafter \u201cIIRAIRA\u201d). 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1478-80. The <em>Padilla </em>Court found that, unlike in earlier times, when the law had a more limited class of deportable offenses and greater authority for the exercise of discretion by courts not to order deportation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">[ujnder contemporary law, if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments, his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">These changes to our immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal conviction. The importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important. These changes confirm our view that, as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part\u2014indeed, sometimes the most important part\u2014of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1480 (footnotes omitted). In that same vein, the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>We have long recognized that deportation is a particularly severe \u201cpenalty\u201d but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil in nature, deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal convictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a century. And, importantly, recent changes in our immigration law have made removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders. Thus, we find it \u201cmost difficult\u201d to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context. Moreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defendants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense find it even more difficult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1481 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">For these reasons, the <em>Padilla </em>Court rejected the argument that criminal defense attorneys need not warn their clients about deportation risks because deportation is a \u201c \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 \u201d of a criminal conviction and is therefore \u201coutside the scope of representation required by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1481 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court pointed out that it has \u201cnever applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u2018reasonable professional assistance\u2019 required under <em>Strickland.\u201d Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1481 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052). And though the Court declined to address whether a distinction between collateral and direct consequences ever is appropriate in a <em>Strickland </em>analysis, the Court made clear that such a distinction is \u201cill-suited\u201d to determining a claim relating to possible deportation consequences. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. The Court explained: \u201cDeportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is, because of its close connection to the criminal process, uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. The Court therefore concluded \u201cthat advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Strickland </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Turning then, to <em>Strickland, </em>the Court observed that \u201c[t]he first prong\u2014constitutional deficiency\u2014is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: \u2018The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1482 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Such professional norms, the <em>Padilla </em>Court recognized, \u201cas reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like[,] ... are guides to determining what is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052; other citations omitted). The Court observed: \u201cThe weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. (citations omitted). The Court noted, in particular: \u201c[A]uthorities of every stripe\u2014including the American Bar Association, criminal defense and public defender organizations, authoritative treatises, and state and city bar publications\u2014universally require defense attorneys to advise as to the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen clients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482 (quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>and citation omitted). The Court also noted its own previous statements on the subject. <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1483 (\u201cWe too have previously recognized that \u2018[preserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 322, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted))); <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482 (\u201c \u2018[Preserving the possibility of discretionary relief from deportation ... \u2018would have been one of the principle benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 323, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (citations omitted))); <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1482 (\u201cWe expected that counsel who were unaware of the discretionary relief measures would \u2018follo[w] the advice of numerous practice guides\u2019 to advise themselves of the importance of this particular form of discretionary relief.\u201d (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 323 n. 50, 121 S.Ct. 2271)).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">From all of the above, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1483. The Court recognized, though, that \u201c[immigration law can be complex\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr\">[tjhere will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner in such cases is more limited. When the law is not succinct and straightforward ... a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1483 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Court rejected the argument of the United States Solicitor General (who argued as amicus in support of Respondent, the State of Kentucky), that Padilla\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient only to the extent that he gave <em>misadvice </em>about the immigration consequences of a plea. The Court found \u201cno relevant difference \u2018between an act of commission and an act of omission\u2019 in this context[,]\u201d because \u201c[sjilence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \u2018the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1484 (citations omitted). The Court added that limiting the focus of an ineffectiveness claim to misadvice would give defense counsel incentive to remain silent while also \u201cdenying] a class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1484.

The court elaborated: \u201c[A] court\u2019s disposition of each individual factual scenario arising under the long-established <em>Strickland </em>standard is not in each instance a \u2018new rule,\u2019 but rather a new application of an \u2018old rule\u2019 in a manner dictated by precedent. <em>Padilla </em>is no different.\u201d <em>Id.

One other court has noted that <em>Padilla </em>was reasoned like \u201cmost\u201d <em>Strickland </em>cases, stating: \u201c[T]he Supreme Court merely cited to professional standards and expectations and identified competent counsel\u2019s duty in accordance thereof.\u201d <em>Tanklevskaya, </em>\u2014 S.W.3d at-, 2011 WL 2132722, at *6 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>We agree with our sister courts in the Third Circuit, Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas that <em>Strickland </em>set forth a general standard for application to a specific set of facts; that decisions applying the <em>Strickland </em>standard do not establish a rule of prospective application only; and that <em>Padilla </em>is an application of <em>Strickland, </em>to a specific set of facts. <em>Padilla, </em>decided on March 31, 2010, instructs that, \u201c[f]or at least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea.\u201d 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1485. That 15-year span approximately matches the time period following the 1996 amendments to federal immigration law that made deportation \u201cpractically inevitable\u201d for noncitizens convicted of removable offenses. <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1480 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b). The <em>Padilla </em>Court explained that those changes to immigration law \u201cdramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal convictionL,]\u201d and, as a result, \u201c[t'Jhe importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1480. Likewise, all but one of the sources cited by the Court in determining the \u201cweight of prevailing professional norms\u201d were published in 1995 or later, i.e., within the 15 years preceding the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">We therefore need look no further than <em>Padilla </em>itself to ascertain what has been expected of defense counsel under the Sixth Amendment, in connection with advice concerning the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, at least since the 1996 amendments to federal immigration law. Stated differently, the holding of <em>Padilla </em>did not \u201coverrule! ] prior law and declare! ] a new principle of law.\u201d <em>Daughtry, </em>419 Md. at 78, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>18 A.3d at 86 (internal citations omitted). Rather, <em>Padilla </em>applied \u201csettled precedent [i.e., <em>Strickland </em>] to [a] new and different factual situation[ ],\u201d and, therefore, that decision \u201capplies retroactively.\u201d <em>Potts, </em>300 Md. at 577, 479 A.2d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Consequently, under Maryland retroactivity jurisprudence, <em>Padilla </em>is retroactively applicable to convictions, like Petitioner\u2019s, that are based on guilty pleas that came after the effective date of the 1996 changes to the immigration laws. Because, under <em>Padilla, </em>Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was obligated, but failed, to provide advice on the deportation consequences of Petitioner\u2019s plea, we hold that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Much of what we have said disposes of the remainder of the State\u2019s arguments for why <em>Padilla </em>does not apply to Petitioner\u2019s case. The State argues that <em>Padilla </em>does not apply because Padilla received misadvice and Petitioner received no advice. True, Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not advise him of the possible immigration consequences of the guilty plea. But, as we have detailed, the <em>Padilla </em>Court adamantly rejected the Solicitor General\u2019s attempt to draw the distinction, for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, between no advice and incorrect advice concerning immigration consequences. <em>See Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The State also argues that we should affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reversal of the postconviction court\u2019s finding of deficient performance, because the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis \u201cis in accord with the controlling authority at the time of [Petitioner\u2019s] plea.\u201d The State points out in its brief that the Court of Special Appeals, in applying the <em>Strickland </em>analysis,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">thoroughly addressed the long-recognized distinctions between collateral and direct consequences of criminal convictions ... [and] concluded, based on \u201cthe dispositive distinction made by the caselaw,\u201d that potential deportation is a collateral consequence which, unlike a direct consequence, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>not a matter as to which a defendant must be advised before pleading guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The State, relying on language from <em>Strickland </em>concerning the performance prong of the analysis, notes that \u201ca reviewing court \u2018must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, <em>viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct </em>[,]\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052) (emphasis added by the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">This argument, like the others the State advances, fails under the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Padilla. </em>The <em>Padilla </em>Court applied the same <em>Strickland </em>analysis to a set of facts materially identical to Petitioner\u2019s. The <em>Padilla </em>Court recognized that many courts, prior to <em>Padilla, </em>drew a distinction between direct and collateral consequences of a guilty plea and, treating deportation consequences as \u201ccollateral,\u201d held that counsel\u2019s failure to inform the client about such consequences was beyond the scope of what is required under the Sixth Amendment. Yet, notwithstanding prior caselaw, the <em>Padilla </em>Court had no apparent difficulty concluding that \u201c[t]he collateral versus direct distinction is ... ill-suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland </em>claim concerning the specific risk of deportation[,]\u201d and therefore, \u201cadvice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Strickland </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim.\u201d 559 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1482. In essence, the <em>Padilla </em>Court\u2019s decision is a recognition and correction of an error on the part of many courts that for many years had prevented them from applying the <em>Strickland </em>analysis to factual situations like those presented in <em>Padilla\u2019s, </em>and Petitioner\u2019s, cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Furthermore, Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, like <em>Padilla\u2019s, </em>postdated the enactment of the IIRAIRA when, as the <em>Padilla </em>Court made plain, the prevailing professional norms dictated that defense counsel advise their clients of the immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>consequences of the plea. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1485. Petitioner\u2019s counsel was charged, just as was counsel for Padilla, with adherence to the same then-prevailing professional norms of which the <em>Padilla </em>Court spoke.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVi\">For all these reasons, we reject the State\u2019s contentions and hold that <em>Padilla </em>governs Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We have determined so far that, by application of <em>Padilla, </em>Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because it fell below the standard of prevailing professional norms. That, however, resolves only the first of the two prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. It remains for us to determine whether Petitioner has established that he was prejudiced, in the <em>Strickland </em>sense, as the result of defense counsel\u2019s deficient performance. We turn now to that inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">To show prejudice, <em>Strickland </em>requires that a defendant demonstrate \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Supreme Court instructed in <em>Hill </em>that, \u201cin order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d 474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. <em>See also Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1485 (instructing that, \u201cto obtain relief on [an ineffective assistance of counsel] claim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances\u201d). This Court has interpreted the \u201creasonable probability\u201d language of <em>Strickland </em>to mean a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that the result of the trial would have been different. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>326 Md. 367, 375-76, 605 A.2d 103, 107 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In <em>Hill, </em>the defendant entered a guilty plea and later sought federal habeas relief on the ground that his defense counsel provided erroneous information about his eligibility for parole under the sentence agreed upon as part of the plea. The Supreme Court found no prejudice for purposes of <em>Strickland, </em>because the defendant \u201cdid not allege in his habeas petition that, had counsel correctly informed him about his parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>eligibility date, he would have pleaded not guilty and insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 60, 106 S.Ct. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Unlike in <em>Hill, </em>Petitioner expressly alleged that he would not have entered the guilty plea had he been advised of the deportation risk of doing so. In his affidavit to the postconviction court, Petitioner -wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Had I been aware of the ... immigration consequences I now face, including an order or [sic] deportation, I never would have proceeded in the manner I did, rather, I would have exercised my right to a court or jury trial and any other right or defense which would have prevented the entry of a conviction for a deportable offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The State did not challenge the affidavit, nor did it argue that the affidavit was insufficient, even if credited fully, to establish the prejudice required by <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We are bound to credit a postconvietion court\u2019s first-level findings, including findings concerning the sworn testimony of a defendant concerning whether he or she would have entered into a plea if defense counsel had performed competently in connection with the plea. <em>Yoswick, </em>347 Md. 228, 700 A.2d 251, provides an example. In that case, Yoswick, after pleading guilty to attempted first degree murder and kidnaping, sought postconviction relief by asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel erroneously advised him regarding the requirements for parole. At a postconviction hearing, the defendant testified that, had he been correctly advised regarding parole, he would not have entered the guilty plea. The postconviction court did not find the defendant credible: \u201cSimply stated, the Court does not believe Petitioner\u2019s self-serving statement that he would not have pled guilty had he known the actual date for parole eligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 700 A.2d at 255. This Court affirmed the postconviction court, holding that the defendant had failed to satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice requirement. Deferring to the trial court\u2019s finding, the <em>Yoswick </em>Court stated: \u201c[T]he trial court simply did not believe him and we cannot say that credibility determination was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 700 A.2d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In the case at bar, the postconviction court expressly credited Petitioner\u2019s uncontroverted, sworn averment that, had defense counsel advised him of the plea consequence of deportation, he would not have entered into the plea. We must accept that fact, as not clearly erroneous. Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals viewed the postconviction court\u2019s finding much the same way. <em>See Denisyuk, </em>191 Md.App. at 425-26, 991 A.2d at 1285 (\u201c[W]e would probably have been highly skeptical about [the Petitioner\u2019s] <em>pro forma </em>representation, even if uncontroverted, were the matter before us. That is not, however, our prerogative. We were not fact finders, and we have no choice but to accept the facts as properly found by the fact-finding judge.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The State, seemingly ignoring that the postconviction court expressly credited Petitioner\u2019s averment, argues that \u201c[t]he multiple charges that [Petitioner] was facing, the overwhelming evidence against him, and the leniency afforded [Petitioner] as a result of his negotiated plea arrangement refute his contention ... that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s representation.\u201d By citing the \u201cmultiple charges\u201d facing Petitioner and \u201cleniency\u201d offered him, the State appears to assume that Petitioner must have considered conviction of fewer charges and a relatively short period of incarceration to be his top priorities when he entered the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The State\u2019s assumption does not hold up in the face of what the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Padilla, </em>and we endorse here: \u201c[Preserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\u201d 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1483 (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 322, 121 S.Ct. 2271). Petitioner swore that, had he been given the choice, he would have gone to trial. The postconviction court obviously took Petitioner at his word. From that we must conclude that, had Petitioner been advised of the deportation risks of his plea, he would have run the risk of significant jail time, rather than the near certainty of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Our conclusion in this regard is far from fanciful. We are not alone in understanding that many noncitizens might reasonably choose the possibility of avoiding deportation combined with the risk of a greater sentence over assured deportation combined with a lesser sentence. <em>See Orocio, </em>645 F.3d at 645 (\u201cFor the alien defendant most concerned with remaining in the United States, especially a legal permanent resident, it is not at all unreasonable to go to trial and risk a ten-year sentence and guaranteed removal, but with the chance of acquittal and the right to remain in the United States, instead of pleading guilty to an offense that, while not an aggravated felony, carries \u2018presumptively mandatory\u2019 removal consequences.\u201d); <em>see also Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1480 (\u201cdeportation is an integral part\u2014indeed, sometimes the most important part\u2014of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Insofar as the State refers to the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d against Petitioner to suggest that a conviction was inevitable and therefore no prejudice existed, the State misunderstands the focus of the prejudice inquiry in cases involving plea agreements. The appropriate determination is not whether Petitioner ultimately would have been convicted following a trial, but rather whether there \u201cis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [Petitioner] <em>would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366 (emphasis added); <em>see also Premo, </em>562 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 744 (explaining that the prejudice inquiry \u201cis whether [the defendant] established the reasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel\u2019s deficiency ... \u201d); <em>see also Orocio, </em>645 F.3d at 645 (noting that the threat of removal provides a \u201cpowerful incentive to go to trial if the plea would result in removal anyway\u201d and, given his relatively young age at the time of the plea agreement, Orocio \u201crationally could have been more concerned about a near-certainty of multiple decades of banishment from the United States than the possibility of a single decade in prison\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">For all of the reasons we have discussed, Petitioner\u2019s sworn statement that he would have opted to go to trial if he had known of the likelihood of deportation, which was credited by the court, established a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that, had he received the advice required by <em>Padilla, </em>he would have opted to go to trial. <em>Cf. Williams, </em>326 Md. at 382, 605 A.2d at 110 (1992) (concluding that the petitioner\u2019s after-the-fact-statement \u201cthat had he been told [by defense counsel] of the possible mandatory sentence, he would have accepted the plea\u201d was enough to allow the inference that the petitioner \u201c \u2018may well\u2019 have opted to accept the plea agreement, [thereby creating] at least a \u2018substantial possibility\u2019 that the outcome would have been different\u201d).

Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), to the instant case; I disagree with the majority\u2019s mandate vacating the guilty plea and ordering a new trial merely on a recitation by Denisyuk that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN4\">[h]ad I been aware of the aforementioned immigration consequences I now face, including an order or deportation, I never would have proceeded in the manner I did, rather, I would have exercised my right to a court or jury trial and any other right or defense which would have prevented the entry of a conviction for a deportable offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In essence, the result of the majority\u2019s decision is that a self-serving declaration suffices to vacate a guilty plea. I would prefer that the trial court be instructed with this opinion, when faced with post-conviction allegations pursuant to <em>Padilla, </em>as here, to conduct an evidentiary hearing, beyond the admission of an affidavit, to determine whether an alien\u2019s decision to reject a plea offer and proceed to trial \u201cwould have been rational under the circumstances.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1485,176 L.Ed.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Other courts addressing <em>post-Padilla </em>claims have rejected similar self-serving affidavits as sufficient <em>per se </em>to establish prejudice. <em>See United States v.

The presence of other criminal offenses may have affected Denisyuk\u2019s alien status with respect to deportation. <em>See People v. Bevans, </em>30 Misc.3d 1238(A), 926 N.Y.S.2d 345, 2011 N.Y.

LEXIS 36739, at *39-40 (S.D.Tex.2011) (explaining that, because Zapata-Banda had \u201cnever been a lawful permanent resident of the United States,\u201d the \u201cimmigration consequence of Zapata\u2019s guilty plea is not that he lost the right to be in the United States, but instead, that he lost the right to apply to be in the United States\u201d). There is nothing in the record to reflect Denisyuk\u2019s status apart from his affidavit, which states only that he \u201cwas not a United States citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Other relevant factors may include the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>See Santos-Sanchez v.

Conversely, the trial court may consider the presence of a viable defense as indicative of prejudice. <em>See ZapataBanda, </em>2011 WL 1113586, at *10-11, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36739, at *35-37 (after Zapata-Banda failed to articulate a believable defense, the court remained \u201ccompletely unconvinced\u201d that his trial strategy \u201cwould have had any impact on his proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Whether the benefit obtained from the guilty plea was substantial also has been a frequent consideration among trial courts. <em>See Zapata-Banda, </em>2011 WL 1113586, at *11, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36739, at *39-40 (concluding, in part, that because Zapata-Banda did not lose his right to be in the United States because of the guilty plea at issue, he was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of deportation consequences). Curative judicial admonishments also may be relevant considerations, although admittedly, in the present case, none occurred. <em>See Khanali v. United States, </em>2011 WL 1626553, at *4, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45751, at *14 (S.D.Ga. 2011) (finding no prejudice where trial judge explicitly advised Khanali at plea hearing that \u201cthe maximum penalty could include deportation\u201d); <em>see also Ellington v.

Any other objective indicia that rejecting the plea and proceeding to trial would have been rational also may be the subject of an evidentiary hearing, such as the length of time Denisyuk has lived in the United States, whether Denisyuk has family in the United States, the connections Denisyuk has to his home country, and evidence that Denisyuk knew, or did not know, of the deportation consequences of a conviction. <em>See United States v.

Maryland has not adopted <em>Teague, </em>nor must it. <em>See Danforth v.

Indeed, we cite and discuss these cases because we find persuasive, and subscribe to, the analysis these courts gave to the <em>Padilla </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. We have explained why counsel's failure to advise Petitioner of the immigration consequences of the plea was deficient performance, under <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Padilla. </em>We also note (though we do not ground our decision on this point) that Petitioner\u2019s counsel should also have known, when advising Petitioner about the plea, of the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-242. At the time of Petitioner's plea, Rule 4\u2014242 provided in pertinent part that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[bjefore the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court, the State's Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof shall advise the defendant (1) that by entering the plea, if the defendant is not a United States citizen, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship and (2) that the defendant should consult with defense counsel if the defendant is represented and needs additional information concerning the potential consequences of the plea. The omission of advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea does not itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Md. Rule 4-242(e) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">By its plain language, Rule 4-242(e) mandates that defense counsel, among others (the court and State's Attorney), ensure an on-the-record advisement of the immigration consequences of the plea. The Rule mandates the advice, and it charges defense counsel with the obligation, if not to advise the client himself directly on the record, then, at a minimum, to ensure that the advice is given, on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Furthermore, as Petitioner points out, the minutes of the April 24, 1998, meeting of the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure reflect the intention of the drafters of Rule 4-242(e) to permit collateral challenges, based on ineffective assistance of counsel, to a plea that did not include on-the-record advice concerning immigration consequences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">The Vice Chair expressed her disagreement with the fact that if a judge fails to advise the defendant about the consequences of a guilty plea, no remedy exists, even if that defendant suffers dire consequences. Some other states provide that if the advice is not given, the plea can be invalidated. The Chair pointed out that there are two aspects to this. One is that the defendant can get postconviction relief based on inadequate advice of counsel. The Rule says that the guilty plea cannot be attacked, but does not preclude postconviction relief. U.S. citizens may not ask for their pleas to be set aside because the judge did not give the advice about immigration consequences. If a particular defendant is unfairly prejudiced, that defendant\u2019s right to competent defense counsel should cover this situation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. The fact that the postconviction court made the express finding that Petitioner was prejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance provides one of two reasons why we decline the State's request that, if we hold that defense counsel\u2019s performance satisfies the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>(as we have done), then we should direct a remand to the postconviction court for further proceedings at which the State is given an opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning whether Petitioner was prejudiced. The additional reason why we decline to remand this case is that the State had the opportunity to present its own evidence that might have shed light on the credibility of Petitioner\u2019s sworn statement; the State did not opt to do so. The State could have argued the weight to be given to Petitioner\u2019s sworn statement; the State did not do that either. The State left the postconviction court with the decision whether to credit Petitioner\u2019s sworn statement, on its face, and the court exercised its right to do so. The State is not entitled to the proverbial \"second bite of the apple.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b519-7\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">I respectfully dissent because I believe the better position under Maryland law, under federal law, and in light of prudential considerations is that <em>Padilla v.

In my view, <em>Padilla </em>should not apply to Petitioner, and he should not receive a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">It is clear that <em>Padilla </em>created a new rule under the federal standard for retroactivity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the federal standard, holding that a rule is \u201cnew,\u201d and thus not applicable retroactively, if \u201cthe result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>conviction became final.\u201d 489 U.S. 288, 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). In <em>Beard v. Banks, </em>the Court refined the <em>Teague </em>standard, holding that a rule is new whenever \u201creasonable jurists could differ as to whether precedent compels [it].\u201d 542 U.S. 406, 416 n. 5, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 2513, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2000). Thus, the Tenth Circuit recently held that <em>Padilla </em>created a new rule because \u201ca reasonable jurist ... would not have considered Supreme Court precedent to compel [its result].\u201d <em>U.S. v. Chang Hong, </em>\u2014 F.3d \u2014, \u2014, 2011 WL 3805763, at *5-7 (10th Cir.2011). The Seventh Circuit reached the same result, holding that <em>Padilla </em>created a new rule because one could not say that prior cases holding differently had been \u201cunreasonable in their reading of existing Supreme Court precedent.\u201d <em>Chaidez v. U.S., </em>655 F.3d 684, 691-92 (7th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because <em>Padilla </em>created a new rule under the federal standard, the majority must rely on Maryland\u2019s unique standard for retroactivity, set forth in <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 77-81, 18 A.3d 60, 85-87 (2011), to hold that <em>Padilla </em>did not create a new rule, and thus is applicable retroactively to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The better position, however, is that <em>Padilla </em>creates a new rule under Maryland\u2019s standard as well as the federal standard, because the rule it overturned was more reasonable and more widely followed than the rule overturned in <em>Daughtry. </em>In other words, <em>Daughtry </em>is distinguishable because <em>Padilla </em>overturned stronger and better-established precedents. Unlike the rule overturned in <em>Daughtry, </em>which was followed in \u201csome trial courts\u201d and \u201cseemingly ... [mis]construed a prior case,\u201d 419 Md. at 80, 18 A.3d at 79, the rule overturned in <em>Padilla </em>was followed in \u201cevery Federal Court of Appeals,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>provided a reasonable solution to a \u201cuniquely difficult\u201d question. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 180 S.Ct. 1473, 1482, 1491-92, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\"><em>Daughtry </em>affirmed a judgment from the Court of Special Appeals holding that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary because \u201cthere was no other evidence (aside from the fact of representation) tending to show that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered.\u201d 419 Md. at 80,18 A.3d at 87. On appeal before this Court, the State argued that the holding below, if affirmed, would create a new rule because it was \u201ca significant departure from ... <em>Priet,\u201d </em>a case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sometimes cited as having created a presumption that guilty pleas are knowing and voluntary as long as the defendant is represented by counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79, 18 A,3d at 86. We disagreed.

(Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 80-81, 18 A.3d at 87. Thus, the rule overturned in <em>Daughtry </em>was not widely accepted and was a mistaken interpretation of applicable precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On the other hand, the rule overturned in <em>Padilla </em>was widely accepted and well reasoned. <em>Padilla </em>held that a criminal defense lawyer, to provide effective assistance under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cmust inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1486. This holding overturned the rule, widely followed in the lower courts, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>guilty plea is not invalid under <em>Strickland </em>solely because the defense attorney failed to inform the defendant of the risk of deportation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1491 (Alito, J., concurring). As the Seventh Circuit explained in <em>Chaidez, </em>prior to <em>Padilla </em>\u201cvirtually all jurisdictions ... had held that defense lawyers ... need not explain collateral consequences, such as ... deportation.\u201d 655 F.3d at 690 (citation omitted). Thus, Justice Alito\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Padilla </em>characterized the majority\u2019s holding as a \u201cdramatic departure from precedent\u201d and a \u201cmajor upheaval in Sixth Amendment law,\u201d observing that \u201cthe Court\u2019s view has been rejected by every Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the issue thus far.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1488, 1491. Because <em>Padilla </em>overturned such a strong and widely followed precedent, the best position is that it created a new rule. <em>Daughtry, </em>therefore, is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Two additional considerations counsel against the retroactive application of <em>Padilla. </em>First, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Butler v. McKellar, </em>\u201c[T]he \u2018new rule\u2019 principle therefore validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions.\u201d 494 U.S. 407, 414, 110 S.Ct. 1212, 1217, 108 L.Ed.2d 347 (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I find this consideration persuasive. To avoid implying that practically all judges and practitioners have been unreasonable in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>interpretation of <em>Strickland, </em>courts should recognize that <em>Padilla </em>created a new rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Second, one of the reasons <em>Teague </em>created the dichotomy between new rules and old rules is that states are unduly burdened when new constitutional rules are applied retroactively. As the Court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">In many ways the [retroactive] application of new rules ... may be more intrusive than the enjoining of criminal prosecutions, for it continually forces the States to marshal resources in order to keep in prison defendants whose trials and appeals conformed to then-existing constitutional standards. Furthermore ... [sjtate courts are understandably frustrated when they faithfully apply existing constitutional law only to have a federal court discover ... new constitutional commands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">(Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\"><em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 310,109 S.Ct. at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I find this consideration persuasive as well. Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea complied with then-existing constitutional standards under <em>Strickland. </em>As Justice Alito noted in <em>Padilla, </em>\u201cevery Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the issue\u201d agreed that deportation was a collateral consequence, and that failing to advise a defendant of it did not invalidate a guilty plea. 130 S.Ct. at 1488, 1491. Thus, granting Petitioner a new trial when his plea conformed with a well-established and reasonable constitutional rule imposes an undue burden on the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">. As the majority correctly observes, we are not bound by the federal standard, but it is persuasive. Maj.

The only federal circuit court to apply <em>Padilla </em>retroactively failed to address the Supreme Court\u2019s later interpretations of the <em>Teague </em>standard. <em>See U.S. v. Orocio, </em>645 F.3d 630 (3rd Cir.2011). Indeed, the only Supreme Court case cited in <em>Orocio </em>with respect to the <em>Teague </em>standard is <em>Wright v.

Although Md. Rule 4-242(e) required defense attorneys to advise their clients of \"collateral consequences\u201d of a guilty plea, including deportation, it explicitly provided that \"the omission of advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea does not itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.\u201d Maryland Rule 4\u2014242(e).
