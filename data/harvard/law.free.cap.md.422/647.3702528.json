The question arises from a medical malpractice suit that Katherine Lewis filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d) against her former psychiatrist, Dr. Jeremy P. Waletzky, for injuries she allegedly sustained as a result of medications he prescribed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Medical malpractice cases in Maryland are governed by the Health Care Malpractice Claims statute (herein \u201cthe Act\u201d), CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 through 3-2A-10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As will be explained in more detail <em>infra, </em>Lewis did not comply with various administrative filing requirements set forth in the Act before filing her complaint in the District Court. Under Maryland law, those administrative filing requirements are a condition precedent to initiating suit in Maryland state courts and federal courts located in Maryland. <em>Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 181, 929 A.2d 19, 28 (2007). Failure to meet these requirements, when applicable, results in dismissal of the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u25a0without prejudice. <em>Kearney v. Berger, </em>416 Md. 628, 668-69, 7 A.3d 593, 616-17 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Before the District Court, Waletzky filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Lewis was required to have complied with the Act\u2019s filing requirements. Lewis responded that she was not subject to the Act because the injury occurred in Washington, D.C. (hereinafter \u201cD.C.\u201d) and therefore D.C. law governed her malpractice suit. Resolution of that matter implicates choice-of-law principles, to which the District Court, sitting in diversity jurisdiction, was required to apply Maryland\u2019s choice-of-law principles. <em>See, e.g., Day &amp; Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, </em>423 U.S. 3, 4, 96 S.Ct. 167, 46 L.Ed.2d 3 (1975) (per curiam) (holding that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the choice-of-law rules of the state in which the court is located).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Following argument and briefing, the District Court filed a written opinion granting Waletzky\u2019s motion to dismiss. The District Court considered the filing requirements of the Act to be substantive tort law; the court therefore focused on Maryland\u2019s application of <em>lex loci delicti. </em>That rule directs a court to \u201capply the [substantive tort] law of the place where the tort or wrong was committed.\u201d <em>See Lab. Corp. of Am. v. Hood, </em>395 Md. 608, 613, 911 A.2d 841, 844 (2006). Because the injury occurred in D.C.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court reasoned that, pursuant to <em>lex loci delicti, </em>D.C. law, which at that time had no specific procedural requirements for medical malpractice claims, would govern the present litigation. The District Court determined, however, that the Act\u2019s filing requirements implicated strong public policy sufficient to require Lewis\u2019s compliance with those requirements, thereby invoking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>public policy exception to <em>lex loci delicti. </em>The District Court therefore dismissed the suit without prejudice, pursuant to <em>Kearney. See Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 668-69, 7 A.3d at 616-17 (explaining that failure to comply with the requirements of the Act requires dismissal without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (hereinafter \u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d) determined that the choice-of-law issue involves a question of unresolved Maryland law and, thus, should be decided by this Court. The Court of Appeals certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArB\">Does Maryland recognize the public policy exception, or any other exception, to <em>lex loci delicti </em>based on the Maryland Health Care Malpractice Claims Act ... which requires a plaintiff to comply with certain mandatory administrative filings prior to filing a medical malpractice lawsuit in a Maryland court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">As we have mentioned, this litigation involves a claim of alleged medical malpractice. The Court of Appeals has provided us with the underlying facts of the federal suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">Lewis alleges the following facts in her complaint which, for purposes of this appeal, are not disputed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">Lewis, once a resident of [Washington, D.C.] and currently a resident of Minnesota was formerly a patient of Waletzky. Waletzky, at all times relevant, was a physician licensed to practice in the State of Maryland and had his office in Chevy Chase or Bethesda, Maryland. From approximately October 2000 until January 2005, Waletzky was Lewis\u2019 psychiatrist and treated her at his Chevy Chase office. Waletzky prescribed several psychotropic medications to Lewis, including antidepressants and stimulants, and also prescribed antipsychotic and/or neuroleptic drugs. All of the prescribed medications were filled in pharmacies in [Washington, DC] and ingested by Lewis while she was in [Washington, DC].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">During the treatment period, Waletzky did not diagnose Lewis with any serious mental disorder and never made any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>diagnosis of Lewis\u2019 psychiatric condition. After taking the prescribed antipsychotics, Lewis began experiencing adverse side effects and discontinued her use of these medications. Immediately after experiencing these adverse side effects, Lewis suffered, for the first time in her life, an anxiety attack. She contacted Waletzky who instructed her to continue taking the antipsychotic medications and wrote her additional prescriptions in order for her to \u201ctaper off\u2019 the antipsychotic medications. While she was \u201ctapering off\u2019 the antipsychotic medications, Lewis continued to experience adverse side effects, including extreme jaw tension and clenching, anxiety, and other effects. After completely withdrawing from the antipsychotic drugs, Lewis\u2019 side effects persisted and worsened, and she was eventually diagnosed with a permanent neurological disorder known as Tardive Dyskinesia/Dystonia caused by the antipsychotics she had taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Given the question before us, we need not discuss at length all the various provisions of the Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; instead we focus on the provisions of the Act pertinent to the question we must answer. In effect since 1976, the Act created the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (\u201cHCADRO\u201d) for the purpose of establishing and administering an arbitration process for medical malpractice claims prior to court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The Act includes various procedural provisions that a plaintiff pursuing a medical malpractice action must satisfy before being able to prosecute his or her claim in a court of Maryland. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-2A-02 (\u201cExclusiveness of procedures\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the years following its enactment, the Act has been modified so that today, and at the time of the present case, arbitration may be waived unilaterally by either the plaintiff or the health care provider by filing a written election with the Director of HCADRO indicating the party\u2019s desire to do so. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-2A-06B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Whether or not a plaintiff elects to forego the arbitration process, CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(a)(l)(i) requires the plaintiff, as a condition precedent to proceeding, to file with the Director of the HCADRO his or her medical malpractice claim. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>see also Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 656-57, 7 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>609-10. Within 90 days of filing that claim, the plaintiff must also file with the Director of HCADRO a certificate of a qualified expert. CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That certificate must contain the qualified expert\u2019s attestations to a \u201cdeparture from [the] standards of care, and that the departure ... is the proximate cause of the alleged injury.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that adherence to the [Act\u2019s] procedures is necessary to maintain a claim that is subject to the [Act].\u201d <em>Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 655, 7 A.3d at 608. In that regard, we have not hesitated to dismiss a claim because the plaintiff failed to comply with the Act\u2019s administrative filing requirements. <em>See id. </em>at 657-58, 660-61, 7 A.3d at 610-11 (stating that \u201c[t]he requirement that the claimant or plaintiff file a certificate of qualified expert serves an important purpose, even in cases of unilateral waiver[,]\u201d and dismissing the claim for failure to comply); <em>Carroll, </em>400 Md. at 181, 929 A.2d at 28 (\u201c[I]f a proper [certificate has not been filed, the condition precedent to maintain the action has not been met and dismissal is required by the Statute once the allotted time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>period [for filing the certificate] has elapsed.\u201d); <em>see also Tranen v. Aziz, </em>304 Md. 605, 612, 500 A.2d 636, 639 (1985) (explaining that the \u201cstatutory context of [the Act\u2019s] directives plainly shows that compliance with them is mandatory and that noncompliance mandates dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The District Court, applying the law of Maryland, dismissed Lewis\u2019s claim for failure to comply with the filing requirements of the Act, precipitating her appeal to the Court of Appeals and, in turn, that court\u2019s question to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">A federal court, in a diversity action, must apply the substantive law of the state in which it sits, including that state\u2019s choice-of-law principles. <em>See, e.g., Hood, </em>395 Md. at 611, 911 A.2d at 842-43. For that reason, the Court of Appeals wants to know whether, if Lewis\u2019s suit was filed in a Maryland state court, the filing requirements of the Act would apply. To answer that question, we must look, first, to Maryland law concerning choice of law. In that regard, this Court adheres to the doctrine of <em>lex loci delicti. See Hood, </em>395 Md. at 615, 911 A.2d at 845. Under that approach, when a Maryland state court is confronted with multistate tort litigation, that court must apply the law of the place of injury as to all matters of substantive law. <em>Id., </em>911 A.2d at 845; <em>see also White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 352, 223 A.2d 763, 765 (1966) (\u201cThis Court has consistently followed the rule that when an accident occurs in another state[,] substantive rights of the parties, even though they are domiciled in Maryland, are to be determined by the law of the state in which the alleged tort took place.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Procedural matters, however, are always gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>erned by the law of the forum. <em>Erie Ins. Exch. v. Heffernan, </em>399 Md. 598, 632-33, 925 A.2d 636, 656 (2007) (stating that \u201csubstantive law [is] to be determined by the place of wrong, and the procedural law [is] to be determined by the law of the forum\u201d); <em>Hood, </em>395 Md. at 615, 911 A.2d at 845 (stating same).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The Court of Appeals, in crafting the certified question as it does, recognizes Maryland\u2019s adherence to <em>lex loci delicti. </em>What the certified question does not ask, at least not in so many words, is whether Maryland would apply <em>lex loci delicti </em>in the present case. In their briefs and at oral argument before this Court, the parties focused their attention on whether the public policy exception to <em>lex loci delicti </em>should be invoked. By so arguing, the parties necessarily assumed that the filing requirement is part of Maryland\u2019s substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We, however, do not make the same assumption. Our choice-of-law rules mandate a threshold determination of whether the Act\u2019s filing requirement is substantive law or a procedural matter. <em>Heffernan, </em>399 Md. at 615, 925 A.2d at 646. If substantive, <em>lex loci delicti </em>controls and, absent invocation of the public policy exception, a Maryland court would not enforce the Act\u2019s filing requirements. If, however, the filing requirements are procedural, a Maryland court would require compliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">To resolve the substantive-procedural dichotomy for choice-of-law purposes, we look first to our cases in which we have applied the doctrine of <em>lex loci delicti. </em>Our research has not uncovered a single case in which the doctrine has been applied to a provision of law similar to that at issue in the case before us. The cases we discuss below, however, reveal that the Act\u2019s filing requirements are distinguishable from the various provisions of law that we have treated as involving matters of substantive tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We have applied <em>lex loci delicti </em>on prior occasions to enforce the substantive law of the place of injury. We have done so, for example, to enforce the Guest Statutes of other jurisdictions. In <em>White, </em>the plaintiff brought a tort claim in Maryland to recover for injuries resulting from a car accident that occurred in Michigan. <em>244 </em>Md. at 351, 223 A.2d at 765. Michigan\u2019s Guest Statute at the time limited an automobile passenger\u2019s ability to recover damages from the driver for injuries to situations involving intentional misconduct or gross negligence. <em>Id, </em>223 A.2d at 765. We applied <em>lex loci delicti </em>and held that Michigan\u2019s Guest Statute applied, and, therefore, the question of whether the accident was caused by gross negligence should have been submitted to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 223 A.2d at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">We also have applied the doctrine to cases involving claims for loss of consortium. In <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bruchey, </em>248 Md. 669, 238 A.2d 115 (1968), Mr. and Mrs. Bruchey, both residents of Maryland, were injured in a car accident while traveling together in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 670, 238 A.2d at 115. In subsequent litigation brought in the Circuit Court for Harford County, Mr. Bruchey sought to recover for loss of consortium as a result of his wife\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 670-71, 238 A.2d at 115-16. Virginia law at that time prohibited a husband from recovering for loss of consortium. <em>Id, </em>238 A.2d at 115-16. Following <em>lex loci delicti, </em>we held that Virginia\u2019s law \u201cdefeat[ed] [Mr. Bruchey\u2019s] right to recover for loss of consor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tium[,]\u201d even though under Maryland law such an action would have been permitted. <em>Id. </em>at 676, 238 A.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Other scenarios in which Maryland Courts have applied <em>lex loci delicti </em>analysis include: (1) whether a Maryland court would enforce a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s ban on wrongful birth actions, <em>see Hood, </em>395 Md. 608, 622-24, 911 A.2d at 849-51 (reaffirming this State\u2019s commitment to <em>lex loci delicti </em>and opining that Maryland would invoke the public policy exception to allow a wrongful birth action to proceed in Maryland courts should the law of the state of injury bar such an action); (2) cases involving the elements required to be established in a negligence action, <em>see, e.g., Chambco v. Urban Masonry Corp., </em>338 Md. 417 421-22, 659 A.2d 297, 299 (1995) (reversing and remanding judgment in part because trial court erred in applying Maryland law, when <em>lex loci delicti </em>directed application of D.C. law to determine elements of negligence claim); and (3) cases involving whether to apply Maryland\u2019s then-existing doctrine of interspousal immunity to a suit for which <em>lex loci delicti </em>directed application of foreign law, <em>see, e.g., Linton v. Linton, </em>46 Md.App. 660, 667, 420 A.2d 1249, 1253 (1980) (allowing an interspousal suit sounding in negligence to proceed because it was permitted by the law of Virginia, the place of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We most recently affirmed our commitment to <em>lex loci delicti </em>in <em>Heffernan, </em>399 Md. at 620, 925 A.2d at 649. In that case, Mr. and Mrs. Heffeman purchased two uninsured/under-insured motorist policies from Erie Insurance Exchange. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 925 A.2d at 640-41. Pursuant to those policies, Erie guaranteed to pay to the Heffernans all damages \u201cthat the law entitles you\u201d to recover from an uninsured or underinsured motorist.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 609, 925 A.2d at 641. The Heffernans\u2019 daughter was killed in an automobile accident in Delaware, <em>id. </em>at 605, 925 A.2d at 640, while traveling as a passenger in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>underinsured motor vehicle, <em>id. </em>at 605-06, 925 A.2d at 640-41. During litigation that followed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the court certified to us the following questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">1. In a case involving a claim for benefits pursuant to the uninsured/underinsured provisions of an automobile insurance contract executed in Maryland, where the car accident occurred in Delaware, should Maryland or Delaware law be applied to determine what the claimants would be \u201centitled to recover\u201d because of the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">2. If Delaware law governs the tort issues of this case under <em>lex loci delicti, </em>would Maryland\u2019s public policy exception to that doctrine nonetheless require application of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">a. Maryland\u2019s statutory cap on non-economic damages, ... where the insured and the insurer both reside in Maryland, the covered automobiles are garaged in Maryland, and the contract was executed and administered in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">b. Maryland\u2019s contributory negligence principles?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 604, 925 A.2d at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">With regard to the first question, we determined that the contractual language, \u201cthat the law entitles you,\u201d did not raise a question of contractual interpretation, but, instead, of tort liability and damages. <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 925 A.2d at 648. As such, the question was one involving substantive tort law, for which <em>lex loci delicti </em>applied. <em>Id., </em>925 A.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">We answered both parts of the second question in the negative, holding that the statutory cap on non-economic damages and the principle of contributory negligence were matters of substantive tort law and the respective public policy undergirding each was insufficient to override <em>lex loci delicti. Id. </em>at 635-36, 925 A.2d at 658. With respect to the statutory cap on non-economic damages, we rejected the notion raised by Erie that the provision was part of Maryland\u2019s procedural law. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 925 A.2d at 656. In doing so, we agreed with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination in <em>Black v. Leatherwood Motor Coach Corp., </em>92 Md.App. 27, 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>606 A.2d 295, 300-01 (1992), that the statutory cap is part of the \u201csubstantive law of Maryland and ... therefore, inapplicable to this case, which is governed by the substantive law of Delaware.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>399 Md. at 633, 925 A.2d at 656. We found support for our conclusion in \u00a7 412 of the Restatement (First) of Conflicts of Laws, which provides that \u201c[t]he measure of damages for a tort is determined by the place of the wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 925 A.2d at 656-57 (quoting <em>Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 412 (1934)). We also noted that, in <em>Steger v. Egyud, </em>219 Md. 331, 149 A.2d 762 (1959), we relied on \u00a7 412 for the proposition that substantive tort law encompasses \u201cthe extent of liability and the right to, and measure off,] contribution.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>399 Md. at 633, 925 A.2d at 656-57 (quoting <em>Egyud, </em>219 Md. at 337, 149 A.2d at 765) (internal quotation mark omitted). Accordingly, we held that Delaware law, which did not limit noneconomic damages and followed comparative negligence principles, would govern the <em>Heffeman </em>litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 635-36, 925 A.2d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">With the exception of <em>Heffeman, </em>the cases we have discussed thus far involved provisions of law that were, without question, matters of substantive law, for which <em>lex loci delicti </em>applied. Consequently, we had no reason to scrutinize the substantive-procedural dichotomy. There is, however, one case from the intermediate appellate court that provides guidance on that distinction. That case is <em>Jacobs v. Adams, </em>66 Md.App. 779, 505 A.2d 930 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In <em>Jacobs, </em>the intermediate appellate court had before it three tort cases filed in Maryland circuit courts involving automobile accidents that occurred in D.C. <em>Id. </em>at 783, 505 A.2d at 932. Each case presented the same choice-of-law issue: whether Maryland courts should enforce D.C.\u2019s no-fault insurance statute, which barred all civil suits to recover for personal injury resulting from automobile accidents unless, <em>inter alia, </em>medical expenses exceeded $5,000, and, if applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, would bar them. <em>Id., </em>505 A.2d at 932. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Maryland\u2019s no-fault insurance scheme had no such limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 787, 505 A.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">To answer that question, the Court of Special Appeals had to decide, among other issues, whether the no-fault insurance provision at issue was substantive, to which <em>lex loci delicti </em>would control, or procedural, and thereby governed by Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 790, 505 A.2d at 936. The <em>Jacobs </em>Court had this to say in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">A logical resolution to this problem was suggested by Professors William Richman and William Reynolds, who said, \u201c[fjorum interest and convenience ... should dictate the classification of an issue as \u2018procedural.\u2019 Put differently, if neither the forum\u2019s interest nor judicial convenience is involved, no reason exists to treat the problem as \u2018procedural.\u2019 \u201d W. Richman &amp; W. Reynolds, <em>Understanding Conflict of Laws </em>116 (1984). We agree. <em>There is no reason to classify an issue as procedural, and hence controlled by the law of the forum, unless it affects the manner in which the forum administers justice. </em>If the law of the state wherein an accident occurred does not grant the affected parties the right to bring a suit, then there is no need for the application of any procedural laws. It is only after the rights of parties have been established by the laws of the situs that the forum may determine how those rights shall be exercised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Jacobs, </em>66 Md.App. at 790-91, 505 A.2d at 936 (emphasis added) (internal footnote omitted). Persuaded by Professors Richman and Reynold\u2019s reasoning, the Court of Special Appeals held that D.C.\u2019s no-fault insurance law was substantive. <em>Id. </em>at 791, 505 A.2d at 936. The court found it dispositive that the law \u201cdid not restrict, limit, define, qualify, or otherwise simply modify the cause of action [which would indicate that the provision was one of procedure,] but declared it to be wholly unavailable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>505 A.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">From the cases we have discussed, we can reduce the provisions of law to which we have applied <em>lex loci delicti (i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the provisions of law that we have deemed matters of substantive tort law) to three broad categories. First, we have applied <em>lex loci delicti </em>to provisions of law that recognize or bar a cause of action. Second, we have applied the doctrine to provisions of law which define the elements of a claim. And third, we have applied the doctrine to provisions of law that limit or prescribe the way in which damages are calculated. In each situation, the provision of law is linked inextricably to the nature and existence of the underlying right.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Though our review of Maryland\u2019s choice-of-law rules indicates that this Court has not had the opportunity to provide a lengthy commentary on the matter of procedure for choice-of-law purposes, we have explained that Maryland law controls \u201cthe inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, the inferences from it to go to the jury and other procedural matters.\u201d <em>Vernon v. Aubinoe, </em>259 Md. 159, 162, 269 A.2d 620, 621 (1970). We have also held that statutes of limitations are procedural for choice-of-law purposes. <em>Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 88, 148 A.2d 438, 440 (1959). And, as our Court of Special Appeals has explained, procedural matters are those that merely \u201crestrict, limit, define, qualify, or otherwise simply modify the cause of action,\u201d rather than provisions that declare the existence or abrogation of a cause of action, which are substantive. <em>Jacobs, </em>66 Md.App. at 791, 505 A.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We believe that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis in <em>Jacobs </em>establishes the appropriate analytical framework in distinguishing substantive from procedural provisions of law. We agree that \u201c[i]t is only after the rights of parties have been established by the laws of the situs that the forum may determine how those rights shall be exercised.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>66 Md.App. at 791, 505 A.2d at 936. We are also mindful of the following observation by a leading commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cAnother type of rule often called procedural actually is designed to govern access to the courts, and necessarily governs access only to courts of the state having the rule. A state can control access to its own courts.... A state may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>say, for example, that a plaintiff may not sue for damages on account of personal injuries unless he gives notice to the defendant of the injury within a specified time, and such a rale may preclude suits even on extrastate injuries if the specified notice be not given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Robert A. Leflar, <em>American Conflicts Law </em>\u00a7 122, p. 243-44 (3d ed. 1977) (footnotes omitted). In sum, we shall describe procedural provisions of law as those that generally \u201crestrict, limit, define, qualify, or otherwise simply modify\u201d an existing cause of action. Put differently, procedural matters are those that simply affect the manner in which the forum administers justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">With this legal framework in mind, we turn next to identify on which side of the procedural-substantive divide the Act\u2019s filing requirements reside. It is plain from the outset that the filing requirements do not fit neatly among any of the three \u201ccategories\u201d to which we have applied <em>lex loci delicti. </em>We have described \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)\u2019s certificate of qualified expert as \u201can indispensable part of [the process to reduce the number of medical malpractice court suits] because it helps weed out non-meritorious claims.\u201d <em>Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 658, 7 A.3d at 610. \u201cThe certificate [furthers this process] not only by helping the litigants, the HCADRO, and the trial court determine whether a claimant or plaintiffs claim has merit, but also by requiring the claimant or plaintiff to support the claim with an expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>7 A.3d at 610. Compliance with the Act\u2019s filing requirements is a condition precedent to maintenance of suit. <em>See supra </em>pp. 656-57, 31 A.3d at 128-29. Though of obvious importance to the Act, these filing provisions in no way establish, deny, or define a cause of action. These provisions do not define the standard of care to be applied; nor do they prescribe how liability is to be determined. Instead, the provisions are part of a legislative scheme intended to control the manner in which Maryland administers justice, by controlling access to Maryland courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Any remaining doubt as to the nature of the filing provisions for choice-of-law purposes is resolved by the plain language of CJ \u00a7 3-2A-10,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by which the General Assembly has pronounced the filing requirements to be procedural. That provision, entitled \u201cConstruction of subtitle,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-08A [enabling a defendant, subject to certain time constraints, to make \u201can offer of judgment\u201d without risk that such offer be used against him or her should it be rejected] and 3-2A-09 [setting a cap on non-economic damages in all medical malpractice cases] of this subtitle, <em>the provisions of this subtitle shall be deemed procedural in nature and may not be construed to create, enlarge, or diminish any cause of action not heretofore existing, </em>except the defense of failure to comply with the procedures required under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7B\">CJ \u00a7 3-2A-10 (emphasis added). Defining the Act\u2019s filing requirements as procedural, for choice-of-law purposes, gives effect to the General Assembly\u2019s clear advisement that, with the exception of CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-08A and 3-2A-09, \u201cthe provisions of this subtitle shall be deemed procedural in nature and may not be construed to create, enlarge, or diminish any cause of action not heretofore existing.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-2A-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In sum, we hold that the filing provisions at issue in this case are procedural provisions of Maryland law. And, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Maryland law, Lewis would be required to comply with the filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In conclusion, the doctrine of <em>lex loci delicti </em>does not apply under the circumstances present here. For the reasons we have explained, we hold that the filing requirements at issue are procedural, mandating application of those requirements under Maryland choice-of-law principles, as the law of the forum. We would require Lewis to comply with the Act\u2019s filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION OF LAW ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE. COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">MURPHY and ADKINS, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">ADKINS, J., dissenting, in which MURPHY, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Respectfully, I dissent. At the core of the American judicial system lies the notion that litigants have the right to be heard by the court that passes judgment on their case. This is reflected in the principle that we will not consider or decide cases on an issue that was not briefed by the parties. <em>See Menefee v. State, </em>417 Md. 740, 746 n. 9, 12 A.3d 153, 157 (2011) (observing that because a particular issue \u201cwas not briefed by either party, it is not, at present, before this Court\u201d); <em>Lubin v. Agora, Inc., </em>389 Md. 1, 26 n. 13, 882 A.2d 833, 848 (2005) (declining to consider \u201can important issue\u201d of law that was \u201cnot briefed or argued\u201d); <em>Sweeney v. Sav. First Mortgage, LLC, </em>388 Md. 319, 325 n. 8, 879 A.2d 1037, 1040 (2005) (declining to address an issue that was \u201cnot briefed or argued\u201d); <em>Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc. v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>336 Md. 635, 657 n. 19, 650 A.2d 260, 271 (1994) (same); <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Purifoy, </em>280 Md. 46, 59, 371 A.2d 650, 658 (1977) (\u201cNor do we express any view with respect to the specific issue raised by appellants, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>not briefed by appellees, nor presented as a certified question by the Fourth Circuit, of whether appellants\u2019 interests under the trust instruments were alienable[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The Majority opinion deprives these litigants of that right by deciding an issue not raised by the certified question, not briefed by the parties, and not mentioned at oral argument. As the majority acknowledges, the parties \u201cfocused their attention on whether the public policy exception to <em>lex loci delicti </em>should be invoked. By so arguing, the parties necessarily assumed that the filing requirement is part of Maryland\u2019s substantive law.\u201d Maj. Op. at 658, 31 A.3d at 130. The Majority, however, strays from this issue to resolve a question the federal court had not asked and the parties had not briefed: whether the Act\u2019s filing requirement is substantive or procedural. It then decides that, although the federal court assumed the filing requirements of the Act were substantive for the purposes of <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), we may conclude the opposite for purposes of applying choice-of-law principles. Relying on that principle, it proceeds to decide that the Act is procedural, and thus, <em>lex loci </em>does not apply. The Majority thus renders the briefs filed by the parties irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">I submit that the decision to decide this non-certified question is not only inconsistent with general principles of fairness, but also inconsistent with our jurisprudence relating to an analogous certification rule that permits the Court of Special Appeals to certify a question of law to this Court. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-304(c). In <em>Barnett v. State, </em>307 Md. 194, 203-04, 512 A.2d 1071, 1076 (1986), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">This Court has power under Rule 815, \u201cProcedure in Certified Cases from Court of Special Appeals,\u201d to modify a question so certified. That power to modify was intended to give this Court as much flexibility in answering the substance of a question certified by the Court of Special Appeals as would a provision expressly authorizing question modification contained in an order of certification from a federal court[.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>We were careful to qualify our exercise of the power to modify, however, by considering fairness to the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">So long as there is no prejudice to either party, this Court\u2019s exercise of the power to modify is not restricted to the time when the application for certification is granted. In the instant matter both parties have briefed the substantive issue of waiver, in addition to their positions respecting interpretation of Rule 4-231(c)(l). We therefore modify the certified question to read: \u201cDid Barnett waive all rights involving presence so that the State could try him in absentia?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 204, 512 A.2d at 1076. I take no position on the issue the majority decides. I dissent because I think it only fair that we either resolve the case on the certified question or give the parties the opportunity to brief and argue whether the Act\u2019s filing requirement is substantive or procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The latter is not an open and shut matter. A similar issue was addressed in <em>Davison v. Sinai Hosp. of Balt., Inc., </em>462 F.Supp. 778, 780 (D.Md.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, Davison v. Sinai Hosp. of Balt., Inc., </em>617 F.2d 361 (4th Cir.1980). The <em>Davison </em>court held that the word \u201cprocedural,\u201d in an identical part of the Act, does not apply toward resolving the substantive-procedural distinction in the choice-of-law decision. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Davison </em>court instead reasoned that the statutory provision \u201cwas merely intended to indicate that the legislature was not attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>to create a new cause of action in passing this statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded that the comparable Act was substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">I conclude the parties should be given the opportunity to address whether the Act is procedural or substantive for purposes of a choice-of-law analysis, before we throw the case out of court based on our resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Judge MURPHY authorizes me to state that he joins in the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">. For purposes of this opinion we assume that Lewis\u2019s claim meets the threshold requirements of the Act, which applies only to claims against Maryland health care providers for medical injuries for which the damages sought exceed \"the limit of the concurrent jurisdiction of the District Court.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-2A-02(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">. Pursuant to the Maryland Certified Uniform Questions Act, we accept the statement of facts provided by the certifying court. <em>See, e.g., AGV Sports Grp., Inc. v. Protus IP Solutions, Inc., </em>417 Md. 386, 389 n. 1, 10 A.3d 745, 746 n. 1 (2010). \u201d[W]e consider only questions of state law,\u201d <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v.

We must view each provision of a statute \u201cwithin the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs,\u201d and will avoid \"forced or subtle\u201d interpretations. <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 275-76, 987 A.2d 18, 29 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. Rule 8-304(c) is similar, but not identical to the old 815(b). The former reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">Rule 8-304. Certification from Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">(c) Disposition of Certification. The Court of Appeals may refuse the certification or may issue a writ of certiorari that (1) accepts the certification as submitted, (2) modifies the questions of law certified, (3) includes the entire action although only a question of law was certified, or (4) limits review to only a question of law although the entire action was certified. The Clerk of the Court of Appeals shall send the order refusing certification or the writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals and to the parties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
