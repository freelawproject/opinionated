Petitioner concedes that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses on April 9, 2008, but argues that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the (partial) defenses of \u201cimperfect self defense\u201d and the \u201crule of provocation.\u201d In <em>Wilson v. State of Maryland, </em>195 Md.App. 647, 7 A.3d 197 (2010), the Court of Special Appeals rejected those arguments and affirmed the judgments of conviction. Petitioner then filed a petition for writ of certiorari, in which he presented this Court with two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">1. Did the lower courts err in modifying and/or rejecting the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard established by this Court in <em>Dykes [v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990)], by holding that the \u201csome evidence\u201d requirement is not satisfied by evidence which the lower courts deem unworthy of belief?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">2. Did the trial court err by refusing to instruct the jury on the mitigation defenses of hot blooded response to adequate provocation and imperfect self defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s second question, but \u201cyes\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s first question. We shall therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">As the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">At approximately 11:00 A.M. on the morning of April 9, 2008, in an area known as Bryant Woods in Columbia, the appellant shot Brian Adams four times. Adams died of \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds.\u201d The appellant was indisputably the homicidal agent. The only issue before us is whether the evidence generated at least the reasonable possibility that the appellant, because of extenuating circumstances, may have been guilty only of manslaughter rather than of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">.195 Md.App. at 656, 7 A.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The confrontation that ended with the fatal shooting occurred a short time after Petitioner had initially encountered the victim and two of the victim\u2019s friends at a gas station, where one of the victim\u2019s friends said to Petitioner, \u201cWe\u2019ll fuck you up,\u201d and, \u201cFuck, we could beat you up right now.\u201d As to what occurred thereafter, the State\u2019s brief \u201caccepts\u201d the following statements in Petitioner\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Mr. Wilson returned to his grandmother\u2019s home located several minutes away. He promptly tried to reach his cousin, \u201cChris,\u201d by phone, because he had been \u201ckind of intimidate[d]\u201d by the encounter at the Crown Station. When there was no answer, Petitioner decided to walk to Chris\u2019s home \u201con the other side in Oakland Mills.\u201d Concerned that he might run into the trio, he changed his clothes so that he would not be recognized and took a steak knife from the kitchen \u201cfor backup.\u201d Mr. Wilson expressly stated that he had not gone out for the purpose of finding the trio, but recognized that an encounter was possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">He left his house and started walking towards his cousin\u2019s home. On his way, he saw the three youths. He stated that when they noticed him \u201cthey threw their hands up,\u201d which Petitioner interpreted as meaning that they \u201cwanna fight.\u201d In discussing his intent as he approached the group, he testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">Q. Was it your intention to start something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>A. Not really. Really it was my intention to squash it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">Q. What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">A. Squash it means, like, come to an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Q. Okay. And did you have a thought about how you were [sic] come the [sic] that kind of agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">A. Talk to him, you know what I mean, tell him that I\u2019m not from around here, you know what I\u2019m saying, I just moved out here, you know what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m not too familiar with the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">Q. Okay, Well, why did you bring a knife? A. Because in case they got aggressive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">As Mr. Wilson walked toward the youths, Adams stepped toward Wilson with his hand in his pocket. Adams\u2019 \u201chomeboys\u201d remained about two feet behind him. Mr. Wilson acknowledged being \u201cnervous\u201d and kept his hand on the knife in his pocket. Adams asked what he had in his pocket. Mr. Wilson asked the same. Mr. Wilson stated that they went \u201cback and forth,\u201d until Adams pulled out a gun, looked at Petitioner and \u201csmiled.\u201d Asserting that he was \u201cscared,\u201d Mr. Wilson \u201cgrabbed\u201d for Adams\u2019 weapon and was able <em>to </em>pull it away from him. In approximately fifteen seconds, Mr. Wilson fired four shots at Adams and then fled, dropping the gun as he ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The police subsequently created a \u201cperson wanted\u201d flier and began a canvass of the area. Three days later, on the morning of April 12th, Detective Clay Davis and Detective Vickie Shaffer knocked at the door of the residence at 10848 Green Mountain Circle. Mr. Wilson answered the door. They handed him the flier and told him that they were investigating a homicide. Mr. Wilson\u2019s hands were noted to shake as he took the flier. He denied any knowledge of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">After the officers left, Mr. Wilson called his mother in Georgia and told her that he had \u201cgot into it with some dudes.\u201d She advised him to contact the police. He did so, and Detectives Davis and Shaffer subsequently returned to Wilson\u2019s residence at approximately 11:30-11:45 a.m. In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>recorded interview, Mr. Wilson acknowledged having been at the Crown station to purchase cigarettes, and stated that he later heard shots fired, but denied any knowledge of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">At 3:30 p.m. that same afternoon, a team of officers returned to Mr. Wilson\u2019s home and placed him under arrest. He was transported to the Northern District Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Petitioner again met with Detective Davis and Detective Shaffer at approximately 8:00 p.m. After waiving his Miranda rights, he provided a second statement which was similar in content to the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">At 9:00 p.m. Mr. Wilson was transported by Sergeant Justin Baker to Central Booking. While awaiting processing, Petitioner made several inquires to Baker, including whether he had to admit committing the act in order to claim self-defense. The sergeant responded, \u201cnot necessarily ... that is why it is called a defense.\u201d Mr. Wilson requested another meeting with Detectives Davis and Shaffer. He stated that he had come to recognize the severity of the situation and decided that it was necessary that the detectives hear his side of the story. Mr. Wilson was transported back to Northern District where he met with the two detectives at 11:09 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In this third interview, Mr. Wilson stated that he had changed his clothes before leaving the house, \u201ccause I figured they was gonna look for somebody in my, you what I\u2019m saying, that had my clothes on.\u201d He further told the police that when he saw the three youths, they \u201cflagged [him] down.\u201d He admitted that he shot Adams, but repeatedly asserted that he was \u201cshook\u201d when Adams pulled out the gun and that he \u201cfroze\u201d when Adams aimed it at him and smiled. Petitioner asserted, \u201cI ain\u2019t never been that scared in my life.\u201d He continued[,]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">I was shook. Like I said, when he pulled his out, I was shook. Honest. Turned like this, smiled. And I ain\u2019t his bitch ass. I mean, shit, <em>Kill or be killed. You know what I\u2019m saying? </em>What you gonna do if somebody pulled a gun on you? Man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Mr. Wilson was adamant that he had no intention to kill anyone, adding,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">I\u2019m not no killer . .. I\u2019m not no murderer ... Really, I ain\u2019t even want to fight ... and I\u2019m saying it all happened so fast, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">During the interview, the nineteen year old attempted to respond to the numerous scenarios proposed by the police. He acquiesced in their assertion that he had been upset because he had been disrespected, but denied the allegation that \u201c[Adams] punked you and you got mad; and you shot him.\u201d Mr. Wilson rejoined, \u201cThat ain\u2019t how it went down ...\u201d At one point, Detective Shaffer asserted: \u201c[I]t almost seems as though you came in here to set us up for self defense. And maybe, maybe you were defending yourself</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested that the Circuit Court instruct the jury on the partial defenses of imperfect self defense and hot blooded response to lawfully adequate provocation. The Circuit Court\u2019s denial of those requests was accompanied by the following on-the-record analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">Mr. Wilson\u2019s response to that [first confrontation] was to go home and at that moment he was very deliberative, he thought through what he intended to do. First he called for his cousin for backup, which suggests to me that Mr. Wilson was looking to take care of business immediately, because you can\u2019t walk around with your cousin for the rest of your life. And that\u2019s true because Mr. Wilson said he\u2019s not the kind to run, he\u2019s gonna take care of it. He put on\u2014he changed his clothes, he changed his clothes for, quite frankly, competing reasons, one was to, maybe, not be identified by the three boys, but the other was not to be identified by other persons, should he be involved in an altercation. So, again, he was thinking beyond personal safety, he was thinking at that point [of] lack of detection. And he armed himself with a knife as backup, since he couldn\u2019t find his cousin and then, according to his testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>he proceeded to want to walk towards Oakland Mills. And he left, clearly, very shortly\u2014left his home, clearly, very shortly after he arrived. He certainly didn\u2019t wait to give the three a chance to vacate the area. So he was certainly, aware of the probability or possibility at least, that he would see these boys again, which is why he armed himself. When he saw the boys there was, according to the testimony, a gesturing by Bryan Adams, a raising of the hands in the air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">... [I]t was his view that the raising of the hands was an invitation to fight and he crossed a road to go towards Mr. Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">And according to his testimony he put his hand in his pocket where the knife was. And Mr. Adams, according to him, had his hands in his pockets, so they both were looking at each other with their hands in their pockets. And there\u2019s a lot of thinking going on here, a lot of decision making going on here, none of which smacks nor is there any evidence that there\u2019s fear of death or imminent bodily harm coming, so that\u2019s [him] protecting himself. In fact, he\u2019s going towards the source of the fear of death and imminent bodily harm, if that\u2019s what was present at this point----[Wjhen Mr. Adams is looking at one of his friends the Defendant disarms him and he holds the gun for upwards of\u2014for a period of whatever, but 15 seconds is the number that was testified to, before firing the shots four times. During that time period, when asked about his state of mind, and that\u2019s the operable time period, really, for this, when asked about his state of mind, he expressed that he was caught up in the moment. There\u2019s no specific articulation of fear of death or serious imminent bodily harm, there\u2019s no specific articulation of observations that prompted his fear, at that moment. He has the upper hand, he has control of the situation, he\u2019s, by all accounts, at that moment in time, not confronted by a weapon. There\u2019s no articulation of any behavior by Brian Adams, during that moment in time, that would\u2014that could be pointed to as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>source that would cause fear of imminent death or of death or serious bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">As stated above, the jury convicted Petitioner of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">In <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 483 A.2d 759 (1984), while affirming <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 113, 458 A.2d 81 (1983), this Court held that \u201cthe honest but unreasonable belief standard of imperfect self defense,\u201d although not a complete defense, \u201cmitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-500, 483 A.2d at 761-68. In <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">It is clear from our <em>Faulkner </em>that \u201cwhen evidence is presented showing the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self-defense.\u201d 301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d 759 (footnote omitted), quoted in <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 39, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988). For entitlement to the instruction with respect to both perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">the defendant has the \u201cburden of initially producing \u2018some evidence\u2019 on the issue of mitigation or self-defense ... sufficient to give rise to a jury issue.... Once the issue has been generated by the evidence, however, the State must carry the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\"><em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 39-40, 542 A.2d 1258, quoting <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. at 207-208 [362 A.2d 629], <em>See Cunningham v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 249, 257, 473 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 300 Md. 316, 477 A.2d 1195 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">It is only when \u201csome evidence\u201d has been adduced which is looked to by the defendant on the issue of self-defense or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>other mitigation, that the State \u201cmust carry the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says\u2014\u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not kill in self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 215-17, 571 A.2d at 1256-57. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Applying the \u201csome evidence\u201d test to what Petitioner told the investigating officers as well as to Petitioner\u2019s trial testimony, we are persuaded that Petitioner was entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self defense. The Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was based upon inferences that\u2014although entirely consistent with the evidence that \u201coverwhelmed\u201d Petitioner\u2019s claim that he acted in self-defense\u2014invaded the province of the jury. While affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">With absolutely everything the appellant said and did pointing indisputably in one windward direction, he cannot now claim the protection of the lee shore by claiming that his initiation of the renewed encounter was not with the intention \u201cto start something\u201d but was only with the counter \u201cintention to squash it.\u201d It may take only slight evidence to generate a jury issue, but slight evidence must still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>somewhat more than preposterous.... [Ejvery inane statement does not ipso facto satisfy the burden of production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzB\">195 Md.App. at 668, 7 A.3d at 209. In the case at bar, however, the jury received evidence that, when asked by the detectives what he thought when he saw the victim\u2019s handgun, Petitioner responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">I was shook. Like I said, when he pulled his out, I was shook. Honest. Turned like this, smiled. And I ain\u2019t his bitch ass. I mean, shit, <em>Kill or be killed. You know what I\u2019m saying? </em>What you gonna do if somebody pulled a gun on you? Man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">As Petitioner had elected to be tried by a jury, it was not for the court to determine whether that response was preposterous and/or inane. It was the jury\u2019s duty to determine the reasons why Petitioner (1) changed his clothes, (2) armed himself with the knife, (3) left the safety of his grandmother\u2019s house, (4) decided to approach the victim and the victim\u2019s friends,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (5) after gaining control of the victim\u2019s gun, fired the shots that caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Although Petitioner\u2019s \u201cKill or be killed\u201d claim was (in the words of the <em>Dykes </em>Court) \u201coverwhelmed by evidence to the contrary,\u201d it was legally sufficient to require a jury determination of whether the State\u2019s evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that\u2014at the moment when he shot the victim\u2014 Petitioner did not have a subjective belief that he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm. Under these circumstances, because the Circuit Court erroneously declined to deliver a proper instruction on \u201cimperfect self defense,\u201d Petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">From our review of Petitioner\u2019s statement and testimony, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the evidence was insufficient to generate the issue of whether, at the moment he shot the victim, Petitioner \u201cwas acting in hotblooded rage brought on by the act of [the victim] in pulling a gun from his pocket and smiling.\u201d 195 Md.App. at 682, 7 A.3d at 217. As noted in Petitioner\u2019s brief, he expressly denied the suggestion of the investigating officers that he had fired the shots because he \u201cgot mad.\u201d We therefore hold that the Circuit Court correctly rejected the request for a \u201chot-blooded response ...\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. Both the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals concluded that, because Petitioner approached the victim and the victim\u2019s friends, Petitioner was the \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d and was for that reason not entitled to the jury instruction at issue. From our review of the record, however, we disagree with those conclusions. Moreover, the defendant who was the first combatan! to employ non-deadly force <em>is </em>entitled to assert the defense of (perfect or imperfect) self-defense against a combatant who has responded by employing deadly force. <em>See </em>Charles E. Moylan, Jr., <em>Criminal Homicide Law </em>\u00a7 10.4 at 197 (MICPEL 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
