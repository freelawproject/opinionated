Code (1984, 2009 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 through 10-305 of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). This question is of much interest to Appellant Tonya Walker, whose housing benefits were terminated by the Department for her alleged violations of certain \u201cfamily obligations\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required to be satisfied for continued participation in the Section 8 program. Appellant challenged that decision at an informal administrative hearing at which, pursuant to Departmental and federal regulation, a hearing officer appointed by the Department presided. The hearing officer affirmed the Department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Appellant sought judicial review of the Department\u2019s decision, asserting that the informal hearing was intended to be a \u201ccontested case\u201d under Maryland\u2019s APA, <em>see </em>SG \u00a7 10-202(d), to which certain rights and procedures apply, but were not followed in her case. The Circuit Court rejected Appellant\u2019s contention and affirmed the Department\u2019s decision. Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before argument in that court, we, on our initiative, issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\n<em>The Federal Housing Choice Voucher Program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The Section 8 Housing Program, otherwise known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program (hereinafter \u201cHCVP\u201d), was enacted for the purpose of \u201caiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live....\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1437f(a). The HCVP is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), the regulations for which are found in 24 C.F.R Part 982. Under the HCVP, HUD enters into contracts with, and provides funding to, state public housing agencies (\u201cPHAs\u201d) for the purpose of providing rental subsidies to eligible program participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Each PHA must adopt an Administrative Plan that conforms with the statutory requirements and HUD regulations. Individuals seeking to participate in the HCVP program must apply to the designated PHA. The PHA, in conformance with criteria set forth by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(4), HUD regulations, and the procedure established by its Administrative Plan, is responsible for processing and qualifying the low income applicants. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Once an applicant is approved by the PHA, he or she is provided a HUD voucher and approval form. The participant is then responsible for locating housing. Once a participant identifies rental housing and reaches an agreement with the landlord, the participant must obtain tenancy approval from the PHA. To be approved, the apartment must meet housing quality standards established by HUD, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(8)(B); 24 C.F.R \u00a7 982.305(a); the rent must be reasonable, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(10)(A); and the lease must conform to HUD requirements, including as an attachment a memorandum prepared by HUD explaining the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and tenant, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(7)(F). Once the PHA approves the lease, the PHA then enters into a housing assistance payment agreement with the landlord, whereby the PHA arranges to pay the difference between the participant\u2019s base rental payment and the actual rent for the housing unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>When a family is selected to participate in the HCVP program, the PHA is required to \u201cgive the family an oral briefing\u201d to explain family and owner responsibilities. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.301(a). The PHA must also provide the family with an information packet setting forth, inter alia, \u201c[f]amily obligations under the program,\u201d and explaining the right of a participant to request an informal hearing before the PHA to challenge certain PHA actions and how and when that right may be exercised. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Pursuant to the statute and HUD regulation, participants in the HCVP must meet, at the outset and on an ongoing basis, specified family obligations. <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551. Two of those obligations are relevant to the present case: Pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(d) participants are required to allow the PHA to inspect the unit on an annual basis to ensure that the unit meets housing quality standards, <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o )(8)(D) (requiring PHAs to conduct annual inspections); and pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(b), participants are obligated to provide \u201ctrue and complete\u201d information as required by the PHA and HUD, including \u201cfamily income and composition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Part 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(1) lists the grounds upon which a PHA may terminate program assistance. That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">The PHA may at any time deny program assistance for an applicant, or terminate program assistance for a participant, for any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">(i) If the family violates any family obligations under the program (see \u00a7 982.551). See \u00a7 982.553 concerning denial or termination of assistance for crime by family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">(v) If the family currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(vii) If the family breaches an agreement with the PHA to pay amounts owed to a PHA, or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. (The PHA, at its discretion, may offer a family the opportunity to enter an agreement to pay amounts owed to a PHA or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. The PHA may prescribe the terms of the agreement.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>The requirement of a pre-termination hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a)(1) provides that, prior to making a determination to terminate assistance, \u201ca PHA must give a participant family an opportunity for an informal hearing to consider whether the [ ] PHA decision[ ] ... [is] in accordance with the law, HUD regulations and PHA policies.... \u201d Part 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e) directs the PHA to establish procedures for conducting informal hearings and provides a general framework for conducting the proceeding. The regulation provides the following: Prior to the hearing, the participant must be given the opportunity to examine all relevant PHA documents. <em>Id. </em>At the hearing, the participant, at his or her own expense, is entitled to legal representation. <em>Id. </em>The PHA may appoint \u201cany person\u201d to serve as the hearing officer for the hearing, so long as that person is not the person \u201cwho made or approved the decision under review or a subordinate of this person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although there are no formal evidentiary rules at the hearing, both the PHA and the participant have the opportunity to \u201cpresent evidence, and may question any witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulation requires all factual determinations to be made by a preponderance of the evidence standard, and it directs the hearing officer to \u201cissue a written decision, stating briefly the reasons for the decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Maryland\u2019s PHA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development is the PHA responsible for administering the HCVP program in Wicomico County, Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>by the federal statute and HUD regulations, the Department has adopted an Administrative Plan governing the administration of the HCVP program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consistent with the various HUD regulations discussed above, the Administrative Plan provides for, inter alia, the possible termination of a participant\u2019s assistance payments for failing to comply with family obligations, failing to provide an accurate report of family income, and failing to repay the Department for any overpayments. Also consistent in all material aspects with HUD regulations, the Administrative Plan provides that, prior to the termination of a participant\u2019s housing assistance benefits, the participant must be given an opportunity for an informal hearing. In accordance with 24 C.F.R. 982.555(e), the Administrative Plan specifies the rights afforded to a participant at the informal hearing and how that informal hearing is to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">This litigation arises out of Appellant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with her family obligations, as required by the Administrative Plan and HUD regulations. In 2009, Appellant resided with her four children in a house she rented in Salisbury, Maryland. Because Appellant was at the time an HCVP participant, her rental payments were supplemented by payments made directly from the Department to Mary Anne Johnson, the property manager of Appellant\u2019s rental unit. The Department, alleging that Appellant was in violation of her family obligations, notified Appellant that her rental assistance payments were being terminated. As a result of the termination, Appellant requested and was given an informal hearing to appeal the termination decision, as required by the Administrative Plan and HUD regulations. On August 27, 2009, that hearing was held at the office of Joy Chestnutt, a local property manager appointed by the Department to serve as the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>The Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Ms. Chestnutt (hereinafter, \u201cthe hearing officer\u201d) took testimony from Ms. Barbara Bialk, a housing subsidy officer representing the Department, and from Appellant and her father, Avery Walker. The hearing officer also received certain documentary evidence from the Department and Appellant. Given the purely legal question we decide, it is unnecessary to discuss all that occurred at the hearing. It is sufficient to note the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The Department\u2019s theory for terminating Appellant\u2019s participation in the program was that she had violated her HCVP family obligations in two ways: she failed on multiple occasions to make her home available for inspection, as required by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(d), and she failed to enter into a repayment agreement to compensate the Department for alleged overpayments, as she was required to do by the Administrative Plan and 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(1)(vii). According to the Department, the overpayment resulted from Appellant\u2019s failure to report to the Department that she was receiving Social Security benefits on behalf of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The Department further alleged that Appellant failed to take any corrective actions to satisfy her family obligations, despite the Department\u2019s numerous letters to Appellant warning her of the need to do so in order to avoid termination of her HCVP benefits. Those letters included a June 8, 2009 \u201cTermination of Assistance Notification\u201d letter indicating that Appellant\u2019s HCVP participation was being terminated effective July 31, 2009. The letter stated that the grounds for termination were Appellant\u2019s failure to enter into a repayment agreement and to allow inspection of the assisted unit. The letter also notified Appellant that \u201c[y]ou have a right to appeal this decision. To appeal, you must file a written request for an informal hearing sent to [the Department] no later than fourteen (14) days from the postmark on this notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Appellant presented to the hearing officer a different version of events that led to the Department\u2019s terminating her from the program. With regard to her alleged failure to make her home available for inspection, Appellant argued that she had notified the Department that the inspector failed to show up for one of the scheduled re-inspections and that a family medical emergency necessitated her missing the second of the scheduled re-inspections. As for the failure to report the change in income, Appellant denied receiving notice from the Department directing her to arrange for a repayment plan and, when she noticed an increase in her rental payments, she believed that she had begun repayment of the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Appellant also denied receiving the June 8 \u201cTermination of Assistance Notification,\u201d and alleged that she only learned from her father of the termination of her benefits on or about August 11, 2009, after her father had been informed by the property manager, Ms. Johnson, of the termination. Appellant presented to the hearing officer a letter from Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson wrote that the property management company did not receive the June 8 letter, and, according to Ms. Johnson, she learned of the termination only after she noticed that the rental assistance payments from the Department had ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>On September 3, 2009, the hearing officer issued a written decision, summarizing the aforementioned evidence, but making no findings of fact. The decision includes the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion, without elaboration, that \u201c[t]he testimony and evidence in this matter indicates that the decision of the [Department] should be upheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\n<em>Petition for Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On September 28, 2009, Appellant filed in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County a petition for judicial review pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-222. The Department moved to dismiss the petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Department relied on Maryland Rule 7-201(a), which provides: \u201cThe rules in this Chapter govern actions for judicial review of (1) an order or action of an administrative agency, where judicial review is authorized by statute.... \u201d The Department argued that its decision to terminate Appellant from the program would be subject to judicial review only if authorized by statute, and there is no such authority. The Department further relied on SG \u00a7 10-202(d), which describes what is, and what is not, a \u201ccontested case.\u201d The Department argued that the informal hearing conducted pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 does not come within the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d as set forth in Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (hereinafter, the \u201cAPA\u201d), for which judicial review is available. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-222(a)(1) (providing that, \u201c[e]xeept as provided in subsection (b) <em>of </em>this section, a party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision as provided in this section\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">SG \u00a7 10-202(d) sets forth the following definition for \u201ccontested case\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(d) <em>Contested </em>Case.\u2014(1) \u201cContested case\u201d means a proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">(1) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">(2) \u201cContested case\u201d does not include a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required only by regulation unless the regulation expressly, or by clear implication, requires the hearing to be held in accordance with this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In the Department\u2019s view, there is no statute or provision of the Constitution that requires a contested case hearing prior to the termination of HCVP participation, making SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) inapplicable; instead, the sole right to a hearing comes from HUD regulations, specifically the right to the informal hearing set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555. According to the Department, SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) is therefore applicable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and, because 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 does not indicate either expressly or by clear implication that the informal hearing is to be treated as a contested case, it is not one.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Appellant disagreed. Appellant argued in her Reply Memorandum, and later during oral argument before the Circuit Court, that 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 is not the only source of a right to a hearing prior to an HCVP termination decision. Appellant asserted that the pre-termination hearing, in addition to being required by the federal regulation, is also dictated by the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution, thereby satisfying the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d set forth in SG \u00a7 10\u2014202(d)(1)(i). Appellant continued that, as a contested case, the hearing was required to be held according to the procedures set forth in Subtitle 2 of SG \u00a7 10 and, because it was not, a remand to the Department for a proper hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The Circuit Court, after hearing from the parties in open court, issued a written Opinion and Order agreeing with the Department. The court, unpersuaded by Appellant\u2019s argument, found that \u201cthe hearing held by the [Department] was ... required only be regulation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(a)(v)\u201d and therefore the \u201cmatter is not a \u2018contested case\u2019 under Maryland\u2019s statutory definition and [ ] the APA requirements do not apply.\u201d The court nonetheless went on to find that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Department\u2019s termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">On May 12, 2010, Appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to argument before the Court of Special Appeals, we, on our initiative, issued a writ of certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">1. Does the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act govern hearings concerning terminations of rental assistance to participants in the Housing Choice Voucher Program administered by the Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">2. Did the Department comply with Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Department, upon receipt of Appellant\u2019s challenge to the pending termination decision, was required to provide her a contested case hearing before terminating her housing benefits. We further hold that the informal hearing was not held in accordance with the contested case procedures set forth in the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We decide first whether the Department is required to hold a' \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing, as defined by the APA, before terminating the benefits of an HCYP participant who challenges the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(1), as we have explained, defines \u201ccontested case\u201d as including \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine[ ] (i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing[.]\u201d When a \u201cproceeding\u201d meets the definition of a contested case, the agency is required to provide certain trial-type procedures during the hearing. <em>See Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 651, 594 A.2d 1115, 1120 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The parties are in agreement that the Department is a State agency to which the APA applies. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 \u00a7 10-202, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>10-203. Termination of HCVP benefits, moreover, constitutes a \u201cright, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege\u201d as set forth in the definition of \u201ccontested case.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(1). The parties dispute, however, whether a statute or constitutional principle requires that a decision regarding termination of HCVP benefits be made only after \u201can opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It is a well-established principle of Maryland administrative law that the APA itself does not grant a right to an administrative hearing. Rather, the right must come from another source, such as a statute, due process principles, or a regulation. <em>See Carven v. State Retirement &amp; Pension System of Maryland, </em>416 Md. 389, 410, 7 A.3d 38, 51 (2010); <em>Sugarloaf </em>323 Md. at 652, 594 A.2d at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Appellant makes no claim that a statute grants her the right to an administrative hearing. Appellant contends, instead, that federal due process principles entitle her to a pretermination hearing. Appellant relies on <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In <em>Goldberg, </em>the Supreme Court held that termination of welfare benefits without first affording the recipient an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The <em>Goldberg </em>Court held that Due Process requires that, prior to termination of public assistance benefits, the welfare recipient must be given \u201ctimely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination,\u201d and, at the hearing, the recipient must be given \u201can effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d <em>Goldberg, </em>397 U.S. at 267-68, 90 S.Ct. 1011. The Supreme Court reasoned that the interests of the participant in the \u201cuninterrupted receipt of public assistance, coupled with the State\u2019s interest that his payments not be erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>terminated, clearly outweighs the State\u2019s competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 90 S.Ct. 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">That same reasoning applies with equal force to HCVP benefits, because participants rely on the rental assistance payments to meet \u201ctheir basic need for housing.\u201d <em>Basco v. Machin, </em>514 F.3d 1177, 1182 n. 7 (11 th Cir.2008). <em>See also Davis v. Mansfield Metro. Hous. Auth., </em>751 F.2d 180, 185 (6th Cir.1984) (same). The Department implicitly concedes, by not arguing the contrary, that the Due Process Clause requires an evidentiary hearing prior to the termination of HCVP benefits. And indeed, the informal hearing framework set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 meets <em>Goldberg\u2019s </em>due process requirements. <em>Compare </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(c)(1) (providing that the recipient may request a hearing to challenge termination if he or she \u201cdoes not agree with the [initial] determination\u201d) <em>with Goldberg, </em>397 U.S. at 267, 90 S.Ct. 1011 (requiring that the recipient be given the opportunity of a pre-termination hearing \u201cto protect a recipient against an erroneous termination of his benefits\u201d); <em>compare </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(c)(2) (providing that the PHA is required to give \u201cprompt written notice\u201d of the proposed termination containing \u201ca brief statement of reasons\u201d) <em>with Goldberg, </em>397 U.S. at 267-68, 90 S.Ct. 1011 (stating that recipient must receive \u201ctimely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination\u201d); <em>compare </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(5) (specifying that the recipient \u201cmust be given the opportunity to present evidence, and may question any witnesses\u201d) <em>with Goldberg, </em>397 U.S. at 268, 90 S.Ct. 1011 (explaining that the recipient must be given an \u201ceffective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As the Department acknowledges in its brief, courts throughout the country have rejected due process challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to the informal hearing procedures set forth in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 precisely because the procedures meet the requirements of <em>Goldberg </em>and its progeny. <em>See generally Hunter v. Underwood, </em>362 F.3d 468 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Ritter v. Cecil County Office of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev., </em>33 F.3d 323 (4th Cir.1994). It is clear, then, that the Due Process Clause\u2014and not the relevant federal regulations alone\u2014requires, upon request, a hearing prior to the termination of HCVP benefits. We thus must decide whether the due process requirement of a hearing prior to termination of HCVP benefits renders those hearings \u201ccontested cases\u201d for purposes of the Maryland APA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\n<em>Right to a pre-termination hearing is not required \u201conly by regulation\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Department first relies on SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) in arguing why the pre-termination hearing is not a contested case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Once again, SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) provides: \u201c \u2018Contested case\u2019 does not include a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required <em>only by regulation </em>unless the regulation expressly, or by clear implication, requires the hearing to be held in accordance with this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Department argues that a pre-termination proceeding is not a contested case because the \u201cinformal hearing\u201d is required by regulation (i.e., 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555). Appellant responds, as she did before the Circuit Court, that the right to a pre-termination hearing emanates not \u201conly\u201d from the federal regulation, but also from the Due Process Clause, thereby making SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The plain language of SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) demonstrates why the Department\u2019s argument fails.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That provision exempts from contested case treatment a hearing that is \u201crequired <em>only </em>by regulation\u201d (absent language in the regulation indicating that it is to be treated as a contested case). In other words, subsection (d)(2) is applicable only when neither a statute nor a constitutional principle\u2014e.g., due process\u2014 requires a hearing prior to certain agency action. Put another way, the only way for the Department to prevail on this point is if we read out the word \u201conly\u201d from SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2), such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that it would read in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Contested case\u2019 does not include a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required by regulation....\u201d That, of course, is untenable. We are obliged to enforce the plain language of a statutory provision and must \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute.... \u201d <em>Headen v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 559, 569, 16 A.3d 196, 202 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The legislative history of SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) does not convince us to the contrary. To understand the history of that subsection, we must first review <em>Sugarloaf, </em>323 Md. 641, 594 A.2d 1115, the issuance of which precipitated the enactment of subsection (d)(2). In that case, we construed a statute that employed the term \u201cpublic hearing\u201d as contemplating a contested case hearing. In response to <em>Sugarloaf, </em>the Governor formed a Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act and charged the Commission with \u201cassessing] and respondting] to complaints that the <em>Sugarloaf </em>decision had resulted in an unexpected and unwarranted expansion of the situations to which contested case hearings were applicable.\u201d The Commission recommended the addition of \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) to \u201cclarify which activities of State government do not fall under the provisions of the [APA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The General Assembly adopted the recommended provision in 1993. The Bill Analysis of HB 877 (which became subsection (d)(2)) states that the amendment \u201cmakes clear that a public hearing that is required by regulation or statute before an agency takes a particular action need not take the form of a \u2018contested case\u2019 proceeding, with its accompanying evidentiary, discovery, and other elaborate procedural rules, unless the regulation or statute expressly or by clear implication requires otherwise.\u201d Because the legislative history of \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) suggests that the intent behind revision of the APA was to avoid a situation where a hearing required by regulation automatically triggered the APA, and because Appellant\u2019s hearing was required by federal regulation, the Department asserts that this legislative history supports its argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00a7 10-202(d)(2) excludes from the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d the hearing at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We are somewhat perplexed by the Department\u2019s insistence that the legislative history of (d)(2) supports its interpretation of that subsection. The Department\u2019s assessment indicates that the addition of subsection (d)(2) was motivated by concerns not at all at issue here\u2014mainly, this Court\u2019s suggestion in <em>Sugarloaf </em>that the term \u201cpublic hearing\u201d as used in the statute at issue in that case contemplated a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Indeed, the Bill Analysis of House Bill 877 says nothing regarding the issue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>which involves a situation where both a regulation and due process principles require a hearing prior to agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In sum, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that an HCVP participant be given the opportunity for a hearing prior to the termination of HCVP benefits. Consequently, the hearing is not required <em>\u201conly </em>by regulation,\u201d as would be necessary for application of SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2) (describing what \u201ccontested case\u201d does not include). We therefore must focus our attention on subsection (d)(1), to ascertain whether the pre-termination hearing meets the definition in that subsection of a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>Contested Case?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The Department\u2019s remaining argument for why the pretermination hearing is not a contested case confuses a constitutional analysis with one that, at bottom, is one of statutory interpretation. Essentially, the Department argues that, because due process requires no more than an informal hearing prior to termination of HCVP benefits\u2014and indeed the federal regulations explicitly characterize the pre-termination hearing as \u201cinformal\u201d\u2014the hearing is not a contested case for which the full trial-type procedures are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Appellant disagrees. Appellant contends that, because the pre-termination hearing prescribed by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 is also required by the Constitution, the hearing comes within the SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) definition of a contested case, i.e., an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>agency proceeding at which, inter alia, a statutory entitlement that is \u201crequired by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The leading case on this issue is <em>Sugarloaf. </em>The question decided in <em>Sugarloaf </em>was whether the Maryland Air Management Administration of the Maryland Department of the Environment was required to hold a contested case hearing before ruling on an application for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> related to the process of building a Municipal solid waste incinerator. 323 Md. at 651, 594 A.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Northeast Maryland Disposal Authority had proposed to construct a municipal solid waste incinerator near Sugarloaf Mountain. The first step in the process was for the Disposal Authority to obtain a PSD permit, which would then be followed by obtaining a construction permit and, finally, an operation permit. Concerned citizens (plaintiffs) living in the area requested that the Air Management Administration (\u201cAgency\u201d) hold an \u201cadjudicatory hearing\u201d prior to ruling on the permit. After the Agency denied the request, indicating that it instead would hold a \u201cpublic hearing at which interested persons could make comments,\u201d the plaintiffs filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a complaint for declaratory judgment. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the Agency must hold a contested case hearing prior to final action on the PSD permit. <em>Id. </em>at 648-49, 594 A.2d at 1118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Agency, finding that a contested case hearing during the PSD permit process was not required by statute, regulation, or due process. Prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, we granted the Agency\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-petition to review the Circuit Court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 594 A.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The <em>Sugarloaf </em>plaintiffs, unlike Appellant here, made no argument that they had a due process right to a contested case hearing at the PSD permit stage. <em>Id. </em>at 653 n. 8, 594 A.2d at 1121 n. 8. Instead, the <em>Sugarloaf </em>plaintiffs contended that Maryland Code (1982, 1987 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-404 of the Environment Article (\u201cEnv\u2019t Art.\u201d) and COMAR 26.11.02.10C obligated the Agency to provide a contested case hearing prior to PSD permit approval. 323 Md. at 653, 594 A.2d at 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We disagreed with the plaintiffs, explaining that the \u201cstatute or regulation which grants the right to a hearing may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \u2018contested case\u2019 or \u2018adjudicatory\u2019 hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 594 A.2d at 1120. We rejected outright Env\u2019t Art. \u00a7 2-404 as a basis for a contested case hearing at the PSD permit stage. We reasoned, based on the language of that provision, that it was not until the construction permit stage that the statute provides the right to a \u201cpublic hearing,\u201d which we construed to mean a contested case hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 656, 594 A.2d at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">With regard COMAR 26.11.02.10C, we found important the portion of it authorizing the Agency to implement the hearing procedures used by the Environmental Protection Agency in PSD proceedings at the federal level. We noted that the federal regulation, in turn, provided for \u201cnon-trial type public notice and comment hearings\u201d and specified that PSD permits \u201cmay never be subject to an \u2018evidentiary hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 594 A.2d at 1122. That language, we explained, clearly evinced an intent by the Environmental Protection Agency that the hearing <em>not </em>be treated as a contested case. <em>Id., </em>594 A.2d at 1122. We concluded that, by giving the Agency the option to employ those federal procedures, Maryland had shown a \u201csimilar intent\u201d that the PSD permit hearing not be a contested case. <em>Id., </em>594 A.2d at 1122. Accordingly, we held that the COMAR regulation\u2014i.e., the source of the right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>hearing\u2014did not contemplate a contested case hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 594 A.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">It is this analysis in <em>Sugarloaf </em>from which the Department crafts its argument that \u201cthe statute or regulation which grants the right to a hearing, or due process principles themselves, may negate the fact that the hearing is to be a \u2018contested case\u2019 hearing.\u201d In other words, the Department argues that, because due process does not require a contested case hearing prior to termination of HCVP benefits, the hearing does not come with the definition of \u201ccontested case.\u201d The Department, however, overlooks a key aspect of our analysis in <em>Sugarloaf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Subsequent to the filing of our initial opinion in <em>Sugarloaf, </em>the Agency filed a motion for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 594 A.2d at 1124. The Agency argued that we had erroneously interpreted Env\u2019t Art. \u00a7 2-404 to provide for a contested case hearing at the construction permit stage. Specifically, the Agency contended that the hearing provided for in Env\u2019t Art. \u00a7 2-404 at the construction permit stage is not a contested case because the \u201cword \u2018public\u2019 is used in the statute[ ] providing for [the] hearing[ ] and that the administrative practice has not been to treat the hearing[ ] as [a] contested case....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 594 A.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In reaffirming our interpretation of that statutory provision, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Under Maryland administrative law, where a statute, regulation or due process principles provide that a particular administrative function be done after an agency hearing, it is the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act, and not the statute dealing with the underlying administrative function, which ordinarily determines whether the hearing is a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing. In other words, where a statute ... requires an opportunity for an agency hearing prior to the issuance of a construction permit, the question whether such hearing is a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing ordinarily depends upon applying the definition of \u201ccontested case\u201d in the Administrative Procedure Act to the agency activity, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>not upon whether [the statute] uses language indicating that the hearing is \u201cadjudicatory.\u201d Otherwise, the definition of contested case in the Administrative Procedure Act ... would be superfluous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 663, 594 A.2d at 1126. Because Env\u2019t Art. \u00a7 2-404 required a hearing prior to issuance of the construction permit, and \u201c[n]othing in the scheme expressly or by implication negates a contested case hearing,\u201d we reaffirmed in <em>Sugarloaf </em>our earlier conclusion that the hearing is a contested case hearing. 323 Md. at 666, 594 A.2d at 1127.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">This analysis applies with equal force to refute the Department\u2019s contention that the source of the HCVP benefits termination hearing \u201cnegates the fact\u201d that the hearing is a contested case. Put differently, though due process requires an informal HCVP hearing, the somewhat limited rights (as compared to those provided at a contested case hearing) afforded a participant by due process do not constitute the \u201cexpress[ ] or clear implication\u201d necessary to negate treatment of the hearing as a contested case under Maryland\u2019s APA. <em>See Sugarloaf </em>323 Md. at 665-66 n. 6, 594 A.2d at 1127 n. 6. In the absence of the requisite evidence of negation, <em>see, e.g., Angell v. Henneberry, </em>92 Md.App. 279, 303, 607 A.2d 590, 602 (1992) (holding that the procedures required by due process attendant at inmate transfer hearings were so limited as to constitute the express or implied negation required by <em>Sugarloaf), </em>once due process or a statute requires a hearing prior to certain agency action, it is the definition of contested case found within the APA that is controlling. Otherwise, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>explained in <em>Sugarloaf, </em>we would render nugatory and surplusage the contested case definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Two of our sister states have held similarly. In <em>Bouie v. New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, </em>407 N.J.Super. 518, 972 A.2d 401 (2009), the New Jersey intermediate appellate court held, inter alia, that the HCYP benefits termination hearing required by federal law was a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the New Jersey APA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Codified at N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2(b), the New Jersey APA defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as \u201ca proceeding, including any licensing proceeding, in which the legal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other legal relations of specific parties are required by constitutional right or by statute to be determined by an agency by decisions, determinations, or orders, addressed to them or disposing of their interests, after opportunity for an agency hearing. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The <em>Bouie </em>court began by noting that the New Jersey APA (much like Maryland\u2019s APA, <em>see Carven, </em>416 Md. at 410, 7 A.3d at 51) does not create a substantive right to an administrative hearing. <em>Bouie, </em>972 A.2d at 412. Instead, just as in Maryland, the right to an administrative hearing must flow from another statute or constitutional provision. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The <em>Bouie </em>court then explained that, in the context of housing benefits, the right to an administrative hearing emanates not from a statute, but instead from the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted that, for this reason, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555 provides for an informal hearing at which certain procedures\u2014those required by Goldberg\u2014are guaranteed to a participant. <em>Id. </em>at 409. Because the protections afforded participants were dictated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the Constitution, the court concluded that the termination hearing was a contested case under the New Jersey APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">To like effect is <em>Aguiar v. Hawaii Housing Authority, </em>55 Haw. 478, 522 P.2d 1255 (1974). In that case, the Supreme Court of Hawaii confronted an issue identical to the case <em>sub judice. </em>At that time, the Hawaii APA defined a \u201ccontested case\u201d as \u201ca proceeding in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for [an] agency hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267. Relying on <em>Goldberg </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 interest in continuing to receive the statutory benefit of low-cost housing\u2014and hence in resisting erroneous rent increases\u2014is a \u2018property\u2019 interest for due process purposes[,]\u201d the Court held that the assistance could only be terminated after an opportunity for a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1267. Accordingly, the court held that the proceeding was a contested case under the Hawaii APA, for which all of the attendant procedures applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We agree with our sister jurisdictions. Pursuant to <em>Goldberg, </em>the Due Process Clause requires that HCVP participants be given an opportunity for an informal hearing prior to termination of benefits. Absent the express or clearly implied evidence of negation required by <em>Sugarloaf, </em>we hold, much like the <em>Bouie </em>and <em>Aguiar </em>courts, that HCVP benefits termination hearings are contested cases under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>Was the HCVP benefits termination hearing held in accordance with the contested case requirements?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Our remaining task is to determine whether the procedures afforded Appellant at her HCVP benefits termination hearing were in accordance with those procedures required of contested cases, as set forth in Subtitle 2 of SG Title 10. Appellant argues that the hearing and the decision issued failed to comply with the APA because the findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>conclusions of law were inadequate and the hearing examiner failed to construct an adequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">SG \u00a7 10-221, entitled \u201cFinal decisions and orders!,]\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">(a) Form.\u2014A final decision or order in a contested case that is adverse to a party shall be in writing or stated on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">(b) Contents.\u2014(1) A final decision or order in a contested case, including a remand of a proposed decision, shall contain separate statements of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">(i) the findings of fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">(ii) the conclusions of law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">(iii) the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">(2) A written statement of appeal rights shall be included with the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">(3) If the findings of fact are stated in statutory language, the final decision shall state concisely and explicitly the facts that support the findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">(4) If, in accordance with regulations, a party submitted proposed findings of fact, the final decision shall state a ruling on each proposed finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Appellant complains that the hearing officer\u2019s decision lacks the findings of fact and conclusions of law mandated by SG \u00a7 \u00a7 10-220 and 10-221. Appellant specifies that the hearing officer neither articulated her reasoning nor set out the facts as she found them, and \u201csimply paraphrased the evidence offered by each party and concluded that \u2018the testimony and evidence in this matter indicate! ] that the decision of the local housing authority should be upheld.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">The hearing officer\u2019s written findings consist of a summary of the Department\u2019s \u201cposition,\u201d as presented by Ms. Bialk, followed by a summary of Appellant\u2019s \u201cposition,\u201d as presented by Appellant and her father, Mr. Walker. Following that narrative account of the evidence is the hearing officer\u2019s decision, which reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The Hearing Officer is responsible for determining whether the action or decision of the Local Housing Authority is in accordance with HUD regulations and the agency Administrative Plan based upon the preponderance of evidence and testimony provided at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">The testimony and evidence in this matter indicates that the decision of the Local Housing Authority should be upheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">This does not come close to the findings required by SG \u00a7 10-221. We have explained time and time again, \u201cnot only the importance but the necessity that administrative agencies resolve all significant conflicts in the evidence and then chronicle, in the record, full, complete and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 64, 806 A.2d 662, 676 (2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted).

Though it may seem that the Department is making a preemption argument, it in fact is not. The Department does not argue explicitly that preemption applies in its brief; in fact, the Department conceded before the Circuit Court that preemption was not an issue (stating that \"there is no preemption issue.\u201d).

There is nothing in the federal statute or accompanying regulations that prohibits a PHA from providing procedures beyond those that are required by due process at the pre-termination hearing. <em>See, e.g., </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.53(d) (\"Nothing in part 982 is intended to pre-empt operation of state or local laws.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\">.

I can find nothing in the relevant statutory or regulatory context that indicates other than that a more formal, trial type contested case hearing (under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act) is not intended in these situations.

Thus, even though a statutory entitlement was at issue in the present case, \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) of the State Gov\u2019t Art. of the Md.Code does not trump the clear indication from the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>for the administrative resolution of Section 8 housing assistance disputes that only an \u201cinformal hearing\u201d is required, such as was given in the present case, <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v.
