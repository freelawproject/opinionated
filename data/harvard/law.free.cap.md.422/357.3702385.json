We shall hold that the statute\u2019s provisions granting immunity violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and are, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act was enacted by Ch. 114 of the Acts of 1994 and is, for the most part, codified in Maryland Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), subtitle 8, \u00a7\u00a7 6-801 through 6-852 of the Environment Article. As stated in \u00a7 6-802 of the Act, \u201c[t]he purpose of this subtitle is to reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.\u201d The Act was generally based upon the recommendations of a study commission, the \u201cLead Paint Poisoning Commission,\u201d which reported to the General Assembly in December 1993 and which issued a final report in May 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The Act was divided into several parts, with Part I, consisting of \u00a7\u00a7 6-801 through 6-804, containing definitions and coverage provisions. Among the definitions, the phrase \u201caffected property\u201d is primarily defined as \u201cproperty constructed before 1950 that contains at least one rental dwelling unit\u201d (\u00a7 6-801(b)). Part II of the Act, in \u00a7\u00a7 6-807 through 6-810, creates and delineates the duties of an advisory and study commission. Part III is titled \u201cRegistration of Affected Property,\u201d and it requires that \u201cthe owner of an affected property shall register the affected property with the Department [of the Environment]\u201d on \u201cor before December 31, 1995\u201d (\u00a7 6-811(a)). The registration involves filling out a form giving the Department various items of information about the affected property (\u00a7 6-811(b)). The statute also requires that the registration be renewed \u201con or before December 31 of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>year,\u201d updating the information about the affected property (\u00a7. 6-812(a)(l)). If an owner first acquires affected property after December 1, 1995, the owner \u201cshall register the affected property ... within 80 days after the acquisition\u201d (\u00a7 6-812(b)). Section 6-813(a) provides that, if an owner \u201cfails to register\u201d or \u201cfails to renew the registration of an affected property,\u201d the owner \u201cis not in compliance with respect to that affected property ... for purposes of \u00a7 6-836,\u201d which is one of the sections granting immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Sections 6-815 through 6-824 comprise Part IV of the Act, titled \u201cRisk Reduction Standard for Affected Property.\u201d These sections establish detailed and mandatory risk reduction standards for affected property,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> set forth a schedule for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>bringing affected property into compliance with the risk reduction standards, and provide that the owner of affected property may lose liability protection for non-compliance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Section 6-818 provides for inspections of affected property by independent inspectors who are accredited by the Department of the Environment, and \u00a7 6-819 contains a \u201cmodified risk reduction standard.\u201d Section 6-820 requires that owners of affected property give to tenants a \u201cnotice of tenant\u2019s rights,\u201d and \u00a7 6-823 requires that the owners give to each tenant a \u201clead poisoning information packet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Part V of the Act, titled \u201cQualified Offer,\u201d consists of \u00a7\u00a7 6-826 through 6-842.. In addition to the provisions concerning \u201cqualified offers,\u201d this part contains the limitations on judicial actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">A \u201cqualified offer\u201d is an offer of money by an owner, the owner\u2019s agent, or an insurer of the owner, made to a person at risk or to a parent or legal guardian of a person at risk who is a minor (\u00a7\u00a7 6-831 through 6-834). A \u201cperson at risk\u201d is defined as \u201ca child or a pregnant woman who resides or regularly spends at least 24 hours per week in an affected property\u201d (\u00a7 6-801(p)). \u201cChild\u201d is defined as \u201can individual under the age of 6 years\u201d (\u00a7 6-801(d)). A \u201cqualified offer\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>designed to cover some expenses which are incurred on behalf of an affected person at risk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>amount payable under a qualified offer is only $17,000, and most of this is payable to the provider of medical or other services and not to the person at risk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Act, in \u00a7 6-835, provides that \u201c[acceptance of a qualified offer by a person at risk, or by a parent [or] legal guardian\u201d of a person at risk, \u201creleases all potential liability of the offeror, the offeror\u2019s insured or principal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 6-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>836, on the other hand, provides that if a qualified offer is rejected, \u201c[a]n owner of an affected property is not liable, for alleged injury or loss caused by ingestion of lead by a person at risk in the affected property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 6-836.1 purports to direct a trial court to proceed in a particular manner if an owner\u2019s claim of immunity from liability under \u00a7\u00a7 6-835 or 6-836 is challenged by any party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Although certain sections of the Act are written as if \u00a7\u00a7 6-835 and 6-836 were the only provisions granting immunity to the owners <em>(see, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6-813(a) or 6-836.1), \u00a7\u00a7 6-827 and 6-828 also deal with liability and immunity from personal injury suits. Section 6-827 indicates that Part V of the statute, relating to qualified offers and owners\u2019 immunity from suit, is intended to be very broad. Section 6-827 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u201c\u00a7 6-827. Applicability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">This part applies to all potential bases of liability for alleged injury or loss to a person caused by the ingestion of lead by a person at risk in an affected property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Section 6-828 appears to grant immunity from personal injury suits to an owner, if that owner has complied with the statute, unless certain notice is given to the owner and the owner has been given the opportunity to make a qualified offer. Section 6-828 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u201c\u00a7 6-828. Failure to give notice to owner in compliance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">(a) Applicability.\u2014This section applies to an owner of an affected property who has, with respect to the affected property, complied with the applicable requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 6-811, 6-812, 6-815, 6-817, and 6-819 of this subtitle, and has sent to the tenant the notices required by \u00a7\u00a7 6-820 and 6-823 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A person may not bring an action against an owner of an affected property for damages arising from alleged injury or loss to a person at risk caused by the ingestion of lead by a person at risk that is first documented by a test for EBL of 25 ug/dl [micrograms per deciliter] or more performed between February 24, 1996 and February 23, 2001, inclusive, or 20 ug/dl or more performed between February 24, 2001 and February 23,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>2006, inclusive, or 15 ug/dl or more performed on or after February 24, 2006, unless the owner has been given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">(1) Written notice from any person that the elevated blood level of a person at risk is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">(1) Greater than or equal to 25 ug/dl as first documented by a test for EBL performed between February 24, 1996 and February 23, 2001, inclusive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">(ii) Between February 24, 2001 and February 23, 2006, inclusive, an EBL greater than or equal to 20 ug/dl as first documented by a test for EBL performed between February 24, 2001 and February 23, 2006, inclusive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">(iii) On or after February 24, 2006, an EBL greater than or equal to 15 ug/dl as first documented by a test for EBL performed on or after February 24, 2006; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">(2) An opportunity to make a qualified offer under \u00a7 6-831 of this subtitle.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">As the present case was resolved in the Circuit Court by a grant of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, \u201c \u2018we must review the facts, and all inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bednar v.

Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 248, 863 A.2d 297, 299 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This case began in July 2002 when ZiTashia Jackson and her mother, Tameka Jackson, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint against the Packman Co., Jacob Packman &amp; Sons, L.L.C., Elliot Packman, and Charles A. Skirven, Trustee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The case involved two separate pieces of residential, rental property in Baltimore City, one of which was 1233 Cliftview Avenue and the other was 706 Mt. Holly Street. The complaint alleged that both properties were owned, controlled, managed, supervised or maintained by the defendants. The plaintiffs sought damages based on ZiTashia\u2019s claimed severe and permanent brain injuries allegedly resulting from her ingestion of lead-based paint at 1233 Cliftview Avenue and 706 Mt. Holly Street. The complaint sounded in negligence as well as alleged deceptive practices in violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.VoL), Title 13 of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ZiTashia Jackson was born on January 12, 1997, and, when she was one year old, ZiTashia and her mother moved to 1233 Cliftview Avenue. The Cliftview Avenue property was actually rented from the defendants by two of Tameka\u2019s maternal aunts, although the lease listed ZiTashia as one of the children residing at the property. When her aunts executed the lease for the Cliftview property, they did not note on the lease any defective conditions such as chipping, flaking or peeling paint. Nevertheless, ZiTashia\u2019s mother, Tameka Jackson, in an affidavit filed in the Circuit Court, stated that, when she and her daughter first moved to the Cliftview property to live with her aunts, there was chipping and flaking paint on both the wooden exterior window frames and on the wooden interior window frames. Tameka further said that \u201c[t]here was also chipping and flaking paint on the floors and, every time I swept, the paint would come off.\u201d She stated that, \u201cfw]hen we lived at Cliftview Ave., my daughter had a lot of hand to mouth activity, and she put everything in her mouth.\u201d The affidavit also represented that Tameka \u201cwitnessed my aunt ... call the landlord to complain about chipping paint ... [but the] landlord never repaired the chipping paint while we lived at 1233 Cliftview Ave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 move to 1233 Cliftview Avenue, the defendants filed a certificate with the Maryland Department of the Environment which asserted that the Cliftview Property received a \u201cFull Risk Reduction\u201d on February 19, 1997. Moreover, the tenants stated that, before moving into the Cliftview Avenue property, the defendants represented to the tenants that the premises were lead free. Nonetheless, while residing at the house on Cliftview Avenue, ZiTashia was lead-poisoned. She had a blood lead level of 21 ug/dl on October 22,1998,16 ug/dl on November 18,1998,15 ug/dl on February 5, 1999, and 9 ug/dl on January 21, 2000. For the years at issue in this case (1997,1998,1999 and 2000), ZiTashia\u2019s blood-lead level never reached 25 ug/dl, which is the level set forth in \u00a7 6-828(b) applicable to those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On January 29, 1999, Tameka Jackson and ZiTashia\u2019s father, Dia Lawrence, signed a lease for a month-to-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tenancy at 706 Mt. Holly Street. Tameka and ZiTashia Jackson moved from the Cliftview Avenue property to 706 Mt. Holly Street on February 1, 1999. Earlier, on January 8, 1999, the Mt. Holly property had received a \u201cFull Risk Reduction\u201d and inspection, and the inspector determined that the property complied with the standards required under the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act. Also, before executing the lease for the Mt. Holly property, Tameka Jackson and Dia Lawrence were required to inspect the property and write down any defective conditions. They did not note on the lease that there was chipping, flaking or peeling paint, although they did list ZiTashia as a child residing at the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Tameka Jackson, by affidavit, represented that the Mt. Holly Street residence had \u201cchipping paint around all of the windows, on my daughter\u2019s room walls and windowsills and in the playroom.\u201d She also stated that, before she signed the lease, the defendants\u2019 rental agent told Tameka that \u201c706 Mt. Holly Street was lead free.\u201d Tameka further said in the affidavit that, while residing at Mt. Holly Street, she saw ZiTashia \u201cput paint chips in her mouth.\u201d Tameka stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMl\">\u201cI called the rental office and complained about the paint about a month after I moved to 706 Mt. Holly St. I told the woman who answered the phone that there was chipping and flaking paint on the wall and windows and that my daughter was picking at it. She said they would send someone out, but no one ever came to fix the chipping and flaking paint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Turning to the matter of the defendant\u2019s compliance with the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act, the only issue that has been raised in this case concerns Part III, \u00a7\u00a7 6-811 through 6-813, which is the requirement that affected property be registered and that the registration be renewed and updated \u201con or before December 31 of each year\u201d (\u00a7 6-812(a)(1)). There was in this case a dispute over the basic facts regarding the registrations of both rental properties involved. Because of this dispute, the Circuit Court denied in part the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Thereafter, the parties entered a stipulation of the facts concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>registration. It was stipulated that, for the years in question, the registration renewals were mailed by the defendants on or before December 31 of each year but were received by the Department of the Environment at various dates during the following Januarys.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In the Circuit Court, in support of their motions for summary judgment, the defendants contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that they had complied with the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act, and, therefore, they were immune from suit under the immunity provisions of the Act. With respect to a qualified offer, the defendants pointed out that they did not receive written notice of ZiTashia\u2019s elevated blood lead level as required by the Act, and thus they had no opportunity to make a qualified offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The plaintiffs, in opposing summary judgment, argued in the Circuit Court that the Act\u2019s grant of immunity was unconstitutional on several grounds. They claimed that the immunity provisions of the Act violated their rights to equal protection of the laws and due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that the immunity provisions deprived them of their right to jury trial in violation of the Seventh Amendment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Articles 5 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that the grant of immunity from suit was inconsistent with the separation of powers requirement in Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, and that the immunity sections were in violation of Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights. The plaintiffs also asserted that the defendants had not complied with the registration requirements of the Act, as the annual renewals of registration for the years in question were not received by the Department of the Environment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>December 31 of each year but were received in January of the next year. Finally, the plaintiffs argued that the immunity provisions of the Act were inapplicable if a child\u2019s blood lead level was below the amounts set forth in \u00a7 6-828. <em>See </em>footnote 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Circuit Court granted in part the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and filed an opinion holding that the immunity provisions of the Act were constitutional and were applicable \u201cfor all\u201d blood lead levels. As previously mentioned, because there was a dispute over the basic facts concerning the defendants\u2019 renewals of registration, the court only granted in part the motion for summary judgment. Later, after the parties entered a stipulation of the facts relating to the registration renewals, the Circuit Court granted in full the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court held that the registration renewals were timely because they were mailed on December 31 of each year. The brief final judgment order stated \u201cthat judgment is entered in favor of the Defendants as to all counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, making the same arguments that had been advanced in the Circuit Court. The intermediate appellate court initially rendered an unreported opinion disposing of the case, but, upon a request from one of the parties, decided to report the opinion. <em>Jackson v. Dackman, </em>181 Md.App. 546, 956 A.2d 861 (2008). The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the Circuit Court on the constitutional issues and on the application of the immunity provisions to a child whose elevated blood lead level was below the amounts specified in \u00a7 6-828. Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals held that the defendants \u201cdid not fully comply with the Statute and, thus, are not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Dackman, supra, </em>181 Md. App. at 577, 956 A.2d at 879. The appellate court held that, under the statute, the annual renewals of registration had to be <em>received </em>by the Department of Environment on or before December 31 of each year. The Court of Special Appeals concluded (181 Md.App. at 581, 956 A.2d at 882): \u201cwe reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the trial court\u2019s decision and hold that the appellees did not fully comply with the Statute.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The plaintiffs filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the same issues which they raised in the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal argument, however, was that the Act\u2019s immunity provisions violate Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights. In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 petition claimed that the Court of Special Appeals erred by inserting into its opinion the \u201cprospective only\u201d language. The defendants filed a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the registration renewal provision. This Court granted both the petition and the cross-petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>As stated at the beginning of this opinion, we shall hold that the immunity provisions in the Act are invalid under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Consequently, we need not and shall not reach the other issues dealt with by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides:</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">\u201cArticle 19.

While the United States Constitution contains no comparable provision, today the constitutions of 39 states have clauses similar to Article 19. These provisions, often referred to as \u2018Remedy Clauses\u2019 or \u2018Open Courts Clauses\u2019 or \u2018Access to Courts Clauses,\u2019 are based on Chapter 40 of the Magna Carta or, more particularly, Lord Coke\u2019s interpretation of Chapter 40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For a review of the history, purpose, interpretation, and application of such clauses, <em>see, e.g., Smothers v.

We continued in <em>Piselli </em>to set forth some of the specific applications of Article 19 (371 Md. at 205-206, 808 A.2d at 518, footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201cWe have held that \u2018[i]t is a \u201cbasic tenet, expressed in Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that a plaintiff injured by unconstitutional state action should have a remedy to redress the wrong.\u201d \u2019 <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. [604] at 644, 805 A.2d [1061] at 1061 [ (2002) ], quoting <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 105, 660 A.2d 447, 464-465 (1995). <em>See, e.g., Robinson v.

Where a person clearly has a right to money or property under a statute or common law principle, and no statute specifically provides for a remedy, Article 19 guarantees a common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>remedy to enforce the right. <em>Robinson v. Bunch, supra, </em>867 Md. at 444, 788 A.2d at 644. The principle that one has a Maryland constitutional right to judicial review of adjudicatory administrative decisions is based, in part, upon Article 19. <em>State v. Board of Education, supra, </em>346 Md. [633] at 647, 697 A.2d [1334] at 1341 [ (1997) ]. <em>See Board of License Comm. v. Corridor, </em>361 Md. 403, 415, 761 A.2d 916, 922 (2000). Article 19 ordinarily precludes retrospective legislation abrogating accrued causes of action. <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. at 645, 805 A.2d at 1085.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201cApart from these types of specific holdings with respect to Article 19, the constitutional provision generally prohibits unreasonable restrictions upon traditional remedies or access to the courts but allows the Legislature, pursuant to its authority to change the common law or statutory provisions, to enact reasonable restrictions upon traditional remedies or access to the courts. <em>Johnson v. Maryland State Police, </em>331 Md. 285, 297, 628 A.2d 162, 168 (1993)....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Many restrictions upon judicial remedies, challenged under Article 19, have been upheld by this Court, while others have been invalidated. Thus, the application of traditional or well-established immunities from suit has been held not to violate Article 19. <em>See, e.g., Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 139 n. 17, 872 A.2d 1, 21 n. 17 (2005) (immunity of local governments from tort actions based upon \u201cgovernmental\u201d functions); <em>Renko v.

Moreover, with regard to actions not based upon a violation of constitutional rights, Article 19 may, under some circumstances, preclude immunizing from suit both the government and the government employee involved. <em>See Lee v.

Montgomery County, supra, </em>386 Md. at 136-139, 872 A.2d at 20-21 (upholding the 180-day notice provision in the Local Government Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article); <em>Attorney General v.

We have taken the position that Article 19 permits the Legislature to impose a reasonable limit upon non-economic damages recoverable in tort cases. <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 366, 601 A.2d 102, 114 (1992). We have also held \u201cthat Article 19 does not require the recognition of a new tort cause of action which has never previously been recognized in Maryland.\u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 206, 808 A.2d at 519; <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>358 Md. 113, 128, 747 A.2d 617, 625 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Court has decided that 5, 10, and 20-year statutes of repose, for certain tort actions, \u201care not unreasonable restrictions upon remedies and access to the courts, and thus do not violate Article 19, under circumstances where the injured claimants were adults.\u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 207-208, 808 A.2d at 519 (emphasis deleted). <em>See Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 703-705, 501 A.2d 27, 34-35 (1985); <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 359-360, 499 A.2d 178, 188-189 (1985). On the other hand, in the <em>Piselli </em>case, 371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d at 524, we held that a statute of repose, running <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>against a minor child during his or her period of minority, and \u201cbarring an injured child\u2019s medical malpractice claim before the child is able to bring an action is an unreasonable restriction upon the child\u2019s right to a remedy and access to the courts guaranteed by Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In addition, as this Court pointed out in <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 446-447, 788 A.2d 636, 645 (2002), \u201cthe Legislature may <em>ordinarily </em>substitute a statutory remedy ... for a common law remedy -without violating Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights or other Maryland constitutional provisions.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See also Lee v. Cline, supra, </em>384 Md. at 265-266, 863 A.2d at 309-310; <em>Ashton v. Brown, supra, </em>339 Md. at 104-108, 660 A.2d at 464-466; <em>Maryland Aggregates v. State, </em>337 Md. 658, 675-682, 655 A.2d 886, 895-898, <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1111, 115 S.Ct. 1965, 131 L.Ed.2d 856 (1995); <em>Johnson v.

Co., </em>156 Md. 482, 144 A. 696 (1929); <em>Solvuca v. Ryan &amp; Reilly Co., </em>131 Md. 265, 101 A. 710 (1917). The issue, under our Article 19 jurisprudence, generally is whether the abolition of the common law remedy and substitution of a statutory remedy was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"ARep\">The personal injury action filed in the present case, based upon the defendants\u2019 alleged violation of a duty under a statute or ordinance \u201c \u2018designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff,\u201d\u2019 has long been recognized under \u201cwell-settled Maryland common law....\u201d <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 472, 489, 869 A.2d 837, 840, 851 (2005). <em>See Brooks v. Lewin Realty, </em>378 Md. 70, 78, 835 A.2d 616, 620-621 (2003). It is the type of remedy protected by Article 19. Thus, any restriction upon that remedy must be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Preliminarily, it should be noted that the immunity granted to defendants by \u00a7\u00a7 6-828, 6-835, 6-836, and 6-836.1 of the Act is not, in any respect, a traditional or well-established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>immunity from personal injury actions. Instead, the immunity given by the Act to defendants in actions based on permanent brain injuries to children, allegedly caused by the defendants\u2019 negligence, did not exist prior to 1994 when the Act was first enacted. Consequently, the Article 19 holdings in <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>386 Md. 104, 872 A.2d 1, <em>Renko v. McLean, supra, </em>346 Md. 464, 697 A.2d 468, and <em>Johnson v. Maryland State Police, supra, </em>331 Md. 285, 628 A.2d 162, do not support the grant of immunity in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In holding that the immunity granted by the Act did not violate Article 19, the Court of Special Appeals relied on the principle <em>(Jackson v. Dackman, supra, </em>181 Md.App. at 568, 956 A.2d at 874)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cthat \u2018the Legislature may ordinarily substitute a statutory remedy ... for a common law remedy without violating Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights.\u2019 <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 446-47, 788 A.2d 636 (2002).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Unlike the substituted remedy in the <em>Robinson </em>case, however, the substituted remedy under the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act for a permanently brain damaged child is totally inadequate and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The only remedy provided by the Act, in substitution for a personal injury action, is a qualified offer by the owners which is accepted by a \u201cperson at risk, or a parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a person at risk,\u201d (\u00a7 6-834). In the instant case, however, no qualified offer was made and, presumably, was not required to be made. Where no qualified offer is made, the plaintiffs have no remedy under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Where a qualified offer is made, the maximum amount payable under the offer is $17,000, consisting of \u201c$7,500 for all medically necessary treatments\u201d and \u201c$9,500 for relocation benefits,\u201d (\u00a7 6-840(a)(l) and (2)). \u201cRelocation benefits\u201d include \u201c(i) Relocation expenses; (ii) A rent subsidy ...; and (iii) Incidental expenses which may be incurred by the household, such as transportation and child care expenses.\u201d \u00a7 6-840(a)(2). Moreover, \u00a7 6-840(b) provides that \u201c[a]ll payments under a qualified offer ... shall be paid to the provider of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>service, except that payment of incidental expenses ... may be paid directly to the person at risk, or in the case of a child, to the parent or the legal guardian____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">For a child who is found to be permanently brain damaged from ingesting lead paint, proximately caused by the landlord\u2019s negligence, the maximum amount of compensation under a qualified offer is minuscule. It is almost no compensation. Thus, the remedy which the Act substitutes for a traditional personal injury action results in either no compensation (where no qualified offer is made or where a qualified offer is rejected) or drastically inadequate compensation (where such qualified offer is made and accepted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The Act has no exception to the owner\u2019s immunity in the situation where an injured child reaches the age of majority and attempts to bring, in his or her own name, a personal injury action against the owner. On the contrary, \u00a7 6-827 of the Act broadly states that the immunity \u201capplies to all potential bases of liability for alleged injury or loss to a person caused by the ingestion of lead by a person at risk in an affected property.\u201d Consequently, this case is somewhat analogous to <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d at 524, involving a statute of repose which ran against a minor child during the period of minority and thus barred a medical malpractice action by the child when he or she reached the age of majority. We held that \u201cbarring an injured child\u2019s medical malpractice claim before the child is able to bring an action is an unreasonable restriction upon the child\u2019s right to a remedy and access to the courts guaranteed by Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">A grant of immunity and a statute of repose are, of course, different. Nevertheless, when no adequate remedy is substituted for the grant of immunity, both the statute of repose in <em>Piselli </em>and the grant of immunity in the present case leave a negligently injured child without a remedy. What was said in <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d at 524, quoting <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 695, 697 A.2d 1358, 1366 (1997), is also applicable here: \u201c We cannot countenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a result that would leave the only innocent victim ... uncompensated for his or her injuries....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We hold, therefore, that the immunity provisions of the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act are invalid under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Although the immunity provisions of the Act are invalid, they are severable from those remaining portions of the Act which can be given effect. Maryland Code (1957, 2011 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 23, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u201c\u00a7 23. Severability of provisions of statutes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">The provisions of all statutes enacted after July 1, 1973 are severable unless the statute specifically provides that its provisions are not severable. The finding by a court that some provision of a statute is unconstitutional and void does not affect the validity of the remaining portions of that statute, unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions alone are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Ch. 114 of the Acts of 1994, which enacted the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act, contained no language which \u201cprovides that its provisions are not severable.\u201d Moreover, numerous remaining portions of the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act are \u201c[ \u00a1capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>See Migdal v. State, </em>358 Md. 308, 323-324, 747 A.2d 1225, 1233 (2000), discussing and applying Article 1, \u00a7 23. It has been commented that many states have reduction of lead poisoning statutes without immunity from suit provisions. T. Harris and L. Smith, <em>Tori Reform Reform: Maryland\u2019s Lead Poisoning Law Needs Overhaul, </em>12 U. Balt. Journal of Environmental Law 27, 40 (2004). <em>Cf. Ashton v. Brown, supra, </em>339 Md. at 93-96, 660 A.2d at 459-460, illustrating the type of statute where the valid portions cannot be operative, in accordance with legislative intent, without the invalid portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Even in the absence of a severability statute, \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption that if a portion of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>enactment is found to be invalid, the intent is that such portion be severed.\u201d <em>Board v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 245, 608 A.2d 1222, 1234 (1992). Under our case law, the principal test is whether \u201c \u2018the dominant purpose of an enactment may largely be carried out notwithstanding the [enactment\u2019s] partial invalidity,\u2019 \u201d <em>Board v. Smallwood, supra, </em>327 Md. at 246, 608 A.2d at 1235, quoting <em>O.C. Taxpayers v. Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 601, 375 A.2d 541, 550 (1977). As pointed out earlier in this opinion, \u00a7 6-802 of the Act states: \u201cThe purpose of this subtitle is to reduce the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, while maintaining the stock of available affordable rental housing.\u201d Granting immunity to landlords is <em>not </em>referred to in \u00a7 6-802. Accordingly, the dominant purpose of the Act can be given effect without the invalid immunity provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENTS AND CROSS-PETITIONERS, THE DACKMAN COMPANY, et. al.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">.

The Attorney General's \"Office of Counsel to the General Assembly\" responded by a letter dated March 4, 1994, taking the position that, if the owner is in compliance with the statute and \"receives notice that a child has [an] elevated blood level,\u201d and if \u201cthe owner ... makes a qualified offer,\u201d the owner would have immunity from suit whether the qualified offer is accepted or rejected.

Immediately after the sentence quoted above in the text, the Court of Special Appeals, in the reported version of its opinion, but not in the earlier unreported version, said: \"This portion of the decision is prospective only.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>What the Court of Special Appeals meant by this statement is not at all clear. At any rate, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision regarding compliance with the statute, even if we were to uphold it, is not the type of decision which, under Maryland law, would be prospective only. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the registration provisions in the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act \"was not novel and did not overrule any prior decisions....\" <em>Walker v.

Thus, \"no question regarding a \u2018prospective only' application ... was presented.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 640, 684 A.2d at 433. <em>See, e.g., Houghton v.
