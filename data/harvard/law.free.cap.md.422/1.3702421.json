The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that Petitioners committed those offenses on June 7, 2005. Both Petitioners noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That Court consolidated the appeals, and affirmed the judgments of conviction in an unreported opinion. Petitioners then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in which they requested that this Court address four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">1. Where two defendants with identical interests are jointly tried and where one defendant objects to remarks in closing argument that are equally damaging to both, should the objection of one defendant be deemed to preserve the issue as to both defendants, and, if it does not, should this Court recognize plain error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">2. Should the petitioners\u2019 convictions be reversed in light of the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial remarks during closing argument when she (1) denigrated the role of defense counsel by, among other things, \u201ccautioning]\u201d the jury \u201cthat unlike the State, the Defense\u2019s specific role in this case is to get their Defendants off\u2019; (2) improperly appealed to the jury to protect the community by saying \u201cenough\u201d; and (3) introduced the specter of witness intimidation into the case by suggesting to the jury that a key witness had moved because she and her family had been threatened by one of the defendants despite the fact that there was no evidence to that effect in the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>3. Where the jury sent a note during deliberations which asked if it could have a tape of the testimony of a key witness and which asked if the same witness had given a recorded pre-trial statement, did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the petitioners and their counsel about the note and to provide the jury with a response to the note was harmless error in light of the fact that the trial court told the jury, in response to a different note, that the jury had all of the evidence in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">4. Where a witness testified three times that Mr. Smith had been incarcerated, did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that a mistrial was not warranted because defense counsel had invited the error by asking the witness whether she knew Mr. Smith\u2019s mother and when it held that any prejudice Mr. Smith suffered was minimal given the context of her testimony and the \u201cstrong evidence\u201d against him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We granted that petition. 415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 2 and question 4. In light of these answers, the issues presented in question 1 and question 3 are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">We hold that (1) the trial court erroneously overruled Petitioner Beads\u2019 objections to improper prosecutorial argument, (2) the trial court erroneously concluded that the cross-examination of Petitioner Smith\u2019s trial counsel \u201copened\u201d the door to testimony that Smith had been incarcerated, and (3) because the trial court failed to take any corrective action in response to the improper arguments and inadmissible evidence, we are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that these erroneous rulings were harmless. We shall therefore direct that these cases be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">On June 7, 2005, an utterly senseless episode of violence occurred in front of 3832 Roland View Avenue in Baltimore City. During a gun battle, one or more persons fired shots into a crowd, killing Mr. Lawrence Johnson, and wounding two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>other victims, Jeremy Drake and Ronald McCuteheon. Although no one present at the scene of the shooting identified either Petitioner as the shooter, each Petitioner\u2019s criminal agency was established by the testimony of two witnesses\u2014 Kelly Rae Miller, and Darren Buie\u2014who observed and spoke with Petitioners when they entered Mr. Buie\u2019s residence shortly after the shooting, as well as by ballistics evidence presented by a firearms examiner who testified that bullets recovered from the crime scene were fired by someone (1) using the very handgun, a 9 mm Glock, seized from a taxicab in which Petitioner Beads was riding, and (2) using a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson found to be \u201cconsistent with\u201d the one seized from under a bed in which Petitioner Smith had been sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The following transpired during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">[Prosecutor]: Cyrus Beads and Joseph Omar Smith went to the 3800 block of Roland View Avenue and they went there hunting. They went there armed at night and they hid, and they ambushed these people who were standing around drinking and singing old Temptations songs, and as a result, Mr. Johnson, 44 years old, a father, a grandfather, a working man, a husband, someone who had nothing to do with the business that these men set out to take care of, is dead and today, ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for someone to say, \u201cEnough. Enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">[Counsel for Smith]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Petitioner Smith\u2019s trial counsel moved for a mistrial after the Circuit Court overruled his objection to evidence that Petitioner Smith had been \u201cincarcerated.\u201d The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following discussion of this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">At trial, Roslyn Peterson [the deceased victim\u2019s wife] testified that on June 6th, the day before the shooting, she saw a blue station wagon at the bottom of her block. There were two men in the car, and one of them had a gun. Peterson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>did not identify the men and could only testify that one of them had long plaits. In an effort to demonstrate that Smith was not one of the two men Peterson saw in the car, defense counsel inquired as to whether she knew Smith and his mother. The following colloquy occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: Do you know a woman by the name of Porscha Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. I assume when you\u2019re saying \u201che,\u201d you\u2019re referring to the gentleman, Joseph Omar Smith\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">[Peterson]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]:\u2014sitting next to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">[Peterson]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: This is Porscha Smith\u2019s son; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">[Peterson]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: You know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">[Peterson]: I didn\u2019t know it was his (sic) son during the time. I guess, yes. After I found out that that was his (sic) son\u2014I haven\u2019t seen him since he was a little boy. He was incarcerated. I hadn\u2019t seen him since he came home. So I don\u2019t know how he looked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-14\">[Peterson]:\u2014after he came from incarcerated (sic).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-15\">THE COURT: Overruled. You opened it. You opened it. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-16\">[Peterson]: He was incarcerated. I hadn\u2019t seen him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-17\">THE COURT: Excuse me, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-18\">[Smith\u2019s Counsel]: Objection. May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">THE COURT: No. No. You opened it. She gave you an answer. Now, ma\u2019am, please only respond to the questions. No outbursts. I know how upset you are, but no outbursts. Next question. [Smith\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, may we approach? I would like to make a motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>At that point, the parties approached the bench, and Smith moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACK\">I think that you opened up unwittingly, I think, a line of questioning with respect to how long has it been since she saw him. She said she knew him when he was a little boy\u2014 I don\u2019t know how little\u2014and hasn\u2019t seen him since and she mentioned he was away, that he was incarcerated. Now, I know that\u2019s a little tenuous, but I don\u2019t think it warrants a mistrial motion being granted. I\u2019ll deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Immediately thereafter, counsel for Smith asked the court to strike Peterson\u2019s testimony and instruct the jury to disregard it, but the court denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The following transpired at the end of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">[Prosecutor]: You\u2019re now going to hear from the Defense attorneys, both of whom are fine attorneys. I caution you, that unlike the State, the Defense\u2019s specific role in this case is to get their Defendants off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">[Counsel for Smith]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">[Prosecutor]: It is their job, and they do it well, to throw up some smoke, to lob a grenade, to confuse. That doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t important and that you shouldn\u2019t listen carefully. But even when all that is said and done, I believe that you will conclude, as you must conclude in this \u2022case, that Cyrus Beads and Joseph Omar Smith conspired to murder, and did in fact murder, Lawrence Johnson, conspired to murder and did in fact attempt to murder, Jeremy Drake. Did conspire to murder and did in fact attempt to murder Pascal Ryan [McCutcheon], And I thank you sincerely for your attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The following transpired during the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">[Prosecutor]: I don\u2019t think it[ ]s right to call witnesses who come forward in a murder trial in Baltimore City names, like liar, or junkie, or militant. There are many, many reasons why witnesses do not come forward\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Objection Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">[Prosecutor]:\u2014in murder trials immediately. One of them is concern for safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">[Counsel for Beads]: Objection Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">[Prosecutor]: In this case, concern for family as well. My son, I know his entire family. We have moved, we live in Allegheny County now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call them names; convicted felon, liar, junkie, meal ticket. Why don\u2019t we go a little further and say what we\u2019re really thinking. [Prosecutor]: Another reason why witnesses do not come forward is because they don\u2019t want to be subjected to the public humiliation of cross examination. They don\u2019t want to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">[Counsel for Beads]: Objection Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">[Prosecutor]:\u2014submitted to the public humiliation of sitting on the witness stand and speaking into this microphone about all of the mistakes and craziness of their lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-13\">[Prosecutor]: Mr. Buie wasn\u2019t put in this bad spot by Kelly Miller, or by Detective Juan Diaz. Joey Smith brought this to him, to his lady Mend. And Joey Smith brought to him Cyrus Beads. That\u2019s why he\u2019s in this tough spot and for no other reason. And I would suggest that to this day he\u2019s trying to protect that boy who both Kelly and Darren say they had not done anything but try to help, to give him a place to live when he had nowhere to go. To give his girlfriend a place to live when she had nowhere to go. To help him get a job when he had no source of income, that they\u2014no employment. They lent him money. They did nothing but help this boy. Their words, not mine. So I show you this to remind you what this is about and to say to you enough. Say enough. Like some of the courageous women in this case said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>[Counsel for Smith]: Objection Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The jury convicted Petitioner Beads of the attempted second degree murders of Mr. McCutcheon and Mr. Drake, the first degree assaults of those two victims, conspiracy to murder those two victims, two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and three counts of carrying a handgun. The jury convicted Petitioner Smith of the second degree murder of Mr. Johnson, the attempted second degree murders of Mr. McCutcheon and Mrs. Drake, the first degree assault of Mr. Drake, conspiracy to murder Mr. McCutcheon and Mrs. Drake, three counts of use of handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and three counts of carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Petitioners argue that the trial court erroneously overruled objections to the above quoted unfairly prejudicial comments made by the prosecutor during opening statement, closing argument, and rebuttal argument. We agree that the comments at issue were inappropriate. It is well settled, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">[n]ot every improper remark [made by a prosecutor during closing argument], however, necessarily mandates reversal, and \u201cwhat exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends on the facts in each case.\u201d We have said that \u201creversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d This determination of whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were prejudicial or simply rhetorical flourish lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. On review, an appellate court should not reverse the trial court unless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 430-31, 722 A.2d 887, 902 (1999) (internal citations omitted). We must determine whether the erroneous overruling of the objections constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments about the role of defense counsel, although inappropriate, are unlikely to have \u201cmisled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cappeals to jurors to convict a defendant in order to preserve the safety or quality of their communities are improper and prejudicial.\u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 225, 734 A.2d 199, 209 (1999). The \u201csay Enough!\u201d exhortation implored the jurors to consider their own personal safety and therefore violated the prohibition against the \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Although the Court of Special Appeals did not hold that the \u201csay Enough!\u201d exhortation was appropriate, either in opening statement or in closing argument, that Court provided the following explanation for its conclusion that this exhortation was not so outrageous as to require a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">In <em>Hill, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments urging jurors to consider their own interests and send a message to protect their community were wholly improper and presumptively prejudicial. Unlike the remarks at issue in the case before us, the arguments in <em>Hill </em>were not isolated, but rather pervaded the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">In <em>Holmes [v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 518, 705 A.2d 118 (1998) ] the prosecutor argued in summation that \u201cThis is not about jail time. It\u2019s about a day of reckoning, the day of accountability, the day we say no, Mr. Holmes, no longer will we allow you to spread that poison on the streets.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>119 Md.App. at 526-27[, 705 A.2d at 122-123]. We held that the \u201cwe say no\u201d comments urged the jurors to consider their own interests and violated the prohibition against the \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument and we trusted that those comments would not be repeated when the case was tried again, as a new trial was granted on another issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>In the case before us, the prosecutor\u2019s statements that it was time for someone to say enough do not rise to the level of an improper appeal to protect the community, nor did they have the level of severity of the arguments made in either <em>Hill </em>or <em>Holmes. </em>Thus, reversal is not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax\">We are persuaded that reversal would not be required if the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from this argument had been removed by the prompt and decisive action of the Circuit Court, but the record shows that the Circuit Court erroneously overruled the objections interposed by Petitioner Beads\u2019 trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">As to Petitioners\u2019 argument that they were unfairly prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument, which (in the words of their brief) \u201cintroduced the specter of witness intimidation into the case,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">We find no error in the prosecutor\u2019s arguments because they were made in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the case rested solely upon the testimony of two convicted felons, the implied argument that there were other, more credible witnesses that were not called, and references to Miller and Buie as felons, junkies, liars, on parole and \u201cmeal ticket.\u201d (Tr. 6/19/09 at 57-61) <em>See Mitchell, </em>408 Md. at 388 and 392-93 [,969 A.2d at 1001 and 1003] (holding that a prosecutor may reasonably reply to arguments made by defense counsel that open the door to .such a response). In addition, testimony was adduced at trial that Drake, McCutcheon, and [Robert] England were not cooperative with [the investigating officers]. In light of the testimony and argument presented, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were properly based upon facts in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We hold that, because neither of Petitioners\u2019 trial counsel made an improper closing argument, the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine is not applicable to the unfairly prejudicial comments made during the State\u2019s rebuttal argument. \u201c[I]t is evident that the \u2018invited response\u2019 doctrine applies only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>defense counsel first makes an improper argument.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 382, 969 A.2d 989, 997 (2009). Petitioners\u2019 trial counsel were entitled to attack the credibility of Miller and Buie without \u201copening the door\u201d to a rebuttal argument implying that the shootings were witnessed by persons of good character who were afraid to cooperate with the investigators. Moreover, the evidence indicated that fear of self incrimination\u2014rather than fear of either Petitioner\u2014 was the reason why Drake, McCutcheon and England were not cooperative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court should have sustained Petitioner Beads\u2019 objection to the improper rebuttal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 872 A.2d 25 (2005), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">When assessing whether reversible error occurs when improper statements are made during closing argument, a reviewing court may consider several factors, including the severity of the remarks, the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice, and the weight of the evidence against the accused. <em>U.S. v. Melendez, </em>57 F.3d 238, 241 (2nd Cir.1995); <em>see also Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 232, 596 A.2d 1024, 1038 (1991) (finding that \u201c[i]n determining whether reversible error occurred, an appellate court must take into account \u2018(1) the closeness of the ease, 2) the centrality of the issue affected by the error, and 3) the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\"><em>Id. </em>at 159, 872 A.2d at 33. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The record clearly shows that the case at bar is not one in which the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from an improper argument has been removed by a ruling that \u201csustained\u201d a timely objection and/or by a \u201ccurative\u201d instruction. Moreover, because the Circuit Court erroneously <em>overruled </em>objections to the improper arguments that created the danger of unfair prejudice, those erroneous rulings may well have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>added greater impact to the improper arguments. As the Court of Special Appeals noted in <em>Curry v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 250, 256, 458 A.2d 474, 478 (1983), while holding that an \u201cimproper argument\u201d objection is timely if made promptly after the argument has concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">If [appellants\u2019 trial counsel] had objected at the time the remark was made, they might have underscored the prosecutor\u2019s comments and perhaps added greater impact to those remarks. Additionally, they ran the risk of the court\u2019s overruling the objections, thus emphasizing to the jury the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the comments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 7 A.3d 84 (2010), while holding that the petitioner was entitled to a new trial as a result of unfairly prejudicial prosecutorial argument, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">We must determine, upon our \u201cown independent review of the record,\u201d whether we are \u201cable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. [148] at 164, 950 A.2d [125] at 134 [ (2008) ] <em>(quoting Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 7 A.3d at 101. In our \u201charmless error\u201d analysis, we must consider the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the improper comments. <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 600, 886 A.2d 876, 893 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">As to \u201cthe closeness of the case,\u201d the case at bar is not one in which the State\u2019s evidence was overwhelming. Petitioner Beads\u2019 fingerprints were not found on the Glock seized from the taxicab in which he was riding. The firearms expert was unable to conclude that the Smith and Wesson seized from under Petitioner Smith\u2019s bed was the Smith and Wesson that fired any bullet recovered at the crime scene. Ms. Miller and Mr. Buie were vulnerable to impeachment that attacked their character for veracity as well as their motivation to testify for the State. Under these circumstances, we are unable to declare that we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the erroneous rulings preserved for appellate review by Petitioner Beads\u2019 trial counsel \u201cin no way influenced the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Circuit Court erred in concluding that cross-examination of Petitioner Smith\u2019s trial counsel \u201copened\u201d the door to Ms. Peterson\u2019s testimony that Petitioner Smith had been \u201cincarcerated.\u201d Although the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted \u201cthat the denial of the motion to strike Peterson\u2019s testimony was not appealed,\u201d the fact that this motion was denied is of significant consequence. While it is often stated that appellate courts apply the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review to determine whether a motion for mistrial should have been granted, that standard is not applicable when the record shows that the trial court did not exercise discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In the case at bar, the record shows that the trial court (1) erroneously concluded that the cross-examination of Ms. Peterson \u201copened\u201d the door to her non-responsive answer, and (2) denied the mistrial motion based upon that erroneous conclusion. To the extent that the above quoted bench conference permits the inference that the trial court did exercise discretion, such an inference would be unreasonable in light of the fact that the trial court thereafter denied Petitioner Smith\u2019s \u201cmotion to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The party who is questioning a witness is entitled to a ruling \u201cstriking\u201d a non-responsive answer merely because the answer is non-responsive. <em>Gas Equip. Corp. v. Baldwin, </em>152 Md. 321, 325, 136 A. 644, 646 (1927). It is clear from the above quoted portion of Ms. Peterson\u2019s cross-examination that her answer to the question \u201cYou know him?\u201d was \u201cnon-responsive and could not have been anticipated from the form of the question.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Slye, </em>137 Md. 87, 99, 111 A. 814, 817 (1920). In that case, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">The rule requiring objections to testimony to be made promptly is for the purpose of facilitating rather than retarding the administration of justice, and should receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>reasonable interpretation, and even when the objection comes after a question has been answered, if it appears that the delay was inadvertent and unintentional, and what under all the circumstances reasonable diligence was exercised, or that no sufficient opportunity had been given to make it sooner, the objection will be considered to have been taken in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 111 A. at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In <em>Colter v. State, </em>297 Md. 423, 466 A.2d 1286 (1983), and <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 535 A.2d 455 (1988), this Court ordered new trials on the ground that the trial court did not exercise discretion in resolving an issue that required the exercise of discretion. In <em>Colter, </em>the trial court erroneously \u201capplied Rule 741 as a mandatory rule excluding the testimony of an undisclosed alibi witness upon the failure of the defendant to comply with the notice requirement.\u201d 297 Md. at 430, 466 A.2d at 1290. In <em>Watson, </em>the trial court erroneously concluded that, because attempted rape is an \u201cinfamous crime,\u201d he did not have discretion to prohibit the State from cross-examining the defendant\u2014on trial for rape and related offenses\u2014about the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for attempted rape. 311 Md. at 372, 535 A.2d at 456. Our holdings in <em>Colter </em>and <em>Watson </em>are fully applicable to the issue of whether Petitioner Smith is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his motion for mistrial was based on its erroneous conclusion that the question asked by his trial counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to Ms. Peterson\u2019s inadmissible testimony, rather than on the exercise of discretion. Because it is clear that the Circuit Court did not exercise the discretion it was required to exercise, Petitioner Smith is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASES REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR NEW TRIALS; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">.
