In 2001, the Maryland Legislature passed the DNA Evidence\u2014Postconviction Review Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> becoming one of more than thirty states which now have similar statutes providing for postconviction scientific testing of evidence in cases where the petitioner was convicted of one or more statutorily enumerated crimes. <em>See Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 218-19, 909 A.2d 1020, 1023 (2006) <em>{Blake I). </em>Section 8-201(b) of Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code grants a right to a person convicted of one or more specified crimes to file a petition for DNA testing of evidence in the possession of the State that relates to a conviction. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-201(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 7, 2002, Arey filed a petition in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Circuit Court for Baltimore City for postconviction DNA testing of evidence related to his conviction. On April 21, 2010, the Circuit Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the evidence related to Arey\u2019s conviction no longer existed. On July 26, 2010, Arey filed a timely appeal from that ruling directly to this Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-201(j)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are asked to decide the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">(1) Did the [Circuit Court for Baltimore City] err when it held that the State had performed a reasonable search for biological evidence relating to Mr. Arey\u2019s conviction, and dismissed Mr. Arey\u2019s request for the production of evidence?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">(2) Did the [Circuit Court for Baltimore City] err in denying Mr. Arey\u2019s request for production and testing of biological evidence relating to his conviction the day after the State filed a pivotal affidavit, and thus, without giving Mr. Arey a reasonable opportunity to respond to the factual allegations contained in that affidavit prior to dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>For the reasons stated below, we shall reverse the dismissal of Arey\u2019s petition for DNA testing and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In May 1973, Baltimore City police officers contacted Arey and requested that he come into the station for questioning regarding the death of his former employer, Samuel Shapiro. After voluntarily submitting to questioning, Arey confessed to the police that he shot Shapiro and was charged with first degree murder and other related crimes. Among the evidence presented by the State at the original trial was a blue denim shirt which Arey had been wearing when he arrived at the police station for questioning. There was a small amount of blood on the right shoulder area of the shirt, which Arey claimed was his own blood. At a pretrial hearing, Arey asserted that he had been nervously picking at pimples on his face during interrogation and had wiped the blood on the back of his shirt. Detective James Russell of the Baltimore City Police Department testified that he had observed this occur. The State presented expert testimony from Robert S. Davis, the police department\u2019s crime laboratory technician, who testified that scientific analysis had resulted in the finding that the shirt contained type AB blood, which matched the victim\u2019s blood type, and did not match Arey\u2019s type 0 blood. Arey\u2019s counsel argued that the mixture of blood and bacteria from Arey\u2019s pimples could have created an inaccurate blood type result if the bacteria contained antigens similar to those found in AB blood. Arey\u2019s counsel attempted to demonstrate this effect at a pretrial hearing by applying a mixture of Arey\u2019s blood and bacteria to the same shirt and submitting it for retesting. The blood type test, however, resulted in a finding of type 0 blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The results of the scientific analysis of the blood on Arey\u2019s shirt were admitted into evidence, along with the testimony of Dennis Moon, who claimed to have assisted Arey with the murder, and the confession from Arey himself. In April 1974, Arey was convicted of first-degree murder and use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>handgun in the commission of a felony, and sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years concurrent. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction on June 2, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">On May 7, 2002, Arey filed a <em>pro se </em>petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City under \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article, seeking postconviction DNA testing of evidence related to his convictions. The State produced an affidavit of a police sergeant averring that the evidence no longer existed after the sergeant searched the database and records of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Evidence Control Unit (ECU) and found no reference to the evidence. On the basis of the affidavit, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City dismissed the petition on July 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In 2007, we reversed and remanded, holding that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the petition because the State\u2019s affidavit was not sufficient to constitute a reasonable search for the evidence requested. <em>See Arey v. State, </em>400 Md. 491, 503-04, 929 A.2d 501, 508 (2007) <em>(Arey I). </em>We pointed out that \u201c[t]he State should have attempted to determine the proper protocol for handling and destroying evidence in Baltimore City in 1974. From this, the State might have discovered other locations to search for the requested evidence or determined more conclusively its fate.\u201d <em>Arey I, </em>400 Md. at 504, 929 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">On remand, the Circuit Court held four separate hearings between November of 2007 and April of 2010. At the first hearing on November 19, 2007, the State contended that a large amount of evidence was damaged or destroyed when the basement of the Baltimore City Police Department building was flooded by Hurricane Isabel in 2003. The State claimed that it was in the process of securing an outside contractor to conduct an inventory of all of the evidence recovered from the flood. At the second hearing on February 19, 2009, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Andrew, the commanding officer of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s ECU, testified that a contractor had inventoried 417,000 pieces of evidence recovered from the flood and found no evidence related to Arey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>case. Lt. Col. Andrew did testify, however, that a warehouse containing a mass of unidentifiable clothing damaged in the flood was not searched. At the third hearing on June 12, 2009, the State provided the logbook from the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s crime laboratory which showed that the evidence in Arey\u2019s case was examined in May 1973 by someone with the initials \u201cR.S.D.\u201d The Circuit Court for Baltimore City ordered the State to ascertain the identity of R.S.D. and to provide Arey\u2019s counsel with access to the logbook. On April 19, 2010, the State filed an affidavit from Robert S. Davis,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the crime laboratory technician who testified at Arey\u2019s original trial, which contained the following relevant averments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">(3) I do not recall the shirt, any work I may have performed upon it and I certainly have no recollection of where I might last have seen it or where it might be now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">(4) I do recall that I did not personally keep any physical evidence [i]n cases after testing was performed upon such evidence and that items, such as a shirt, were ordinarily returned to the Evidence Control Unit after laboratory work was completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">(5) The small about [sic] of sample that I test would generally be consumed by the process of analysis. We retained no evidence in the laboratory when our work was complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On April 21, 2010, two days later, the Circuit Court dismissed the petition for DNA testing on the ground that the State conducted a reasonable search for the evidence. The court issued the following Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">With the State\u2019s submission of the affidavit of Ronald Davis, the ECU crime lab technician who handled Petitioner\u2019s evidence in this case; and having held a final hearing on April 7, 2010;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The Court is satisfied that the State has done a reasonable search under \u00a7 8-201 of Maryland\u2019s Criminal Procedure Article; and it is this 21st Day of April, 2010, hereby</p>\n<p id=\"Atov\">ORDERED that Mr. Arey\u2019s Motion for DNA Testing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Arey noted a timely appeal from that ruling to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">When reviewing a Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that the State\u2019s search was reasonable under \u00a7 8-201, this Court will uphold findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Blake v. State, </em>418 Md. 445, 460, 15 A.3d 787, 796 (2011) <em>(Blake </em>II). In his appeal to this Court, Arey first contends that the hearing judge erred in holding that the State performed a reasonable search for evidence relating to his conviction. According to Arey, the State\u2019s search for evidence was not reasonable because it consisted only of a search by property number when the property number associated with Arey\u2019s case was either undisclosed or unknown. More specifically, Arey argues that the State has failed to look through a large mass of \u201cold clothing\u201d for the shirt and has neglected to search for the blood slides used by the crime laboratory for blood type analysis. These issues, in our view, are best left for the hearing judge to resolve in the first instance, on remand, and we decline to address them. Secondly, Arey argues that the hearing judge erred in prematurely ruling on his petition for DNA testing by dismissing it the day after the State filed the pivotal affidavit of Mr. Davis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The State contends that the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the State conducted a reasonable search for evidence is not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d pursuant to the standard of review set forth in <em>Blake II. </em>According to the State, by submitting Davis\u2019s affidavit, it has met its burden of conducting a reasonable search. Additionally, the State contends that it has searched all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>places where the evidence could possibly have been found including the ECU, original trial judge\u2019s chambers, original trial courtroom, State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, court clerk\u2019s office, and the court reporter\u2019s office. While the property control number associated with the evidence in Arey\u2019s case was never located, the State contends that other attempts were made to find the evidence using the criminal complaint number and the physical description of the shirt. Finally, the State maintains that it has sufficiently identified the evidence-handling protocol in 1974 by presenting testimony that officers would authorize the destruction of evidence after any direct appeals concluded. Although we decline to hold that the hearing judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was clearly erroneous, we do decide that, on the record before us, the ruling was premature. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The hearing judge erred in ruling on Arey\u2019s petition for testing only two days after the State submitted an affidavit from a key witness. This Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blake I </em>and <em>Horton v. State, </em>412 Md. 1, 985 A.2d 540 (2009) support the reversal of the hearing judge\u2019s order in this case. In <em>Blake I, </em>we held that the Circuit Court erred in summarily dismissing Blake\u2019s petition for testing before Blake had an opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s allegation that the evidence related to Blake\u2019s conviction was no longer in its possession. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-9\">Fundamental fairness requires that a petitioner be given an opportunity to respond and to challenge the State\u2019s representation. When it is the State\u2019s position that the evidence sought to be tested no longer exists, the circuit court may not summarily dismiss the petition requesting DNA testing. The court must give a petitioner notice of and an opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s allegation. A petitioner has a right to notice and opportunity to contest the State\u2019s representation that the evidence is unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Blake I, </em>395 Md. at 228, 909 A.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In addition, we held that Blake\u2019s rights to due process entitled him to notice of the court\u2019s impending ruling and an opportunity to respond. We concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Appellant had a liberty interest at stake, and was, at a minimum, entitled to notice of the impending action, even if he did not have the right to an oral hearing. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Consequently, the failure of the Circuit Court to provide <em>any </em>notice to appellant that the State had filed the motion to dismiss and that the court intended to rule upon it, and its dismissal of the petition without affording appellant any opportunity to respond, violated his rights to due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><em>Blake I, </em>395 Md. at 230, 909 A.2d at 1030 (emphasis in original). Similar to the appellant in <em>Blake, </em>Arey was not given adequate opportunity to respond to the affidavit before the hearing judge dismissed his petition. Arey\u2019s due process rights entitled him to notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond to the averments in Davis\u2019s affidavit before a ruling was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In <em>Horton, </em>the hearing judge dismissed Horton\u2019s petition under \u00a7 8-201 for DNA testing of evidence related to his conviction on the ground that the evidence did not exist. <em>Horton, </em>412 Md. at 3, 985 A.2d at 541. We held that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Horton\u2019s petition for DNA testing two days after the State made available a document authorizing destruction of the evidence related to Horton\u2019s conviction, and less than one month after the State filed affidavits, because the petitioner did not have a reasonable amount of time to examine the document or to respond to the affidavits by arranging for depositions or interviews with the affiants. <em>Horton, </em>412 Md. at 17-18, 985 A.2d at 549-50. We reversed the dismissal despite the fact that the State in <em>Horton </em>had recovered a the document authorizing destruction of the evidence related to Horton\u2019s conviction, documentation which is lacking in Arey\u2019s case. <em>See Horton, </em>412 Md. at 12-13, 985 A.2d at 546-47. Like <em>Horton, </em>Arey\u2019s counsel expressed a desire to interview the State\u2019s affiant, Robert S. Davis, and was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to arrange for his interview or to respond to the State\u2019s representations when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the trial judge dismissed the petition within two days of the State\u2019s filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The State maintains that continued questioning of Davis will not reveal any further information regarding the location of the DNA evidence. We reject that argument as a bar to Arey\u2019s opportunity to respond. The State contends that it is unclear whether the blood slides were ever marked as evidence or held in the ECU. The record before us, however, does not provide any indication of the procedure for the storing or disposing of slides. Even though the 2007 affidavit from the crime laboratory supervisor avers that the slides were not found in a hand search of the crime laboratory, the State subsequently was able to find a notation regarding the analysis of evidence for this case in the laboratory\u2019s log book with the initials of Robert S. Davis. Davis\u2019s affidavit indicates that evidence was not kept in the crime laboratory after testing was complete and that the small amount of blood was generally \u201cconsumed\u201d by testing, but it is still unclear what protocol existed for the disposal of the blood slides made for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Given the opportunity to interview Davis, Arey\u2019s counsel may be able to obtain information about the crime laboratory protocol that could shed light on the possible location of the evidence. Davis may be able to provide a more detailed account of the procedures actually followed at the time of trial such as whether slides were disposed of once analysis was complete, whether slides were stored in the freezer, or whether there was a procedure in place for slides in those situations where the blood was not completely consumed by the process of analysis. While the possibility exists that no further information would come from an interview with Davis, Arey still must be given the opportunity to probe, challenge, or otherwise respond to the statements in the affidavit before a decision can be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We consider the case of <em>Blake II </em>where this Court affirmed the hearing judge\u2019s dismissal of a petition for DNA testing. <em>See Blake II, </em>418 Md. 445, 15 A.3d 787. While several of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>hearings for the two petitioners were held jointly and the circumstances surrounding Blake\u2019s petition were similar in some respects to Arey\u2019s, there exists a significant difference between the two cases. At the final hearing for Blake\u2019s petition, Blake\u2019s counsel explicitly stated that once the State submitted the final requested information, counsel did not \u201chave any further requests of the State____\u201d <em>Blake II, </em>418 Md. at 458-59, 15 A.3d at 795. On the contrary, Arey\u2019s counsel expressly stated that he still wished to speak -with Davis to attempt to find out more information about the protocol followed in the 1970\u2019s. At the final hearing on April 7, 2010,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> counsel for Arey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">I\u2019d love to have the opportunity to interview him____Specifically what I want, if it were up to me and I were the State, what I would do is I would have RSD come in and on the record talk to him about the protocols that were found [sic].... Now if he doesn\u2019t remember specifically handling this, which I think is likely, he will remember what the protocols were back then, I would hope____ I think Mr. Davis would be a place to start who could give us information of the best places to look. I mean, once we get that information if he has it, I mean maybe he doesn\u2019t remember anything, but we don\u2019t know. And the whole point of this, I believe, is for the State ... to be able to say with certainty, what they\u2019re saying. They\u2019re saying the evidence doesn\u2019t exist. And my question is how do you know that____[W]hy don\u2019t we ask people who might have seen it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">In accordance with this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blake I </em>and <em>Horton, </em>the hearing judge should not have dismissed the petition by ruling on it two days after the State provided an affidavit from Mr. Davis, the retired laboratory technician, without providing the defendant \u201can opportunity to respond and to challenge the State\u2019s representation.\u201d <em>Blake I, </em>395 Md. at 228, 909 A.2d at 1028. Although the State has taken considerable steps to conduct a reasonable search for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>evidence in this case, the petition for testing should not have been dismissed, at least, until Arey had an opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s most recent affidavit. Therefore, we reverse and remand this case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS REVERSED.

The State is not required to conduct a \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cexhaustive\u201d search.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The Majority opinion leaves muddled for litigants, litigators, and Bench alike the burdens to be borne by parties in similar proceedings and in this case in particular on remand. Our caselaw is somewhat unclear already with respect to which burdens shift to the defendant when a hearing judge concludes, as happened here, that the State established a prima facie case of reasonableness of its search. For example, we stated in <em>Arey I </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">Once the State performs a reasonable search and demonstrates sufficiently a <em>prima fade </em>case, either directly or circumstantially, that the requested evidence no longer exists, the State will have satisfied its burden of <em>persuasion. </em>The burden of <em>production </em>then shifts to the petitioner to demonstrate that the evidence actually exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Arey v. State, </em>400 Md. 491, 505, 929 A.2d 501, 509 (2007) (emphases added). The words \u201cprima facie\u201d are synonymous usually with \u201cburden of production.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Questar Builders, Inc. v. CB Flooring, LLC, </em>410 Md. 241, 281 n. 25, 978 A.2d 651, 675 n. 25 (2009) (\u201cCB Flooring bears the initial burden of production to adduce a prima facie showing that Questar invoked the termination for convenience clause in bad faith.... \u201d). Thus, the language in <em>Arey I </em>suggests that, at the inception of a post-conviction DNA proceeding, the State bears the burdens of production and persuasion, but <em>both </em>may shift to the defendant, upon a showing by the State, satisfactory to the trial judge, that, after a reasonable search, the DNA evidence could not be found and does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Ordinarily, only the burden of production shifts between parties; the burden of persuasion stays usually with the party that bore it originally. <em>See </em>Lynn Mclain, Maryland Evidencia\u2014State and Federal \u00a7 300:2 n. 23 (2d ed. 2001) (\u201cAs a general rale, th[e] burden [of persuasion] does not shift, but remains throughout the trial as allocated at the beginning of the trial.\u201d); <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 203-04, 401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>A.2d 651, 660 (1979) (\u201cThe burden of [persuasion], i.e., the risk of non[-]persuasion, never shifts from the party on whom it is placed.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In elucidating this conceit, we quoted from Dean McCormick for the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe burden of producing evidence on an issue means the liability to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if evidence on the issue has not been produced____ The burden of producing evidence is a critical mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the case without jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">The burden of persuasion becomes a crucial factor only if the parties have sustained their burdens of producing evidence and only when all of the evidence has been introduced. It does not shift from party to party during the course of the trial simply because it need not be allocated until it is time for a decision. When the time for a decision comes ... [t]he jury must be told that if the party having the burden of persuasion has failed to satisfy that burden, the issue is to be decided against him. If there is no jury and the judge finds himself in doubt, he too must decide the issue against the party having the burden of persuasion [C. McCormick, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 336, at 947 (3d ed. 1984) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\"><em>Commodities Reserve Corp. v. Belt\u2019s Wharf Warehouses, Inc., </em>310 Md. 365, 368 n. 2, 529 A.2d 822, 823 n. 2 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Without a clearer indication of legislative intent in Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 8-201, Maryland Rule 4-710 (2009), or our caselaw, we should be reluctant to countenance shifting the burden of persuasion, as opposed to the burden of production, in DNA missing evidence cases. The defendant does not regain control usually of the type of evidence taken from him in this case after it is acquired and used by the State at trial. Thus, if the evidence is retained after trial, most likely it is in the State\u2019s (or its agents\u2019) possession, if it exists at all. Because of this, the State has the burden of production and persuasion at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>outset of a post-conviction DNA proceeding; however, if the State makes a prima facie showing that the DNA evidence does not exist (e.g., presents testimony and/or documents persuading the hearing judge that a reasonable search was made), then the burden of production only shifts to the defendant. <em>See Murphy v. 24th St. Cadillac Corp., </em>353 Md. 480, 492, 727 A.2d 915, 921 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Applying properly the deferential \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard to the record here as to the reasonableness of the State\u2019s search, we should conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s determination that the State discharged its prima facie burden was not clearly erroneous and, thus, the burden of production shifts to Arey on remand. <em>See Arey I, </em>400 Md. at 505, 929 A.2d at 509 (stating that, after the State presents its case, \u201c[t]he burden of production then shifts to the petitioner to demonstrate that the evidence actually exists\u201d). The record is ample to support the trial judge\u2019s finding of reasonableness as to the State\u2019s search. The Majority opinion documents well the bases for that finding at Majority op. 332-33, 29 A.3d at 988-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Majority opinion\u2019s (and my) concern that Arey have an opportunity to inquire behind the face of Davis\u2019s affidavit and, further, to attempt to persuade the hearing judge that his petition should not be denied, may be vindicated through Arey attempting to discharge the shifted burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Arey knows already who Davis is and the role he played in securing his conviction because Davis testified at Arey\u2019s 1974 trial. Davis\u2019s lab work on the sought-after missing evidence occurred between 1973 (the crime) and 1974 (Arey\u2019s trial). The State, in the course of the present proceedings, informed Arey\u2019s trial counsel of the since-retired Davis\u2019s current address, as ordered by the trial judge some months before Davis\u2019s affidavit was filed here. Thus, Arey may examine Davis in open court (once Arey serves him with process or the State persuades Davis to appear as an accommodation) by challenging the accuracy of his non-recollection versus what he apparently does recall in the affidavit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The hearing judge\u2019s premature and unfair decision to deny Arey\u2019s petition so promptly after receiving the Davis affidavit does <em>not </em>reflect adversely on the prior determination as to the prima facie reasonableness of the State\u2019s search to that point. The State\u2019s search was reasonable, notwithstanding the hearing judge\u2019s error in signing the 21 April 2010 order of denial, without giving Arey an opportunity to adduce evidence that the evidence exists and where it may be found. That is why there were two questions presented in this case, one addressing the reasonableness of the State\u2019s search (for burden shifting purposes) and the other the prematurity and fairness of the trial judge\u2019s denial of Arey\u2019s petition on 21 April 2010. We should answer both questions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. The affidavit of Robert S. Davis was transmitted by the prosecutor to the Court and Arey\u2019s trial counsel by cover letter of 19 April 2010. The Court's copy was docketed as filed on 20 April 2010. There is no indication in the record extract that Arey\u2019s counsel knew in advance what the contents of the Davis affidavit would be, although he had the apparent ability to contact Davis, a retired employee of the State, on his initiative for some considerable time prior to the receipt of the affidavit and failed to do so. Of course, at that juncture in the long life of this case, Arey had no statutory or legal imperative to do so because, at that time, the State bore still the burden of production as to the reasonableness of its search for the missing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. After reciting the parties' appellate arguments as to the reasonableness determination, the Majority opinion says simply, \"These issues in our view are best left for the hearing judge to resolve, in the first instance, on remand.\u201d Majority op. at 334, 29 A.3d at 989. Of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the hearing judge resolved already \"these issues\u201d when she concluded that the State met its initial burden of production that a reasonable search had been made for the missing evidence. See Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Proc. Art., \u00a7 8-201. This determination preceded the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Arey\u2019s petition should be denied. The Majority opinion and I agree that the ultimate decision was premature and unfair because Arey should have been given an opportunity to respond to the State's discharge of its initial burden of production, which was completed with the filing of Mr. Davis\u2019s affidavit. The Majority opinion misses completely the distinction between, and significance of, the penultimate and ultimate determinations of the hearing judge, implicitly throwing out both (although it purports not to decide whether the judge\u2019s reasonableness finding was clearly erroneous\u2014see Majority op. at 335, 29 A.3d at 990, \"[ajlthough we decline to hold that the hearing judge's ultimate conclusion was clearly erroneous ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">. Clarity in our directions on remand is all the more important here because a different judge will conduct those proceedings. The judge who presided over the extensive proceedings culminating in the 21 April 2010 denial order has retired since and did not seek the Court\u2019s approval to be recalled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. It is a little difficult to imagine how Arey will probe behind what Davis stated in his affidavit regarding the existence vel non, and the whereabouts, of the \"missing\u201d evidence. Davis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u2022 \"I do not recall the shirt, any work I may have performed on it and I certainly have no recollection of where I might last have seen it or where it might be now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u2022 \"I do recall that I did not personally keep any physical evidence and that- items, such as a shirt, were ordinarily returned to the Evidence Control Unit [\"ECU\"] after laboratory work was completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u2022 \"The small [amount] of sample that I test would generally be consumed by the process of analysis. We retained no evidence in the laboratory when our work was complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">As the State proved here, the ECU was searched and the evidence not found there. It seems to me a low expectancy that even highly skilled cross-examination of Davis is likely to inspire a catharsis leading to information shedding light on whether the evidence actually exists and, of so, where it is. In any event, Arey should be given that opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
