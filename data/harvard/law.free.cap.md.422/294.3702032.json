Specifically, Woodmore Towne Centre had applied for the permit to construct a road extension and stream crossing at Ruby Lockhart Boulevard in order to provide primary access into the development. During the administrative proceeding before MDE, Riverkeeper had submitted written comments against the permit, asserting that Woodmore Towne Centre had not demonstrated that the proposed road extension and stream crossing had \u201cno practicable alternative\u201d that would \u201cavoid or result in less adverse impact on nontidal wetlands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>After MDE approved the permit, Riverkeeper initiated a judicial review action in the Circuit Court, after which both MDE and Woodmore Towne Centre filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court dismissed the judicial review action, and Riverkeeper petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which, prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we granted, <em>Patuxent Riverkeeper v. Department of the Environment, </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011), to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">Did the circuit court err when it interpreted the federal test for standing and held that the Riverkeeper lacked standing to challenge the issuance of a Maryland nontidal wetlands and waterways permit authorizing permanent and temporary impacts to nontidal wetlands and streams where one of Riverkeeper\u2019s members alleged that the permit would result in future and threatened harm to his recreational, aesthetic, and economic interests in the Western Branch watershed and tributary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We shall hold that Riverkeeper has standing to initiate a judicial review action, because its member, David Linthicum, had alleged sufficient harm to his aesthetic, recreational, and economic interests in connection with the issuance of the non-tidal wetlands permit in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Section 5-204(f) of the Environment Article, enacted by Chapters 650 and 651 of the Maryland Laws of 2009 and effective January 1, 2010, enables a person to seek judicial review of an administrative determination by the Maryland Department of the Environment regarding certain environmental permits, including those affecting non-tidal wetlands, if the person satisfies the federal rubric for standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">(f) <em>Judicial review of final determination by Depart</em>ment.\u2014A final determination by the Department on the issuance, denial, renewal, or revision of any permit issued under Title 5, Subtitle 5 or Subtitle 9, \u00a7 14-105, \u00a7 14-508, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u00a7 15-808, or \u00a7 16-307 of this article is subject to judicial review at the request of any person that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">(i) Meets the threshold standing requirements under federal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">(ii) 1.

Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967); <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v.

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 270-71, 964 A.2d 662, 671-72 (2009). Moreover, a group could not establish standing to initiate judicial review of a permitting decision by an administrative agency, unless the organization had a \u201cproperty interest of its own\u2014separate and distinct from that of its individual members.\u201d <em>Medical Waste Associates, Inc. v. Maryland Waste Coalition, Inc., </em>327 Md. 596, 612, 612 A.2d 241, 249 (1992), quoting <em>Citizens Planning &amp; Housing Ass\u2019n v. County Executive of Baltimore County, </em>273 Md. 333, 345, 329 A.2d 681, 687 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In enacting Chapters 650 and 651 of the Maryland Laws of 2009, which originated as Senate Bill 1065 and House Bill 1569, the General Assembly embraced the \u201cbroader\u201d notion of standing applied in federal courts, to enable both individuals and organizations to challenge environmental permits in judicial review actions, were certain conditions to exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>With respect to cases involving challenges to specific types of permits, <em>Maryland courts have defined \u201caggrievement\u201d to mean the ownership of property either adjacent to, or within \u201c \u2018sight or sound\u2019 range of the property that is the subject of [the plaintiffs] complaint. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">The Court of Appeals has held that an association lacks standing to sue where it has no property interest of its own, distinct from that of its individual members. <em>Citizens Planning &amp; Housing Ass\u2019n v. County Executive, </em>273 Md. 333, 329 A.2d 681 (1974). In <em>Medical Waste Ass\u2019n [Associates </em>] <em>v. Maryland Waste Coalition, </em>327 Md. 596, 612 A.2d 241 (1992), the Court of Appeals stated that if an individual or organization is seeking to redress a public wrong, the individual or organization has no standing unless the wrong suffered is different in character and kind from that suffered by the general public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Federal law is broader than State law in its determination of standing. Under federal law, a party has standing if its use and enjoyment of the area is affected by the challenged action/decision or if the party has a particular interest in the property affected. Federal law also makes little distinction between individual and group standing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABq\">Environmental Matters Committee Floor Report on House Bill 1569, at 4 (2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The touchstone Supreme Court case involving environmental standing, <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000), drew the federal landscape in environmental actions. In that case, a judicial review action to enforce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>permit authorizing the limited discharge of pollutants, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342, the Court determined that to satisfy standing in an environmental action, a plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) it has suffered an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180-81,120 S.Ct. at 704, 145 L.Ed.2d at 627, quoting <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364 (1992). An environmental group can satisfy standing federally if \u201cits members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth, </em>528 U.S. at 181, 120 S.Ct. at 704,145 L.Ed.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In <em>Friends of the Earth, </em>the Court emphasized that injury in fact has included a negative impact on the organizational representatives\u2019 recreational or aesthetic appreciation of the affected area, in that case the demonstrably diminished ability or desire to hike, camp, picnic, swim, canoe, boat or fish in a river contaminated by pollutants. 528 U.S. at 181-82, 120 S.Ct. at 704-705, 145 L.Ed.2d at 627-28. In addition, the Supreme Court determined that a person may suffer an injury in fact when his economic interests are negatively impacted, for instance, lower home prices due to proximity to a hazardous waste incinerator. <em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 120 S.Ct. at 705, 145 L.Ed.2d at 628. The Court noted that an injury to aesthetic, recreational, or economic interests need not be consummated, so long as an individual can demonstrate reasonable concerns about the effects of the challenged activity. <em>Id. </em>at 183-84, 120 S.Ct. at 705-706,145 L.Ed.2d at 628-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Such aesthetic, recreational, or economic interests or values, however, must be based upon a demonstrable record of regularly utilizing the affected area, as well as a desire to do so in the future. In <em>Summers v. Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>488, 494-96, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 1150, 173 L.Ed.2d 1, 10 (2009), the Supreme Court reasoned that an organizational representative\u2019s affidavit indicating a desire to \u201cvisit several unnamed National Forests in the future\u201d was not sufficiently particularized to establish a cognizable aesthetic or recreational interest. Moreover, asserting a past injury to aesthetic or recreational interests, arising for example, from \u201cpast ... development on Forest Service land,\u201d without demonstrating a continuing or future harm, further does not suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 129 S.Ct. at 1150, 173 L.Ed.2d at 9-10. The Court also has opined that a genuine nexus must exist between the alleged injury and the challenged conduct, <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364 (1992), and that the remedy requested must \u201ceffectively abate[ ] [illegal] conduct and prevent[ ] its recurrence.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth, </em>528 U.S. at 185-86, 120 S.Ct. at 706, 145 L.Ed.2d at 630.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">At the time the new standing test was embraced by the Maryland Legislature, not only had the Supreme Court spoken, but other federal appellate courts already had an opportunity to interpret the tenets of the Supreme Court cases. The application of these precepts prior to the enactment of Section 5-204(f) of the Environment Article in 2009 illustrates the boundaries of standing in environmental cases to which the General Assembly had referred when it enacted the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Sierra Club v. Franklin County Power of Illi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>nois, LLC, </em>546 F.3d 918, 925 (7th Cir.2008), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit determined that a Sierra Club member adequately alleged an injury by asserting that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and her family had taken trips to \u201cfish, kayak, camp, and enjoy the natural beauty and clean environment\u201d of a lake, located three miles from the site of a proposed power plant, and that if the plant were built, she would cease her recreational trips. Similarly, in <em>American Canoe Ass\u2019n, v. City of Louisa Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>389 F.3d 536, 542 (6th Cir.2004), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reasoned that an environmental group representative had demonstrated a sufficient injury when he alleged that he previously recreated in a river near a water treatment plant, but that he presently refused to do so, because of pollution caused by discharges from the plant. In so doing, federal appellate courts have noted that a plaintiff may express reasonable concerns about the future impacts of the challenged activity. <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>204 F.3d 149, 160 (4th Cir.2000) (reasoning an environmental group member \u201cneed not wait until his lake becomes barren and sterile or assumes an unpleasant color and smell before he can invoke the protections of the Clean Water Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The injury alleged must share a specific nexus with the harm asserted. In <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>236 F.3d 985, 995 (9th Cir.2000), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that the plaintiff had adequately demonstrated such a nexus by indicating that sediments in defendant\u2019s marine leasehold contained elevated concentrations of pollutants, that defendant had discharged such pollutants, and that defendant\u2019s marine leasehold was \u201cdevoid of life.\u201d In contrast, in <em>Center for Biological Diversity v. Lueckel, </em>417 F.3d 532, 540 (6th Cir.2005), the Sixth Circuit reasoned that although the environmental group representatives had shown that they had suffered concrete injuries to their aesthetic, recreational, and scientific interests in the scenic rivers in question due to commercial logging, the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the requisite connection because they had not referred to specific evidence that the United States Forest Service\u2019s failure to enact a \u201ccomprehensive resource management plan\u201d had caused the approval of the environmentally harmful projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>According to the federal appellate court, an aggrieved party also must show that a favorable decision will likely, not merely speculatively, relieve the injury alleged. Alleging a previous injury, for instance, without referencing a continuing or future harm, will not suffice. <em>Lueckel, </em>417 F.3d at 537 (reasoning that \u201cplaintiffs ... must show that actual, site-specific activities are diminishing or threaten to diminish their members\u2019 enjoyment of the designated river segments\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The parties in the present case differ, though, not regarding the test for standing, but in its application to the factual circumstances presented. Riverkeeper asserts that its member, Mr. Linthicum, suffered an injury in fact, because his aesthetic, recreational, and economic interests in the Patuxent River, particularly the Western Branch watershed,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>been jeopardized by the road extension and stream crossing allowed by the permit. In particular, Mr. Linthicum asserts that the upstream impacts caused by the crossing will cause \u201cnitrogen and other pollutants\u201d to leach into waters downstream. Woodmore Towne Centre counters that Mr. Linthicum failed to satisfy the standing inquiry, because he failed to demonstrate that the issuance of the permit has negatively impacted his paddling and cartography activities on the Western Branch watershed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">In his affidavit, Mr. Linthicum described the aesthetic and recreational interests he has in paddling, wading, and clearing branches in the Western Branch of the Patuxent River:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">5. 1 visit the Patuxent River almost every other day. I have visited and will continue to visit the Western Branch every few months. When visiting the Western Branch, I paddle along the tributary, and also wade in the water to clear out branches for the purpose of waterway maintenance and navigation. I have been paddling, wading, and clearing branches and other blockages in the Western Branch for nearly ten years. Beyond my recreational interests in the Western Branch tributary and watershed, I also have aesthetic and environmental interests in the Western Branch, as the river and watershed is much healthier and cleaner than surrounding watersheds such as the Anacostia watershed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">6. The area of the Western Branch tributary and watershed that I most often visit is downstream from the location of the Woodmore Towne Center Project. I sometimes paddle in the Western Branch as far north as Upper Marlboro, which is approximately 8.5 miles downstream from the areas of wetlands and streams that are impacted by the Woodmore Towne Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">He further described the negative impact of the issuance of the MDE permit on the wetlands and streams in the Western Branch, where he most often paddles and clears blockages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the waterway, jeopardizing his aesthetic and recreational interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">7. The wetlands permit pertaining to the Woodmore Towne Center will cause impacts to wetlands and streams in the Western Branch watershed. These impacts will ultimately have a direct effect on the watershed and the river downstream, where I most often paddle and clear blockages in the waterway. Specifically, the stream impacted by the Ruby Lockhart Boulevard extension on the Subject Property is the north fork of the Southwest Branch of the Patuxent River (this stream is marked \u201cS\u201d on a map that I prepared for the Subject Property, attached as Exhibit C). This stream runs southward from the Subject Property through developed and undeveloped land before ultimately joining the Western Branch tributary approximately five miles downstream. Smaller drainages on the north end of the Subject Property (marked as \u2018W\u201d on Exhibit C) also connect directly with the Western Branch and the Patuxent River itself. These smaller drainages flow into Bald Hill Branch approximately 3/4 mile from the Subject Property. Bald Hill Branch then joins the Western Branch just over a mile further downstream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">8. The health of the Western Branch, including the area where I most often paddle, wade, and clear trees and other blockages, will suffer as a direct result of the impacts to the connected streams and tributaries just a few miles upstream at the Woodmore Towne Center site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">9. Diverting and/or compromising the streams on the Subject Property can affect the flow rate and the ecology of the tributaries of the Patuxent River. Moreover, drainage of stormwater from the impervious surfaces of the Woodmore development into the surrounding streams and watershed will further degrade the water quality of the Western Branch. Western Branch is a system already in decline due to the vast amount of paving, construction, channelization and other human intervention in its natural functions. Like many tributaries, streams, and creeks elsewhere in Prince George\u2019s County, Western Branch fails to meet Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>water quality standards, and appears to be approaching the tipping point of no return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">10. The impacts to wetlands on the Subject Property will also have a negative effect on my activities downstream in the Western Branch. Wetlands provide recharge and storage of surplus water during storm events, which can lessen the impacts of flooding and property damage to downstream neighbors. Wetlands serve as natural \u201csponges\u201d to absorb manmade toxins and poisons that leach from surrounding contaminated runoff caused by paved surfaces, trash, and chemicals applied to urbanized lands. The loss of the natural wetlands in a river system eventually leads to the death and desertification of a river\u2019s tributaries and takes an equivalent toll on the waters of the main channel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">11. I have reviewed recent scientific and academic literature that has discussed the connection, both in Maryland and in general, between urbanization, impacts to streams and headwaters, and the deleterious effects on watersheds and rivers downstream. One of these articles discussing this connection states: \u201cHeadwater systems are important sources of sediments, water, nutrients, and organic matter for downstream reaches. Despite the significant roles of headwater systems within the channel network, the ecological values of headwater systems are underestimated, and their processes have been extensively modified by land use.\u201d <em>See </em>Takashi Gomi, Roy C. Sidle &amp; John S. Richardson, <em>Understanding Processes and Downstream Linkages of Headwater Systems, </em>BioScience, Vol. 52, No. 10, Oct. 2002, at 914. I have also read that \u201c[the] natural dendritic properties of stream networks play an intrinsic role in the delivery of nitrogen and other pollutants to downstream receiving waters from headwater locations throughout watersheds.\u201d <em>See </em>Richard B. Alexander, Elizabeth W. Boyer, Richard A. Smith, Gregory E. Schwarz &amp; Richard B. Moore, <em>The Role of Headwater Streams in Downstream Water Quality, </em>Journal of the American Water Resources Association, Vol. 43, No. 1, Feb. 2007, at 57. In the context of streams and wetlands, the term \u201cdendritic\u201d refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>branch-like characteristics of upstream headwaters, which then funnel into a single stream or river downstream, as is the case with the Western Branch watershed and tributary,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">(internal footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On the basis of Mr. Linthicum\u2019s affidavit, as well as the testimony he presented at a hearing on the motions to dismiss,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Circuit Court found that Mr. Linthicum is \u201ca frequent recreational paddler\u201d on the Western Branch of the Patuxent River and also has an \u201caesthetic interest in the beauty of the river and the cleanliness of its water.\u201d The court further found that Mr. Linthicum has \u201can economic interest in navigating the river, [because] he charts its tributaries to produce maps and guides that he sells to the River-keeper and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Despite these findings, the judge dismissed the judicial review action for lack of standing, determining that the injury Mr. Linthicum alleged on behalf of Riverkeeper was merely \u201cconjectural or hypothetical\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">On the other hand, Mr. Linthicum has never visited the actual site of the permit at issue and has never paddled on the tributary that has been altered by development of the Towne Center, nor has he testified to an intention or desire to do so. He has not seen any effects, other than seasonal ones, on the parts of the river he does travel since the completion of the work at the Towne Center. Indeed, he did not even realize there had been work impacting a wetland until a few weeks before offering his testimony to the Court, long after that work had been completed.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In other words, completion of the work authorized by the wetlands permit issued by MDE has not affected Mr. Linthicum\u2019s day to day life on the river in any manner whatever. Instead, Mr. Linthicum claims that the Towne Center development will \u201cultimately\u201d impact the watershed downriver where he carries on his business. Affidavit of David Linthicum \u00b6 7. This is precisely the conjectural or hypothetical injury forbidden by <em>Summers, supra. </em>Mr. Linthicum has a good-faith belief that continued urbanization of Prince George\u2019s County will one day result in the erosion of the wetlands and waterways that he loves. As he testified, he fears the \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\u201d This is not a sufficient injury in fact to establish standing under federal law and Md.Code, Enviro. \u00a7 5-204(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We disagree with the Circuit Court\u2019s legal assessment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mr. Linthicum alleged, and the Circuit Court found, that he had adequately asserted demonstrable aesthetic, recreational, and economic interests in the Western Branch as an avid paddler and mapmaker. The Circuit Court determined that the harm alleged, however, was not sufficiently concrete nor imminent, because Mr. Linthicum claimed that the permit allowing the road expansion and stream crossing would \u201cultimately\u201d impact the Western Branch watershed downriver \u201cwhere he carries on his business.\u201d In so doing, the judge failed to credit the reasonable concern that Mr. Linthicum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>manifested about the future harm to the ecology of the Western Branch that would result from \u201cdiverting and/or compromising\u201d upriver streams.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The injury suffered by Mr. Linthicum, moreover, shares a sufficient nexus to the issuance of the non-tidal wetlands permit, because Mr. Linthicum alleged, referring to scientific articles as well as his own experiences, that stream crossings at headwaters and wetlands, such as that constructed at Ruby Lockhart Boulevard, can cause negative affects downstream on the Western Branch watershed. Finally, at a hearing before the Circuit Court regarding the motions to dismiss, Frederick Tutman, Chief Executive Officer of Riverkeeper, described methods to abate the harm caused by the issuance of the permit, including rescission of the permit, as well as more intensive mitigation efforts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">I would say in addition to the rescission of the permit, I think look at broader or more specific mitigation in line with the scope of the impacts[,] [b]ut, also, I think something of great value is being taken away from citizens adjacent to this site and the county and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being put back. I think the quality of the mitigation that\u2019s been approved by the State[,] I don\u2019t think begins to really get to the heart of what\u2019s being taken away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As a result, the motions to dismiss for lack of standing on the part of Riverkeeper should not have been granted, and the judicial review action should be permitted to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT, PETRIE/ELG INGLEWOOD, LLC, ALSO KNOWN AS WOODMORE TOWNE CENTRE, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">HARRELL and MURPHY, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">HARRELL, J., dissenting, in which MURPHY, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The Majority opinion correctly characterizes the broader nature of federal standing, as compared to Maryland\u2019s tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tional \u201caggrievement\u201d standard; however, by reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court in this case, it dilutes unfortunately the threshold requirements of injury in fact and traceability in the \u201cnew\u201d standard.

Accordingly, I dissent and offer a more appropriate analysis of federal standing requirements as they apply to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">This case is a judicial review action of a nontidal wetlands and waterways permit issued by Respondent, the Maryland Department of Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d), to Respondent, Petrie/ELG Inglewood LLC, the developer of Woodmore Towne Center in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. The permit, issued on 19 March 2010, authorized filling of less than one acre of nontidal wetlands and allowed the developer to place several streams in a culvert to accommodate an access road for the development. At the time of permit issuance, over 550,000 square feet of commercial retail floor space in the development was under active construction in upland areas, outside of the MDE\u2019s jurisdiction under the Nontidal Wetlands Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1982, 2007 RepLVol.) Environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ment Article \u00a7 5-901(j) (defining regulated activities) and \u00a7 5-903(b)(4) (requiring the MDE to evaluate proposed activities on nontidal wetlands). Construction activities, including wetland filling and placement of culverts, authorized under the MDE permit, were completed several weeks after issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Petitioner, Patuxent Riverkeeper (\u201cRiverkeeper\u201d), an environmental advocacy group dedicated to preserving the health and water quality of the Patuxent River, challenged issuance of the permit. Riverkeeper sought judicial review under Maryland\u2019s new standing laws for certain environmental permits, which adopted the federal standing requirements, including the provisions for organizational standing. In the Circuit Court, Riverkeeper attempted to demonstrate organizational standing based on an affidavit and testimony of one of its members, David Linthicum. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of standing, which was granted by the Circuit Court. That is the posture in which this case reaches us.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">A. Maryland\u2019s New Standing Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In 2009, the Legislature adopted amendments to the Maryland Code that changed the standing requirements for challenging certain environmental permits. Maryland Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.), Environment Article \u00a7 5-204(f). Under prior Maryland standing principles, a challenger had to be \u201caggrieved\u201d by an agency or board action in order to bring and maintain a judicial review challenge. Maryland Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Environment Article \u00a7 5-301(g) (providing the standing requirements for contested case hearings), Maryland Code (1982, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Environment Article \u00a7 10-222(a) (providing the standing requirements for judicial review of contested cases), <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>247 Md. 137, 143, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967). The former standard made it difficult for environmental organizations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>establish standing to challenge environmental permits because an organization was required to have a distinct and separate property interest from its members. <em>Medical Waste Assocs. v. Md. Waste Coalition, Inc., </em>327 Md. 596, 612, 612 A.2d 241, 249 (1992). The 2009 amendments, however, provided that any person could seek judicial review of a covered final permit determination by the MDE as long as he/she/it met the \u201cthreshold standing requirements under federal law\u201d and participated in the public comment process, unless there was no opportunity for public comment. Maryland Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol., 2010 Supp.) Environment Article \u00a7 5-204(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">B. Federal Standing Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Under federal law, an appellant or petitioner possesses standing to challenge a final agency action when that person has suffered an injury in fact 1) that is concrete, particularized and actual or imminent, rather than conjectural or hypothetical, 2) traceable fairly to the challenged activity, and 3) that will be redressed likely, as opposed to speculatively, by a favorable decision. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364 (1992). Environmental organizations have standing to sue when \u201cits members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 704, 145 L.Ed.2d 610, 627 (2000) (citing <em>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383, 394 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">To demonstrate injury in fact, an appellant or petitioner need not show an injury to the environment, only an injury to his/her/its interests. <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 181, 120 S.Ct. at 704,145 L.Ed.2d at 627. An injury in fact includes ongoing or current harm to the appellant\u2019s/petitioner\u2019s interests, as well as threats of future harm caused by a challenged activity. Aesthetic, recreational, and economic values are judicially cognizable interests for the purposes of determining an injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>in fact; however, the fear of harm to these interests must be reasonable. <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 183-84, 120 S.Ct. at 705-06, 145 L.Ed.2d at 629. Reasonableness depends on the facts of each case and requires courts to look at whether the appellant/petitioner uses the \u201caffected area\u201d of the permitted activity. <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 181, 120 S.Ct. at 704, 145 L.Ed.2d at 627. The reasonable fear of harm must be related directly to harm of the appellant\u2019s/petitioner\u2019s interests; generalized concern for environmental degradation is not sufficient to meet the \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d test. <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 575,112 S.Ct. at 2144, 119 L.Ed.2d at 373-74. The magnitude of the harm is not relevant for the injury in fact inquiry; an \u201cidentifiable trifle\u201d is sufficient to find standing. <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), </em>412 U.S. 669, 689 n. 14, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2417 n. 14, 37 L.Ed.2d 254, 270 n. 14 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">To demonstrate that the injury in fact is traceable fairly to the challenged activity under the permit, an appellant or petitioner must show that it is \u201clikely that the injury was caused by the conduct complained of and not by the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.2000) (Gaston Copper I). In other words, there must be a showing that there is a genuine nexus between the injury and the challenged conduct. <em>Gaston Copper I, </em>204 F.3d at 161 (citing <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d at 364).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">I agree that Linthicum\u2019s interests are germane to that of Petitioner; however, I do not agree that Linthicum demonstrated, on this record, that he suffered a concrete and particularized injury in fact or that his alleged harms are traceable fairly to the activities under the challenged permit. Even were I to agree that Linthicum\u2019s activities were within the affected area, or that his alleged harms could be traced to the activities allowed by the MDE permit, his fear of harm was not reasonable based on his affidavit and Circuit Court testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>A. Affected Area and Traceability Determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">While injury in fact and traceability to the activity under the challenged permit are separate judicial inquiries, the underlying allegations and evidence often endeavor to support both. <em>Gaston Copper I, </em>204 F.3d at 154. To determine whether an appellant/petitioner is within the affected area, a court should consider the type and source of the pollutant, the amount of the pollutant, and the distance from the person\u2019s allegedly impacted activities to the discharge. When all of the claims of harm, or threat of harm, to the person are prospective, as alleged by Linthicum, the court should evaluate the \u201cfacts\u201d using a reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">i. Type and Source of the Pollutant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The case before the Court involves a nontidal wetlands and waterways permit that is different, and distinctly so, from the challenged activities in the cases relied on by the Majority opinion in its analysis, each of which involved potential or existing discharges of metals or other inherently toxic pollutants. To be sure, nutrients and sediments in excess also can cause environmental impacts, as detailed in the literature alluded to by the Petitioner. Nutrients and sediments, however, occur naturally in stream systems, sometimes in large amounts, in a dynamic relationship with the surrounding ecosystem. This is not the case with toxic metals such as mercury, where even small amounts, introduced through anthropogenic <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sources, likely will cause harm or a reasonable fear of harm. A recent Eighth Circuit decision evaluated the affected area of a power generation plant where wetland and stream fill was authorized by a Clean Water Act \u00a7 404 permit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>645 F.3d 978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>986 (8th Cir.2011). The utility company permittee argued, as the Respondent developer does in the instant case, that the plaintiffs were required to \u201cshow harm as a result of the particular activities authorized by the \u00a7 404 permit, rather than the overall construction of the plant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court agreed and evaluated the affected area and potential harm solely from the perspective of the activities authorized by the \u00a7 404 permit. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 986-89. One plaintiff, a private hunting club with an individual member who owned property adjacent to the plant site, was able to persuade the court that it had standing because light and noise pollution from the clearing of the land for the power transmission line harmed the member\u2019s aesthetic interests by changing the behavior of the local wildlife. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 987. Other hunting club members averred that they \u201cenjoyed taking pictures, hunting and studying the history and archaeology of the area\u201d adjacent to the plant site. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 987-88. The court concluded that the interests of the hunting club and its members were harmed by the activities authorized by the \u00a7 404 permit. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 988. The court also evaluated the standing claim of an environmental organization, the Sierra Club, that argued the affected area \u201cis the plant site as well as the area in its immediate proximity. ...\u201d <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 988-89. The court agreed with the Sierra Club and conferred standing based on the district court\u2019s finding that bird watching and other recreational interests of the Club\u2019s members were injured \u201cimplicitly,\u201d at least in part, by the utility\u2019s \u00a7 404 activities. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 989. The court also relied upon the allegation that members of both groups were upset by the amount of mud and silt from the plant which the district court found was related directly to the \u00a7 404 permit. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">This is the most recent Eighth Circuit case on point and is particularly informative in the present case for its analytical model. It involved a challenged activity similar to that of the developer here. Importantly, the federal court limited its review of the potential harm to the \u00a7 404 permit-authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>activities, rather than the entire construction site. The Eighth Circuit likely limited the affected area determination for a \u00a7 404 permit to the area in immediate proximity to the site due to the uncertainty in determining cause-and-effect at any substantial distance from a dredged or filled wetland or stream. The Majority opinion in the present case, however, recites and relies on Linthieum\u2019s fear of development and impervious surfaces from the Woodmore Towne Center development. Maj. Op. at 305-06, 29 A.3d at 590-91 (2011). While these potential impacts may not be insignificant, they are upland land use changes primarily that are not within the scope of the MDE permit or the MDE\u2019s jurisdiction and, consequently, they do not support Petitioner\u2019s standing. Petitioner challenged the MDE permit based primarily on increases of nutrients and sediments. This Court should evaluate Linthicum\u2019s potential future harm proffers from the activities authorized by the MDE permit, not the larger Woodmore Towne Center development.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">ii. Amount of the Pollutant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Neither the Circuit Court nor the Majority opinion analyzed the magnitude of the alleged impact as it relates to whether Linthicum was within the affected area. While federal courts indicate that the amount of the harm is not relevant particularly, so long as there is at least an \u201cidentifiable trifle,\u201d <em>SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. at 689 n. 14, 93 S.Ct. at 2417 n. 14, 37 L.Ed.2d at 270 n. 14, the scale of the permitted activity is relevant, as a threshold matter, to determining whether there is a threat of harm. The challenged permit here authorized less than one acre of nontidai wetland fill and placement of streams into oversized culverts to eliminate or minimize the impact of channelization. Even had Linthicum shown that these activities were an actual source of the pollutants he complains of, the amount of the pollutants, and therefore the scale of these impacts, in a watershed that is over 70,000 acres, appears minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">This case differs from the scenario in <em>Sierra Club </em>in that those plaintiffs were able to point to current impacts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u00a7 404 permit, including large amounts of silt and mud around the plant. <em>Sierra Club, </em>645 F.3d at 978. Here, even after completion of the construction of the permitted activities, Linthicum did not see additional sediment, increased algae or other signs of nutrient enrichment, or any \u201cchanges visible to the human eye\u201d as a result of the construction. While visual confirmation of environmental damage, such as excessive sedimentation, is not a requirement for an appellant or petitioner challenging prospective activities under MDE permits, this should be informative to this Court\u2019s evaluation, under the reasonableness standard, of Linthicum\u2019s showing. Additionally, the absence of a visual observation of the alleged harms should guide future trial and appellate court evaluations of other relatively small disturbances in wetland and waterway permit challenges, especially where solely aesthetic interests are claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">iii. Distance from the Pollutant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Federal cases have not articulated a clear standard for gauging distance from a pollutant discharge to a plaintiffs activities that defines the affected area; rather, the affected areas are highly dependent on the individual facts of each case. The largest affected area in the relevant federal cases was 40 miles downstream of a toxic discharge of mercury. <em>Laidlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 183, 120 S.Ct. at 705, 145 L.Ed.2d at 628. In another case, however, a court declined to find injury in fact where the plaintiffs used a creek 18 miles downstream of an oil refinery\u2019s stormwater discharge. <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Crown Cent. Petrol., </em>95 F.3d 358, 361 (5th Cir.1996). The Fifth Circuit stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">At some point, however, we can no longer assume that an injury is fairly traceable to a defendant\u2019s conduct solely on the basis of the observation that water runs downstream. Under such circumstances, a plaintiff must produce some proof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Croum Cent., </em>95 F.3d at 362. This reasoning applies well to the circumstances of the instant case where there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>traditional discharge, just the alleged potential, at most, for long term, cumulative land use and hydrologic changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In yet another situation, the Fourth Circuit concluded that a plaintiffs activity, 16.5 miles downstream, was within the affected area of discharges of numerous heavy metals and chemical contaminants in excess of permitted limits. <em>Friends of the Earth v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>629 F.Bd 387, 397 (4th Cir.2011) (Gaston Copper III). Another court found that a distance of two to four miles was not too far and \u201cnot so tenuous\u201d for harm to the plaintiffs\u2019 interests from a discharge of pollutants where reports indicated regular exceeding of permit limits. <em>Friends of the Earth v. Chevron Chem. Co., </em>900 F.Supp. 67, 75 (E.D.Tex.1995). Four miles downstream of hog waste discharges was within the affected area when the plaintiff observed the water at that distance getting darker, increased algae, and dead fish floating in the water. <em>Am. Canoe Ass\u2019n v. Murphy Farms, </em>326 F.3d 505, 518 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Two Seventh Circuit cases involved pollution discharges into a lake, potentially a more static body of water. In one, the court found, based on the proposed permitted emissions from a nuclear facility, that a plaintiffs activity three miles away was within the affected area. <em>Sierra Club v. Franklin Cnty. Power of Ill., </em>546 F.3d 918, 925 (7th Cir.2008). In the other case, the court found that a plaintiff located 13 miles away from a bullet lead discharge into Lake Michigan was not within the affected area. <em>Pollack v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>577 F.3d 736, 743 (7th Cir.2008) (stating that, \u201cwithout some support for the assertion that he will be affected by the drift or polluted sediment or water, Pollack has not shown that he has standing to pursue this lawsuit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Based on the wide ranges of distances from the challenged activities in the federal cases, it would be impossible to determine in the present case if 8.5 miles downstream of the wetland fill and stream culvert is, or is not, within the affected area, based on distance alone. In the instant case, there are no permit exceedances of any pollutants from a discrete discharge point and there are no specific allegations of toxic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>chemicals or metals being released from the permitted activities. The relatively small size of the wetland and stream impacts, the large size of the Western Branch watershed, the natural occurrence and dynamic variability of nutrients and sediments in the natural environment, and the distance of 8.5 miles from the impact site to the closest point of the permitted activities and the nearest part of the Western Branch frequented by Linthicum convinces me that I cannot agree with the Majority opinion that Linthicum is within the affected area of this MDE permit or that the Circuit Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Petitioner asserts that another problem is that the wetland impacts, in concert with other similar impacts, present a cumulative harm to Linthicum\u2019s interest. Petitioner\u2019s argument finds support superficially in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s statement that a plaintiff \u201cmust merely show that a defendant discharges a pollutant that causes or contributes to the kinds of injuries alleged.\u201d <em>Gaston Copper I, </em>204 F.3d at 161. Applying this theory to multiple upstream hog waste discharges, however, the court in <em>American Canoe </em>noted that traceability is a closer call when \u201cthird parties could also have contributed to the alleged injuries.\u201d <em>Am. Canoe Ass\u2019n, </em>326 F.3d at 520. In the present case, the challenged permit activity occurs in an urban environment where there are large numbers of unrelated sources of nutrient and sediment discharges, including developments, agricultural activities, waste-water treatment plants, and natural sources, that contribute a large volume of pollutants to the Western Branch. To countenance Linthicum attributing harm to his interests from less than one acre of wetland fill and several streams placed in culverts, 8.5 miles downstream from that relatively small impact, in a relatively large watershed, without some additional support or evidence that the challenged activity is in part actually responsible, is to render meaningless the traceability requirements of federal standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In other cases where the claimed environmental harm was prospective, as in this case, plaintiffs were able to show injury in fact by demonstrating that they had a reasonable fear of pollutants that would prevent them from visiting the affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>area or would lessen their aesthetic, recreational, or economic interest. In <em>Franklin </em>Power; an environmental organization challenged the proposed construction of a nuclear power plant and demonstrated standing satisfactorily with a prospective injury in fact through a member\u2019s statement that she would discontinue her biennial recreation trips due to fears that pollutants emitted by the plant would harm her and diminish her aesthetic enjoyment of the nearby lake. 546 F.3d at 925. In the present case, Linthicum has not stopped or slowed his recreation in the Western Branch since the construction under the permit was completed, and does not state that he intends to stop in the future. Petitioner emphasizes the cumulative and prospective nature of the harm in this case, as if to ask this Court to grant him flexibility in showing injury in fact due to the complexities of the overall situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, the pleading requirements for future harm are relatively simple, as demonstrated in the <em>Franklin Power </em>case. Had Linthicum alleged that he would not return to his previously enjoyed recreation due to the permitted activity, the Petitioner would be closer to addressing the prospective harm element. Instead, Linthicum\u2019s affidavit and testimony speak to concerns and displeasure with future environmental degradation caused by cumulative urbanization in the upland areas of the watershed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Petitioner failed to show that Linthicum\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ests were in the affected area and that the alleged harms were traceable to the permit activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Pleadings and Testimony in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Linthicum\u2019s affidavit leaves little room to wonder whether he has genuine aesthetic, recreational, and economic interests in the mainstem of the Western Branch, 8.5 miles downstream of the area where the on-site streams were culverted and wetlands filled. A problem with the Majority opinion is that it takes Linthicum\u2019s alleged interests and imparts harm to these interests without requiring Linthicum to supply the correlative evidence himself. This Court should require that an appellant/petitioner make a reasonable showing of harm, based on the actual facts of the permitted activity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither Riverkeeper\u2019s pleadings nor Linthicum\u2019s affidavit or additional testimony made a threshold showing of injury in fact or traceability.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Under <em>Laidlaw, </em>the relevant showing of harm for standing falls on the plaintiff, not the environment. 528 U.S. at 181, 120 S.Ct. at 704, 145 L.Ed.2d at 627. The bulk of Linthicum\u2019s affidavit was focused on the potential environmental degradation posed by generic \u201curbanization,\u201d rather than the specific potential harm of the permitted activity. For example, he stated that \u201cthe wetlands permit ... will cause impacts to wetlands and streams in the Western Branch ...,\u201d that the \u201chealth of the Western Branch ... will suffer as a direct result of the impacts ...,\u201d that \u201cdiverting and/or compromising streams on the Subject Property <em>can </em>affect the flow rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and ecology of the tributaries ...and that \u201cdrainage of stormwater from the impervious surfaces of the Woodmore Towne Center development into the surrounding streams and watershed will further degrade the water quality of the Western Branch.\u201d (emphasis added). These are examples of Linthicum\u2019s genuine interest in, and concern for, the environment, based on generalized and assumed impacts related to urbanization. They do not explain, however, how these generalized environmental harms cause an injury to Linthicum himself. His affidavit went on to state how \u201cimpacts to wetlands on the Subject Property will also have a negative effect on my activities downstream ...but followed this statement with generalized concern for environmental degradation, rather than link the harm to his personal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Linthicum\u2019s testimony in the Circuit Court expanded on the themes of his affidavit, but continued to fail to demonstrate how the environmental degradation he attributed to the MDE permit harmed, or threatened to harm, his own interests. He stated that he was \u201cimpacted by the damage done on the site down river, whether it\u2019s nutrients, whether it\u2019s sedimentation, pollutants\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">it\u2019s very well established that what happens 10, 20,100 miles up river [ajffects the down river, and in this case, [ajffects me personally on the western branch. It\u2019s a cumulative effect, as you know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This is just the sort of \u201cwater runs downhill\u201d line of reasoning warned against by the court in <em>Croton, Central, 95 </em>F.3d at 362. Linthicum should have made a more concrete and particularized showing of how the nutrients, sediments, or pollutants, after they inevitably flow downstream, acted, or will act, to harm his particular interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">When questioned by opposing counsel during the Circuit Court proceeding, Linthicum admitted that he did not know the amounts of wetlands being filled under the permit, he had not seen the actual permit itself or the associated drawings of the impact or location of the work, and did not know any facts specific to the permit itself. While this Court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>require individual appellants or petitioners asserting standing in judicial review actions to be engineers or scientists, or even to adduce expert witness testimony, we should require them to have some knowledge of and familiarity with the actual permit they are challenging and understand somewhat the nature and magnitude of the activities to be conducted under the permit. Respondent developer produced substantial amounts of engineering and scientific studies that were submitted to the MDE during the permit process. These documents included hydrology studies that speak to one of Linthicum\u2019s concerns about the flow rate of the streams that were culverted, as well as the potential for future flooding. When information regarding the actual nature of the challenged activity is available, potential challengers to environmental permits should be required to be familiar with this information in expiation of their burden to demonstrate their standing in light of that information. This blatant disregard of available information in this record speaks to the patent unreasonableness of Linthicum\u2019s fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">When asked directly why the permit matters to him, Linthicum stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">You see the degradation, you see the aforementioned death by a thousand cuts, and you realize that a permit for 250 acres here, in and of itself is one thing, but then another one and another one and another one and another one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">He stated further that there is a \u201cdirect cause and effect\u201d between the urbanization and impervious surfaces, like the development at Woodmore Towne Center and the lower parts of the watershed that he frequents. Death of, desertification,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>and adverse impacts on the downstream area are alleged by the Petitioner to be the direct result of the challenged permit, however, these assertions are not directed towards the activities allowed under the permit and the wetland and stream impacts, but rather the general result of urbanization or pointed towards the greater Woodmore Towne Center.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Theses repeated vague themes are Petitioner\u2019s substitute for actual knowledge of the permitted activity and critical analysis of the real effects of the permitted activity. For impacts related to wetland permits, as opposed to toxic or metals discharge points, the connection is less clear and may be challenging for appellants/petitioners to prove. Despite this, potential challengers should not be encouraged to use general scientific studies about the impacts of urbanization, channelization, or impervious surfaces as a substitute, rather than a supplement, for explication of genuine and reasonable fears flowing from the proposed activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In summary, Linthicum asks this Court to equate any impact or harm to the environment from cumulative development or urbanization in the Western Branch watershed with harm to him personally. This is simply not reasonable. This would allow any appellant/petitioner or organization who uses or appreciates environmental or natural resources to say that environmental degradation is per se harm to them. I agree that, in a broad sense, urbanization can cause environmental degradation. Where I do not agree with the Majority opinion is that Linthicum, through his affidavit or testimony on this record, has shown how the permitted activity has caused, or will cause in the future, any harm to his interests. Even under the broader federal standing requirements, an appellant or petitioner must make a specific showing of how a challenged activity harms him/her/it personally, aside from his/her/ its love and devotion to the environment. \u201cDeath by a thousand cuts\u201d is not an injury in fact. I would affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County dismissing Petitioner\u2019s judicial review action for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Judge MURPHY authorizes me to state that he joins in the views expressed here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\">.

U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the 1990s required plaintiffs alleging environmental injury in federal courts to meet stringent standing requirements. In a series of decisions, the court held that (1) averments by plaintiffs that a federal agency action affecting specified tracts of land adversely affected their recreation on unspecified portions of public land <em>lacked geographic specificity for standing; </em>(2) an environmental group\u2019s allegations that, as a result of a federal action, the group\u2019s members would not be able to observe endangered species at a location the members intended to visit at an unspecified time in the future <em>lacked temporal specificity for standing; </em>and (3) a plaintiff <em>failed to meet the redressability component </em>of federal standing when a defendant came into compliance during the 60-day notice period prior to a citizen action suit being filed, since the civil penalties requested by the plaintiff were payable to the federal government, not the plaintiff, and thus could not redress any injury plaintiffs continued to suffer as a result of the former violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">However, in a 2000 decision, the court held that <em>sworn statements by plaintiffs that waste discharged from a corporate hazardous waste incinerator into a local river interfered with their recreational use of the river downstream met the \u2018\u2018injury in fact\" component </em>of federal standing since \"environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons 'for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened' by the challenged activity.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">On March 3, 2009, <em>the U.S. Supreme Court held that an association lacked standing </em>to challenge regulations of the U.S. Forest Service exempting small fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects from specified notice, comment, and appeals processes applicable to more significant land management decisions. The court determined that the group had standing with respect to the imminent and concrete harm threatened to its members by a specific project; however, since the group had voluntarily settled that portion of the dispute, it could no longer use the threat imposed by that project on its members to meet the standing requirements of Article III of the federal constitution. Furthermore, the <em>court determined that the remaining affidavit submitted in support of the group\u2019s standing stating that one of its members: (1) had suffered past injury from development on Forest Service land; and (2) wants to visit the National Forests in the future was insufficient to prove that the application of the regulations posed an actual or imminent injury to any of the association\u2019s members. </em>See <em>Summers et al. v.
