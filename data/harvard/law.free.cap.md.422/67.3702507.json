' The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction, concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing either form of impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s request for further review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling and now reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that the trial court (1) did not err or abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Petitioner to make impeachment use of the witness\u2019s prior conviction, but (2) committed reversible error in denying Petitioner\u2019s request to use make impeachment use of the conduct underlying the prior conviction. Therefore, Petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The State\u2019s lead witness at Petitioner\u2019s trial was Timika Williams. Before trial, the State moved in limine to prohibit Petitioner from impeaching Ms. Williams\u2019s testimony by asking her about a March 2007 conviction of theft of a motor vehicle. The conviction resulted from Ms. William\u2019s pleading guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. According to the State, Ms. Williams\u2019s guilty plea was unconstitutional, because she was not represented by counsel when she entered her plea and had not waived her Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Counsel for Petitioner objected to the State\u2019s motion but did not challenge the State\u2019s characterization of Ms. Williams\u2019s plea as being unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion over Petitioner\u2019s objection, prohibiting Petitioner from impeaching Ms. Williams by asking about the prior conviction or the conduct underlying it. The trial court explained its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">I\u2019m going to put on record exactly why I ruled the way I did in the State\u2019s motion in limine. I just want to make sure it\u2019s clear for the appellate record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>I find and I\u2019ll take judicial notice that the proceedings that take place in front of [the judge who accepted Ms. Williams\u2019s guilty plea] are absolutely unconstitutional. He does such things as ask people certain things, tell them to nod their head, and then he just takes pleas and just does it. There is no state\u2019s attorney present. There is no defense attorney present. There is no semblance of any type of due process or any rights given to the defendants. It is so widespread that even the federal judges in Greenbelt won\u2019t recognize that as convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">Now, I understand [Petitioner\u2019s] argument, and I am not taking anything away from it. I just wanted to make sure that the record indicated why I was ruling, not that I was saying that [Petitioner] couldn\u2019t use a conviction against the witness. It\u2019s this conviction. It\u2019s unique only to what happened in that courtroom. I have long lamented what happens there. I just wanted that on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Petitioner later asked the court to reconsider its evidentiary ruling. The Court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Ms. Williams testified that she and Petitioner at one time had an \u201cintimate relationship.\u201d She recounted that, during the early morning hours of May 17, 2007, she was in her home in Oxon Hill, Maryland. Also in the home were Ms. Williams\u2019s niece and nephew, and her friend, Kenneth Foster. At approximately 4:30 a.m., someone began ringing the doorbell and banging on the door. Ms. Williams opened the door and saw Petitioner standing on the porch. Petitioner began asking Ms. Williams why she had not called him the night before and whether anyone else was inside the house. Ms. Williams responded that Mr. Foster was in her house, but \u201che wasn\u2019t there for [her].\u201d She replied \u201cno,\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s demands that Foster come outside. Petitioner then walked back to the street and got in the passenger seat of a pickup truck. The truck began to drive away, but then backed up and stopped in front of Ms. Williams\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Ms. Williams testified that Petitioner stepped out of the truck, and, while carrying a black bag in his hand, walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>toward her. As Petitioner approached Ms. Williams, he reached into the bag. Ms. Williams \u201cgrabbed his hands\u201d and, as she did so, she felt \u201csomething in his hand in the bag\u201d; that \u201csomething\u201d was \u201cjust big and it was hard----\u201d Petitioner \u201cpulled away\u201d from Ms. Williams, who then ran into the house and locked the door. She then heard banging on the door and went upstairs, where she found Mr. Foster on the telephone, speaking with the police. Ms. Williams went back downstairs to be with her niece and nephew. She looked out the peep hole in the door and saw Petitioner sitting on the porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Police Officers Jermaine Allen and Kevin Brooks responded to the call for assistance at the Williams residence. Officer Allen arrived at the residence, and, after speaking with Ms. Williams, searched the bushes two or three feet from the porch steps. There he found a black bag. Inside the bag, Officer Allen found a revolver and several rounds of ammunition. Meanwhile, Officer Brooks stopped a pickup truck approximately two blocks from Ms. Williams\u2019s residence. Officer Brooks found Petitioner in the passenger seat and took him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Petitioner testified at trial and provided a different version of events on the night in question. He testified that he had gone to Ms. Williams\u2019s house to have her re-twist his hair (Ms. Williams is a hairdresser). According to Petitioner, when he arrived at the house, Ms. Williams tried to give him a bag but he declined to take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The jury found Petitioner guilty of carrying a handgun. At a subsequent hearing, following a pre-sentence investigation, the court imposed a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding impeachment of Ms. Williams\u2019s testimony. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction in an unreported opinion. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting Petitioner from asking Ms. Williams about either her prior conviction or the conduct underlying that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Petitioner then sought review in this Court, and we granted certiorari to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">Did the trial court err in refusing to allow defense counsel to impeach the State\u2019s \u201cstar witness\u201d with a prior theft conviction or the underlying conduct because the conviction was based on a guilty plea where the witness was not represented by counsel and had not waived her right to counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The question Petitioner presents implicates two rules of evidence relating to witness impeachment: Md. Rule 5-609(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (impeachment by prior conviction), and Md. Rule 5-608(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (impeachment by prior conduct). We will overturn a trial court\u2019s ruling on such matters only if the court \u201c \u2018exercise^] discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner or ... act[ed] beyond the letter or reason of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 696, 967 A.2d 790, 798 (2009) (quoting <em>Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 531, 898 A.2d 419, 430 (2006)) (addressing Md. Rule 5-609(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Petitioner asserts that the trial court erred by not allowing the defense to use Ms. Williams\u2019s prior conviction for motor vehicle theft to impeach her testimony at trial. Petitioner points out that the language of Md. Rule 5-609(b), which allows the use of a prior conviction to impeach a witness, \u201cdoes not contain an exception for convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel____\u201d Petitioner further argues that use of such a constitutionally defective conviction for impeachment purposes does not run afoul of due process. Indeed, Petitioner contends that the \u201ctrial judge\u2019s erroneous decision to prevent defense counsel from impeaching Ms. Williams, the State\u2019s key witness, with her prior conviction violated Mr. Thomas\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to due process of law and to confront the witnesses against him, as well as Rule 5-609.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The State disagrees, arguing that the trial court correctly concluded that the prior conviction could not be used for impeachment purposes because it was obtained without the benefit of counsel, in a process the trial court described as \u201cabsolutely unconstitutional\u201d and a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d The State suggests that, \u201c[wjhen the State demonstrated, and the defendant accepted, the constitutional invalidity of Williams\u2019s conviction, it was as if the conviction did not exist, nunc pro tunc, and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion\u201d in refusing to allow Petitioner to impeach Williams with that \u201cfunctionally nonexistent conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Maryland Rule 5-609(a) allows the use of a prior conviction to impeach a witness if \u201c(1) the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and (2) the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.\u201d Subsection (b) of the Rule instructs that \u201cevidence of a conviction is not admissible under this Rule if a period of more than 15 years has elapsed since the date of the conviction.\u201d Motor vehicle theft, the crime to which Ms. Williams pleaded guilty, is an \u201cinfa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d for purposes of the Rule. <em>See Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 270, 619 A.2d 105, 108 (1993) (explaining that, because theft \u201cis the embodiment of deceitfulness,\u201d it is an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d for purposes of impeaching a witness). The conviction, moreover, occurred in March 2007, well within the 15-year limit. The only remaining inquiry under Md. Rule 5-609(a), then, would be whether the probative value of the conviction outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice to Ms. Williams or the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The conviction at issue in the present case, however, does not call for that analysis, because the conviction is the product of a constitutionally infirm guilty plea. Our caselaw, derived from Supreme Court precedent, makes clear that such convictions cannot be used for impeachment purposes. In <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 258-59, 368 A.2d 468, 470 (1977), we cited <em>Loper v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 473, 483, 92 S.Ct. 1014, 31 L.Ed.2d 374 (1972) as \u201cdirectly govern[ing]\u201d the issue. In <em>Loper, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the \u201crule against use of uncounseled convictions \u2018to prove guilt\u2019 was intended to prohibit their use \u2018to impeach credibility\u2019,\u201d because \u201c[t]he absence of counsel impairs the reliability of such convictions just as much when used to impeach as when used as direct proof of guilt.\u201d 405 U.S. at 483, 92 S.Ct. 1014 (quoting <em>Gilday v. Scafati, </em>428 F.2d 1027, 1029 (1st Cir.1970)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That reasoning applies equally whether the prior conviction is that of the defendant or of a third-party witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In this case, it is undisputed that Ms. Williams\u2019s prior conviction was achieved without counsel or a waiver of counsel and is therefore unreliable, under <em>Loper, </em>for purposes of attacking Ms. Williams\u2019s credibility. We hold that the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>allow Petitioner to impeach Ms. Williams with evidence of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Petitioner next argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from questioning Ms. Williams, pursuant to Md. Rule 5\u2014608(b), about the conduct underlying the same conviction. Rule 5\u2014608(b) addresses \u201cImpeachment by examination regarding witness\u2019s own prior conduct not resulting in convictions.\u201d Under the Rule, the questioner must (1) show that the witness\u2019s prior conduct sheds light on the witness\u2019s personal credibility, and (2) if the opposing party objects, establish \u201ca reasonable factual basis for asserting that the conduct of the witness occurred.\u201d Md. Rule 5-608(b). Additionally, \u201c[t]he conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Petitioner sought to question Ms. Williams about the conduct underlying her conviction for motor vehicle theft. As noted above, a theft conviction is relevant to a witness\u2019s credibility under Rule 5-609(a). <em>Beales, </em>829 Md. at 270, 619 A.2d at 108. If a conviction of a crime is \u201crelevant to the witness\u2019s credibility\u201d under Rule 5-609(a), then the conduct underlying the conviction is likewise \u201cprobative of a character trait of untruthfulness\u201d for purposes of Rule 5-608(b). Accordingly, the act of theft satisfies the first prong of Rule 5-608(b). Because the State objected to Petitioner\u2019s proposed use of the conduct underlying Ms. Williams\u2019s 2007 motor vehicle theft conviction, Petitioner was obligated, under the Rule, to establish a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d for asserting that she committed the conduct underlying that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">According to Petitioner, the facts \u201c[t]hat [Williams] was both formally charged with car theft and that she admitted guilt in a court proceeding ... established the reasonable factual basis required by Rule 5-608(b).\u201d The State responds that, because the prior conviction resulted from an invalid guilty plea, Petitioner\u2019s supposed \u201cfactual basis\u201d showing that the theft occurred is really nothing more than an accusation and therefore does not establish the requisite \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>factual basis\u201d for Petitioner\u2019s assertion that Ms. Williams actually committed the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 468 A.2d 319 (1983), we addressed the common law rule regarding the use of prior bad acts to impeach a witness. The common law rule was later codified as Md. Rule 5-608(b). <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 683, 831 A.2d 432, 445 (2003). In <em>Cox, </em>the defendant, charged with sexual assault, attempted to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony accusing him of the crime by questioning the victim about a prior criminal trial in which, allegedly, the victim falsely accused the defendant in that case of assault, but later recanted her charge under cross-examination. The trial court allowed the use of the witness\u2019s alleged false testimony. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. In analyzing the issue, we had this to say about the common law rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">We have also permitted a witness to be cross-examined about prior bad acts which are relevant to an assessment of the witness\u2019 credibility. We have allowed such inquiry to be conducted when the trial judge is satisfied that there is a reasonable basis for the question, that the primary purpose of the inquiry is not to harass or embarrass the witness, and that there is little likelihood of obscuring the issue on trial----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">We have also been steadfast in holding that mere accusations of crime or misconduct may not be used to impeach. The rationale for this viewpoint is obvious.... [Accusations of misconduct are still clothed with the presumption of innocence and receiving mere accusations for this purpose would be tantamount to accepting someone else\u2019s assertion of the witness\u2019 guilt and pure hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\"><em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 179-80, 468 A.2d at 321-22 (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>1 Broun, et al., McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 41, p. 181 (6th ed.2006) (explaining that, when attempting to impeach a witness by asking about prior misconduct, \u201ca good faith basis in fact for the inquiry is always required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We later examined the \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d requirement of Rule 5-608(b), in <em>Pantazes. </em>In that case, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>dant\u2019s wife had been killed and the defendant was alleged to have hired a prostitute he frequented to commit the murder. After hearing about the murder, a witness contacted police and reported that the defendant had propositioned the witness about committing the same crime. At trial, defense counsel attempted to impeach the witness\u2019s testimony by questioning her about a previous incident in which she supposedly participated in a robbery that resulted in murder, and later falsely identified an innocent man as the killer. 376 Md. at 667-69, 831 A.2d at 435-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, counsel for the defendant attempted to establish a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d for asking about the alleged prior incident by presenting two affidavits, one from a police officer who investigated the prior incident and one from defense counsel\u2019s private investigator. The police officer\u2019s affidavit stated that the witness identified one man as the killer and that man was charged with murder, but the charges were later dismissed after the police arrested a different suspect. The private investigator\u2019s affidavit stated the same. Neither affidavit said that the witness knowingly misidentified the killer or that she in any way participated in the robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 669-72, 831 A.2d at 437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The trial court refused to allow the incident to be raised on cross-examination and the defendant later argued on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in making that ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 672, 831 A.2d at 438. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d had not been established to show that the witness\u2019s prior conduct actually occurred. Specifically, the affidavits did \u201cnot establish that [the witness] was involved in the botched robbery or that [the witness] lied about an identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 831 A.2d at 449. In other words, defense counsel\u2019s \u201cproffer of evidence amounted to little more than mere accusations....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 831 A.2d at 449. The <em>Pantazes </em>Court then quoted <em>Cox, </em>which instructs \u201cthat when impeachment is the aim, the relevant inquiry is not whether the witness has been accused of misconduct by some other person, but whether the witness actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>committed the prior bad act. A hearsay accusation of guilt has little logical relevance to the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Pantazes, </em>376 Md. at 691, 831 A.2d at 449 (quoting <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 181, 468 A.2d at 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The State asserts that \u201cthe only support for the accusation that Williams was a thief was a record showing that she had once been accused of theft.\u201d We disagree. Unlike the affidavits in <em>Pantazes, </em>which merely established that the witness in that case was claimed to have been involved in prior criminal conduct, the State\u2019s undisputed proffer established that Ms. Williams pleaded guilty to the crime of motor vehicle theft, thereby formally \u201cadmitting\u201d in open court to having committed that offense. We are satisfied that the State\u2019s proffer of Ms. Williams\u2019s formal admission of guilt provided for Petitioner the \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d required by Rule 5-608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in refusing to allow Petitioner to impeach Ms. Williams\u2019s testimony at trial by questioning her about the conduct underlying the conviction, albeit the conviction itself was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">ELD RIDGE, J., joins the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-17\">. Petitioner's first trial ended in a mistrial, the reasons for which are not raised in this appeal. Petitioner\u2019s second trial ended with his conviction, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">. Md. Rule 5-609(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(a) Generally. For tire purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during examination of the witness, but only if (1) the crime was an infamous crime or other crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and (2) the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-10\">. Md. Rule 5-608(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">(b) Impeachment by examination regarding witness\u2019s own prior conduct not resulting in convictions. The court may permit any witness to be examined regarding the witness\u2019s own prior conduct that did not result in a conviction but that the court finds probative of a character trait of untruthfulness. Upon objection, however, the court may permit the inquiry only if the questioner, outside the hearing of the jury, establishes a reasonable factual basis for asserting that the conduct of the witness occurred. The conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">.
