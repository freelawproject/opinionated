Davidson, its agent, and deposited and credited to the personal account of Davidson in the Bank. From an adverse judgment, McNutt has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-29\">The facts are these: On or about November 7, 1939, and at all times hereinafter pertinent, McNutt operated a retail and wholesale petroleum products station at Deming, New Mexico. On that date, Kim-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>bley, as agent of McNutt, opened a\u00f1 account with the Bank in the name of Mc-Nutt by depositing $35.76. Kimbley was unable to give the Bank definite instructions with respect to the endorsement of checks, deposits thereof, and withdrawals from the account. On that date, the Bank wrote a letter to McNutt at its principal office in El Paso, Texas, requesting instructions with respect to the handling of the account,' and specifically requesting instructions with respect to endorsements of' the checks in McNutt\u2019s name, the depositing thereof, and withdrawals from the account, and enclosed therewith a sign\u00e1ture card. On November 8, 1939, McNutt forwarded a letter to the Bank enclosing the signature card with the names C. Blaine McNutt and Cecil McNutt as persons authorized to sign checks and withdrawals from the account and directing the Bank to remit weekly all funds in excess of $500. The letter gave no instructions with respect to the endorsement and deposit of checks payable to Mc-Nutt, and no instructions with respect to the endorsement and deposit of checks payable to McNutt were given by it to the Bank until approximately two years after the checks herein involved were deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In 1942, Davidson succeeded Kimbley as McNutt\u2019s agent in Deming. McNutt g\u00e1ve Davidson authority to manage its retail and wholesale station, to hire and discharge employees, and when rationing came into effect, gave Davidson authority to handle its rationing account with the Bank and check thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">When Davidson made his first deposit in the Bank,- as agent of McNutt, the Bank inquired who he was and if his signature was authentic. It also gave him signature cards to send to McNutt to verify the signatures. He sent \u25a0 the cards to McNutt. They were returned and Davidson delivered them to the Bank. \u2022'</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">McNutt furnished Davidson with daily report blanks. Davidson filled'these blanks out daily and sent them to McNutt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They reflected - the sales and receipts of each day\u2019s business, the amount paid out by Davidson for necessary expenses, -and the bal-anee due McNutt. McNutt instructed Davidson' to deposit all funds to its credit in the Bank over and above a petty cash account of $25 to be kept at the station and to send duplicate deposit slips to McNutt\u2019s home office in El Paso with his daily report. Those instructions were not communicated to the Bank and it had no knowledge thereof at any time here pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Between January 15 and April 22, 1944, . Davidson received the seven checks referred to above, endorsed and deposited them as stated above, and the Bank credited them to Davidson\u2019s personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Davidson did not, in fact, have authority to endorse checks payable to McNutt other than for the purpose of depositing them in the Bank to McNutt\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">During all times here pertinent, McNutt employed Paul A. Robinson as its internal auditor. Robinson\u2019s duties were to visit all the stations of McNutt, including the one at Deming, check the accounts, cash inventories, and other matters at each station at least once monthly and examine at the home office the daily reports sent in from each station, including Davidson\u2019s daily reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Neither McNutt nor Robinson at any time notified the Bank not to accept checks payable to McNutt on Davidson\u2019s endorsement for deposit in Davidson\u2019s individual account and for a substantial period of time prior to January 15, 1944, and through April 23, 1944, McNutt accepted checks drawn by Davidson on his individual account for balances due on daily reports and made no objection to the Bank concerning the method followed by Davidson in handling funds of McNutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">For a substantial period of time prior to January 15, 1944, and during the period the checks here involved were deposited, Robinson knew that Davidson had opened an individual account in the Bank; that Davidson was depositing funds of McNutt in that apeount- and was issuing his personal checks, drawn on his individual account, in payment of the daily balances which he owed McNutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>From time to time, Davidson also purchased petroleum products from other dealers for the McNutt station, paid therefor with personal checks drawn on his individual account, and attached paid bills showing such purchases and such payments by his personal check to his daily reports to Mc-Nutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On a number of occasions, Robinson criticized Davidson for the manner in which he was handling funds of McNutt and directed him to stop the practice. Davidson complied with Robinson\u2019s direction for short periods but always resumed his former practice and continued to handle the funds of McNutt as indicated above until the latter part of April, 1944, when he left Denting without notice to McNutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In a few instances after Davidson had deposited funds of McNutt to the credit of his personal account, he drew a check payable to McNutt and deposited the same to the credit of McNutt in the Bank and, thereupon, transmitted to McNutt along with his daily report a duplicate deposit slip. In several instances, the duplicate deposit slip showed a deposit to McNutt\u2019s account in the Bank, and bore a notation in the space provided for the listing of the checks, \u201cForrest Davidson,\u201d together with the amount therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The Bank sent monthly statements to McNutt showing deposits and withdrawals from its account. The practice of remitting by cashier\u2019s check when the account exceeded $500 had been discontinued, on the instruction of McNutt, long before the checks here under controversy were deposited; and withdrawals from the Mc-Nutt account in the Bank were made thereafter by drafts drawn on the Bank by Mc-Nutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Many of the daily reports reflected cash sales by McNutt and remittance therefor was by personal check of Davidson, forwarded with the report, indicating clearly that Davidson was depositing McNutt\u2019s funds to his personal account and remitting therefor by his personal check.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">For a long period of time prior to January 15, 1944, and during the period the checks here involved were deposited, Mc-Nutt knew that Davidson was depositing McNutt\u2019s funds in his individual account, withdrawing such funds by his personal checks in payment for products purchased from other dealers, and remitting remaining balances due McNutt as reflected in his daily reports, by personal checks of Davidson drawn on his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">The trial court found, substantially, the foregoing facts. Such findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. They are binding on this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">The late Mr. Mechem in his work on Agency, Vol. 1, 2d Ed., at page 509, defines apparent authority and agency by estoppel as follows: \u201c \u2018Apparent authority is that which, though not actually granted, the principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise, or holds him out as possessing;\u2019 while \u2018Agency, or authority, by estoppel arises in those cases where the principal by his culpable negligence permits his agent to exercise powers not granted to him, even though the principal have no notice or knowledge of the conduct of the agent.\u2019 \u2018Apparent authority is not founded in negligence of the principal, but in the conscious permission of acts beyond the powers granted, whereas the rule of estoppel has its basis in the negligence of the principal in failing properly to supervise and control the affairs of the agent.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">The test is what powers, persons of ordinary prudence, familiar with business practices, dealing with the agent, without knowledge of any limitation on the agent\u2019s authority, might reasonably believe him to have on the basis of the principal\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Absence of the intention to confer any power of the character of that exercised cannot be asserted as a defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The agent\u2019s authority as to those with whom he deals, absent knowledge to the contrary, is what it reasonably appears to be.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Davidson had authority to endorse checks payable to McNutt and deposit them to its account in the Bank. McNutt, over a long period of time prior to January IS, 1944, and during the period the checks here involved were deposited, permitted Davidson to deposit its funds to his personal account in the Bank and to check such funds out in payment for petroleum products purchased for McNutt by Davidson and to remit with his daily reports balances due McNutt by Davidson\u2019s personal check. With respect to the checks for the alleged conversion of which McNutt seeks recovery, we hold it was estopped to deny Davidson authority to endorse and deposit such checks in his- personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-30\"> Hereinafter called McNutt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-31\"> Hereinafter called the Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> The daily reports from D-ecember 1, 1943, until the latter part of April, 1944, were introduced in evidence.
