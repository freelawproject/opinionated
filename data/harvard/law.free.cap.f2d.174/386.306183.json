In 1919 he contracted to purchase 331 acres of farm land, generally known as the DePriest tract, from one W. W. DePriest for $20,000 and another tract of about 424 acres, generally known as the Stewart tract, from John W. Stewart for $21,202.50. In making these contracts he acted for himself and three other individuals who had agreed to, and did, organize the Fairview Farming Company, a South Carolina corporation, to take title to these lands. The purpose of the company, as stated in its charter, was \u201cto do a general farming business with power to sell, buy and mortgage real estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">Fairview Farming Company was organized with an authorized capitalization of $25,000 represented .by 250 shares of common stock of $100 par value. Each of the four incorporators subscribed for 50 shares, paying $3,600 in cash and giving his promissory note for $1,400. On March 25, 1920, a certificate for 50 shares of stock was issued by the company to each of the incor-porators. On the same day two of them assigned their shares to the taxpayer and the other assigned his shares to the taxpayer\u2019s wife but the taxpayer was beneficial owner. Each transferee received from the taxpayer $3,600 in cash and the taxpayer\u2019s note for $1,500 as consideration for the assignment, but because of the taxpayer\u2019s subsequent financial difficulties payment of these notes was forgiven by the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">On January 6, 1920, DePriest conveyed the 331 acre tract to the corporation, which paid him $6,666.67 cash and gave him a mortgage on the property to secure payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>of the balance of $13,333.33. On March 12, 1920, Stewart conveyed the 424 acre tract to the corporation, which paid him the $21,-202.50 in cash. The necessary funds beyond the corporation\u2019s capital were supplied by a bank loan of $10,000 secured by a mortgage on the Stewart tract, and by the taxpayer, who borrowed $12,000 by giving a mortgage on his home. These two tracts of land, the DePriest tract and the Stewart tract, were the only assets Fairview Farming Company ever owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The DePriest and Stewart tracts produced a good grade of upland cotton, which was being sold in 1919 at about 40 cents a pound, and all four organizers of the corporation expected to profit from their investment. But in 1920 the boll weevil attacked the area with disastrous consequences to the value of farm land, and the price of cotton began to fall, dropping to about 11 cents a pound by the middle of 1921. The price rose slowly to a high of 34.39 cents in December, 1923; in and after 1926 it fluctuated below 20 cents, and during 1932 fell to a low of five cents. The market value of land underwent corresponding fluctuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In 1921, there began a long, continuous and complicated series of transactions in a desperate, but futile, effort by the taxpayer to salvage something from his investment in the stock of, and his loans to the corporation. These transactions involved varied loans between the taxpayer and the corporation and several banks. There were mortgages and re-mortgages, conveyances and re-conveyances of the DePriest and Stewart tracts. And, to add to the general confusion, in 1930 a new corporation was organized which played a small part in the picture. These transactions are set out and discussed in extenso by the Tax Court in its findings of fact and in its opinion. No useful purpose would be served by our again reviewing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Income tax returns for the years 1920, 1921, 1922, were filed by the Fairview Farming Company, reporting little income and no tax for 1920, losses for 1921 and 1922, On this corporation\u2019s return for 1923 was written: \u201cThis company has entirely ceased to do business.\u201d In its return for 1931, the corporation reported a gross income of $100, with deductions of $100 for taxes and $600 for interest. The charter of this corporation was revoked in 1926 for non-payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">It is elementary that as to deductions for both losses and bad debts, or other cases of deductions and exemptions from the federal income tax, the burden is squarely placed upon the taxpayer to bring himself clearly within the statutory provisions authorizing the claimed deduction or exemption. Miller Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 149 F.2d 421; Mahler v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 119 F.2d 869, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 660, 62 S.Ct. 114, 86 L.Ed. 529. And federal income tax statutes have been consistently drawn with the purpose of definitely fixing, so far as is practicable, the precise year in which a deduction or exemption must be claimed, not with the idea of leaving the taxpayer the choice of a taxable year, when his claim would inure to his greatest advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Under Section 23 of the Revenue Act of 1932, previously quoted, taxpayer\u2019s loss on the stock of the Fairview Farming Company can be deducted only for the year in which this loss was sustained. Hall v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 128 F.2d 180; Keeney v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 116 F.2d 401; Lambert v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 108 F.2d 624. For tax purposes, the particular year in which a loss is sustained is a question of fact; and particularly in the case of property such as corporate stock, when there has been no actual sale or disposition of the stock, the determination of the year in which the loss is sustained is controlled and governed by practical, economic considerations, not by theoretical speculations. In such cases, the taxpayer must definitely establish by some identifiable event or series of circumstances that the property became worthless during the taxable year in question. A. R. Jones Oil &amp; Operating Co. v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 114 F.2d 642; Brown v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 94 F.2d 101; Gowen v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 65 F.2d 923, certiorari denied 290 U.S. 687, 54 S.Ct. 123, 78 L.Ed. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Even a casual inspection of the record here will reveal that at the time of the revocation of its charter in 1926, the stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of the Fairview Farming Company was quite worthless. In January 1924, the Stewart tract (loaded with three mortgages to secure loans amounting to $18,500) was conveyed to a bank which had obtained a personal judgment against the taxpayer. While in July 1922, the Fairview Farming Company conveyed the mortgaged DePriest tract to the taxpayer, who conveyed this tract by a mortgage deed to a bank to secure a loan of $7,200, with which to pay off the balance of the purchase price. In the light' of subsequent dealings and happenings, the situation of the Fairview Farming Company, if anything, apparently went from bad to worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">So, we certainly cannot set aside the Tax Court\u2019s finding that this stock became worthless long before 1932. Consequently, taxpayer cannot deduct his loss on the stock for the year 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">What has been written above is equally applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the bad debts owed by this corporation to the taxpayer. Under Section 23(j) of the Revenue Act of 1932, quoted above, bad debts are deductible only in the year in which they are ascertained to be worthless and are charged off by the taxpayer. The taxpayer kept no regular books or records, so a mental charge-off would suffice, provided it was bona fide and the debts were actually ascertained to be worthless during the year of the charge-off. Here again, the test is reasonableness, common sense and economic reality. See Nemerov v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 690; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. MacDonald Engineering Co., 7 Cir., 102 F.2d 942. Any other rule, as Circuit Judge Chase pointed out in Ludlow Valve Manufacturing Co. v. Durey, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 508, 509, would permit the taxpayer \u201cto wait before claiming the deduction until there should be a year in which his income would be sufficient to allow him the maximum benefit, instead of taking it as the statute required in the year when the debts were both ascertained to be worthless and charged off.\u201d We have no desire to impute bad faith to the taxpayer here, yet he did, in the year 1932, receive unusually large legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Strengthening the conclusion that the taxpayer\u2019s loans to the corporation were ascertained to be worthless prior to 1932 is the fact that, as part of one of his refinancing operations in 1930, taxpayer himself cancelled the mortgages securing these loans to enable him to again mortgage the property free of any other encumbrance. The loans were thereafter unsecured and patently worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">So again we must, sustain the Tax Court in its finding that long before 1932, the taxpayer must have fully realized that there was no likelihood (not even a modicum of a Chinaman\u2019s chance) that he would ever realize anything on these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Finally, this brings us to the question of the penalty imposed on the taxpayer for his failure to file a timely return for the year 1932. This penalty is required by Section 291 of the Revenue Act of 1932 (quoted above) except when \u201ca return is filed after such time and it is shown that the failure to file it was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The taxpayer\u2019s return for 1932 was due to be filed on or before March 15, 1933. He obtained successive extensions from local revenue officials to September 15, 1933, which was the ultimate extent to which they could legally grant such extensions. When he requested a further extension beyond September 15, 1933, he was advised that no further extension could be granted and it was suggested that he should then submit an affidavit with his delinquent return, together with an explanation of the reasons for the delay. He prepared a return apparently on or before September 27, 1933, drew a check of that date for $62.05, being the amount of tax due by his computation, plus $2.10 interest and drafted a letter of the same date to the Collector, which apparently was notarized, explaining the delay. The letter and return were never received by the Collector or Commissioner; the check never cleared through the taxpayer\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">An internal revenue agent called on the' taxpayer in May, 1935, to inquire why he had not filed a return for 1932; but it was not until July 12, 1937 (more than four years after the date when the return was originally due), that the taxpayer tendered to the Collector a copy of the return pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>portedly prepared in September, 1933. At the same time he filed an amended return in which certain income was excluded as lion-taxable, leaving no tax due.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Taxpayer claimed that the return was mailed on September 27, 1933. On this question, the Tax Court had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cWe do not doubt that a return was prepared at the time alleged, but evidence that it was mailed is not convincing. Petitioner\u2019s secretary testified that she \u2018probably would have mailed it right away, the same day. In fact, I\u2019m sure I would have.\u2019 And while she made an affidavit in 1935 that she had dropped it in a mail box at the National Loan and Exchange Bank, the qualified manner of her testimony on the witness stand indicates rather an inference of mailing based on her custom in the discharge of duties rather than specific recollection in respect of this item. When the revenue agent made inquiry about the 1932 return in 1935, she made a search for the check and inquired at the bank, but found no evidence that the check had been presented or cashed, and petitioner has not produced the cancelled check or any bank statement showing a charge of his account in the amount of the check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Tax Court, accordingly, stated: \u201cWe cannot affirmatively find that petitioner\u2019s return was mailed\u201d on September 27, 1933, and approved imposition of the statutory penalty of 25%. Further the Tax Court distinguished the case of Crude Oil Corporation of America v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 161 F.2d 809. There, in upholding a presumption of receipt by the Commissioner upon proof of mailing, Circuit Judge Phillips stated, 161 F.2d at page 810, that the evidence established that the requisite return was \u201cenclosed in an envelope, properly addressed to the Collector\u2019s office at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with proper postage duly affixed thereto, and <em>deposited in the United States mail </em>at Tulsa, Oklahoma, in time to have been received by the Collector, in the ordinary course of mail, within the statutory filing period.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> The evaluation of testimony and the determination of what constitutes (under the peculiar circumstances of each particular case) \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201cwillful neglect\u201d in connection with the failure to file a timely return are peculiarly within the province of the Tax Court. In the instant case, we cannot well overturn its findings, and its holding, as to the imposition of the statutory penalty upon the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The decision of the Tax Court of the United States is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
