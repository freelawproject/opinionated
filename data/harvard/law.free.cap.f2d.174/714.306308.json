Stilwell and Edward R. Roche, filed their complaint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>September 5, 1946, to recover from the defendant, who had been their employer, unpaid overtime compensation, liquidated damages, and attorney fees pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 1069, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 216(b). Upon the jury verdict for the plaintiffs, a judgment was entered, and following the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment under Rule 50(b), Federal Rul\u00e9s of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., or, in the alternative, for a new trial, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">As to the plaintiff Roche, defendant contends that (a) a substantial portion of his claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (b) he had signed a release relinquishing his rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq., effective in view of Section 3 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of May 14, 1947, 61 Stat. 86, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 253; (c) if the release is not a bar to all of Roche\u2019s rights, it is at least a waiver of his claim to liquidated damages; and (d) under general contract law, Roche may be held to his release since he did not restore the consideration therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">As to the plaintiffs Stilwell and Roche generally, defendant contends that judgment should have been entered in its favor for lack of evidence upon which the verdict could have been based. Further, it asserts that, in any event, a new trial should be ordered because (a) the verdict returned is not supported by the evidence; (b) the plaintiffs\u2019 computation of damages is based on incorrect hourly rates; and (c) plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made improper and prejudicial remarks to the jury. Finally, it is urged that the amount awarded as counsel fee is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Undoubtedly, the defendant had, in the statute of limitations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a good defense to a substantial portion of Roche\u2019s claim. Although the applicable statute was pleaded in defendant\u2019s answer, it cannot prevail on this appeal; not merely did defendant fail to include that defense as a ground for its motion for directed verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but it further failed to request the court below to instru'et the jury on the matter, and did not object to the omission from the charge of any reference to the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 51, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As we said in Alcaro v. Jean Jordeau, Inc., 3 Cir., 1943, 138 F.2d 767, at page 771:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-15\">\u201cRule 51 is designed to preclude counsel from assigning for error on appeal matter at trial which he did not fairly and timely call to the attention of the trial court.\u201d The release upon which the defendant relies for its second defense against Roche\u2019s claim was executed on January 12, 1946.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *It recites the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>bona fide dispute between Roche -and the defendant with respect to (1) coverage by the Fair Labor Standards Act, (2) the number of overtime hours worked by Roche, and (3) the amount ,of defendant\u2019s liability under the Act. Roche released the defendant of \u201cany and all liabilities atid claims of any kind\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act which he might have by reason of overtime worked by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anz-dedup-0\">Without regard to the prior law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant seeks to establish the validity of the release under Section 3 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of May 14, 1947, 61 Stat. 86, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 253.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Section 3(a) of that statute expressly conditions the validity of a release of claims for overtime compensation upon the existence of \"a bona fide dispute as to the amount payable\u201d. We do not think that condition is complied with in the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The uncontradicted testimony of Roche was that in December of 1945, or January of 1946, over five years after he had left the defendant\u2019s employ, he received a letter from the defendant. Prior to the receipt of that letter, he had not made any claim against the defendant for unpaid overtime compensation, nor had he discussed the matter with the company, or ever had a dispute with the company concerning overtime compensation. As a consequence of the letter, he went to the offices of the defendant, and relying upon the statements therein contained, as well as the statements in the release, he signed the latter and received a check. On cross-examination, Roche stated that he had read the release. \u201cWith the exception of the recital in the release, there is nothing in the record which shows that the respondent\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) release was obtained as the result of the settlement of a bona fide dispute between the parties with respect to coverage or amount.\u201d Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\u2019Neil, 1945, 324 U.S. 697, 703, 65 S.Ct. 895, 900, 89 L.Ed. 1296. Patently, the release here is a filled-in mimeographed form.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The recital in the release of the existence of a \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d is, in our opinion, merely the declaration of a legal conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think the uncontradicted testimony as to what actually took place prior to the signing of the release could not, as a matter of law, support such a conclusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whatever else a compromise of-claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 within the meaning of Section 3 of the Portal-to-Portal Act might contain, the statutory condition to the validity of such a compromise, the existence of a \u201cbona fide dispute as to the amount payable\u201d, must be met. Since that prerequisite is not satisfied in this case, we conclude that the release here in controversy is invalid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, we do not agree with the argument, based on Section 3(b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, that the release is nevertheless binding on Roche with respect to the matter of liquidated damages: the arrangement is entire and indivisible; the failure of so substantial a portion of it as relates to overtime compensation \u2014 the root of the agreement \u2014 pulls down with it the remainder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">The defendant lastly asserts that Roche must be held to the terms of the release since he failed to restore the status quo by repaying what he had received. As to this, it need only he said that the defendant merely paid money, the amount of which can be, and was, credited in reduction of Roche\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AE3\">The remaining contentions of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>fendant, directed generally to the verdict in favor of both plaintiffs do not require extended discussion. In our opinion, they are without merit. The record furnishes adequate ground for the jury\u2019s conclusion, and the testimony, of both, the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendant\u2019s witnesses, permitted, if it did not require, the conclusion that Stilwell and Roche were paid on the basis of a 54-hour work week.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Again, with respect to the charge that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney made improper and prejudicial remarks, it should be noted that some controversy apparently exists as to what was said, and that controversy cannot be resolved because no complete record of the remarks was made. In any event, a reading of the charge to the jury discloses that the matter was adequately covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s exception to the amount of the fee awarded to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney cannot be sustained. The question of fees is one for the exercise by the trial court of its sound discretion. In view of the fact that the attorney represented two plaintiffs, and the fact that the trial below spanned five days, we cannot say that the allowance clearly constituted an abuse of. legal discretion by the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\"> The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 did not contain a limitation of actions provision. Accordingly, it has been held that the applicable statute of limitations is that of the state in which the forum is located. Republic Pictures Corp. v. Kappler, 8 Cir., 1945, 151 F. 2d 543, 545-546, 162 A.L.R. 228; Rock-ton &amp; Rion Ry. v. Davis, 4 Cir., 1946, 159 F.2d 291, 293; Caldwell v. Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 5 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 83, 85, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 759, 68 S.Ct. 59, 60. The pertinent statute in this ease is that of Pennsylvania, 12 P.S. \u00a7 31, containing a six-year limitation. Section 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 255, is a \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, but does not deal with actions commenced prior to May 14, 1947.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\"> The motion for directed verdict was general, and did not specifically state as a ground therefor the statute of iimitations.

Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp., 3 Cir., 174 F.2d 711.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-22\"> It should be noted that in neither Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\u2019Neil nor D. A. Schulte, Inc. v. Gangi, supra, note 5, was the Supreme Court faced with the question whether a bona fide dispute as to amount validated a release agreement. In none of the cases disposed of in the O\u2019Neil decision was there a bona fide dispute; in the Gangi case there was only a bona fide dispute as to coverage. As we have pointed out above, however, the Portal-to-Portal Act, in Section 3(a), now lays down the rule that there may be a compromise \u201cif there exists a bona fide dispute as to the amount payable by the employer to his employee\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b771-5\"> Cf. Hatfried, Inc., v. Commissioner, <em>3 </em>Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 628, 635; Orient Investment &amp; Finance Co. v. Commissioner, 1948, 83 App.D.C. 74, 166 F.2d 601, 604, 3 A.L.R.2d 612; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Revere Land Co., 3 Cir., 1948, 169 F.2d 469, 480, certiorari denied 335 U.S. 853, 60 S.Ct. 82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\"> Since by its verdict for Roche, the jury substantially credited his testimony, it would not have been at liberty to disbelieve his clear and uncontradicted testimony on this phase of the case. Cf., Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Martin, 1931, 283 U.S. 209, 216-220, 51 S.Ct. 453, 75 L.Ed. 983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b771-12\"> It cannot be contended with avail that this issue was abandoned in the court below because it was not submitted to the jury and neither party made a request therefor. Since the attempted compromise does not come within the permissive terms of the statute, it is void, and it is not enforceable by the indirection of permitting the defendant to utilize it as a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b771-17\"> MeCloskey &amp; Co. v. Eckart, 5 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 257, is distinguishable. In that case the plaintiff sought to recover liquidated damages after having executed a release agreement. At the time of the trial court\u2019s judgment, Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\u2019Neil and D. A. Schulte, Inc., v. Gangi, supra, note 5, were declarative of the law; the Portal-to-Portal Act became effective before the disposition of the appeal. However, the Court held the release binding, for the defendant had pleaded in its answer the existence of a bona fide dispute as to amount payable, and had denied any liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 whatsoever, while the plaintiff apparently offered no proof on the issue. It may be noted, also, that in the instant case, the Portal-to-Portal Act was effective at the time of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b771-20\"> See Restatement of the Law of Contracts, Section 480(2) (c); Restatement of the Law of Restitution, Section 65(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
