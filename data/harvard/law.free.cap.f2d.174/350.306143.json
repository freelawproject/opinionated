In short, he alleges violation of due process in being held without bail or arraignment between May <em>7 </em>and May 21, 1948, and in being intimidated into signing a statement while being so held for such period.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The writ issued and upon final hearing the petitioner\u2019s application was denied and he was remanded to the custody of the respondent because of the failure of the petitioner to comply with Sec. 2255<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Title 28 U.S.C.A., which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\u201c\u00a7 2255.

In drawing to such courts the power through 'habeas corpus to supervise the \u201cintrinsic fairness\u201d of criminal trials<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in both State and Federal courts, there has been not only a disinclination to accord full faith and credit to final judgments of trial courts of competent jurisdiction but also a readiness to grant permission to petitioners, admittedly guilty of serious offenses, to dispute, orally, collaterally, and as often as they chose, the solemn records and final judgments of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is not subject to argument that the great writ cannot be suspended in times of peace, but the proposition is also undebatable that it ought not to be abused in times of war or peace. It was doubtless to these ends that Congress .passed Chap. 153, Title 28 U.S.C.A., \u00a7\u00a7 2241 to 2255, inclusive, whereby to provide that an -attack upon a final judgment of conviction by a Federal court in a criminal case ought usually to be made first in the court that rendered such judgment, proximate to which the records, the witnesses, and the alleged despoilers of constitutional rights generally reside. It was doubtless believed that there the petitioners could get at these despoilers in frontal, rather than collateral, attacks, no more handicapped by estoppels of records or judgments than if the attacks were made in places far remote if they also alleged that the violated Constitution or \u201cintrinsic fairness\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was on their side. Then, if sudh a petitioner\u2019s effort were an ineffective test or if he failed to succeed in the court that had cast the yoke upon him, the right of appeal would still be his; and if either or' both of these efforts should prove inadequate, then he should still have access to the great, age-old, and grossly abused writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The right to the writ has never been absolute. The statute from 1789 until the present has required that for the writ to issue it must be \u201cagreeable to the principles and usages of law.\u201d The petition must be in writing and under oath. Section 454 [now \u00a7 2242], Title 28 U.S.C.A. If the petitioner be held under a judgment of a State court, a showing that he has exhausted his State remedies or that the State affords him no remedy is a condition precedent to maintaining the writ in the Federal court. If petitioner appeal's from a judgment of a court of the United States in a proceeding where the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court, Sec 466 [now \u00a7 2253], Title 28 U.S.C.A., provides that no appeal will be allowed unless the judge of the United States court who rendered the final decision, or a judge of the appellate court, certifies that there is probable cause for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The procedure in habeas corpus has been the subject of change by legislation down through the centuries but the intent and purpose of the writ have remained substantially unchanged. In the passage of Chapter 153, supra, Congress has not undertaken to suspend the writ but has set up procedure that is designed to supply a more appropriate remedy to those -unlawfully detained as well as to preserve the 'writ for those who are entitled to it and at the same time to protect it from abuse by those who do not deserve it, but who clamor for it incessantly. The additional remedy provided above has not ended or suspended the writ of habeas corpus although it may have lessened its abuse by placing some emphasis on the finality of final judgments against collateral attacks without limit, thereby rendering perjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>less tempting to tho-se of little veracity, convenient memory, or evil purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"> The Act in question has had the approval of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, the Congress of the United States, and United States District Courts in the cases of Lowe v. Humphrey, Warden, 80 F.Supp. 442, and Wong v. Vogel, 80 F.Supp. 723. Moreover, a presumption of constitutionality attends the Act. The provisions of Sec. 2255 \u2014 which are the only provisions of the chapter here under consideration \u2014 whether viewed as an additional method of testing the validity of a detention or as conditions precedent to the issuance of a writ, appear not only to he reasonable and valid but also as a highly desirable means of lessening the abuse of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The judgment of the lower Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> The order of the Court erroneously refers to the section as 2455 of Title 28 U.S.C.A. but the record clearly shows that the section involved was 2255 of Title 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-21\"> Jenks, 18 Quarterly Law Review (1902), p. 64, et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\"> See 1 Stat. 81, Sec. 377, Title 28 U.
