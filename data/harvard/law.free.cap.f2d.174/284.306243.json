Arthur Miller, Edgar Vanneman, Jr., and Campbell, Clark &amp; Miller, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b339-6\">Before MAJOR, Chief Judge, KERNER and DUFFY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Plaintiff brought this action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 51, to recover damages for injuries sustained by her husband while an employee of the defendant, which injuries allegedly resulted in his death. On defendant\u2019s motion, the lower court on November 3, 1948 dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, and the instant appeal is from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">As to the manner in which the injuries were sustained, the complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201cTwo other employees of defendant were attempting to gain possesion of a bar of soap provided by defendant for his employees\u2019 use at said premises and engaged in wrestling and scuffling about and in an altercation for the possession of said bar of soap and the use of said wash basin. While they were so engaged in scuffling about for the use of said wash basin they approached the wash basin where plaintiff\u2019s decedent was at in the act of washing and unnoticed to plaintiff\u2019s decedent suddenly and without warning one of the other said employees swung around in such a manner as to strike plaintiff\u2019s decedent very sharply and violently with great force with his elbow on plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s jaw causing plaintiff\u2019s decedent to sustain serious injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">While other questions were raised by defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, we think that the only one necessary for decision is whether defendant is liable for injuries sustained by the decedent at the hands of fellow employees as a result of their engagement in \u201cwrestling and scuffling.\u201d The answer to this question depends upon whether such employees while so engaged were acting in the furtherance of the defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">No good purpose could be served in an attempt to discuss or analyze the authorities relied upon, by the plaintiff. We have examined them and think they are not in point. We agree with the lower court that no cause of action was stated. Cf. Davis v. Green, 260 U.S. 349, 43 S.Ct. 123, <em>67 </em>L. Ed. 299; Sheaf v. Minneapolis St. P. &amp; S. S. M. Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 162 F.2d 110; Reeve v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 82 Wash. 268, 144 P. 63, L.R.A. 1915C, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The order appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
