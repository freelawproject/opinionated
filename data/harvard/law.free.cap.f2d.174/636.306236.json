The amount was stipulated by the parties. The plaintiff at Jhe time of the explosion had three insurance policies in force: A standard fire insurance policy issued by the defendant The Continental Insurance Company of the City of New York (hereafter referred to as Continental) providing coverage not exceeding $400,000; a policy issued by the defendant The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut (hereafter referred ,to as Hartford) covering accidents as defined to objects as described therein, not to exceed $100,000 per accident; and a policy issued by The Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York (hereafter referred to as Fidelity) covering various items of damage in the amount of $1,814.-40. The plaintiff brought suit against Continental and Hartford seeking to recover its property damage as well as other items not here material. The case was tried by a court and a jury. The jury found that the explosion was within the coverage of the policies issued by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The court on motions after verdict apportioned the loss equally between the defendants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-13\">Total Damage Items Insured Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVy7\">Less $1,814.40 by Continent-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adq-dedup-1\">Liability on al, Hartford</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azr-dedup-1\">Which Fidelity and Fidelity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arv-dedup-0\">Was Also</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0y\">Liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0R\">Continental $37,597.09 $ 604.80 $38,201.89</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axt-dedup-0\">Hartford 37,597.09 604.80 38,201.89</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">Fidelity (not a defendant) 604.80 604.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUt\">$75,194.18 $1,814.40 $77,008.58</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-20\">Although the policies of Continental and Hartford had the apportionment clauses which are set out in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court declined to apply them on the ground that such application would leave the insured not fully indemnified. From the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>apportioning the loss, the defendant Hartford has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"> The sole question is the correctness of the apportionment of the loss by the District Court. The answer lies in a proper reconciliation of the two basic insurance principles' here applicable: One, the insured must be fully indemnified, Employers Casualty Co. v. Ragley, Tex.Civ.App., 197 S.W.2d 536; Sherman v. Madison Mutual Insurance Company, 39 Wis. 104; and, two, apportionment clauses must be respected as valid contractual agreements, Kisow v. National Liberty Ins. Co., 220 Wis. 586, 265 N.W. 569; Fitzsimmons v. City Fire Insurance Company of New Haven, 18 Wis. 234, 186 Am.Dec. 761. It is evident as the computation in the margin discloses <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that a literal application of the apportionment clauses in the policies of the defendants would result in a deficiency or \u201cgap\u201d to the insured of $3,140.19. For this reason the District Court held that the apportionment clauses failed, and it divided the loss on a fifty-fifty basis. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The defendant Continental should pay four-fifths of the loss or $60,155.35 according to the terms of its contract. The defendant Hartford should pay $15,038.84, made up of the $11,898.65 for which it is liable under the strict terms of its contract, and $3,140.19, the amount of the deficiency or \u201cgap.\u201d We think this \u201cgap\u201d should be made good by Hartford rather than apportioned between both defendants, as Hartford contends, because the \u201cgap\u201d arises from a peculiarity in the Hartford apportionment clause and because the facts do not warrant an extension of Continental\u2019s liability beyond the limit fixed by the Continental apportionment clause, which is $60,155.35. Cf. Page v. Sun Insurance Office, 8 Cir., 74 F. 203, 33 L.R.A. 249. This distribution makes the insured whole and so far as possible carries out the contracts of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-15\"> Continental:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-16\">\u201cApportionment Clause: This Company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss from any peril or perils included in this endorsement than * * * (2) nor for a greater proportion than the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the amount of all insurance, whether valid or not and whether collectible or not, covering in any manner such loss ; * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-18\">Hartford:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-19\">\u201cOther Property Insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-21\">\u201c3.
