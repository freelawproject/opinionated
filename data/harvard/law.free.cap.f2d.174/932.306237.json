We deem it sufficient to note that Mary Eichler and the others joining in her petition did not comply with the January 30, 1940, Bar Order of the district court, which Bar Order required the presentation of the first mortgage bonds for registration and modification within five years of the date of the final decree closing the estate here involved. The district judge therefore acted properly in dismissing the petition for that reason, and the order herein appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
