HAND Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b971-23\">This is an appeal from an order denying an injunction, pendente lite, in an action under the Anti-Trust Acts, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 13-15, to restore the plaintiffs\u2019 to their privileges as baseball players and for damages for their exclusion from \u201corganized baseball.\u201d It is a sequel of our decision in Gardella v. Chandler,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which a majority of the court held that the complaint set out a claim under the Anti-Trust Acts against the defendants in that action, who together with others are defendants in this, The plaintiffs in the case \u2022 at bar moved for an injunction, pendente lite, to compel the defendants to take them off the \u201csuspended\u201d list, and to restore them to their former position as \u201celigible\u201d baseball players, freed from the \u201creserve clause\u201d contained in contracts under which they had been employed until 1946 when they accepted engagements elsewhere. The complaint alleged that the defendants, who are the owners and officers of the \u201cMajor Leagues\u201d in baseball, regularly broadcast the games play by play to distant audiences by radio and television; but neither in the complaint nor in any supporting affidavits is it alleged how great a part these activities constitute, either absolutely, or proportionately to the total activities or to the income of the business. By the \u201creserve clause\u201d a player promises that \u201cwhile under contract or reservation he will not play baseball * * * otherwise than for the Club or a Club assignee\u201d \u2014 4(a)\u2014and that \u201con or before February 15 * * * of the year following the last written notice to the player * * * the dub or any assignee hereof may renew this contract for the term of that year\u201d at a salary agreed upon, \u201cor in default of agreement the Player will accept such salary rate as the Club may fix, or else he will not play baseball otherwise than for the Club or for an assignee thereof.\u201d The club is given the privilege of terminating the contract upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>ten days notice, so that in effect the player agrees to an indefinite employment at any salary \u2014 after the first year \u2014 which the club may fix, subject to discharge at the club\u2019s pleasure. Although the complaint and the affidavits alleged generally that the defendants had a monopoly of the whole business of \u201corganized baseball,\u201d this was denied and stands unproved, saved as we could take judicial notice of it, which we cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The plaintiffs during 1946 were players with the St. Louis team under contracts containing the \u201creserve clause\u201d; but, finding better pay elsewhere, they joined Mexican teams. Whereupon the defendants, acting for the \u201cMajor. Leagues\u201d and for the -\u201cMinor Leagues\u201d (59 other teams, affiliated with them), \u201csuspended\u201d them for five years, under the sanction, that no players in the \u201cMajor Leagues\u201d or the \u201cMinor Leagues\u201d are allowed to play on any team with a .\u201csuspended\u201d player. The plaintiffs allege that this has substantially excluded them from their calling -by confining them to non-professional, or \u201csemi-professional\u201d teams. The defendants counter by alleging that the \u201creserve clause\u201d was \u201cindispensable\u201d to the conduct of professional baseball, and that they had not prevented the plaintiffs from playing on any teams except \u2022 those of the \u201cMajor\u201d and \u201cMinor\u201d leagues. The judge denied the motion on three grounds, .First, he held that the injunction would \u201cdisturb the status quo\u201d by restoring the plaintiffs to positions which they had voluntarily resigned three years before; second, he held that their rights. depended upon disputed questions of fact and law; third, he held that they had an adequate remedy at law in the recovery of da-mages. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Of these three grounds we find it necessary to consider only the second. All members of the court- i\u00f1 Gardella v. Chandler, supra,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that, if the facts alleged in the complaint, which\u2019 was all that was before us; had been the same -as in Federal Baseball Club v.. National League,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it would have been our duty to follow that decision, and to hold that the defendants were not engaged in interstate commerce. Judge Chase held that that decision was authoritative in.spite of the hew facts alleged in the complaint; Judge Frank and I thought otherwise, although we did so for not quite the same reasons. We both thought that radio broadcasting from the \u201cball-parks\u201d of narratives of the games play by play, and projecting the actual scene by television, might make the defendants\u2019 activities interstate commerce, but Judge Frank thought that it was necessary to look only at the absolute extent of the radio broadcasting and television. If that was substantial, it colored the sum total of the activities and made the business interstate, regardless of the proportion which it bore to the whole. ' I thought that there had been some interstate activities in the Federal Baseball Club v. National League, supra, but that the. court did not regard them as enough to make the business interstate. It seemed to me that it was a question of the proportion of the interstate activities to the whole business, and' that the new activities of radio broadcasting and television should be added to the earlier interstate activities, and the sum should be compared with the business as a whole. So far as concerns the present record, it makes no difference which of us was right, for it does not appear what is the extent of the radio broadcasting or the television, either absolutely, or proportionately. We are all agreed that the bare allegation in a complaint that the defendants make contracts with broadcasting and television companies will not support the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Apart from the question of jurisdiction, we are not prepared to say that, on the record now before us, the \u201creserve clause\u201d violates the Anti-Trust Acts. Such a. determination may involve consideration, among other things, of the needs and conduct of the business as a whole. We do not mean that it would not be otherwise, if the record showed, with enough certainty to support a preliminary injunction, that-the defendants have established a monopoly of the baseball business, and that the \u201creserve clause\u201d is a means of maintaining it. If it be established that they do have such a substantial monopoly, the \u201creserve clause\u201d will take on a different face, as to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>which nothing we say now must be understood to express any opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold, not only that we should not reverse what was in any event a discretionary order, but that the judge came to the only conclusion legally open to him on the record. It would, however, seem highly desirable that the cause should be preferred, and that it should be brought to trial as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-25\"> 172 F.2d 402, 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-6\"> 2 Cir., 172 F.2d 402, 408.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-9\"> 259 U.S. 200, 42 S.Ct. 465, 66 L.Ed. 898, 26 A.L.R. 357.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
