HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b343-29\">The plaintiff, who represents employees of the defendant, appeals from a judgment dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in an action to recover damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq. The only question is whether the employees were entitled to added overtime upon payments made to them during the years 1940-45, both inclusive, under an \u201cEmployee Participa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tion Plan,\u201d which went into effect on January first, 1940, and a copy of which we annex in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts that this bonus should be treated as an addition only to the regular \u201crate\u201d, and that the employees were therefore entitled to an added fifty percent of that proportion of it which overtime bore to straight time and overtime combined. The defendant asserts that the bonus should be allocated propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tionately to all the pay received \u2014 straight time and overtime \u2014 with the result that no added overtime is due.</p>\n<p id=\"AFU\">On February 5, 1945, the Wages and Hoars Administrator issued an \u201cInterpretative Bulletin,\u201d of whose relevant part \u2014 \u201cCategory B\u201d \u2014 we annex a copy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Its meaning is not altogether clear, and it is in any event\u2014 as it itself declares \u2014 only a declaration of the Administrator\u2019s \u201cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>forcement policy,\u201d which '\u201cdoes not and cannot affect the independent right of employees * , * * to ' recover wages that are due 'them.\u201d As we bead it, it means that unless a bonus is paid at intervals of three months or less, the Administrator will not add any overtime at all, and that even when it is-paid at such intervals no overtime will be added, if the bonus is \u201cbased upon a percentage of his\u201d- \u2014 the employee\u2019s \u2014\u201ctotal earnings,\u201d because in such cases it includes the payment of both straight time and overtime. The Administrator has not the power to issue regulations in the ordinary sense, and his \u201cBulletins\u201d have not the force of law, though they- should be deemed to have the authority of. an administrative \u25a0 interpretation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As res nova, we do not agree that no overtime should be added to a regularly paid bonus which is paid at longer intervals than three months. That may be a desirable limit for the.- Administrator to impose upon himself in enforcement cases because of the accounting ing difficulties.it avoids, but it is not a val-lid defence in actions by employees. On the other hand, we -accept the Bulletin as an administrative interpretation \u2014 -applying as well to bonuses payable at longer interyals than three months, as to those paid at other intervals \u2014 in so far as it declares that to a bonus \u201ccomputed\u201d \u25a0 or \u201cbased\u201d upon a \u201cpercentage\u201d of \u201ctotal earnings\u201d overtime need not be added. This we do because, quite aside from any interpretative authority of the \u201cBulletin,\u201d we should- independently so interpret \u00a7 7(a) of the Act. A bonus which varies in' proportion to \u201ctotal earnings,\u201d varies in proportion to the sum of the straight time payments and the overtime payments, and a percentage of an aggregate is ordinarily eom'p\u00fcted upon every unit\u2019 of the aggregate, unless some other purpose appears. It would be purely gratuitous to apply the percentage to \u201ctotal earnings\u201d over a period upon each dollar of straight time, but upon only sixty-seven cents of each dollar of overtime. Indeed, the plaintiff makes no such argument; -his position is that the percentage must be applied to \u201ctotal earnings\u201d made in the year in which the bonus is computed and paid. In this we .think that, he is in part right and in part wrong; but before -giving our reasons for this we must analyze in some detail how the \u201cPlan\u201d operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The bonus received in any year was made up as follows: The -company'subtracted from its earning's six percent of an amount which it estimated to be the capital contribution of its, shareholders; and then found the percentage which the remainder of its earnings bore to the capital so estimated. This percentage was used as the multiplier of a multiplicand, made up of one-half the sum of the employee\u2019s total earnings over the last five years, including the year in question; and the product Was the bonus. Obviously it was made\" up of five components, each computed by using the same multiplier upon one-half the employee\u2019s earnings in each of the past four years and in the current year. (For simplicity we disregard those cases in which an employee had served less than five years; and we assume that the \u201cPlan\u201d dates from its \u201ceffective\u201d date, January 1, 1940,-although it was only \u201cannounced\u201d on April 10, 1940.) For reasons which will appear, it is somewhat easier to- begin with the year, 1944. The \u201cPlan\u201d had been in existence five years on December 31st of that year, so that each of the five multiplicands used in computing the bonus for that year was one-half the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d of a year during which the \u201cPlan\u201d had been in effect. It is hardly necessary to say that, if , to each of the five components of the bonus, computed on those multiplicands, no overtime should be added, none should be added to the whole bonus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>paid in that year. However, during each of the years 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943 each employee knew that to his \u201ctotal earnings\u201d for that year would be added a bonus which he would receive in five installments \u2014 if he remained in service so long \u2014 one component paid in the year in which the earnings were made, and one paid in each of the succeeding four years. Had the five components been computed upon half the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d for 1940, and been paid in that year, the result would have been the product of a multiplicand of two and one-half times the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d for that year multiplied by the percentage fixed for that year. It is plain that at least to the first component \u2014 that paid in 1940 \u2014 no overtime should he added. Had the payment of the other four 'components been merely, deferred to four successive years \u2014 the percentage remaining the same \u2014 to each of them also no overtime would be added,, for overtime 'does not depend upon the date at which a bonus 'is paid. Thus, the only question is whether there is a valid distinction between the component paid in 1940 and the four components paid in future years because the multipliers' \u2014 -\u201cpercentages\u201d\u2014used varied in .every year. We think not. Whatever percentage was used to compute .a component of a bonus based upon the '\u201ctotal earnings\u201d of 1940, the product had \u25a0for :its \u2022multiplicand the same ,sum \u2014 one-'half \u00a1the amount of those earnings. There was mo \u00a1more reason to assume, when the component for 1940 of the bonus paid in 1944, for example, was computed by the use of The percentage fixed in 1944, that that percentage was not applied upon every dollar.of .the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d of 1940 \u2014 straight time \u00a1and overtime \u2014 than to assume that the percentage fixed in 1940 was not applied to every .dollar of the same earnings to determine the component for 1940 of the bonus paid in 1940. In each case, unless some reason existed .to the contrary, the percentage -should be .assumed to be applied ratably upon .every .dollar of the multiplicand. There was no reason to the contrary, and we hold that no overtime was payable upon the bonuses paid in 1944 and 1945, both of -which -.were .entirely made up of deferred payments ox .components computed upon '\u201ctotal -earnings\u201d made during years while the \u201cPlan\u201d was in operation. Obviously, the same result follows as to the component for 1940 of the bonus' paid in 1940; as to the components for 1940 and 1941 of the bonus paid in 1941; as to the components for 1940, 1941 and 1942 of the bonus paid in 1942; and as to the components for 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943 of the bonus paid in 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There remain those components of the bonuses paid in 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943 which were computed upon years before 1940, during which the \u201cPlan\u201d was not in operation. It is indeed true that the component for even these years was computed upon the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d of the employee in that year. Had the \u201cPlan\u201d been in operation before the Act took effect on Octp-ber 24th, 1938, there would have been good reason for saying that, since the bonus was computed upon the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d for the year 1937, for example, no overtime ought to be added, although it was paid in 1940. However, the \u201cPlan\u201d went into operation only in 1940; and there is a valid distinction between a percentage applied to \u201cearnings\u201d in a past year, and that applied to those which are in process of being made. Both are, it is true an \u201cincentive\u201d to the employee, as is any bonus; but the first is an \u201cincentive\u201d which does not depend upon the extent that the employee exerts himself; he gets it, regardless of the amount of his earnings during the period for which it is paid, just as he gets a bonus paid as a lump sum, or one computed upon the employer\u2019s capital, or even upon his. profits. When a percentage is applied to. an employee\u2019s current earnings, it would, as we have said, normally be treated as an increase in each unit of pay \u2014 straight time and overtime \u2014 just as any percentage is ordinarily reckoned; and it may be asked why .a percentage taken on past earnings\u2014 overtime plus straight time \u2014 should not also be so taken. As mere matter of mathematics that may be true; btit there is a reason here for distinguishing. A percentage paid upon current earnings is an \u201cincentive,\u201d or inducement proportional to the amount of the employee\u2019s endeavors; it operates like his pay, which also varies with those endeavors, whether the unit be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>fixed by <em>the </em>hour, or by the piece. In substance, it has the same effect, as between employee and employer, as though it was added to each unit of pay, the unit and a half earned for overtime as well as the unit earned for straight time; and it ought to be deemed the equivalent of an increment to each of the units for current work. Obviously that is wholly untrue, when it is applied to past earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">There is, moreover, an added reason for the same result. The purpose of the Act is to put a premium upon shorter hours by making overtime more expensive than straight time to employers. When the amount of a bonus does not depend upon the hours of work performed in the period for which the bonus is paid, it does not serve to deter overtime, unless some payment is added for overtime; but, when the amount varies with the proportion of the amount paid for overtime, it carries its own deterrent, and to add to it an overtime factor would be to impose overtime upon overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We hold therefore that the judgment was erroneous in dismissing the complaint, and that upon the face of the allegations overtime was payable upon all the components of the bonuses paid in 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943, which were computed upon the \u201ctotal earnings\u201d of employees made before 1940. We do not, of course, undertake to say that the defendant has no defenses to these components, for no answer has been filed. We do hold that as to those components of any of the bonuses which were computed upon \u201ctotal earnings\u201d made after December 31, 1939, no overtime was due. As we have already said, we have assumed for simplicity that the line of cleavage should be January 1, 1940, and not April 10, 1940; we do not mean to foreclose the plaintiff as toothat, if he wishes to establish April 10, 1940, as the right line.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Judgm\u00e9nt reversed; cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\"> \u201c \u2018Employee Participation\u2019 Plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC5o\">\u201cEffective as of January 1, 1940, the Company has decided to inaugurate a plan of \u2018Employee Participation,\u2019 to be based on the Net Earnings of the Company, after all taxes, for each calendar year beginning January 1, 1940.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cThis \u2018Employee Participation\u2019 is not to be considered as a substitute for wages or salaries, but is to be paid in recognition of the value to the company of trained, steady, cooperative employees, and the added effective thought and effort they may put forth to bring additional profits to the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\n<em>\u201cWho Is a \u2018Participant\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cEach employee, with the exception of the executive staff, automatically becomes a \u2018participant\u2019 when he has been employed during all or part of at least twenty-six separate weeks during the calendar year, provided he is still on the company payroll on April 30th, of the following year, and provided that no layoff between January 1st of the calendar year and April 30th of the following year has exceeded thirteen weeks continuous duration.

There are many variations and refinements of plans within this category. For example, the amount of the payment may vary according to the length of service of the employee; his production or compensation; the earnings, production or compensation of the group of employees with which he works; the sales or net or gross income of the employer; or it may be contingent upon his continuing in the employ of the employer until the time the payment is to be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">\u201cBonus payments of this type will be considered a part of the regular rate at which an employee is employed, and must be included in computing his regular hourly rate of pay and overtime compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">\u201cMany employers have been troubled by retroactive allocation of a \u2018bonus\u2019 where it was distributed less frequently than at the regular pay periods.

As an enforcement policy to be followed in the absence of authoritative rulings by the courts, the Divisions will in the future not insist on the inclusion of any bonus (except where there is obvious evasion of the overtime requirements) which is paid at greater intervals than quarterly in computations of the \u2018regular\u2019 or \u2018basic\u2019 rate of pay for overtime purposes, even though the bonus would otherwise be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>a, type requiring such inclusion., Such considerations as the recognized bookkeeping difficulty confronting employers, in allocating a bonus paid less- often than once each quarter to the hours in which the bonus was earned, the time-consuming burden placed upon, the inspection staff when confronted with the. task of making such allocations and. the benefit to employees of having a current knowledge of the hourly rate upon which their overtime will be calculated motivate this administrative policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u201cThis enforcement policy, of course, does not and cannot affect the independent right of employees, under Section 16 (b) of the Fair Labor \u25a0 Standards Act to bring their own suits to recover wages that are due them.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Overnight Motor Transp.

The Act itself is silent as to bonus payments. The only significance under the Act of a bonus arrangement is its bearing upon the regular rate in fact payable to an employee during the work week in which he performs his services. Where the bonus is based upon a percentage of the total compensation for both straight time and overtime received for a given work week, the bonus does not involve any violation of \u00a7 7 as the opinion of the Chief Judge clearly demonstrates with respect to employees whose employment by the defendant did not antedate 1940. I am unable to follow the distinction made with respect to employees whose employment does antedate that year. The plan as I interpret it, is retroactive as to them and provides a bonus for services performed in such earlier yean, e. g. 1939, based upon a percentage of the employee\u2019s total earnings in that year, provided he continues to work for the defendant throughout 1940. In so far as the bonus is based on his earnings in 1939, it is a pure gratuity since he had no expectation of receiving it when he performed those services. That part of the bonus cannot reasonably be considered as an incentive payment for 1940 services because, regardless of his 1940 earnings, the component based on 1939 earnings will remain unchanged. To hold that such component must be deemed to increase the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for straight time services in 1940 produces, in my opinion, an unjust result not required by any previous decision under the Act. I would affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
