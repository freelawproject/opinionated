We have accordingly re-examined the record, and find that two of the other \u201cConfessions\u201d magazines have been registered and published in years past by a competitor of appellant, McFaddin Publications, and that the third, \u201cMystic Confessions\u201d, was registered and published by a wholly owned subsidiary of appellant during the year 1938. We, therefore adhere to our original opinion, as it sufficiently appears from the pleadings and exhibits in the case that the word, \u201cConfessions\u201d, is merely descriptive , of a class of popular monthly publications, and has acquired no secondary meaning as identifying only plaintiff\u2019s publication, \u201cTrue Confessions\u201d. Cf. Crime Confessions, Inc., v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., 139 F.2d 499, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 760. The petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
