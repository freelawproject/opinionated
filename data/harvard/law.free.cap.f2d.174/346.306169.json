The plea sustained and the suit dismissed, the plaintiff is here appealing from the judgment of dismissal on the ground that under the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Act 20 No. of 1914, as amended, the judgment in the state court suit was subject to be modified, and, being so subject, it was not a bar to the suit in federal court</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">This will not do. Sec. 4408, Dart\u2019s Louisiana Statutes Act No. 20 of 1914, \u00a7 18, as amended by Act No. 85 of 1926, provides that the judgment rendered by the court in a compensation suit shall have the same force and effect and may be satisfied as other judgments of the same court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">It is true that Sec. 4410, \u201cModification of judgment of compensation\u201d, does provide for a review \u201cby a judge of the Court that rendered the judgment sought to be modified upon the application of either party, on the ground that the incapacity of the employee has been subsequently diminished or increased, or upon the ground that the judgment was obtained through error, fraud or misrepresentation.\u201d Act No. 20 of 1914, \u00a7 20, as amended by Act No. 85 of 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">The proceeding below was not, it could not have been, such a proceeding for review. It was not filed in the same court which renderedn the judgment pleaded in bar. It was filed before that judgment was rendered. In addition, it was brought as an independent suit and not as a proceeding for review upon any of the grounds set out in Sec. 4410.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">The judgment of dismissal was right. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
