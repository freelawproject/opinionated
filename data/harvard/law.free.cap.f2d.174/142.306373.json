The arms appear to support a miniature plaque or picture of a flower.\u201d Ap-pellee has disclaimed the words \u201cFlowers Air Delivered\u201d which are arranged about the upper margin of the bird wing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-18\">It is alleged in appellee\u2019s application for registration that appellee has used its mark on its goods since August 22, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-19\">In its notice of opposition, appellant alleges that it is \u201ccommonly and almost invariably referred to by its members and by florists in general and by persons dealing with the association and it's members, as \u2018F.T.D.,\u2019 and that this abbreviation is commonly used in Opposer\u2019s magazine, advertising, other printed matter, and letters, and that such use of \u2018F.T.D.\u2019 with reference to and by Opposer long antedates the use alleged for the trade-mark opposed\u201d; that the opposer in October 1939 adopted as its emblem and the trade-mark of its members a circular seal depicting the mythological character Mercury in a running posture and including the words \u201cAuthorized Florists\u2019 Telegraph Delivery Shop,\u201d with the letters \u201cF,\u201d \u201cT,\u201d and \u201cD\u201d relatively enlarged and thus rendered extremely prominent, and that said emblem or trade-mark has since been continuously used by substantially all of opposer\u2019s members on their premises, delivery boxes, and tags, and has appeared consistently in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>advertising and other printed matter, and that said trade-mark was registered 'by op-poser as a collective mark under date of May 23, 1944, registration No. 407,189, for natural flowers and plants in class 1, Raw or Partly Prepared Materials; that opposer\u2019s expense for publicity currently exceeds $125,000 per year; that the mark whereof registration is opposed is for precisely the same goods as those with which opposer\u2019s name and the aforementioned very common abbreviation, \u201cF.T.D.,\u201d are thoroughly identified; that the abbreviation \u201cF A D\u201d prominently appearing in the mark opposed is unduly, unnecessarily, and confusingly similar to the abbreviation \u201cF.T.D.\u201d; that the abbreviation \u201cF.T.D.\u201d through long continued and extensive use to designate opposer and its members and their goods, has become well recognized in the floral business, and allied businesses, and by a considerable section of the general public; that use and registration of the trade-mark opposed will cause confusion in the trade and in the mind of the public, and will do irreparable damage to appellant and its members; and, that the use or registration of the opposed mark would constitute a substantial appropriation of opposer\u2019s corporate name, in view of the common recognition of \u201cF.T.D.\u201d as an abbreviation of such name.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Each of the parties introduced evidence, filed briefs, and were represented by counsel at the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The evidence establishes that the appellant does not sell or grow flowers and does not provide or produce florist\u2019s supplies, but rather it is an organization composed of independent wholesale and retail florists, growers, and dealers in florist\u2019s supplies; that it renders services to its members, such as conducting a clearing house for flower sales by wire transactions, stimulating patronage of members of its association by advertising and by publishing a magazine of interest to florists; that it provides facilities whereby purchasers may place orders with nearby members of the association for the delivery of fresh flowers and plants at distant domestic and foreign points through other members located in the areas of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The evidence also establishes that appel-lee is an independent wholesaler of flowers; that it sells flowers to retail florists and fills orders for flowers by shipments via refrigerated express cars or via air express; that appellee advertises in various publications circulated among florists; and, that when orders are shipped by air express, it applies to the packages a label bearing the trade-mark sought to be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In his decision, the examiner held that the mark of appellant is so distinctively different from that of appellee that it obviates any likelihood of their confusion in use, but that appellant was entitled to prevail under the name clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905; that \u201cF.T.D.\u201d when used in connection with the florist trade is widely known as a name of the appellant; that appellant must be regarded as the owner of the name \u201cF.T.D.\u201d; that \u201cIn sound the difference between this term \u2018F.A.D.\u2019 and the opposer\u2019s abbreviated name \u2018F.T.D.\u2019 are deemed to be negligible\u201d but \u201cthat the concurrent use of the mark and name in competitive businesses is quite likely to cause deception of purchasers and confusion of identities of the parties,\u201d and he accordingly sustained the notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The commissioner reversed that decision of the examiner and held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">\u201cEven were applicant\u2019s mark merely the letters \u2018F A D,\u2019 it would differ very considerably from the initials \u2018F.T.D.\u2019 The two notations viewed as a whole do not look alike, nor do they sound alike when spoken. But \u2018F A D\u2019 is not applicant\u2019s mark. The mark comprises those letters printed in a \u2018particular or distinctive manner\u2019; and it is only when not so \u2018written, printed, impressed, or woven\u2019 that the name of a corporation is forbidden registration by section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">We do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention that it and appellee are engaged in the same business and that competition exists between the parties. Appellee sells flowers to retailers of flowers. Appellant does not sell flowers, but rather furnishes services to its members as hereinbefore mentioned. The record discloses that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>pellant does not consider appellee as a competitor. Mr. Besemer, executive secretary and general manager of appellant corporation, testified as follows: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">\u201cXQ 138. Mr. Besemer, does the Florists\u2019\" Telegraph Delivery Association have any competition in the delivery of flowers by telegraph instructions ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cXQ 139. Will you name them? A. The Telegraph Delivery Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cXQ 140. Do you have any knowledge of the size of that concern? A. You mean, as far as membership is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cXQ 141. Yes. A. I believe that their membership is between 3,000 and 3,500,'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cXQ 142. As I understand it, your membership in the United States approximates 6,500? A. About 6,750.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cXQ 143. Roughly, then, they are about half the size of the F.T.D. Association? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">.\u201cXQ 144. Is there. any other competition? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">In the absence of a competitive relationship between the parties, we are unable to find that appellant would be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark, and we accordingly hold that appellant has no right to oppose the registration of the mark here in issue under section 6 of the TradeMark Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 726, as amended 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 86, Pocahontas Operators Association v. Carter Coal Co., 160 F.2d 114, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 926, 935; that, as held by the commissioner, applicant\u2019s mark, \u201cF A D\u201d is registrable under the name clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85; that appellant\u2019s \u201cF.T.D.\u201d is not itself a valid mark under that clause; and that, a fortiori appellee\u2019s mark is not subject to opposition on the grounds of confusing similarity with appellant\u2019s \u201cF.T.D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
