His main contention, that a pre-trial investigation under Article of War 70, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1542, is jurisdictional, and that there were defects in it which deprived the court of jurisdiction, have been examined and discussed by us in a similar situation in Jackson v. Hiatt, 5 Cir., 170 F.2d 630. What was said there applies fully here. We think it quite plain that the record on this appeal establishes that the appellant was at the time of the offense charged subject to military law and to trial for that offense by general court martial, that the court martial was properly constituted, and that the record raises no question as to the jurisdiction of the court of petitioner\u2019s person and of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-30\">The judgment was right.<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1a\">\n<p id=\"b525-31\"> Waite v.
