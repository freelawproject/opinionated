The district court dismissed the action at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case upon the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent had been shown to have been guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. In so ruling the court correctly applied the applicable law. Cleary v. Philadelphia &amp; Railroad Co., 1891, 140 Pa. 19, 21 A. 242; Sheehan v. Philadelphia Railroad Co., 1895, 166 Pa. 354, 31 A. 120; Ellis v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 1907, 216 Pa. 415, 65 A. 803; Hamilton v. Central R. R., 1910, 227 Pa. 137, 75 A. 1058; Witi-ak v. Deleware &amp; Hudson R. R. Corporation, 3 Cir., 1946, 153 F.2d 379. The district court also held that the plaintiff had failed to show that the defendant was negligent. We need not pass upon, this question, however, except to say that upon no theory was the evidence sufficient to support a finding of willful or wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
