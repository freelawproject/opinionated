This 'hearing took place on April 22 through 25, 1946. On January 15, 1947, the Commission adopted a proposed decision looking to a grant of Mid-America\u2019s application and a denial of that of Kentucky. By order of April 4, 1947, the Commission severed and granted the application of Indiana, thus leaving for comparative consideration the mutually exclusive applications of Kentucky and Mid-America. The validity of this severance order is not challenged by any party to this appeal and is not in issue in the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Exceptions and requests for oral argument on the proposed decision having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>filed, oral argument was., 'held before the Commission <em>en banc </em>on April 24, 1947. Briefs were thereafter filed with the Commission by Kentucky and 'by Mid-America. On October 24, 1947, the Commission -released its, .final -decision granting the application of Mid-Ame-rioa and -denying that of Kentucky. Following that final decision, Kentucky -filed with the -Commission (1) -a petition for -rehearing based on alleged newly discovered evidence, (2) a -request for -oral argument before the Commission <em>en banc, </em>and (3) a supplemental \u25a0request f-or oral argument. By -memorandum opinion and -order released April 12, 1-948, the Commission -denied these three requests and Kentucky promptly -appealed to this -court. Int-ervenor, Mid-America, is currently operating Station WKLO at Louisville as the result of the grant appealed from 'herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We have examined the comparatively small record before us in this case -and see no ground for -disturbing the' decision of appellee -Commission. We shall consider briefly below a few -of the many assignments -of error -raised by appellant. All other -contentions of appellant -not specifically mentioned herein are, -of -course, 'Considered insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Kentucky complains that it .is \u201cmanifestly -clear\u201d that the Commission in ruling against it \u201cgave consideration and controlling weight to extralegal considerations,\u201d namely, -that the Commission -in its decision attached undue importance to the -fact th-at Mid-America had formerly been granted -a permit t-o construct the facilities it now -operates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a preliminary, we wish -to state -th-at the Commission\u2019s prior rulings with regard to the same applicant for .the -same facilities cannot properly be characterized as \u201c-extralegal considerations.\u201d But, he that as it may, study -of the record -and of the -several opinions -of the Commission makes -it clear that this factor was definitely not given control-ling, or even substantial, weight below, hut rather was mentioned -in passing by the Commission in support of its -co-m-ment that Mid-America- was no-t then seeking for the first time, to render broadcast service to \u00a1the Louisville -a-r-ea. We feel the -Corn-mission acted pro-perly in this respect and that Kentucky\u2019s -contention is not supported by tlie record. We 'know ro-f no -rule of law which absolutely precludes the -Commission from <em>any </em>consideration -o-f the priority of applications filed with the -Commission -so long as that consideration -is not the -controlling factor in arriving at a final decision as between two mutually exclusive -applications. It was not the -controlling fa-c-tor -in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Appellant calls attention to the Commission\u2019s prior decision in In re Valdosta Broadcasting Co. et al.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and -complains of th-e 'Commission\u2019s failure to follow that decision. In\u2019 the Valdosta -case the Commission granted the application of an existing licensee -and denied the mutually exclusive application for new service and indicated in its decision that, all -other factors being -equal, it would prefer an existing licensee t-o a newcomer. A preliminary answer to Kentucky\u2019s -claim that the Commission erred -in not -following its Valdosta decision is the -rule -of -law -th-at the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is not generally applicable to the decisions of administrative tribunals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Howev-er, even assuming that the 'Commission is bound by i-ts own -prior 'determinations, the Valdosta case is factually distinguishable -from the inst-ant c-ase. In -the Valdosta case -the Commission\u2019s decision -makes it -clear that there the program -proposals -o-f the two -competing applicants were equally meritorious. That is not true in the present case, as will be -seen below, and accordingly there was no -occasion to -indulge in the presumed preference -of -an existing licensee over a newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The Commission expressly found that on th-e basis -of superior -loc-al programming toe application -o-f Mid-America was to be preferred o-ver that of Kentucky. Thi-s finding -see-ms to have been the chief determinative factor in the -case, -if -any -on-e factor -can -safely he called the deciding -one in a c-ase such -as -this.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find ample and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>substantial evidence of \u00a1record to support the finding that Mid-America\u2019s \u00a1proposed service would better serve the community needs of Louisville \u00a1and environs than would that of Kentucky. Kentucky is, and was at \u00a1the time of the \u00a1proceedings below, a network affiliate. Mid-America proposed, and is now presumably providing, new, local, non-network program service. Mid-America proposed the \u00a1carrying of musical programs by local organizations -such as the Louisville Philharmonic Orchestra and the Louisville Summer Opera. Kentucky\u2019s proposals \u00a1contained no such local \u00a1musical service. Mid-America planned to -broadcast religious programs -from local churches. The -religious programs carried and proposed by Kentucky were solely network programs. Mid-America proposed various locally-originated -programs of cultural, dramatic -and forensic nature. There were no -comparable proposals by Kentucky. Mid-America\u2019s proposed -coverage -far exceeded that of Kentucky with respect to farm programs of immediate interest to -the -rural populace in areas -immediately surrounding Louisville. As to local news service, Kentucky had no members of its staff \u00a1assigned to gathering local news and obtained such news only from the Associated Press wire service. On the other hand, Mid-America proposed to establish \u00a1a -staff of three to -gather -and \u25a0disseminate local news, this in \u00a1addition to providing the usual wire service news broadcasts. It is thus apparent that the \u25a0Commission wa-s completely correct in -deciding in favor of Mid-America on the basis of far superior local program proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">A further factor which the -Commission considered \u00a1and mentioned in its written decisions but which w-as not given -controlling weight was that of local residence of the stockholders and directors of the two competing applicant corporations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this respect -the two applicants hung in equal balance and there is no doubt that the Commission \u00a1could -have properly \u00a1found that either -o-r both met the requisite residence -requirements. Kentucky -allegedly had 70% \u00a1of its stock -owned by \u201cestablished residents. \u2022 \u00a1o-f Louisville,\u201d whereas 55.6% \u00a1of Mid-America\u2019s stock was owned by Louisville residents. However, the -record shows -that the great majority of \u2019Mid-America\u2019s stockholders and -directors are long-time -residents of Loui-sville, -several of whom were born \u00a1and raised in Louisville -or nearby in Kentucky. , Almost all -of Kentucky\u2019s stockholders and -directors came -to reside in Louisville since or during World War II. On this state of the \u00a1record, we -certainly would not- be justified in ruling th-at the Commission arbitrarily or capriciously -chose Mid-America -over Kentucky -on the basis \u00a1of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Appellant also -contends that the Commission abused its discretion in denying a -rehearing on alleged newly discovered evidence. Appellant -argues -that intervenor lacked the proper -character qualification's of \u00a1a licensee, that the effect of intervenor\u2019s proposed network -affiliation on its program proposals should \u00a1have been \u00a1considered, and that the effect -of the establishment of two new stations -in Louisville upon intervenor\u2019s -ability to render the service it -proposed should have been taken -into \u00a1consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">As to the evidence concerning character qualifications -of interveno-r, there was no attempted explanation of why the \u00a1alleged facts were not discovered prior to t-h-e original hearing, no verified -statement of facts accompanying the petition, and no proof \u00a1that the -alleged .newly discovered evidence would, if true, affect -the decision of the -Commission. Section'\u20191.893(a) of the Commission\u2019s Rules and Regulations provides that: \u201cWhere the existence of newly discovered evidence is claimed, the \u00a1petition must be \u00a1accompanied by \u00a1a verified statement \u00a1of the facts, -together with the facts -relied on to show that the petitioner, with -due diligence, \u00a1could -not h-ave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>k-nown or 'discovered such facts, at the <em>time </em>of the hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Almost identical language is contained elsewhere in the Rules and Regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we do not regard the Commission\u2019s action in striking that portion of the petition for rehearing as erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">As to the possibility of intervenor\u2019s securing a network affiliation in the future and the effect of that possible -future affiliation on intervenor\u2019s proposed local program service, that contingency was thoroughly discussed and considered by the Commission prior <em>to its </em>final decision. The testimony of -one of Mid-America\u2019s directors -and -stockholders .before the presiding officer was to the effect that Mid-America would welcome and accept network affiliation <em>only </em>if such an arrangement would not be \u201cat the sacrifice of local programs.\u201d There was -ample and uncontroverted evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Mid-America\u2019-s proposed local programming would not suffer from a possible future network affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As to the effect upon Mid-America\u2019s operation under its license of the establishment of two new daytime stations in Louisville which will presumably render local non-network service, the record in this proceeding shows nothing a-s to the effect of these new stations on intervenor\u2019-s proposed service -and the establishment of the two new stations certainly -adds nothing to a determination of which o-f two competing applicants will provide better service. The Commission was correct when it stated: \u201cWe do not believe that such factors constitute changed conditions warranting a re-opening of the record; nor do we believe that they effect [yic] Mid-America\u2019s -ability to fulfill its overall program proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Further, it is noteworthy that the operation by Mid-America of the facilities which \u2022it has \u00a1been authorized to provide will in no way affect the operation by Kentucky of Station WINN as it is presently -licensed to -operate that station.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">We hold that the -Commission in thi-s case 'accorded the parties hereto a full and fair comparative hearing as required -by the opinion of the Supreme Court in Asbbacker Radio Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that appellant\u2019s contentions are without legal merit. Accordingly, the decision of the Commission is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> The record shows that Mid-America had applied for these same facilities as early as February, 1940, and that such application had been granted and a construction permit issued by the Commission. However, due to the Commission\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of appliea-tions for modification of the construction permit, an action requested by Mid-America, the permit expired in 1942.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-22\"> <em>Cf. </em>Mansfield Journal Company v.
