Appellant has appealed from the order denying such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Appellant contends that the indictment refers to \u201cimported smoking opium\u201d. He argues that since the Jones-Miller Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 173, makes it unlawful to import smoking opium and requires such opium to be summarily seized and destroyed when found, therefore when the Harrison Narcotic Act simply prohibits and makes unlawful the sale of opium \u201cexcept in the original stamped package\u201d, this- Act cannot be construed to impose any tax on the imported smoking opium because, being thus prohibited, there would be no such thing as an original stamped package of such opium. It is therefore said that counts I 'and III charged no offense against the United States. .</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">If we may assume that it appears from the record here that the opium described in these two counts was in fact imported smoking opium, as to which there may be some doubt, we cannot agree with appellant\u2019s contention. Section 2550 of Title 26 U.S.C.A. in general terms imposes a tax on \u201c\u2019opium * * * any compound, salt, de-rivat\u00edve, or preparation thereof, produced in or imported into the United States * * * Congress may tax what it prohibits. United States v. Yugonovich, 256 U.S. 450, 41 S.Ct. 551, 65 L.Ed. 1043. The manifestation of the intention of Congress to do so here is not lessened by the use of the words \u201cexcept in the original stamped package\u201d. We think the Act clearly imposes the tax on the prohibited product even although stamped packages of such imported smoking opium may never'exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
