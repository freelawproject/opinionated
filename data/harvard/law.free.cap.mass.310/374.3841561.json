The facts were found by the Appellate Tax Board. The appeals from its decisions bring before us only the issues of law \u201craised in the proceedings before the board.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1933, c. 321, \u00a7 7; see St. 1937, c. 400, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4. The questions hereinafter considered appear to have been so raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\">Statute 1933, c. 307, \u00a7 9 (unchanged, so far as the questions here involved are concerned, by St. 1935, c. 489, \u00a7 1, and later statutes), provides that income \u201creceived by any inhabitant of the commonwealth during the years nineteen hundred and thirty-three, nineteen hundred and thirty-four . . . from dividends on shares in all corporations . . . organized under the laws of this commonwealth . . . shall be taxed at the rate of six per cent per annum. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of chapter sixty-two of the General Law$, as amended, shall apply to the taxation of income received by any such inhabitant during said years.\u201d No exception to this provision is'here material. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, relating to the tax upon certain classes of income including dividends of Massachusetts corporations, provides in subsection (g): \u201cNo distribution of capital, whether in liquidation or otherwise, shall be taxable as income under this section; but accumulated profits shall not be regarded as capital under this provision.\u201d See also St. 1935, c. 480, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Under these statutes the taxpayer, was not subject to an income tax on the dividends here in question received by him if they were distributions of capital within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g). The fundamental issue of law between him and the commissioner is whether, on the facts found by the board, the dividends were such distributions or were distributions of accumulated profits. The board ruled, in substance, that they were distributions of capital and on this ground abated the income taxes assessed upon such dividends. The commissioner contends that the board was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The board found the following facts: During the year 1933 the taxpayer was the owner of one thousand shares of prior preferred stock of the corporation upon which he -received dividends of $6 per share in four instalments of $1,500 each,, totalling $6,000. He reported the amount in his 1934 income tax return of income received during 1933 as \u201cprior Preferred Stock , dividend paid out of Paid-in Capital Surplus.\u201d The commissioner assessed an income tax thereon, of $360. During the year 1934 the taxpayer was- the. owner of one thousand shares of prior preferred .stock,- an.d one thousand four hundred fifty shares of preferred stock of the corporation. He received during that year $6,000 in dividends paid on the former stock and $8,700 paid on the latter. He reported these amounts in his 1935 income tax return of income received during 1934 as \u201cpaid out of Paid-in capital and surplus.\u201d The commissioner assessed an income tax thereon of $882 and ten per cent thereof ($88.20) as an additional income tax under St. 1935, c. 480, \u00a7 1. The board ordered abatements on the ground that these taxes were improperly assessed. Adjustments on account of interest paid and other items resulted in abatement of the tax assessed on account of income of the year 1933 of $402.87, and on account of income of the year 1934 of $996.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">The question whether the distributions made by the dividends paid to the taxpayer as above described were distributions of capital within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), is to be determined from the standpoint of the corporation making the distributions rather than from the standpoint of the stockholder receiving the dividends. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 266. Facts found by the board relating to the financial condition of the corporation are as follows: On January 1, 1930, the corporation, which had been in business for about twenty years, was capitalized at $600,000, represented by three thousand shares of common stock of a par value of $100 per share and three thousand shares of preferred stock of the same par value per share. Of this total capital, $500,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>had been paid in and $100,000 represented a stock dividend of one thousand shares of common stock of the par value of $100 per share. As of January 1, 1930, there was an earned surplus in the amount of $81,137.60. (The fiscal year of the corporation during the years in question apparently ran from December 1 to November 30 inclusive.) On November 28, 1930, there was transferred to the surplus account of the corporation the sum of $36,250, representing amounts due from the corporation to the taxpayer, who was the principal stockholder in the corporation. \u201cOn November 17, 1931, the par value of the 3,000 shares of common stock was reduced from $100 to $50 per share, thereby reducing the total value of the common stock to $150,000 and the total valuation of all the stock to $450,000. At the same time it was voted to issue and to sell to the . . . [taxpayer] 1,000 shares of prior preferred stock of the par value of $100 per share. The stock was duly issued to the . . . [taxpayer] and his 'personal account\u2019 with the company, consisting in part of unpaid salary due to him, and in part of advances made by him to the company, and interest thereon, was debited in the amount of $100,000. The total par value of the capital stock, therefore, was $550,000. The $150,000 represented by the reduction in value of the stock was credited to the surplus account. Consequently, at the end of its fiscal year 1932 the capital structure of the corporation consisted of 3,000 shares preferred stock, of a par value of $100, or $300,000, 3,000 shares of common stock of a par value of $50, or $150,000, and 1,000 shares of prior preferred stock of a par value of $100, or $100,000, totalling in all, $550,000. The total amount added to surplus during the period between January 1, 1930, and December 1, 1932, was $267,387.60, of which $81,137.60 was earned. During the same period, the corporation suffered a loss of $228,348.98 and paid out dividends of $32,216.67, a total of $260,565.65. This amount exceeded the earned surplus of $81,137.60 by $179,428.05, and reduced the paid-in surplus account on the books to $6,821.95, as of December 1, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">\u201cDuring the period between December 1, 1932, and No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>vember 30, 1933, the corporation had net earnings of $62,743.19, which added to the balance in the surplus account as of December 1, 1932, resulted in a total of $69,556.14. During the same period the corporation distributed dividends totalling $6,000, all of which were paid to the . . . [taxpayer] on his prior preferred stock. Capital surplus as of December 1, 1933, was therefore, $63,-556.14. This sum, plus the par value of the capital stock, equalled $613,556.14, which amount was less by $122,-693.86 than the total paid in capital and surplus of $736,250. We accordingly find that on November 30, 1933, the end of the corporation\u2019s fiscal year, the capital was impaired in the amount of $122,693.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">\u201cDuring the period December 1, 1933, to November 30, 1934, the . . . [corporation] suffered a net loss of $89,403.65 and during the same period paid out dividends in the amount of $24,000, the two items totalling $113,-304.65, resulting in an impairment of capital to said amount; so that as of November 30, 1934, the impairment was $235,998.51.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The board \u201caccordingly find that during the years 1933 and 1934, at the time when the dividends taxed were distributed to the . . . [taxpayer], the capital of the corporation, including the earnings of the company in the year 1933, was at all times insufficient to meet the outstanding capital stock liability plus actual paid-in surplus.\u201d The board \u201calso find, as far as it is a matter of fact, that the distributions were paid out of capital or paid-in surplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">1. The decision of these cases requires an interpretation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), particularly with respect to the meaning of the word \u201ccapital\u201d and the words \u201caccumulated profits,\u201d as used therein, in the light of the context of the subsection and its purpose, and the application of the subsection so interpreted to the facts found as above recited. See <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>306 Mass. 305, 307. It is \u201ccapital\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that may be distributed \u201cin liquidation or otherwise\u201d without being subject to a tax as income of the shareholders, while \u201caccumulated profits\u201d may not be so distributed even by a liquidation dividend (see <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>262 Mass. 1; <em>Follett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>267 Mass. 115) unless by a stock dividend under some circumstances. See <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>306 Mass. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">2. The determination of the question whether the distributions by dividends were made out of \u201ccapital\u201d or out of'\u201caccumulated profits\u201d is to be made as of the times, respectively of such distributions. In <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 266, it was said that it \u201cis plain that under subsection (g) the question whether or not a distributed fund is capital is to be determined primarily with reference to the status of that fund before distribution.\u201d See also <em>Lanning </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>247 Mass. 496, 497-498. Not only is there nothing in the governing statute to indicate that operations of the corporation after distribution are to be considered, but also there is nothing to indicate that a determination as between \u201ccapital\u201d and \u201caccumulated profits\u201d is to be made as of any time prior to distribution, such, for example, as the end of the last preceding accounting period or fiscal year of the corporation, with-\" out consideration of operations of the corporation between that time and the time of distribution. The question is not presented in these cases whether the time of distribution from the standpoint of the-corporation is the date of declaration of a dividend, the date as of which it is payable to the shareholders, or the date on which it is actually paid (see <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>246 Mass. 224, 227; <em>Lanning </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>247 Mass. 496, 497-498). The cases were treated by the board and argued by the parties on the ground that, on the facts found, the distributions were made in the years 1933 and 1934 respectively, and we so treat them. But there is nothing in the facts found to show the respective dates within such years when the distribu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tians were made. The taxpayer, therefore, cannot prevail with respect to any distribution by way of a dividend if such a distribution made at any time during the year in which it was made would constitute a distribution of \u2018 \u2018 accumulated profits. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">3. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), appeared in the same form in the income tax statute first passed after the adoption of the Forty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the Commonwealth \u2014 the income tax amendment. See St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 2. The meaning of the phrase \u201cdistribution of capital\u201d used in this subsection as differentiated from \u201caccumulated profits\u201d was explained in the first case arising under the income' tax statute. <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522. That case presented the question of the liability of a shareholder to taxes upon certain dividends declared and paid in the year 1916. The court said \u201c\u2018Accumulated profits\u2019 as used in the statute are words of sufficiently comprehensive scope to include profits which had been earned and invested as had those here in question. [The profits in question were \u201can accumulation of earnings which before 1916 had been invested in permanent additions to the plants of the corporations involved.\u201d Page 534.] The words \u2018accumulated profits\u2019 are used as'the antithesis of \u2018 distribution of capital.\u2019 The latter would include payment of a part of the capital investment sold and returned to the shareholders, whereby the capacity of the corporation to carry on business was impaired or depleted.\u201d Page 535. It was further said in the opinion with respect to\u2019 another dividend \u201cdeclared and paid after the statute took effect, out of profits earned before it was enacted,\u201d \u201cThe extra cash dividend was declared out of surplus earnings which had accumulated during twenty-three years previous to March 1, 1913. Although it was large and had been accumulating for a long time, it was not the less a cash dividend. It came to the shareholder as his individual property for the first time when it was declared and paid in 1916. It was not in substance or effect a distribution of capital.\u201d Page 537. In each instance the dividend was held taxable. See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>238 Mass. 596, 598-599; <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax </em>Commissioner, 244 Mass. 40, 45-47; <em>Lanning </em>v. <em>Tax </em>Commissioner, 247 Mass. 496; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>262 Mass. 1; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>273 Mass. 187, 200; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 265-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">In the cases decided after <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, that have applied said subsection (g) there has been no suggestion of modification of the general statement herein quoted therefrom, unless it be with respect to a phrase having no application to the present case, in which reference is made to capital investment returned to the shareholder \u201cwhereby the capacity of the corporation to carry on business was impaired or depleted.\u201d Page 535. See <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 46, where that phrase was quoted and it was said that the \u201creal question is whether the distribution is made from capital investment or from profits.\u201d See also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>237 Mass. 574, 575; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>262 Mass. 1, 5-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">4. The word \u201ccapital\u201d may have different meanings when used in different connections. See <em>Hood Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 369, 371; <em>Commissioner of Banks in re Prudential Trust Co. </em>244 Mass. 64, 72. It appears, however, from the <em>Putnam </em>case and the cases following it, and from the general purpose of\" G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), that the word \u201ccapital\u201d as used therein means property invested in the corporation by the stockholders, and is not limited in its meaning to \u201ccapital\u201d in the narrow sense, sometimes described as \u201clegal capital,\u201d that is, property sufficient to balance the capital stock liability. See <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 535; <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 46; <em>Follett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>267 Mass. 115, 117, 118. Property paid in to the corporation by the shareholders in excess of the capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>stock liability \u2014 ordinarily in excess of the par value of the capital stock \u2014\u2022 constitutes what ordinarily is described as \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d and, though not included in the \u201clegal capital\u201d of the corporation, is nevertheless \u201ccapital\u201d in the sense in which the word is used in said subsection (g). Compare <em>LaBelle Iron Works </em>v. <em>United States, </em>256 U. S. 377, 389; <em>Thorsen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>65 Fed. (2d) 234, 236. See also <em>Arey </em>v. <em>George Associates, Inc. </em>299 Mass. 130, 135-136. Such a surplus represents property invested in the corporation and is within the obvious purpose of the statute that property so invested may be returned to shareholders without being subject to taxation as income. This conclusion as to the meaning of \u201ccapital\u201d is in accord with the statutory differentiation between \u201ccapital\u201d and \u201caccumulated profits\u201d (hereinafter considered) which are the two sources of distributions recognized by said subsection (g). The cases in which distributions in excess of the par value of the capital stock have been treated as distributions of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d did not involve \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d and are not in conflict with this conclusion. See <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>299 Mass. 296, 303, and cases cited. Moreover, it is immaterial whether any particular shareholder receives upon a distribution by dividend more or less than the amount actually invested by him personally. See <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations </em>&amp; <em>Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 265-266. Compare <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>262 Mass. 1, 6. The test of taxability is the source of the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">So long as a \u201ccapital surplus\u201d in substance represents property paid in to the corporation by its shareholders, such surplus is included in \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g). The \u201clegal capital\u201d of a corporation may be reduced by the reduction of the capital stock of a corporation. But such a reduction may be made without reducing the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation in the sense in which the word is used in G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g). See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 156, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 45. The result of such a reduction of capital stock where property constituting \"legal capital\u201d is not returned to the shareholders is to.transform \"legal capital\u201d into \"capital surplus,\u201d sometimes described as \u201creduction capital.\u201d But such \u201ccapital surplus\u201d is none the less an investment of property by the shareholders constituting \"capital\u201d of the corporation within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g). Whatever the method by which a \"capital surplus\u201d is created, it is not uncommonly described, as in the present case, as \u201cpaid in surplus.\u201d On the other hand the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation in this sense, as well as its \"capital\u201d in the narrow sense of \u201clegal capital,\u201d may be increased by a stock dividend declared out of \"accumulated profits.\u201d Such a dividend, under our decisions, is a distribution of such profits to the shareholder, constituting income of such shareholder. Whether or not such income is taxable depends upon thapplicable statute, which has been changed from time to time. See <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 534-536; <em>Brink </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>299 Mass. 280, 283-284; <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>306 Mass. 305. And the effect of a stock dividend is to capitalize the income so distributed, whether or not subject to taxation under the applicable .statute. As was said of a stock dividend in the <em>Putnam </em>case, \"In essence the thing which has been done is to distribute a symbol representing an accumulation of profits, which instead of being paid out in cash is invested in the business ... In this aspect of the case the substance of the transaction is no different from what it would be if a cash dividend had been declared with the privilege of subscription to an equivalent amount of new shares.\u201d Page 535. The effect of the transaction from the standpoint of the corporation is to distribute accumulated profits to the shareholders and to receive from such shareholders the amount thereof as an investment by them of their property, constituting not only an increase of the \u201clegal capital\u201d of the corporation but also an increase of its \u201ccapital\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the sense in which the word is used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">5. The words \u201caccumulated profits\u201d in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), are used, as was said in the <em>Putnam </em>case, \u201cas the antithesis of 'distribution of capital.\u2019\u201d Such \u201caccumulated profits\u201d may be described as \u201cearned surplus\u201d or \u201cundivided profits\u201d to distinguish them from \u201ccapital\u201d in the broad sense, including \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus.\u201d The \u201caccumulated profits\u201d of a corporation represent property earned by the corporation as distinguished from property invested therein by the shareholders. Such \u201caccumulated profits\u201d may include earnings resulting from capital transactions as well as those resulting from ordinary operations of the corporation. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>262 Mass. 1, 5-6. <em>Follett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>267 Mass. 115, 118-120. They are in the nature of \u201cincome\u201d of such corporation. See <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 44-45; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 265. Though there are differing conceptions of \u201cincome,\u201d for the purpose of income taxation, \u201cincome\u201d has been broadly defined as \u201cthe true increase in amount of wealth which comes to a person during a stated period of time.\u201d <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>249 Mass. 79, 80. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>299 Mass. 296, 299. See also <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 526; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>242 Mass. 242, 244; <em>Van Heusen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>257 Mass. 488, 491. This definition states an underlying principle that, however, requires explanation, if not qualification, as applied to specific facts. For example, mere appreciation in value, not realized, though in a broad sense representing an increase in wealth, is not ordinarily regarded as \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of taxation. <em>Van Heusen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>257 Mass. 488, 491. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>280 Mass. 238, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>242. See also <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 529, 530. This underlying principle, however, was the ground of decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>242 Mass. 242, 244. And this underlying principle is applicable to \u201caccumulated profits\u201d of a corporation. They constitute, from the standpoint of the corporation, an \u201cincrement of value\u201d that may be distributed to shareholders as income of such shareholders. <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 535. See also <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 43-44; <em>Follett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>267 Mass. 115. Such \u201caccumulated profits\u201d necessarily take into account losses as well as gains in the course of operations of the corporation during the period for which its \u201caccumulated profits\u201d are to be ascertained, that is, the period during which they were accumulated. See <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 265-266. See also <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 45-46. The amount of such \u201cprofits\u201d of a corporation, of course, is to be ascertained as of a fixed date \u2014 the date of distribution \u2014 but with respect to the period during which they have accumulated. The \u201caccumulated profits\u201d for this period are to be considered as a unit. Compare <em>Loevy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>245 Mass. 174, 177. At least in the absence, as here, of any statutory provision for ascertaining the amount of such \u201caccumulated profits\u201d they must be ascertained in accordance with the underlying principle applicable to income \u2014 that such \u201caccumulated profits\u201d represent the true increase in amount of wealth of the corporation during the period in question ending at the date of distribution. To what extent realization of such profits is essential need not be considered in this case. Compare <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>238 Mass. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">6. An important question for determination in this case is the length of the period that is to be considered in ascertaining the \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d Since, however, the end of the period in the case of each dividend is the date of distribution thereof, the real question for determination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>at what date did such period begin. There is nothing in the governing statute expressly limiting the period of accumulation of profits to any calendar year, to any fiscal year or other accounting period of the corporation, or even to the period after the passage of the income tax statute. Under the decisions of this court the period may be long and may have begun even before the passage of the income tax statute. See <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 534-537; <em>Lapham </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>244 Mass. 40, 47; <em>Lanning </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>247 Mass. 496, 497. In the case of one of the dividends considered in the <em>Putnam </em>case, declared in 1916 \u2014 the year in which the income tax statute was passed \u2014 the profits out of which it was declared had \u201caccumulated during twenty-three years previous to March 1, 1913.\u201d Page 537. Yet the dividend was held taxable as income of the shareholder receiving it in the year 1916. The natural conclusion is that the period of accumulation of profits is, in general, the entire period of the existence of the corporation. At least there must be some special circumstance to limit more narrowly the period. Whether there was any such circumstance in the present cases will be considered in the light of the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">7. (a) Though the corporation began business many years earlier, the facts found as of January 1, 1930, render it unnecessary to go back of that date for an analysis of the operations of the corporation. On that date the capital stock liability of the corporation, its \u201clegal capital\u201d and its \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), resulting in part from a stock dividend, were each $600,000. And on that date there were \u201caccumulated profits\u201d \u2014 \u201cearned surplus\u201d \u2014 in the amount of $81,137.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">(b) The details of the operations of the corporation for the period beginning with January 1, 1930, and ending with November 30, 1932, are not fully stated in the record. During that period, by reason of a reduction of capital stock, a payment into the corporation by a stockholder, and an issue of capital stock, the amount of the capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>stock liability and of the \u201clegal capital\u201d became $550,000, and a \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d was created amounting to $186,250, so that the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), amounted to $736,250.' It is not clear from the record whether \u201ccapital\u201d at any time during the period from January 1, 1930, to November 30, 1932, was unimpaired, but the investment by the shareholders, which constituted its \u201ccapital,\u201d was this amount. And the \u201caccumulated profits\u201d \u2014 \u201cearned surplus\u201d \u2014 at the beginning of the period amounted to $81,137.60 as already stated. \"During this period, however, the corporation incurred losses to the amount of $228,348.98 and distributed dividends to the amount of $32,216.67, an aggregate amount of $260,-565.65. Accordingly the \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d was completely extinguished by December 1, 1932. On that date the \u201clegal capital\u201d \u2014 property sufficient to balance its capital stock liability \u2014 of the corporation was not impaired, but the \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d had been reduced by $179,428.05 (the excess of the sum of the losses and distribution \u2014 $260,565.65 \u2014 over the \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d \u2014 $81,137.60) to $6,821.95. Consequently there was an impairment of \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of this word in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), of at least $147,-211.38 by reason of these losses. Whether the dividends during this period were declared and paid out of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d or, on the other hand, out of \u201cpaid in capital\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d (see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>231 Mass. 42, 48) does not appear from the record. In view, however, of the other facts found in regard to impairment of \u201ccapital,\u201d it is immaterial whether such dividends resulted in a reduction of \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d by reason of a return of a part thereof to the shareholders, or indirectly effected a further impairment of \u201ccapital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">(c) If the financial condition of the corporation as of December 1,1932, as above stated, had continued unchanged up to the date of distribution by a dividend of $6,000 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>year 1933, such dividend clearly would not have been a distribution of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d subject to taxation as income, since there would have been no such profits to distribute. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>298 Mass. 263, 265-266. But, during the period from December 1, 1932, to November 30,1933, inclusive, the corporation had net earnings amounting to $62,743.19, and the question is thus presented as to the effect of such net earnings upon the taxability of the dividend. In the absence of findings as to the date within the year 1933 of the distribution by dividend and as to the net earnings of the corporation between December 1, 1932, and the date of this distribution, we treat these net earnings of $62,743.19 as having been made prior to the date of distribution \u2014 the aspect of the situation most favorable to the commissioner \u2014 since the burden of proof was on the taxpayer. While conceivably the net earnings for this period might have been greater than for the entire period between December 1, 1932, and November 30, 1933, yet unless they exceeded $147,211.38 the result would not be affected thereby. On the facts found there is no reasonable probability that the net earnings prior to the date of distribution were larger in amount, and the ultimate finding of the board that the distribution by this dividend was \u201cpaid out of capital or paid-in surplus\u201d cannot be set aside on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">We are of opinion that the net earnings amounting to $62,743.19 in the period between December 1, 1932, and November 30, 1933, inclusive, did not render taxable the dividend of $6,000 in 1933. This is clearly true if, in accordance with the general principle above stated, the \u201caccumulated profits\u201d of the corporation are to be ascertained with reference to the entire period of the operations of the corporation prior to the distribution by this dividend. Such operations resulted not in \u201caccumulated profits\u201d but rather in a loss. Though the corporation on January 1, 1930, had \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d amounting to $81,137.60, the addition thereto of net earnings of $62,743.19 in the period between December 1, 1932, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>and November 30, 1933, would fall far short of offsetting the losses aggregating $228,348.98 sustained by the corporation between January 1, 1930, and December 1, 1932, with the result that at the time of the distribution by dividend in 1933 the corporation had no \u201caccumulated profits\u201d to be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">Doubtless it might be argued that the fact that as of December 1, 1932 \u2014 the beginning of the period in which the corporation had net earnings amounting to $62,743.19 \u25a0 \u2014 not only had the previously \u201caccumulated profits\u201d of the corporation been exhausted, but also its \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), had been depleted or impaired, furnishes a ground for a new starting point on December 1, 1932, of the period for which \u201caccumulated profits\u201d are to be ascertained. But we find no support for such a conclusion in the governing statute. The statute contains no provision limiting this period to the fiscal year or to any other accounting period of the corporation. It would hardly be contended that so long as a corporation had \u201caccumulated profits\u201d the amount thereof would not be increased by subsequent profits or decreased by subsequent losses. A consistent application of this method of ascertaining \u201caccumulated profits\u201d would require that if at any date losses exceeded prior \u201caccumulated profits\u201d the deficiency in such profits should be made good before the corporation could be said to have \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d In the absence, as here, of any express statutory method of computing \u201caccumulated profits,\u201d no reason is apparent for disregarding losses causing such a deficiency, subdividing the ordinary period for the computation of \u201caccumulated profits,\u201d and beginning a new period for such computation on the date the corporation began again to accumulate profits. Such a method of computing \u201caccumulated profits\u201d would conflict with the general principle that profits represent a true increase in the wealth of the corporation and with the purpose of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), to permit a tax free return to shareholders of their investment. Disregarding such losses would result in creating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>fictitious increase of the amount of wealth of the corporation that is derived from the investment of capital by the shareholders. There is no such finality in the fact that a corporation sustaining losses in excess of its \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d thereby, in effect, depletes or impairs its \u201ccapital,\u201d in the sense in which that word is used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), that such losses can no longer properly be considered in determining whether as of a subsequent date the corporation has \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">The conclusion here reached is not fairly open to the objection that it permits evasion of income taxes by enabling a corporation to pay nontaxable dividends to its shareholders by making distribution out of \u201ccapital,\u201d subsequently returning such \u201ccapital\u201d out of \u201caccumulated profits,\u201d and repeating the process from time to time. The \u201ccapital\u201d so distributed would reduce the capital investment of the shareholders that could be distributed by tax free dividends, and the process could not be repeated with respect to \u201ccapital\u201d restored out of \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d The limit of such tax free distribution would be the capital investment of the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The decision here made does not imply that a corporation having a \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or'\u201ccapital surplus\u201d that has been depleted or impaired by losses cannot legally pay dividends until such \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d has been restored out of \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d We are not required to consider that question. See, however, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>231 Mass. 42, 48. The ground of the decision is that a corporation in the situation described has no \u201caccumulated profits\u201d for distribution by a dividend taxable to the shareholders within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The conclusion here reached is in conformity with the reasoning and decision in <em>Willcuts </em>v. <em>Milton Dairy Co. </em>275 U. S. 215, though the statute there under consideration was materially different from the statute here under consideration. In that case the question involved was the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of \u201cinvested capital\u201d as used in the Federal Revenue Act of 1918 (40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1057) as applied to the excess profits tax. Section 326 (a) of this statute defined \u201cinvested capital,\u201d with exceptions not here material, as the actual cash and cash value of other property, bona fide paid in for stock or shares, at the time of such payment, and paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits, not including surplus and undivided profits earned during the year. Pages 216-217. The court said of these terms that both \u201cthese terms, as commonly employed in corporate accounting, denote an excess in the aggregate value of all the assets of a corporation over the sum of all its liabilities, including capital stock . . . But it is a prerequisite to the existence of \u2018undivided profits\u2019 as well as a \u2018surplus,\u2019 that the net assets of the corporation exceed the capital stock. Hence, where the capital is impaired, profits, though earned and remaining in the business, if insufficient to offset this impairment do not constitute \u2018undivided profits.\u2019 . . . We do not think Congress intended that a corporation whose capital was impaired should be entitled to treat profits that, though earned, were insufficient to make good the impairment and create a surplus, as \u2018undivided profits.\u2019\u201d Pages 218-219. This reasoning is equally applicable, so far as a determination of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d is concerned, where, as in the statute here under consideration, \u201ccapital\u201d includes \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus.\u201d A similar conclusion was reached in <em>Foley Securities Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>106 Fed. (2d) 731, 732, under a materially different statutory provision (Federal Revenue Act of 1934, 48 U. S. Sts. at Large, 680, 711) relating to a tax upon \u201cundistributed adjusted net income\u201d of a corporation. The statute (\u00a7 115a) defined a \u201cdividend\u201d as \u201cany distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders . . . out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913.\u201d The court, relying upon and quoting from the <em>Willcuts </em>case, held that a distribution by a corporation to its shareholders was \u201ca \u2018dividend\u2019 only to the extent that it exceeded the operating deficit due to losses in prior years.\u201d Page 733. Reference was made to <em>Kinnear </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>36 B. T. A. 153, 155, in which case it was said with respect to distributions for the purpose of taxation that the \u201crule is that a corporation does not have earnings or profits available for distribution as dividends until impairments of capital or paid-in surplus resulting from operating losses have been restored.\u201d See also <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>35 B. T. A. 938, 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">In the case of <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Canfield, </em>291 U. S. 163, the court apparently recognized the principle stated in the cases just cited but held it inapplicable to the facts before the court. The court was there considering the Federal Revenue Act of 1921 (42 U. S. Sts. at Large, 227) which contained a definition of dividend substantially like that above quoted from the Federal Revenue Act of 1934, and a provision that for the purposes of the act \u201cevery distribution is made out of earnings or profits, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits, to the extent of such earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913; but any earnings or profits accumulated . . . prior to March 1, 1913, may be distributed exempt from the tax, after the earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, have been distributed.\u201d \u00a7 201. In the case before the court the corporation had a surplus on March 1, 1913, a small profit in 1914, a loss in 1915 and again in 1916, and profits in succeeding years including a part of 1923. The court held that the losses sustained in 1915 and 1916 should be treated as reducing the surplus of March 1, 1913, rather than the profits of the years succeeding 1916 for the purpose of determining the taxability of a dividend in 1923. The court said that the \u201csurplus of March 1, 1913, was the amount of net assets over liabilities including capital stock. When the losses of 1915 and 1916 were suffered, the net assets of March 1, 1913, shrunk accordingly.\u201d Page 166. The Aaxpayers, however, contended that the surplus on March 1, 1913, constituted capital. But the court did not accept this contention, pointing out that the court was \u201cnot here concerned with capital in the sense of fixed or paid-in capital, which is not to be impaired, or with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>restoration of such capital where there has been impairment,\u201d that \u201cthe Congress was careful to arrange its plan so that the right to receive, free of tax, a distribution of surplus accumulated prior to March 1, 1913, should not be exercised in such a fashion as to permit profits accumulated after that date to escape taxation,\u201d that nothing was said \u201cas to a restoration of those profits [accumulated prior to March 1, 1913] out of subsequent earnings if the former have been lost,\u201d and that what \u201chad been \u2018 accumulated \u2019 prior to March 1, 1913, was obviously not immune from the risk of loss.\u201d Pages 167-169.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">(d) The situation of the corporation in the year 1934 when there were distributions by dividends aggregating $24,000 requires no detailed discussion. At the beginning of the period from December 1, 1933, to November 30, 1934, inclusive, there were no \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d distribution of which would be taxable under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), and \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of that subsection was impaired or depleted to the extent at least of $84,468.19 even if prior dividends distributed since January 1, 1930, aggregating $38,216.67, are treated as paid out of \u201ccapital\u201d effecting a reduction of such \u201ccapital\u201d rather than an impairment thereof. This impairment was not restored during the period from December 1, 1933, to November 30, 1934, but, on the contrary, net losses were sustained aggregating $89,304.65, increasing the impairment to at least $173,772.84, though the dividends distributed during this period aggregating $24,000 be treated as reducing \u201ccapital\u201d rather than impairing it. While the dates of the dividends in 1934, and the extent of the impairment of \u201ccapital\u201d at those dates respectively, do not appear, on the other facts found there is no reasonable probability that the operations of the corporation prior to such dates, respectively, restored the impairment of \u201ccapital\u201d existing on such dates, respectively, and the ultimate finding of the board that the distributions by the dividends were \u201cpaid out of capital or paid-in surplus\u201d cannot be set aside on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">8. We think, for the reasons stated, that neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>dividends in 1933 nor those in 1934 were subject to income tax and that there was no legal error in abating the income tax\u00e9s assessed upon the taxpayer by reason of such dividends. In the case relating to the tax upon income of the taxpayer for the year 1933 there is to be an abatement of $402.87, and in the case relating to the tax upon income of the taxpayer for the year 1934 there is to be an abatement of $996.82, in each case with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\"> Certain slight discrepancies in the figures are immaterial for the decision of the cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
