The plaintiff, who was sixty-nine years of age, was walking from the southerly side of the avenue to the northerly side. He had crossed the eastbound lane and the reservation in the center of the street and was struck as he was crossing the westbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The burden of proving the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was upon the defendant. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85. An auditor to whom the case had been referred found \u201con all the evidence\u201d before him that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and found for the plaintiff. The auditor\u2019s report alone was sufficient evidence to support a finding for the plaintiff at the trial, whatever other evidence was introduced either through the plaintiff himself or other witnesses <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>307 Mass. 64, 68, 69; <em>Zawacki </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>307 Mass. 86, 88; <em>Runnells </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>307 Mass. 128, 130, 131), unless the subsidiary or specific findings of the auditor are so inconsistent with his general or ultimate findings that as matter of law they cannot stand together. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Farm Service Stores, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 564, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">There are no subsidiary or specific findings of the auditor inconsistent with his general findings in favor of the plaintiff. The pertinent subsidiary findings are in substance these: The roadway was wet. There was a light, drizzling rain. There was mist and a light fog. The westbound lane, which the plaintiff was crossing when struck, was twenty-three and nine tenths feet wide. Before starting to cross this lane the plaintiff looked up and down but \u201ccould see no oncoming traffic.\u201d He could see the nearest street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>light about one hundred twenty feet to his right. The visibility was such as to enable him to see the lights of a vehicle at least as far away as the street light. He then started to cross slowly and was struck when halfway over. He did not observe the automobile at any time. The defendant entered Huntington Avenue from Copley Square, travelling about five feet from the curbing of the reservation. There was nothing to obstruct his view. It was \u201cdarker\u201d where the plaintiff was struck, \u201cowing to the absence of lights.\u201d The defendant\u2019s headlights were on and were \u201cin high beam.\u201d The plaintiff was struck by the \u201cright front end\u201d of the defendant\u2019s automobile and was picked up \u201cin the center of the road.\u201d The defendant stated to police officers that he did not see the plaintiff \u201cin time\u201d and testified before the auditor that he did not see him until he was ten feet away, although he stated, as the auditor says, \u201cin his answer to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatory,\u201d which must therefore have been before the auditor, that he could see ahead about fifty feet. \u201cThe defendant should have seen the plaintiff in time to avoid striking him.\u201d The defendant\u2019s automobile \u201ctraveled twenty feet before it stopped.\u201d The auditor further finds that the only evidence before him of the speed of the defendant\u2019s automobile \u201cwas the defendant\u2019s estimate of twenty miles an hour,\u201d but he does not find, and was not obliged to find, that this \u201cestimate\u201d was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The subsidiary findings just stated did not compel a conclusion that the defendant had sustained the burden of proving that the accident was caused by the plaintiff\u2019s suddenly and negligently stepping out into the path of obvious danger. Even if, as the auditor does not find, when the plaintiff started from the reservation the defendant\u2019s lights were somewhere in sight notwithstanding the mist and rain, still the findings are consistent with their being so far distant that the plaintiff might justifiably attempt to cross and might have crossed in safety if the defendant had seen him when he should and had driven with some regard to the plaintiff\u2019s presence. Indeed, it appears that the plaintiff nearly reached a place of safety and was struck only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>by the farther corner of the defendant\u2019s automobile. <em>Gauthier </em>v. <em>Quick, </em>250 Mass. 258. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>263 Mass. 252. <em>McGuiggan </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>278 Mass. 264. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>C. E. Fay Co. </em>281 Mass. 240. <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>291 Mass. 105. <em>Fruth </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>293 Mass. 403. <em>Desjarlais </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>299 Mass. 182. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Cairns, </em>302 Mass. 584. <em>Tookmanian </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>308 Mass. 162, 166, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Since the auditor\u2019s report is sufficient in itself to support the finding of the judge we need not consider the other evidence introduced at the trial. We do not intimate that the result would be different if the case rested upon the evidence of the witnesses at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
