L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79. The respondent filed a so called \u201canswer in bar.\u201d The case was heard by a judge of the Superior Court upon the petition and \u201canswer in bar.\u201d He made \u201cfindings, rulings and orders.\u201d He ordered the \u201canswer in bar\u201d sustained and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the petition dismissed. The petitioner appealed from the orders and rulings. This appeal has no standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A petition of this nature is purely statutory. <em>Hester </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>251 Mass. 41, 42. There is no right of appeal unless authorized by statute. Neither G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79, nor St. 1926, c. 276, expressly authorizes an appeal. Matters of pleading and practice not specifically provided for are governed by the applicable sections of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231. That chapter contains many sections dealing with pleading and practice, including provisions for review on report and exceptions, and also a limited provision for appeal. \u00a7 96. By \u00a7 145 many of these sections, including \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 112, relating to reports, and \u00a7\u00a7 113-115,117-121, relating to exceptions, are made applicable \u201cto petitions for damages by taking by eminent domain.\u201d But \u00a7 96, relating to appeals, is not so made applicable and, consequently, does not apply to the present proceeding. There is no other statutory authority for an appeal in such a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Moreover, even if \u00a7 96 were applicable to a proceeding like this, that section would not apply to the present case. It applies to but three classes of cases, no one of which would include the present case. Clearly, there is here no order overruling or sustaining a demurrer, and no order for judgment on a case stated.' Nor is there any \u201corder decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d The orders do not purport to be so founded. The pleadings raise questions of fact. And obviously the orders were based upon facts found by the trial judge. Such findings, however, are not a part of the record. <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Page-Storms Drop Forge Co. </em>243 Mass. 133, 134-135. <em>Yoffa </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>299 Mass. 516, 517. Consequently, questions of law raised thereby are not \u201capparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
