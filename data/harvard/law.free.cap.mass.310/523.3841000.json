The declaration contained three counts, the first alleging negligence, the second gross negligence, and the third \u201cwilful and wanton negligence\u201d on the part of the defendant. At the close of the evidence the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on each count was allowed subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"Acp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Other than to state that the judge erred in directing verdicts for the defendant \u201con all the counts/' the plaintiff has confined his argument before us to the issue raised by the third count. With relation to the first and second counts it is sufficient to say that the action of the judge in directing verdicts for the defendant on these counts was right, since a finding would be required that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was at best but a licensee upon the defendant's truck and therefore, as matter of law, the only duty owed the plaintiff by the defendant was to refrain from wilful, wanton and reckless conduct tending to injure, the plaintiff. <em>West </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>196 Mass. 183, 185. <em>Romana </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 76, 82. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>248 Mass. 78, 81, 82. <em>Theriault </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>307 Mass. 532, 534, and cases cited. The question remains whether there was error in the direction of a verdict for the defendant on the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah8\">The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts: At about 2 p.m. on August 1, 1935, the plaintiff, a fourteen year old boy, and two other boys were riding bicycles on Wilbraham Road in Springfield. They first saw the defendant's truck at the corner of Norfolk Street and Wilbraham Road near the C. Frank Adams playground. A removable round wooden tank with a capacity of one thousand gallons of water was mounted on the truck. The tank was then being filled. When it was filled the truck started off in an easterly direction on Wilbraham Road, which is a public highway surfaced with asphalt. The road runs easterly from the playground to the top of a steep hill, where it dips down to a fairly level grade and runs along for about three hundred yards to a pond. A causeway over the pond is about eighteen or twenty feet wide. At each end of the causeway the road is about thirty-five feet wide. Along both sides of the causeway \u201cthere are heavy wooden fences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">After the truck had proceeded for about one hundred yards the three boys pursued it and took hold of the truck \u201cby an iron thing or .chain.\u201d One boy was hanging on at the left rear of the truck, another at the right rear. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plaintiff was holding on to the \u201ciron thing\u201d on the right side of the truck about six feet in front of the second boy. The plaintiff was holding on to the truck with his left hand, and was guiding his bicycle with his right hand. The defendant and \u201cpassengers in the cab were very friendly, gay and jovial, talking and laughing at the boys, looking around in their direction several times.\u201d The defendant did not tell the plaintiff or his companions \u201cto get off the truck\u201d at any time. The boys \u201ctravelled down the hill with the truck\u201d and onto the causeway, the truck \u201cconstantly picking up speed ... to \u2018maybe thirty or thirty-five miles an hour.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">When the truck was in the middle of the causeway two of the boys ceased to hold on to the truck. The plaintiff held on, because he was afraid of being thrown against the fence on the side of the causeway. He did not dare to let go because of the speed of his bicycle which \u201cwas bobbing all around.\u201d As the truck neared the eastern end of the causeway the defendant looked out of the rear window of the cab at the plaintiff and, just after leaving the causeway, veered the truck suddenly and abruptly to the extreme right \u201cover to the traprock shoulder\u201d of the road and then \u201csnapped it back again onto the road, at a point about fifty feet east of the easterly end of the causeway.\u201d The plaintiff was thrown forcibly over the handle bars of his bicycle \u201csome twelve or fifteen feet forward over the road shoulder,\u201d and was injured. One of the other boys \u201cyelled and motioned violently at the defendant who was looking back and the passengers were laughing at him.\u201d This boy \u201ckept shouting at the defendant to come back and motioned with his hand to come back but there was no response from the defendant.\u201d He did not \u201cslow up\u201d or stop his vehicle, which \u201ccontinued on its course.\u201d There was evidence that, when the defendant veered his truck to the right sharply and abruptly and \u201csnapped it back\u201d onto the road, there was no traffic \u201ccoming in the other direction\u201d to, render the action of the defendant in this respect necessary. The jury were not required to believe his conflicting testimony to the effect that \u201cthere were cars coming towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>his truck most all the time when he was coming across the culvert\u201d and that he bore off a little to the right to be on the right side of the road, and if they disbelieved this explanation of his conduct, they could infer that there were no other conditions in the highway to justify his action in veering his truck over \u201cto the traprock shoulder\u201d of the road and \u201csnapping it back\u201d onto the road, in the circumstances before set forth as those the jury could find to have existed when the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">It is settled that one \u201cwho wilfully and wantonly, in reckless disregard of the rights of others, by a positive act or careless omission exposes another to death or grave bodily injury, is liable for the consequences, even if the other was guilty of negligence or other fault in connection with the causes which led to the injury.\u201d <em>Aiken </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 269, 271, 272, 273, and cases cited. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>282 Mass. 49, 54-56, and cases cited. It is not necessary to prove that the defendant deliberately intended to injure the plaintiff. It is enough if it is shown that, indifferent to consequences, the defendant intentionally acted in such a way that the natural and probable consequence of his act was injury to the plaintiff. There is a \u201cconstructive intention as to the consequences, which, entering into the wilful, intentional act, the law imputes to the offender, and in this way a charge which otherwise would be mere negligence, becomes, by reason of a reckless disregard of probable consequences, a wilful wrong.\u201d <em>Aiken </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 269, 271. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>188 Mass. 367, 370. <em>Romana </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 76, 83. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>223 Mass. 300, 302. <em>Bellenger </em>v. <em>Mona-han, </em>282 Mass. 523, 528. <em>LeSaint </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>301 Mass. 136, 138. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In the present case the jury would have been warranted in finding that the defendant knew that the plaintiff was holding on to the right side of the truck, shortly after he took hold of it; that he was still holding on while the truck, a heavy one, travelling at a speed of thirty-five miles an hour, was crossing the causeway; that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>looked at the plaintiff just as the truck was about to leave the causeway; that he knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff was in a position where it would be dangerous for him to release his hold on the truck; that, notwithstanding, the defendant wilfully and intentionally veered his truck over to the \u201ctraprock shoulder\u201d (\u201clike a gutter made of traprock covered with tar\u201d) on he right hand side of the road; that within a space of two car lengths he \u201csnapped\u201d his truck back onto the road; and that he intentionally created an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiff in the face of a strong likelihood, known to the defendant or which he had reason to know, that injury would result to the plaintiff, and that it did result in the manner before recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In these circumstances we are of opinion that the question, whether the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by wilful, wanton and reckless conduct of the defendant, should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the direction of verdicts for the defendant on the first and second counts of the declaration are overruled. His exception to the direction of a verdict for the defendant on the third count is sustained, and the case is to be tried anew on that count only.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
