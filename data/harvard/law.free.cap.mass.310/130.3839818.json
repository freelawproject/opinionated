The pier footing, about eight by eight feet in area, was being excavated within a larger excavated area of about forty by fifty feet, that was about ten feet below the surface of the surrounding ground. The pier footing was to be dug to a depth of two and one half feet, and the employee had been at work there for about three and one half hours in the afternoon when he was stricken. There was evidence that the day, April 25, 1939, which was clear and sunny from sunrise to sunset, was unseasonally hot, the minimum temperature being forty-four degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, and the maximum eighty-four. It could have been found that there was no overhead structure in the area where the employee was working and that he was about thirty feet from the nearest wall. He was dressed in two suits of medium underwear, trousers, shirt and a sweater. Other employees were digging pier footings in the same area, but it did not appear that any of them was in the same hole that Zucchi was digging. The reviewing board, which awarded compensation, inferred that the employee was exposed to the direct rays of the sun while working. It found that the employee received a personal injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment when, \u201ceither by reason of the effects of exposure to the direct rays of the sun or from exposure in a confined area for a concentrated period of time to the excessive atmospheric heat of a day of unseasonal temperature, and to a degree greater than that of other persons in that vicinity, he was caused to be prostrated . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The insurer contends that the finding of the reviewing board is too indefinite to sustain the decree awarding compensation. It is the duty of the reviewing board to make such specific and definite findings upon the evidence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ported as will enable this court to determine with reasonable certainty whether correct rules of law have been applied, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 10, <em>Di Clavio\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 259, 261-262, at least unless the evidence reported is of such a character that no reasonable inference can be drawn therefrom to the contrary. <em>Rozek\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 205, 207. <em>Cahill\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 538, 539. A recital of alternative findings that are inconsistent would not be a compliance with this duty. \u00a7 See <em>Percival\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, 54; <em>Musgrave\u2019s Case, </em>281 Mass. 416, 420. The court, however, will sustain the general finding if possible. <em>Duralith Corp. </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>274 Mass. 397, 401. <em>Craddock\u2019s Case, ante, </em>116, 120-121. The general finding here is that the employee received a personal injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment. The board also found that employee was caused to be \u201cprostrated\u201d either from the \u201ceffects of exposure to the direct rays of the sun or from exposure <em>\u201d </em>in the other manner hereinbefore stated. It is to be observed that the board did not find categorically that the employee suffered a \u201cheat stroke\u201d or a \u201csunstroke.\u201d It recites the evidence that his condition was diagnosed as \u201cheat stroke.\u201d It discusses \u201cheat stroke\u201d and \u201csunstroke.\u201d Both findings lead to the same result, prostration, due to excessive atmospheric heat, amounting to a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">We are of opinion that the evidence warranted both findings as to the cause of the prostration, either one of which will support the ultimate conclusion since it is also found that the employee was' exposed to a greater degree than that of others in that vicinity. This is not a case where there are findings, under one of which the employee would not be entitled to compensation. See <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>193 App. Div. (N. Y.) 574; <em>Gowens </em>v. <em>Alamance County, </em>214 N. C. 18; <em>Chief Consolidated Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>70 Utah, 333; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>80 Utah, 187, 208-214; <em>Finlayson v. Dowd, </em>60 S. D. 57; <em>Bletko </em>v. <em>R. Hoe &amp; Co. </em>216 App. Div. (N. Y.) 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The insurer contends that there is no such thing as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cconcentrated period of time,\u201d and that a decree should not be based upon it. It seems that this finding of the board has reference to the evidence that the employee Was at work in the pier footing hole from about 12:30 to 3:45 in the afternoon when \u201che got dizzy\u201d and fell, and that he came out \u201cright away.\u201d The insurer does not contend that the case presents the difficulty that the employee encountered in <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 429; <em>S. C. </em>232 Mass. 557. The evidence as to the clothing worn by the employee did not require a finding that he was not entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We are of opinion that the case comes within the principle of <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 557, and cases cited at page 559, <em>Ferrara\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 243, <em>Shute\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 393, and that it is distinguishable from <em>Dougherty\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 456, and <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>292 Mass. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
