The facts found are substantially as follows: The employee, hereinafter referred to as the claimant, was a general laborer in the highway department of the town of Richmond. His employment by the town was seasonal, beginning generally in April and ending sometime in the fall. During the winter he and other employees would be called for service when there had been heavy snow storms.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In the late afternoon of August 19, 1938, a fire broke out in the barn of the Richmond Farm, located in the town of Richmond. The farm was \u201ceither owned or managed and controlled\u201d by the Malnatis before referred to. The town had neither fire fighting apparatus nor a fire department. The fire departments of two or three neighboring towns together with several citizens and officials of the town assisted in the work of putting out the fire. As a result of a conference between one Fairfield, the chairman of the board of selectmen of the town, and one Whitcomb, who, was a selectman of the -town, its road superintendent ordered five of the town\u2019s employees, of whom the claimant was one, to proceed to the farm and assist in putting out the fire. The claimant arrived at the farm at about 8 a.m. on August 20, 1938, and joined several men who were inside the barn in an effort to put out the fire, About 10 a.m. he fell from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>a scaffold over a hole in the hayloft onto a concrete floor nearly twenty feet below, sustaining injuries which resulted in total incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The claimant had made no arrangements with the Mal-natis concerning his work on the day in question. He was not promised nor did he expect to be paid by them. The town\u2019s highway superintendent was authorized to order him to help fight the fire. There was no understanding, agreement or arrangement between the town officials and the owners of the farm about payment by the owners of the farm for his services. He did not become an employee of the owners of the Richmond Farm but at the time he sustained his injuries he was an employee of the town of Richmond. It was agreed that the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage paid by the town was $20. There was evidence that he was not paid by the town on the day he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The town\u2019s insurer (hereinafter referred to as the insurer) contends that the claimant was not an employee of the town at the time he sustained his injuries, because he had been lent to the Malnatis and was under their direction and control at that time, and that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26, as amended by St. 1937, c. 370, \u00a7 1, under the terms of which a person is conclusively presumed to be an employee and entitled to compensation if he is injured when acting under orders in performing a task that is outside the usual course of his employer\u2019s business, does not apply to lent employees. It is established, however, that under the workmen\u2019s compensation act there must be a contract of hire express or implied, oral or written, before one can be an employee of another within the meaning of the act. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), as amended by St. 1935, c. 406. <em>Scordis\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 94, 98. <em>Wanders\u2019s Case, </em>308 Mass. 157, 159, 160. The finding of the board that the claimant was an employee of the town when injured must stand if there is any evidence to support it. There was conflicting evidence with reference to whether there was any talk with the Malnatis about payment by them for the services of the men sent by the town to assist in putting out the fire. There was evidence, however, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the board could believe and which would warrant the finding\u00a7 that no arrangement was ever made by the Malnatis with the claimant or the representatives of the town for payment by the Malnatis for the services of the claimant and that there was no contract of employment between the Malnatis and the claimant. <em>Scordis\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 94, 97-98. The fact that the claimant was not paid that day by the town is not decisive of the question whether he .was entitled to be paid by the town for his services on that day. The board could infer that he was so entitled, and we think it was warranted in finding that the claimant was not an employee of the Malnatis but was an employee of the. .town within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (4) and 26, as amended, when he sustained his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">It is true, of course, that under c. 152 a personal injury in order to be compensable must arise out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment. This, however, does not mean that the injury must occur in the usual course of the employer\u2019s business, and where in a case like this the injury is sustained by the employee while doing an act which is not in the usual course of the employer\u2019s business, but which the employee does by direction of his employer, he is conclusively presumed to be the latter\u2019s employee in so doing. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26, as amended. In the instant case the board found that the claimant was assisting in putting out the fire at the time of his injury by order of his employer, the town. This action of the town was within its authority. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>101 Mass. 117, 118. The finding of the board that the claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment was warranted. <em>Stakonis </em>v. <em>United Advertising Corp. </em>110 Conn. 384. <em>Engels Copper Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>183 Cal. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The insurer further contends that, even if the findings of the board that the claimant was an employee of the town at the time of his injury and that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment are correct, he. cannot recover compensation \u201cbecause at the time of his injury he was, on the board\u2019s findings, a member of a \u2018fire.force/\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and as such was excepted from the operation of the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act relating to employees of a town. In support of this contention the insurer argues that the provisions of \u00a7 69, as amended by St. 1936, c. 403, excepting from the operation of the act \u201cmembers of a . . . fire force\u201d are of broad and sweeping import, and that they were used by the Legislature in the light of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 48, \u00a7\u00a781 and 82, which provide for relief to firemen injured in the performance of their duties, including also \u201cany person performing the duties of a fireman in a town having no organized fire department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We are of opinion, however, that the words in \u00a7 69, as so amended, \u201cmembers of a . . . fire force,\u201d were intended by the Legislature to refer to members of a force, comprising the fire department of a city or town, and that they were not intended to except from the operation of the act a person in the position of the claimant. The claimant was a laborer, and we think that it cannot be said his status as such changed when, by direction of his employer, he worked in assisting to put out the fire and was injured. See <em>McPhee\u2019s </em>Case, 222 Mass. 1. He was not a member of a force comprising a fire department. See <em>Devney\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 270; 10 Am. L. R. 201 and cases cited, notwithstanding the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 48, \u00a7 82, providing for relief to any person performing the duties of a fireman in a town having no organized fire department, we are of opinion that in the work that the claimant was doing he still remained an employee of the town within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 1 (4) and 26, as amended. See <em>La Belle </em>v. <em>Village of Grosse Pointe Shores, </em>201 Mich. 371. The act \u201cis to be interpreted in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349. It was intended to be of general application and to include all who are therein described as employees. <em>Slavinsky </em>v. <em>National Bottling Torah Co. </em>267 Mass. 319, 321. In the absence as here of specific provision to the contrary, the claimant is entitled to its benefits. What has already been said disposes of the insurer\u2019s contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>claimant when injured was not engaged in any work that was listed in the \u201cclassification of operations\u201d set forth in the policy, which included street or road work commonly performed by the claimant. See <em>Cox\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 220; <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>301 Mass. 305, 307, and cases cited; 5 Op. Atty. Gen. 73, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">There was no harmful error in the action of the board in allowing the insurer\u2019s request that \u201cThe test to determine who was the employer of Castagna at the time of his injury is \u2018Who had the direction and control of the employee, and to whom did he owe obedience in respect to his emplqyr ment,\u2019\u201d and at the same time adopting the findings and decision of the single member. The result reached - was right. See <em>Weidman </em>v. <em>Weidman, </em>274 Mass. 118, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
