L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 321, \u00a7 7), granting an abatement in the amount of $396,682.20 of a corporate franchise tax assessed by the commissioner for the year 1938, upon the Boston Edison Company (herein referred to as the taxpayer), an electric company as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 164, \u00a7 1, organized under the laws of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The taxpayer in the year in question was subject to the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 53, as amended (see St. 1934, c. 323, \u00a7\u00a7 6,. 11), and consequently was subject to the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 58, which provides that every corporation, subject to said \u00a7 53 \u201cshall annually pay a tax upon its corporate franchise, after making the deductions provided for in section fifty-five,\u201d at a rate therein fixed. The deduction therein referred to applicable to the taxpayer is the value \u201cas found by the commissioner of . . . [the corporation\u2019s] works, structures, real estate, motor vehicles, machinery, poles, underground conduits, wires and pipes, subject to local taxation wherever situated.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, Fifth. See now St. 1939, c. 24, \u00a7 7. There is no controversy as to the rate of tax or as to the propriety or amount of the deduction. The value of the deductible items as found by the commissioner and by the Appellate Tax Board was $113,-172,735. The sole question in controversy is the value of the taxpayer\u2019s \u201ccorporate franchise\u201d upon which, after making this deduction, the tax, according to the provisions of the statute, was to be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The commissioner assessed a tax upon the taxpayer purporting to be based upon the value of its corporate franchise in excess of the deduction required by the statute of the value as above stated of its property subject to local taxation. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>St. 1936, c. 134 (see now St. 1939, c. 24, \u00a7 7), applicable to the taxpayer, provides that the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting its capital stock on January first preceding . . . shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be taken as the true value of its corporate franchise.\u201d The Appellate Tax Board did not find expressly the value of the corporate franchise of the taxpayer or the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting its capital stock,\u201d but found \u201con all the evidence . . . that the fair cash value\u201d of such shares on January 1, 1938, \u201cdid not exceed $113,172,735, the amount for which its property was assessed locally, and, therefore, no franchise tax was payable.\u201d Accordingly the board granted an abatement of the tax assessed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\">The abatement granted by the board was clearly right unless there was error in the finding above recited of the fair cash value of the shares constituting the capital stock of the taxpayer. This finding, however, was a finding of fact. And the \u201cdecision of the board is \u2018final as to findings of fact.\u2019 G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as'amended. Such findings cannot be reviewed by this court unless vitiated by error in an \u2018issue of law\u2019 raised before the board.\u201d \u201cAppeals from the board to this court are only \u2018as to matters of law\u2019 and this court cannot \u2018consider any issue of law which does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Garland School of Home </em>Making, 296 Mass. 378, 383. The claim of appeal sets forth as alleged error of law this statement in the opinion of the board: \u201cThe stock in this case had an active market and the prices for which it was bought and sold could be readily determined. Evidence that the intrinsic value of the assets and property of the corporation is in excess of the market value of all the shares is not material.\u201d Other alleged errors are incidental to this alleged error or dependent thereon, or relate to matters of fact and not to issues of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The method prescribed by the governing statute for determining the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting . . . [the] capital stock\u201d of the corporation that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to \u201cbe taken as the true value of its corporate franchise\u201d is as follows: \u201cThe commissioner shall ascertain from the returns or otherwise the true market value of the shares of each corporation required to make a return under section fifty-three or fifty-four, and shall estimate therefrom the fair cash value of all the shares constituting . . . [the] capital stock on January first preceding.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended by St. 1936, c. 134. This determination of value by the commissioner, however, is subject to review by the Appellate Tax Board on appeal. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 60. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 6, as amended. The returns referred to are the returns that corporations such as the taxpayer are required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 53, as amended by St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 60, and St. 1934, c. 323, \u00a7 6, to make to the commissioner annually. In such a return a corporation is required to set forth, \u201cas of January first of the year in which the return is made,\u201d the \u201ctotal authorized amount of its capital stock; the amount issued and outstanding and the amount then paid thereon; the classes, if any, into which it is divided; the par value and number of its shares; the market value of the shares of each class of its stock outstanding\u201d (clause First); a statement of its assets with the value thereof and of its liabilities (clause Second); a statement \u201cof the profit or loss resulting from the business of the corporation for the twelve months ending with December thirty-first preceding the year in which the return is made\u201d (clause Third); and a statement relating to its shareholders (clause Fourth).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\">It appears from the decision of the board that the taxpayer\u2019s return as of January first of the year in question was before the board. In accordance with the statutory requirement the record on appeal includes a copy of this return. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended. The record, however, does not set forth any evidence offered or admitted before the board. The decision of the board includes the following subsidiary findings of fact made by the board in addition to its findings of fact relating to deductible items: \u201cOn January 1, 1938 . . . [the taxpayer\u2019s] capital stock issued and outstanding consisted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>617,161 common shares, each having a par value of $100 . . . The stock has been listed on the Boston Stock Exchange for many years, is one of its most active issues, and is bought and sold practically every day. On December 31, 1937, and January 3, 1938, the exchange being closed on January 1 and 2, the price ranged from $120 to $121 per share. During the period from July 1, 1937, to June 30, 1938, the high was 140 and the low was 108. From October 1934, through April 1939, the high was 171. For the year 1935, 42,526 shares were dealt in; in the year 1936, 55,338; in 1937, 37,081, and in 1938, 30,229.\u201d Though the further statement that the \u201cstock in this case had an active market and the prices for which it was bought and sold could be readily determined\u201d is in the part of the decision entitled \u201cOpinion,\u201d obviously it is a finding of fact. See Assessors <em>of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., ante, </em>300, 303. Unless the value of each of the shares of the taxpayer was in excess of $183.37 the aggregate value of all the shares did not exceed the value of the deductible items as found by the board and uncontroverted. The tax assessed by the commissioner was upon a \u201cfair cash value of all the shares\u201d of the taxpayer on the basis of $200 for each of the shares. The issue of fact between taxpayer and commissioner, so far as it can be expressed in the value of each outstanding share of the stock of the taxpayer, is, therefore, between a value not in excess of $183.37, as found by the board, and a value of $200, as claimed by the comissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">There is nothing in the record showing that the finding of the board that the \u201cstock in this case had an active market and the prices for which it was bought and sold could be readily determined\u201d was not warranted by the evidence. And it is not necessarily inconsistent with any of the subsidiary findings of the board. It is not necessarily inconsistent with the volume of sales found as compared with the number of shares outstanding. This finding of fact, therefore, must be accepted by us as true. <em>Springfield Young Men\u2019s Christian Association </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>284 Mass. 1, 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The commissioner, therefore, must rely on the alleged error of law in the statement in the opinion that \u201cEvidence that the intrinsic value of the assets and property of the corporation is in excess of the market value of all the shares is not material.\u201d This statement must be considered in the light of the evidence before the board and of the facts found by the board. The record does not disclose that there was any evidence before the board \u201cthat the intrinsic value of the assets and property of the corporation is in excess of the market value of all the shares,\u201d apart from the return of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\">The tax imposed by the statute in question is not a tax upon the property of a corporation subject thereto, but rather is an excise upon the act or privilege of being a corporation or doing business as such \u2014 which need not be more particularly defined \u2014 represented by its corporate franchise. The \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting its capital stock \u201d is merely the prescribed measure of the value of the corporate franchise. It is this value, less the value of the deductible items locally taxed, upon which the corporate franchise tax or excise is assessed. These principles were established by decisions rendered under the statute as it was first enacted in 1864. See St. 1864, c. 208; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>12 Allen, 75, 76-77; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>12 Allen, 298, 300-305. The changes in the form of the statute since that time have not rendered these principles inapplicable to the taxpayer \u2014 an electric company as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 164, \u00a7 1, organized under the laws of the Commonwealth \u2014 see <em>New England &amp; Savannah Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Mass. 385, 387, whatever may be the effect, as we need not decide, as applied to business corporations, of the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 30 (3), originating in St. 1927, c. 258, \u00a7 1, which are not applicable to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The contention of the commissioner that the statement or ruling objected to was erroneous as matter of law involves two fundamental questions: (a) one, as to the thing to be valued, (b) the other, as to the nature of the value to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>be attributed thereto and the method of determining, such value.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\">First. Of course the ultimate thing to be valued is .the \u201ccorporate franchise.\u201d But by express provision of the statute the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the corporate franchise of the taxpayer is the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting its [the corporation\u2019s] capital stock,\u201d so that the thing to be valued as an exercise of judgment is \u201call the shares constituting its [the corporation\u2019s] capital stock.\u201d We consider, therefore, the meaning of this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The words \u201ccapital stock,\u201d like the word \u201ccapital,\u201d may have different meanings when used in different connections. See <em>Hood Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 369, 371; <em>Commissioner of Banks in re Prudential Trust Co. </em>244 Mass. 64, 72; <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, ante, </em>374, 382. But the natural meaning of \u201call the shares constituting its [the corporation\u2019s] capital stock\u201d is such shares outstanding in the hands of the shareholders. See <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal, </em>184 Mass. 460, 463-465. The shares are to be regarded from the standpoint of the shareholders, not from the standpoint of the corporation as the general assets of the corporation including investments and surplus (see <em>Commissioner of Banks in re Prudential Trust Co. </em>244 Mass. 64, 72) or the property paid by the original shareholders for subscriptions to shares. See <em>Hood Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 369, 372; <em>Commissioner of Banks in re Prudential Trust Co. </em>244 Mass. 64, 72. Compare <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, ante, </em>374, 382-383. The fact that the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares\u201d constituting the \u201ccapital stock\u201d of a corporation is to be estimated from the true \u201cmarket value of the shares\u201d of such corporation supports the conclusion that it is the shares of the corporation. in the hands of its shareholders, rather than the property of the corporation, that are to be valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The history of the statute also supports this conclusion. Prior to the passage of St. 1864, c. 208, whereby a corporate franchise tax or excise (see <em>Eaton, Crane &amp; Pike Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Mass. 523, 526-528) was imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>certain corporations, corporate shares were taxed locally as personal property of the shareholders. <em>Salem Iron Factory Co. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>10 Mass. 514. <em>Middlesex Railroad </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>8 Allen, 330, 333. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal, </em>184 Mass. 460, 462. <em>New England &amp; Savannah Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Mass. 385, 386. The corporation, however, was subject to the local property tax upon its real estate though not upon its personal property. <em>Salem Iron Factory Co. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>10 Mass. 514. As early, however, as 1832, it was recognized that, in effect, taxation of corporate shares to the shareholders and of real estate owned by the corporation to the corporation resulted in double taxation, and a statute was passed (St. 1832, c. 158) providing for local taxation of the machinery of a manufacturing corporation, and providing further that, in assessing the shares of such a corporation, \u201cthere shall first be deducted from the value thereof, the value of the machinery and real estate belonging to such corporation, otherwise specifically taxed.\u201d See <em>New England &amp; Savannah Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Mass. 385, 386. See also St. 1837, c. 86; Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 12, Second. But, as was said in the case just cited, \u201cfor obvious reasons this method of reaching for taxation the personal property of domestic corporations, especially that part of it whose value was represented by shares held by shareholders residing out of the Commonwealth, was defective.\u201d An attempt to remedy this particular defect was made in 1863 by St. 1863, c. 236, by requiring domestic corporations to pay an excise on shares of nonresident owners, but the statute was held unconstitutional in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Washington Mills, </em>11 Allen, 268. In 1864, however \u2014 before this decision was rendered \u2014 St. 1864, c. 208, was passed imposing an excise on corporations based upon \u201cthe excess of the market value of all the capital stock of each corporation . . . [with exceptions not here material] over the value of its real estate and machinery, if any,\u201d locally taxed in the Commonwealth, \u00a7 5, and providing that the \u201cshares in the capital stock of any corporation, . . . taxed by this act, shall be exempt from taxation to the shareholders.\u201d \u00a7 15. The returns provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>for by the statute to be made by corporations subject thereto, from which, \u201cor otherwise,\u201d \u201cthe excess of the market value of all the capital stock\u201d over the value of real estate and machinery locally taxed was to be estimated, were to include, among other things, the names and residences of the shareholders, \u201cthe amount of the capital stock of the corporation\u201d and \u201cthe par value and the cash market value of the shares.\u201d \u00a7 2. The provisions of the statute indicate that the corporate excise imposed thereby was in the nature of a substitute for the local tax previously imposed on resident shareholders on account of the shares owned by them, but reaching also for taxation the shares owned by nonresidents. The statute not only referred to \u201cmarket value of all the capital stock,\u201d but also provided for a deduction similar to that authorized by the previous statutes relating to local taxation of shares. It was not unnatural that the thing to be valued under such a substituted statute as the measure of the excise imposed thereby should resemble closely the thing to be valued for the purpose of the local tax previously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\">That the so called \u201ctax\u201d imposed by St. 1864, c. 208, was to be measured by the value of the shares in the hands of the shareholders, rather than by the value of the property of the corporation, was pointed out in a series of cases decided by this court in 1866 and 1867. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>12 Allen, 75, 76, it was said: \u201cWe do not understand that the legislature intended that the assessment authorized by that statute should be imposed as a tax on property. It was designed to be in the nature of an excise or duty on the franchise or privilege of each of the corporations designated, to be estimated and measured by ascertaining the excess of the market value of the capital stock or aggregate of the shares over the value of the real estate and machinery for which each corporation was assessed in the town or city in which it was established and carried on its business.\u201d And in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>12 Allen, 298, the court said in the course of an elaborate discussion (pages 301-306) of the nature of the tax or excise imposed by St. 1864, c. 208: \u201cThe tax is . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>laid, not on 'capital stock as signifying the money paid in to carry on the business of the corporation or the property purchased therewith and owned by the corporation, but on capital stock representing the aggregate of the market value of the shares\u201d (page 304), and it was pointed out that the provision for \u201cthe deduction of the value of the real estate and machinery from the aggregate market value of the stock allowed by the statute\u201d was not inconsistent with the nature of the excise as so described, but that the \u201creason for the deduction is obvious. The real estate and machinery of corporations, under the general tax act, are subject to local taxation in the towns where they are situated. Inasmuch as all taxes on corporate property operate to take away a portion of that which would otherwise belong to shareholders, it would tend to inequality and to double taxation, if, in assessing the excise on the franchise, no deduction were made for what was taxed in a different manner elsewhere.\u201d Pages 305-306. The court concluded that the result \u201cto which we have come on this part of the case is, that the tax in question was intended to be and is an excise on the franchise of corporations, and not on their property; that the imposition of it was a lawful exercise of legislative power under the constitution, and that the mode of measuring the value of the franchise by the market value of the whole stock, allowing the element of deduction as equitable in its general effect, is just, reasonable and valid.\u201d Page 306. Moreover, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>98 Mass. 19, 21-22, the court said with respect to St. 1864, c. 208: \u201cThe computation or estimate to be made by them [the tax commissioners] is in no legal sense a valuation of the property of the corporation .. . the valuation that is to be ascertained is nothing else than the market value of all the shares of the capital stock of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ1u\">The board in its decision in the present case relied upon the <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>case and the <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>case. While the commissioner does not attack these cases as applied to St. 1864, c. 208, he contends that they are inapplicable to the present statute by reason of statutory changes that have intervened. This argument may, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>form, be addressed to the method of valuation rather than to the thing to be valued, but, in substance, it seems to be addressed, in part at least, to the thing to be valued, with the implication that it is now the capital stock of the corporation from the standpoint of the corporation, rather than the shares thereof in the hands of the shareholders, that is to be valued. We pass without discussion the quesT tian whether this argument, if sound, would render the excise unconstitutional as imposing a tax upon the corporate property that would not be proportional, since we are of opinion that the statutory changes have made no such change in the thing to be valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\">In 1865 \u2014 before the decision of the group of cases just above cited relating to St. 1864, c. 208 \u2014 St. 1865, c. 283, was passed amending and revising the previous statute. By this later statute corporations subject thereto were required to make returns in general similar to those required under the previous statute. A corporation was required to include, in such a return \u201cthe par value and the market value of the shares\u201d of the corporation \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 instead of \u201cthe par value and the cash market value of the shares\u201d as under the previous statute. \u00a7 3. The tax commissioner was required (a) to \u201cascertain, from the returns or otherwise, the true market value of the shares of each corporation,\u201d (b) to \u201cestimate therefrom the fair cash valuation of all of said shares constituting the capital stock of such corporation\u201d (c) \u201cwhich shall be taken as the true value of its corporate franchise,\u201d \u00a7 4, and (d) \u201cto ascertain and determine \u201d the value of certain deductible items \u2014 in the case of a corporation like the taxpayer, its \u201creal estate and machinery, subject to local taxation, wherever situated.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. Each such corporation was required to pay \u201ca tax upon its corporate franchise at a valuation thereof equal to the aggregate value of the shares in its capital stock\u201d as above stated after making the statutory deductions. \u00a7 5. It is apparent that, as here described, the thing to be valued, the value of which was to be \u201ctaken as the true value of its [the corporation\u2019s] corporate franchise,\u201d was all the shares of stock of the corporation outstanding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the hands of the shareholders. The language of the statute shows this intention, even more clearly, if that were possible, than the language of the previous statute that was so construed in the cases arising thereunder. And in <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>100 Mass. 399, 404, a case that arose under St. 1865, c. 283, it was said that it was \u201cthe aggregate value of all the shares, which must be taken as the value of the franchise for taxation.\u201d The language of St. 1865, c. 283, with respect to the thing to be valued remained unchanged in Pub. Sts. c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 40, yet under that statute the court in <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Mass. 68, 70, in holding that unissued shares were not to be included in estimating the value of the shares in a corporation\u2019s capital stock, said that under the provisions of the statute \u201cthe aggregate value of the shares in the capital stock is to be taken as a basis.\u201d The statutory language with respect to the thing to be valued continued unchanged in It. L. c. 14, \u00a7 38. And in the case of <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal, </em>184 Mass. 460, 466, which arose while this statute was in effect and related to a distribution of the corporate excise among the cities and towns, the court said with respect to the statutory provision relating to such distribution that \u201cit is evident that its purpose was to give to towns a share of this excise tax corresponding to that which under the former system they had to the tax upon the personal property of these corporations, or in other words that the share of each town in the excise tax is measured by the number of shares which under the former system would have been taxable in that town.\u201d This conclusion is in harmony with the concept of the corporate excise as in part in the nature of a substitute for the local property tax upon shares owned by residents of the Commonwealth and with the principle first established under St. 1864, c. 208, that the thing to be valued as a basis for the corporate excise is the shares of stock of a corporation in the hands of its shareholders. The language of the statute under which the tax or excise in question in the present case was assessed, so far as it re-lotes to the thing to be valued, does not differ in any ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>terial respect from the language first used in St. 1865, c. 283. As under that statute the thing to be valued was the shares of the corporation outstanding in the hands of the shareholders, the present statute is to be given the same interpretation. The aggregate value of the shares of the corporation in the hands of its shareholders is to be \u201ctaken as the true value of its corporate franchise.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"AWEz\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 53, Second, Third, contain provisions, originally introduced into the statute by St. 1914, c. 198, \u00a7 6, requiring a corporation such as the taxpayer to include in its return statements of its \u201cassets . . . with the value thereof,\u201d including assets that are not deductible items, of its \u201cliabilities,\u201d and of the \u201cprofit or loss resulting from the business of the corporation for the twelve months ending with December thirty-first preceding the year in which the return is made.\u201d \"Whatever may have been the purpose of this requirement of the inclusion of such statements in \u2022 a return, the requirement cannot fairly be interpreted as modifying the express provision of the statute that the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares constituting ... [the] capital stock\u201d of the corporation shall \u201cbe taken as the true value of its corporate franchise,\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended, by changing the nature of the thing to be valued \u2014 the aggregate of all the .shares of the corporation in the .hands of its shareholders. Jt is true that this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>12 Allen, 298, 302, in sustaining the constitutionality of the \u201ctax\u201d imposed by St. 1864, c. 208, as an excise rather than a tax on property, mentioned that the \u201cstatute does not require that there should be any return made of the personal property held by corporations to the board of commissioners who are to fix the amount on which the assessment is to be reckoned, nor is there any valuation or estimate of such property to be made in order to arrive at the amount of the excise or duty.\u201d It is not to be thought, however, that the Legislature, by requiring statements of assets, liabilities, and profit and loss of a corporation to be included in its return, intended thereby to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>form the nature of the tax or excise, as long established and held constitutional, by providing that the thing to be valued as the basis thereof should be the assets of a corporation, its assets less its liabilities, or its capitalized earning power. This change in the requirements with respect to returns cannot rightly be held to carry so heavy a burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\">On this branch of the case the Commonwealth is not aided by the decision in <em>Ray Consolidated Copper Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>268 U. S. 373, 377, where the court was dealing with the Federal capital stock tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1057, 1126, as an excise based upon the \"fair average value of its [the corporation\u2019s] capital stock for the preceding year,\" and stated that the \"capital stock of a corporation, its net assets, and its shares of stock are entirely different things.\" The language of the statute indicated that it was the \"capital stock\" from the standpoint of the corporation that was to be valued. The statute now under consideration bases the corporate franchise tax qr excise, not upon the \"capital stock\" of the corporation, but upon \"all the shares constituting its capital stock,\" which, in the light of the decided cases, are such shares from the standpoint of its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The provisions of the statute (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30-52, as amended) imposing an excise on certain business corporations \u2014 with respect to the carrying on or doing business \u2014 based in part upon the \" corporate excess \u201d of such a corporation which is defined, in the case of a domestic business corporation, as \"the fair value of its capital stock\" less certain deductions (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 63, \u00a7 30 [3]) \u2014 a definition substituted by St. 1927, c. 258, \u00a7 1, for \"the fair cash value of all the shares constituting the' capital stock of a corporation\" less certain deductions \u2014 are not applicable to the taxpayer, and we make no intimation as to the meaning of the words \"capital stock\u201d \u00e1s used in this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The thing to be valued for the purpose of determining the \"true value of . . . [the] corporate franchise\" of the taxpayer, as the basis of the corporate franchise tax or. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>excise imposed upon it, therefore, was the aggregate of all the shares of the taxpayer outstanding in the hands of its shareholders, and not \u201cthe assets and property of the corporation.\u201d The \u201cintrinsic value\u201d of such \u201cassets and property,\u201d referred to in the Commonwealth\u2019s claim of appeal, therefore, was material, if at all, only so far as it bore upon the value of the shares in the hands of the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\">Second. The value of \u201call the shares\u201d of the corporation outstanding in the hands- of its shareholders \u2014 the thing to be valued \u2014 that is to be \u201ctaken as the true value of . . . [the taxpayer\u2019s]-corporate franchise,\u201d by the terms of the statute, is the \u201cfair cash value\u201d thereof. But this value is to be <em>estimated </em>from the \u201ctrue market value\u201d of the shares. The latter value is to be <em>ascertained </em>not merely from the return of the taxpayer but from all available facts that are material upon such \u201ctrue market value.\u201d It is not wholly clear why this dual standard was established by St. 1866, c. 283, \u00a7 4, and continued, except for a change from \u201cfair cash valuation\u201d to \u201cfair cash value,\u201d up to and including G. L, (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended, applicable to the present case, instead of the standard fixed by St. 1864, c. 208, of the \u201cmarket value of all the capital stock,\u201d meaning, as defined in the cases arising under that statute, the shares of the corporation outstanding in the hands of the shareholders.. It is not unlikely, however, that the words \u201cfair cash valuation\u201d in St. 1865, c. 283, \u00a7 4, were adopted by analogy to the then existing requirement that assessors \u201cmake a fair cash valuation\u201d of \u201call the estate real and personal\u201d within the respective towns and cities. See Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 24. See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 38. The \u201cfair cash value,\u201d as these words are used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended \u2014 expressed as the \u201cfair cash valuation\u201d in St. 1865, c. 283, \u00a7 4 \u2014 of the shares of a corporation in the hands of its shareholders is the ultimate value to be determined as fixing the \u201ctrue value of its corporate franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">, In other connections, the words \u201cfair cash value\u201d may perhaps have a different meaning, but as.here used they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>refer ordinarily, if not always, to exchange value. In <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>155 Mass. 313, 315, where the court had under consideration a petition for abatement of a tax on bank shares on the ground that that property was assessed \u201cabove the fair cash value,\u201d it was said, in language pertinent to the present case: \u201cThe thing of which the fair cash value is to be found is the stock or shares of the corporation. Value refers to exchange. The cash value of an article is the amount of cash for which it will exchange in fact. That amount depends on the opinion of the public of possible buyers, or of that part of it which will pay the most. If in their opinion the stock is worth only $102 per share, \u2014 if that is all that the stock will sell for, \u2014 it is vain to show that the net value of the property of the corporation, that is to say, the opinion of the- public about a chief component element of the value of the stock, if uncontrolled, logically leads to a different value for the stock. It has been recognized judicially that the'value of the property and the value of the stock might differ ...\u201d Since this case was decided \u2014 in 1892 \u2014 \u2022 the statutes imposing a corporate franchise tax or excise upon the class of corporations embracing corporations like the present taxpayer have been amended, revised or codified many times, in each instance retaining the words \u201cfair cash value.\u201d See R. L. c. 14, \u00a7 38; St. 1902, c. 342, \u00a7 3; St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 72; St. 1909, c. 439, \u00a7 2, c. 490, Part III, \u00a7 41; St. 1914, c. 198, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 55; St. 1926, c. 279, \u00a7 6; St. 1936, c. 134. See also St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 212, Part III, \u00a7 126, c. 516, \u00a7 15. While the case just cited dealt with the words \u201cfair cash value\u201d as used in a different statute, it is to be assumed, in the absence of considerations to the contrary, that the later statutes culminating in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55, as amended, used these words as they had been judicially interpreted. See <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>214 Mass. 477, 479; <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works of Holyoke, </em>222 Mass. 22, 24. Moreover, in <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>175 Mass. 257, 262, the court said that, \u201cgenerally speaking, when a statute requires the \u2018fair cash value\u2019 of property on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>certain day to be ascertained ... it refers to the actual judgment of the public as expressed in the price which some one will pay ... It means the highest price that a normal purchaser, not under peculiar compulsion, will pay at that time to get that thing.\u201d It was in this case suggested, though not decided, that the word \u201cfair\u201d might \u201cadd a little latitude to the definition and . . . allow a correction of whatever was the fleeting accident of a moment of panic by the consideration of values on either side of the precise time fixed by the statute.\u201d And in <em>Massachusetts General Hospital </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 208, where the question involved was the \u201cfair cash value\u201d of real estate for the purpose of local taxation, it was said that it \u201cis possible that taxation cases may arise where, in order to give rational effect to the declared intention of the Legislature, the words \u2018fair cash value\u2019 must be given a somewhat more elastic significance than heretofore has been attributed to them,\u201d and illustrative- cases were cited. But there is nothing in the record of the present case to show that it is not within the ordinary rule that \u201cfair cash value\u201d means exchange value. The nature of the thing to be valued \u2014 the shares of stock of the corporation in the hands of its shareholders \u2014 and the finding of the board that this \u201cstock . . . had an active market and the prices for which it was bought and sold could be readily determined\u201d are in accord with this conclusion. The words \u201cfair cash value\u201d clearly do not mean the value to the owner alone, that is, a value based on an element or elements of value of the property in the hands of its owner that would not affect its exchange value. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\">There is nothing in the statutory requirement, that the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares\u201d constituting the capital stock of a corporation shall be <em>estimated </em>from the \u201ctrue market value of the shares,\u201d that tends to negative the conclusion that the value of the shares to be determined is exchange value. Indeed, this provision emphasizes the conclusion that exchange value is the test. The words \u201cfair cash value\u201d and the words \u201cfair market value\u201d are fre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>quently treated as synonymous. See <em>Massachusetts General Hospital </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 207; <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Boston Consolidated Gas Co. </em>309 Mass. 60, 63. In <em>Massachusetts General Hospital </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>238 Mass. 396, 402, it was said of elements to be considered in deciding what is the \u201cfair cash value\u201d of the property to be valued that \u201cthe sum of them all cannot inflate the value beyond the price at which the property will sell in the market under fair conditions at the time designated.\u201d (We perceive no significant distinction between \u201cfair market value\u201d and \u201ctrue market value.\u201d) But, in accordance with familiar principles of statutory construction, neither the clause containing the expression \u201cfair cash value\u201d nor that containing the expression \u201ctrue market value\u201d is to be regarded as superfluous unless no other course is open. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>256 Mass. 426, 429. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>295 Mass. 467, 469. And the clauses are not identical in meaning. They relate to different subjects. It is the \u201cfair cash value \u201d of \u201call the shares constituting . . . [the] capital stock\u201d of such a corporation that is to be estimated from the \u201ctrue market value\u201d of \u201cthe shares,\u201d that is, of the separate shares. It is common knowledge that the exchange value of \u201call the shares\u201d of a corporation, considered as a single unit, may differ from the aggregate exchange value of the shares considered as separate units. And in view of the original purpose of the corporate franchise tax or excise as to some extent a substitute for the local property tax on the shares in the hands of the shareholders, it was natural to make the value of such shares considered separately the basis for the corporate franchise tax or excise. That such is the meaning of the statute appears from the language of the opinion in a case decided by the court in 1868 under St. 1865, c. 283 \u2014 the statute in which the measure of value was first stated in substantially the form in which it now appears. It was said in that case, <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>100 Mass. 399, 404, that it was \u201cthe aggregate value of all the shares, which must be taken as the value of the franchise for taxation.\u201d And this lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>guage was substantially repeated in <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Mass. 68, 70, with respect to Pub. Sts. c. 13, \u00a7 39, where the same standard of value was prescribed as was prescribed by St. 1865, c. 283, \u00a7 4, and is now prescribed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 55; as amended. The statute, therefore, is to be construed as laying down as a formula for determining the exchange value of \u201call the shares\u201d of a corporation, that such exchange value shall be <em>estimated </em>from the exchange value of the separate shares in the hands of the shareholders rather than as requiring an independent determination of the exchange value of \u201call the shares\u201d considered as a unit. The requirement that the exchange value of \u201call the shares\u201d be <em>estimated </em>from the prescribed data, descriptive of the method of determining such value, supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\">It follows from what has been said that the governing statute provides that the \u201ctrue value of . . . [the] corporate franchise,\u201d which, subject to statutory deductions, is the basis for the corporate franchise tax or excise, shall be determined by applying the exchange value \u2014 in the language of the statute, the \u201ctrue market value\u201d \u2014 of the shares of stock in the hands of its shareholders to the capital structure of the corporation represented by its various classes of stock outstanding. See <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Mass. 68. It may well be that, if the decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. 12 </em>Allen, 75, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. 12 </em>Allen, 298, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>98 Mass. 19, had been made before St. 1865, c. 283, was passed, the Legislature might not have deemed it necessary to change the formula for determining the amount, upon which the corporate franchise tax or excise should be based from that used in St. 1864, c. 208, \u00a7 5 \u2014 \u201cthe market value of all the capital stock\u201d of a corporation less certain deductions. Those decisions, however, remain applicable- to the statute as changed. The \u201caggregate market value of all the shares,\u201d in the phrase used in the <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>case (page 302), remains the basis for the corporate franchise tax or excise, or, as was said in that case (page 304), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the tax is based on \u201cthe aggregate value of the shares ascertained by the price paid in the market for the shares when sold as the separate property of the stockholders.\u201d See also the <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>case, page 76, and the <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>case, page 22. The board rightly relied on the authority of these two cases, notwithstanding the change in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\">The question for, determination, therefore, is narrowed to the question whether, in determining the \u201ctrue market Value\u201d of the shares of the taxpayer in the hands of its shareholders, the board upon this issue was in error in ruling or finding that \u201cEvidence that the intrinsic value of the assets and property of the corporation is in excess of the market value of all the shares is not material.\u201d It is unnecessary to discuss generally the meaning of \u201ctrue market value\u201d or its more familiar counterpart \u201cfair market value.\u201d As applied to the present case the language in the <em>Hamilton Manuf. Co. </em>case, page 302, remains pertinent: \u201cThe market value of the shares of a corporation, or the aggregate market value of all the shares, by which we understand the cash price for which the shares will sell in the market, does not necessarily indicate the actual value or amount of property which a corporation may own. The price for which all the shares would sell may greatly exceed the aggregate of the corporate property, or it may fall very far short of it. Undoubtedly the amount of property belonging to a corporation is one of the considerations which enters into the market value of its shares; but such market value also embraces other essential elements.\u201d See also the <em>Lowell Gas Light Co. </em>case, page 76. And, as was said in the <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>case (page 22), \u201cthe property held by a corporation does not furnish a proper measure of the value of its capital stock regarded as a franchise. The market value of corporate stock must be determined like the market value of any other commodity, by the price that it commands upon actual sales.\u201d In view of the findings of the board as to actual sales, it is unnecessary to discuss the situations where there is no such sale or where sales are made under unusual conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The \u201cintrinsic value of the assets and property of the corporation\u201d would be material only in its bearing upon the exchange value of the shares in the hands of the shareholders. And that value \u201cdepends on the opinion of the public of possible buyers, or of that part of it which will pay the most. If in their opinion the stock is worth only ... [a certain amount], \u2014 if that is all that the stock will sell for, \u2014 it is vain to show that the net value of the property of the corporation, that is to say, the opinion of the public about a chief component element of the value of the stock, if uncontrolled, logically leads to a different value for the stock.\u201d <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>155 Mass. 313, 315. In <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>175 Mass. 257, 262-263, as in the earlier case of the same name, the exchange value of certain bank shares was involved, and this court said that there \u201cwas sufficient evidence upon which to form an opinion of the selling price . . . without the need of resorting to such indirect methods of getting at it [that is, a resort to the excess of assets over liabilities], and therefore the attempt to divert the inquiry into a wrong channel was met properly enough by a rejection of the evidence.\u201d This language is applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The board did not rule as matter of law that evidence of \u201cthe intrinsic value of the assets and property\u201d of a corporation was never material in determining, for the purpose of the corporate franchise tax or excise, the \u201cfair cash value of all the shares\u201d constituting the capital stock of a corporation, or the \u201ctrue market value\u201d of its shares. Doubtless such evidence would be material in some cases, possibly in many cases. The requirement by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 53, Second, Third (see St. 1914, c. 198, \u00a7 6), of inclusion in the return of a corporation of statements of its assets, liabilities, and profit and loss, does not import that in every case the facts so stated are material in determining the \u201ctrue value of its corporate franchise.\u201d Such facts are thus rendered available when material. The board in this case merely decided that, upon the facts found by it, evidence of \u201cthe intrinsic value of the assets and property\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>taxpayer was immaterial, implying that, in view of its findings with respect to actual sales of shares of stock in the taxpayer, there was \u201csufficient evidence upon which to form an opinion of the selling price\u201d of such shares without resort to such indirect evidence as the \u201cintrinsic value of the assets and property\u201d of the taxpayer. Whether the decision is to be regarded as a finding or as a ruling, it was not erroneous as matter of law upon the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\">\n<em>Abatement granted in the amount of $896,682.20 with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
