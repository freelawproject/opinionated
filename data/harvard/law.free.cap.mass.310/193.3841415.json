Thereafter a judge of the Superior Court denied a motion of the insurer for the entry of final decree after rescript, and allowed motions of the employee for a stay of entry of a final decree after rescript, and for the recommittal of the case to the Industrial Accident Board \"for further hearing on the question whether the injury to the employee arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">On recommittal the Industrial Accident Board referred the case to the single member who had heard it before, \"for further hearing as to whether the injury to the employee arose out of and in the course of his employment and for decision anew upon the whole record.\u201d The single member found that the injury of the employee did not arise out of and in the course of his employment and denied his claim for compensation. The reviewing board adopted the findings and rulings of the single member and a judge of the Superior Court entered a decree dismissing the employee\u2019s claim. From this decree the employee has appealed. The insurer also appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">1. At the second hearing before the single member, after recommittal, the record of the first hearing before him was incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, the record of the second hearing. At the first hearing there was testimony that the employee was a \u201crepair man\u201d in an umbrella factory and that his work was the repairing of umbrellas; that lunch hour at the factory was from twelve to one o\u2019clock and that on the day he was injured, which was the day before Christmas, he left the factory at twelve o\u2019clock, had lunch outside and returned to the factory; that he first went to the second floor, where he worked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and left his coat near his work bench; that he then went to the third floor \"to visit girls,\u201d where \"some of the girls\u201d were having \"some sort of celebration ... a small Christmas party\u201d; that he stayed there \"a few minutes,\u201d and shortly before one o\u2019clock left the third floor with the purpose \"to go to work\u201d on the second floor; and that while on a stairway leading from the third to the second floor, and on a step about three steps from the landing on the second floor, he fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">At the second hearing before the single member there was additional testimony of the employee which is here summarized: He was acquainted with most of the employees in the factory. \"He met these people often in the course of his work. At lunch time he visited around the building. There was no rule to prevent it. Nobody ever told him he could not go upstairs.\u201d It was not unusual for him, during the lunch hour, to go from the second to the third floor. Other employees who worked on the second floor visited on the third floor. \"As far as he can remember, it was the customary thing for fellows who worked on the second floor and visited on the third floor to use the stairway to come back down to the second floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">At the second hearing before the single member, the employee filed a number of requests for findings of fact. The single member allowed certain of those requests. They were to the effect that the employee\u2019s usual place of work was on the second floor of the factory; that it was necessary for him in the course of his employment to go to other floors in the factory many times a day and in so doing to pass over the stairway in question many times each day; that \u201cwater bubblers\u201d available to employees were located on the third and fourth floors of the factory and to reach them it was necessary for employees on the second floor to use the stairway in question; and that the freight elevator in the building was not available for use by employees. The single member, in his decision, referred to certain other requests of the employee for findings of fact which, in substance, embodied the evidence of the employee here set out in the preceding paragraph. The single member stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that he did \u201cnot believe\u201d that these requests \u201care warranted in their entirety\u201d on the evidence. But he did not indicate what parts of these requests for findings of fact he believed were \u201cwarranted\u201d or what evidence he disbelieved. He further stated that \u201cIn so far as\u201d these requests \u201care inconsistent with the above findings they are disallowed.\u201d There is no apparent inconsistency between the \u201cabove findings\u201d (that is, the findings he made in accordance with the requests of the employee) and the findings requested by the employee to the effect that employees in the factory were accustomed to meet on the third floor in the lunch hour, and that there was no rule or instruction by the employer to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The ultimate conclusion of the single member, \u201cthat the employee\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d was based on his \u201copinion that the additional evidence offered by the employee at . . . [the second] hearing is not sufficient to warrant a finding that \u2018he was returning by a route which he was expected or allowed to use.\u2019 \u201d In this the single member erred, as did the reviewing board, in affirming and adopting his \u201cfurther findings, rulings and decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">With the additional testimony of the employee given at the second hearing there was evidence which, if believed, warranted the following conclusions: It was a general practice of employees in the factory to gather on the third floor during noon hours. There was no rule or instruction of the employer to the contrary. It was the practice of employees whose place of work was on the second floor to use the stairway in question in going to and from the third floor, when such visits were made by them. It is not necessary here to consider what, if any, the rights of the employee would have been if he had received injury while on the third floor. A finding was warranted that at least he was permitted to go there. But, at the time of his injury, his visit to the third floor had ended. A few minutes before one o\u2019clock he left that floor with the intent to resume his work on the second floor. His purpose in going down the stairs was to put himself in a position to carry out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>duties for which he was employed. He fell on the third step from the second floor. In walking down the stairs he was acting for the benefit of his employer. He was doing \u25a0\u2014 not a forbidden act \u2014 but an act which, it could be found, was permitted to employees who visited on the third floor of the factory during lunch hours and were returning to the place where they worked, on the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"AJG\">In order that an injured employee be entitled to compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation act it is not necessary that at the time of his injury he should be actively performing the duties of his employment. <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56, 61. <em>Hallett\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 49, 52. <em>Holmes\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 307, 309. Compare <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 65, 66; <em>Babineau\u2019s Case, </em>254 Mass. 214, 215. It was said in <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28, 34, that \u201cthe sphere of employment exists and affords its shield to the employee while within the premises of the employer on the way to or on the return from actual performance of the specific duties of the employment.\u201d There was here evidence which, if believed, warranted the findings that at the time of his injury the employee was making a permitted use of the stairway and was on his way immediately to resume his work. A conclusion was warranted that the employee received an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">2. The appeal taken by the insurer relates solely to the action of the Superior Court when the case came before it after rescript. The insurer contends that the court erred in denying its motion for entry of a final decree after rescript, and in allowing the employee\u2019s motion that the case be recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board. A bill of exceptions filed by the insurer and allowed by the court contained the same contentions. An appeal, and not a bill of exceptions, was the proper way to bring the case before this court. <em>Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"A_P\">The employee\u2019s appeal vacated the final decree earlier entered in the Superior Court. <em>Carilli </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>303 Mass. 82, 84. After a rescript ordering the entry of a final decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cthe Superior Court upon being shown that the record upon which the case was decided in this court was inadequate or erroneous in an essential matter of fact, had power in its discretion to reopen the case in order to obtain a full and accurate revised finding of the facts.\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>George, </em>296 Mass. 574, 577, and cases cited. <em>Fred T. Ley &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sagalyn, </em>302 Mass. 488, 495. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 495. Deficiencies in proof that the employee\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment were pointed out in the opinion. The Superior Court was justified in finding that the record was inadequate and, in the exercise of its discretion, was warranted in reopening the case for further hearing by the Industrial Accident Board. <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 467, 470. <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 98. <em>Fierro\u2019s Case, 223 </em>Mass. 378. <em>Devine\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 588, 595. <em>Ward\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 72, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is contended by the insurer that the motion to recommit the case was not supported by a proper affidavit. So far as appears this objection was not suggested by the insurer to the judge of the Superior Court when the employee\u2019s motion for recommittal of the case to the Industrial Accident Board was heard. The present Rule 46 of the Superior Court (1932) corresponds for the most part with earlier similar rules of the Superior Court. Rule 29 (1906). Rule 24 (1915). Rule 46, however, differs in a material respect from the earlier rules. They read: \u201cThe court will not hear any motion . . . unless the facts are verified by affidavit\u201d; while Rule 46 (1932) says that the court \u201cneed not hear any motion . . . unless the facts are verified by affidavit.\u201d It is said in <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>294 Mass. 94, 97, that \u201cThe present rule enlarges the discretion of the trial judge to hear such motions.\u201d Effect must be given to this change in phraseology. The rule in its present form does not require that a motion to recommit be supported by an affidavit. A judge may in his discretion entertain a motion supported by such an affidavit as was filed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">3. The insurer\u2019s exceptions must be dismissed. The decree of the Superior Court that the employee\u2019s claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>compensation be dismissed must be reversed, and a decree entered remanding the case to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
