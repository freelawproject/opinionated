A decree was entered disallowing six of the items of payments and charges and $10 included in another item, amounting in the aggregate to $155, and leaving a balance on hand of $155, amending the account accordingly, and allowing it as a first account. The decree also provided that \"it further appearing that the former ward has necessarily expended certain sums in connection with this accounting and owes his attorney for services; it is further decreed that the accountant pay to said distributee the sum of $134.10, as damages.\u201d From this decree the accountant appealed. No evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>reported. At the request of the accountant, however, the judge made a report of the material facts found by him. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 11. It does not appear that any attempt was made to secure any change in these findings of fact or any further findings of fact. See <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Houghton &amp; Dutton Co. </em>277 Mass. 209, 214-215; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>293 Mass. 327, 328; <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>298 Mass. 182, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Procedure on this appeal in a probate proceeding follows that in equity so far as applicable and practicable. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 9. <em>Ensign </em>v. <em>Faxon, </em>229 Mass. 231. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>284 Mass. 255, 257. The material facts found by the judge must be deemed to be all the facts upon which he acted in entering the decree and leave no room for further findings to be implied from the decree. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Quinlivan, </em>308 Mass. 339, 341, and cases cited. <em>Sidlow </em>v. <em>Gosselin, ante, </em>395, 397. In the absence, as here, of any report of the evidence, the material facts reported must be taken as true unless \u201cthey appear on the face of the report to be mutually inconsistent or plainly wrong or incompatible with the pleadings or other documents set forth in the record.\u201d <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Houghton &amp; Dutton Co. </em>277 Mass. 209, 215. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>King, </em>288 Mass. 381, 383. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>297 Mass. 229, 231-232. The \u201cfindings of fact thus made are in the nature of documents to be interpreted.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>272 Mass. 146, 149. The question for decision is whether, solely on the findings reported by the judge, considered as above stated, the decree was rightly entered. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>243 Mass. 377, 378. <em>Melville Shoe Corp. </em>v. <em>Kozminsky, </em>268 Mass. 172, 174. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Quinlivan, </em>308 Mass. 339, 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">1. Disallowance of items of payments and charges other than compensation for services. \u2014 The burden of establishing the correctness of the account in respect to these items by affirmative evidence rested on the accountant. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Farwell, </em>195 Mass. 559, 560. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>284 Mass. 255, 258. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>293 Mass. 327, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">On the facts stated in the report this burden was not sustained as to any of these items \u2014 aggregating $145 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>amount. This is clearly true of the items disallowed aggregating $5 in amount, with respect to which it was found only that these items \u201cwere insufficiently supported.\u201d Another item disallowed was \u201cWearing apparel \u2014 W. E. Atkinson 25.00.\u201d The findings with respect to this item are these: \u201cWiley had a second-hand overcoat in his office of uncertain ownership. At the time in question the ward had three overcoats. Wiley forced the office overcoat upon the ward and charged him twenty-five dollars for it.\u201d An inference cannot rightly be drawn from these findings alone that the amount charged for the overcoat was a proper charge against the estate of the ward for his \u201ccomfortable and suitable maintenance and support\u201d as being for his benefit or advantage. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 38; c. 205, \u00a7 1 (6) Second. <em>Dolbeare </em>v. <em>Bowser, </em>254 Mass. 57, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">Two items disallowed were cash for \u201cMedical Services rendered by Dr. James J. Grace,\u201d one for $75 and one for $40. The specific findings as to these items are: \u201cFuller had visited one Dr. Grace and had been under treatment by the physician for several months before Wiley became guardian of the estate. Dr. Grace never asked for payment from Wiley, nor sent him a bill, but Wiley without investigation of treatments and with no particulars, sent Dr. Grace cash by messenger on one occasion and called the doctor to Wiley's office and gave him cash on the other. . . . Wiley instructed Dr. Grace to make his bill larger.\u201d A guardian is required to \u201cpay all just debts which are due from his ward out of the personal property, if sufficient, and, if not, out of the real property, upon obtaining a license for the sale thereof.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 37. See, as to a creditor recovering on the bond of a guardian for failure to pay such a debt, <em>Long </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>182 Mass. 332, and cases cited. It is apparent from the record that the personal property of the ward in the hands of the guardian was sufficient for the payment of the amounts paid. The facts found, however, fall short of showing that there was a just debt of the ward to the physician. The facts found show merely that the ward, before the accountant became guardian, \u201chad visited\u201d the physician and \u201chad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>been under treatment\u201d by him \u201cfor several months.\u201d Doubtless in some circumstances medical services furnished to a minor upon his own credit may be a necessary, the furnishing of which to him implies an obligation on his part to pay therefor what such services are reasonably worth \u2014 that is a just debt of the minor. <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>114 Mass. 397. <em>Trainer </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>141 Mass. 527. <em>L. P. Hollander Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>267 Mass. 378. <em>Luster </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>299 Mass. 480, 484. Compare G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 4. No such circumstances appear. The facts reported do not show that the medical services were actually required by the minor or that they were furnished upon his credit. Nor do the facts show what, if anything, these services were reasonably worth.</p>\n<p id=\"am5-dedup-0\">2. Disallowance of compensation for services of the guardian. \u2014 With respect to an item in the account of $13.13 for \u201cGuardian\u2019s fee and disbursements,\u201d allowed in the sum of $3.13, the report of material facts states that this item \u201cincluded actual disbursements of three dollars and thirteen cents and ten dollars for services.\u201d The guardian was entitled to \u201csuch compensation for services as the court may allow.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 206, \u00a7 16. But the court in making such an allowance can allow properly only such compensation as is \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d and the determination of the Probate Court as to what is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d is subject to review by this court on appeal in accordance with the ordinary principles applicable to review on appeals from the Probate Court. <em>King </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>293 Mass. 244, 250-251. It maybe, however, that a guardian is not entitled to any compensation. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>279 Mass. 62, 71-73. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>284 Mass. 255, 258. On the facts reported the Probate Court was not in error in refusing to allow any compensation for the services of the guardian. Obviously the accountant performed little, if any, valuable service as guardian. He was appointed guardian on July 15, 1938, and the ward became of age on April 18, 1940. The guardian, as appears from the record, had no duties to perform with respect to the custody of his ward, but had duties merely with respect to the care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and management of his estate. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. The estate of the ward was a legacy of $213.13 which, according to the report of material facts, the guardian \u201cdid not deposit nor 'Keep in a wooden box in a cabinet in my [his] office\u2019\u201d <em>(sic). </em>In the account filed by the guardian he showed expenditures \u2014 including $10 for his compensation \u2014 of the entire estate. At a hearing on this account the guardian failed to establish that items of expenditures from the estate of the ward aggregating $145 were proper. Apart from paying legal expenses of the guardianship proceeding, aggregating $58.13, the guardian expended no part of the estate for the benefit or advantage of the ward. And even in expending such aggregate sum of $145 from the estate of the ward, so far as appears, the guardian made no effort to determine whether such expenditures would be for the benefit or advantage of the ward. The guardian\u2019s acts with respect to these expenditures were disadvantageous to the ward. And the guardian failed even to render an account as guardian until ordered to do so by the Probate Court upon petition of the ward after he became of age, and upon the account so filed there were hearings on three days \u2014 such proceedings involving expense for the ward \u2014 with the result that these expenditures were disallowed. We cannot say that the value of any service of the guardian in holding the estate of the ward was not at least offset by the difficulty and expense caused to the ward by the guardian by litigation with respect to an accounting therefor. No error appears in the refusal of the court to allow any compensation to the guardian for his services. See <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>284 Mass. 255, 258; <em>Spilios </em>v. Papps, 292 Mass. 145, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">3. Damages \u2014 costs and expenses. \u2014 The amount awarded to the former ward, against the guardian, nominally as \u201cdamages,\u201d was $134.10. This, however, is not a proceeding for breach of the guardian's bond for failing to render an account in which \u201cdamages\u201d can be recovered. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>307 Mass. 404, 405-406. But by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 45, in contested cases before a Probate Court \u201ccosts and expenses in the discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the court may be awarded to either party, to be paid by the other.\u201d This statute is applicable to a contested account. <em>Untersee </em>v. <em>Untersee, </em>299 Mass. 417, 423-425. We interpret the decree appealed from as awarding such \u201ccosts and expenses\u201d though they are described as \u201cdamages,\u201d and we deal with this aspect of the decree in accordance with its true nature. <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Murphy, ante, </em>249, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\">The items allowed as \u201cdamages\u201d are in their nature such as could be awarded as \u201ccosts and expenses.\u201d <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Fenelon, </em>266 Mass. 340, 344. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>272 Mass. 142, 144-145. See St. 1931, c. 120, \u00a7 1. The aggregate amount awarded, particularly the amount included therein \u201cfor hearings in the court on three days, at thirty-five dollars a day, one hundred and five dollars,\u201d apparently for counsel fees, seems large. It is difficult to see why three days were required for hearings on this account if the hearings were properly conducted. The findings, however, do not import that the hearings lasted three full days. Moreover, while there is no fixed schedule of amounts to be allowed for such counsel fe\u00e9s, the \u201cgeneral rule is that the compensation paid to public officers for services of a similar character constitutes the standard, subject to such variations in a particular case as may be determined in the exercise of wise discretion having regard to all pertinent factors.\u201d The \u201cfull amount charged by counsel to his client is not necessarily to be allowed.\u201d <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>272 Mass. 142, 145. See also <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>6 Allen, 152, 165. While this general rule was stated with respect to an award out of the fund, the authority to make such award against a party is conferred by the same statute (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 215, \u00a7 45) and is of the same general nature. Tested by this standard the per diem allowance, especially if the hearings occupied only parts of three days, seems large in the light of the pertinent factors of the amount in controversy and the simple issues involved. The per diem allowance is larger, for example, than the amount ordinarily allowed to masters and auditors. See Rule 86 of the Superior Court (1932). However, we cannot quite say that the discretion of the judge was improperly exercised. Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>course we are not indicating what the standard of damages would be in a proceeding to enforce an obligation of a bond of a fiduciary where counsel fees in prior proceedings may be found to be damages caused by negligence or maladministration. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>307 Mass. 404, 405-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">4. Evidence \u2014 bias. \u2014 The report contains the following recitals: \u201cAfter his account was filed, Wiley offered to pay one hundred dollars for the ward's benefit if the instant account were not brought up for hearing in this court. Date for hearing on his account being set, Wiley made complaint to the Springfield police that his former ward should be examined for reasons which Wiley stated to the head of the Detective Bureau, Capt. Gallagher. Fuller was taken to the station by the police, kept over night examined in the morning and immediately released by Capt. Gallagher when Wiley disclosed that he was in dispute with Fuller over this probate accounting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The accountant contends that this \u201cevidence\u201d was improperly admitted. But the recitals are of facts found and not of \u201cevidence.\u201d And no question of admissibility of evidence is open in the absence of a report of the evidence. One purpose of a report of evidence is to preserve the rights of the parties with respect to the admission or exclusion of evidence to which exceptions were saved. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 12; c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25. The accountant contends also that the facts recited as above set forth are immaterial. We need not consider to what extent, if at all, these facts are material, since, even if they are disregarded, the other facts reported are\" sufficient, as already stated, to support the decree. Nor does the inclusion in the report of these-facts show such bias or prejudice on the part of the judge against the accountant that he could not hear and decide the issues fairly and impartially. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>293 Mass. 244, 247. Finally, there is no necessary inconsistency in the statements in the report of material facts, but, even if certain statements therein, relating to medical services \u2014 to which the accountant refers \u2014 are to some extent inconsistent, they do not affect the ultimate conclusion, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>these statements, read together, are interpreted. And they do not show bias or prejudice on the part of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
