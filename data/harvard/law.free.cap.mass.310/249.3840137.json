There was a finding in each case against one of the defendants. A consolidated bill of exceptions of this defendant \u2014 a copy of which is contained in the printed record \u2014 was \u201callowed\u201d by the trial judge on December 17, 1940, and was \u201cfiled\u201d on December 18, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">Thereafter, on February 17, 1941, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court a so called \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d this consolidated bill of exceptions on the alleged ground \u201cthat the defendant has failed to take any step in furtherance of the prosecution of the exceptions as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135, including his failure to give to the clerk of the Superior Court in which such cases are pending an order in writing for the preparation and printing of the record to the full court as required by said statute, at any time since the allowance of the said bill of exceptions and since the time that he acquired knowledge of the allow-anee of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aam-dedup-0\">After a hearing on this \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d a judge of the Superior Court made the following findings: \u201cI find (1) that no order in writing required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135, for the preparation of papers and copies of papers for transmission to the full court of the Supreme Judicial Court has been given by the defendant ... or his counsel to the clerk of this court since the allowance of his bill of exceptions on December 17, 1940 to the day of the hearing before me, February 25, 1941. (2) Counsel for the defendant . . . first learned of the allowance of his bill of exceptions on January 19, 1941.\u201d The judge declined to rule, as requested by the defendant, that \u201cIf the clerk has not yet given notice to the defendant of the allowance of the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions in accordance with Rule 74 of this court, this case is not yet ripe for final preparation and printing of the record for the Supreme Judicial Court within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135,\u201d ruled \u201c (1) that Rule 74 of this court imposes upon the clerk as a public officer the duty of giving notice to the parties of the allowance or disallowance of a bill of exceptions, (2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>this provision of Rule 74 is directory only, and (3) that the clerk\u2019s failure to comply with the direction of the rule does not suspend the operation of General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135,\u201d and allowed the motion. The defendant excepted to the rulings of the judge, his refusal to rule as requested, and the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss.\u201d The defendant\u2019s consolidated bill of exceptions relating to this matter was allowed and has been entered in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">1. The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d was in substance an application to the Superior Court under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 133, as amended by St. 1933, c. 300, \u00a7 2, that the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions relating to the trial on the merits be \u201coverruled\u201d by reason of the defendant\u2019s neglect \u201cto take the necessary measures by ordering proper copies to be prepared\u201d to carry questions of law to this court. And the order of the judge thereon was in substance an order \u201coverruling\u201d the exceptions relating to the trial on the'merits. The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d and the order, and incidental rulings, relating thereto must be treated in accordance with their true nature. <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>309 Mass. 26, 28, and cases cited. By force of said \u00a7 133, as amended, there is \u201cno right to take an appeal, exceptions or other proceeding in the nature of an appeal from such an order . . . overruling exceptions . . . for any cause above stated, except by leave of the full court under section eleven of chapter two hundred and eleven.\u201d These exceptions relating to the \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d therefore, are not properly before this court. They must be dismissed in accordance with the usual practice where matter on the files of the court is not rightly there.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">2. Since, however, the result to the defendant would be the same if his exceptions relating to the \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d were properly before us, it is appropriate to state the ground upon which these exceptions, if they were before us, would be overruled. See <em>Charbonneau </em>v. <em>Guillet, </em>278 Mass. 153, 155; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>289 Mass. 530, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The question sought to be raised by these exceptions is whether, on the facts found, the defendant, as matter of law, failed to comply with the requirement of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135, that the excepting party \u2014 here the defendant\u2014 \u201cgive to the clerk ... of the court in which the case is pending, within ten days after the case becomes ripe for final preparation and printing of the record for the full court, an order in writing for the preparation of such papers and copies of papers for transmission to the full court.\u201d No such order had been given to the clerk at the time of the hearing on the \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d on February 25, 1941. There is no contention that the case had not become \u201cripe\u201d for \u201cfinal preparation and printing of the record for the full court\u201d more than ten days before that date in all respects except in the respect that no notice of the allowance of the bill of exceptions had been given by the clerk in accordance with the provisions of Rule 74 of the Superior Court (1932). The defendant contends that the failure of the clerk to give such notice prevented the case from becoming \u201cripe\u201d for \u201cfinal preparation and printing of the record for the full court\u201d so that the ten-day period fixed by said \u00a7 135 never began to run. A decision adverse to the defendant upon this contention is required by the decision in <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. Sweeney, 309 Mass. 26, where it was held as a matter of interpretation of said \u00a7 135 that the ten-day period fixed thereby began to run irrespective of notice. See page 30. It is unnecessary to restate or amplify the reasoning of that case. We adhere to the conclusion therein reached. This conclusion does not import that said Rule 74 is invalid. It imports merely that said rule does not modify the meaning or effect of the controlling statute \u2014\u2022 said \u00a7 135. There was no error in the rulings of the judge, his refusal to rule as requested, or his allowance of the \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d in substance an order \u201coverruling\u201d the exceptions of the defendant relating to the trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">3. To avoid any possible misapprehension as to the decision in <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. Sweeney, 309 Mass. 26, we add some explanation thereof. It was there said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that the \u201ccase became 'ripe\u2019 for such final preparation and printing on December 20, 1940, when the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions was allowed.\u201d Page 30. In that case the bill of exceptions was indorsed \u201callowed\u201d and signed by the judge on December 20, 1940, and the docket contains an entry under date of December 20, 1940, \u201cDeft\u2019s bill of exceptions allowed.\u201d No question was presented whether the case became \u201cripe\u201d for such final preparation and printing of the record at the time the bill of exceptions was indorsed \u201callowed\u201d and signed by the judge or at the time it was returned to the clerk so indorsed and signed. Compare G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 115, 117. Nor is any such question presented in the present case, though here the bill of exceptions appears to have been indorsed \u201callowed\u201d and signed by the judge on December 17, 1940, and to have been \u201cfiled\u201d on December 18, 1940, since no order in writing for the preparation of the papers was given within ten days after the latter date. The statement just above quoted from the <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>case does not imply that where there is, as occasionally occurs, as in the present case, a difference between the date of signing and the date of return to the clerk of a signed bill of exceptions, the ten-day period fixed by said \u00a7 135 shall begin to run before the date when the signed bill of exceptions is returned to the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The language and history of said \u00a7 135 lead to the conclusion that the ten-day period does not begin to run until the latter date. By that section the duty of preparing the papers is imposed upon the clerk. See <em>Niosi </em>v. <em>Leveroni, </em>274 Mass. 115, 117. Obviously he cannot perform that duty until the papers, copies of which are to be included in the record for the full court, are in his hands. It cannot rightly be said that a case is \u201cripe\u201d for the performance of his official duty with respect thereto until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">By G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 135, in the form substituted by St. 1929, c. 265, \u00a7 1, the ten-day period for ordering the preparation of papers began to run at the time of the \"appeal or allowance of the bill of exceptions or the determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the court in which the questions arose of the form of the transmitting order.\u201d See <em>Niosi </em>v. <em>Leveroni, </em>274 Mass. 115; <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>275 Mass. 91; <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Moffatt, </em>276 Mass. 174; <em>Dondis </em>v. <em>Lash, </em>277 Mass. 477. The statute in this form created some difficulty when papers, copies of which were an essential part of the record for the\" full court, were not in the hands of the clerk within the ten-day period fixed by the statute. The existence of this difficulty, however, did not relieve the appealing or excepting party of the imperative duty imposed upon him by the statute. See <em>Niosi </em>v. <em>Leveroni, </em>274 Mass. 115; <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Moffatt, </em>276 Mass. 174; <em>Dondis </em>v. <em>Lash, </em>277 Mass. 477. But the obvious purpose of the amendment of said \u00a7 135 by St. 1931, c. 219, by substituting the words now in the section, \u201ccase becomes ripe for final preparation and printing of the record for the full court,\u201d for the words already quoted from the section in the form in which it appeared in St. 1929, c. 265, \u00a7 1, was to avoid this difficulty by postponing the time at which the ten-day period should begin to run until papers, copies of which were an essential part of the record for the full court, were in the hands of the clerk. See <em>Dondis </em>v. <em>Lash, </em>277 Mass. 477, 480-481. In conformity with this purpose a case involving a bill of exceptions would not become \u201cripe\u201d for the preparation of the papers until a bill of exceptions signed by a judge was returned to the clerk. The opinion in the <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>case is to be interpreted in accordance with this explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Doubtless the failure of a clerk to give notice of the allowance of a bill of exceptions in accordance with his public duty, as defined by Rule 74 of the Superior Court (1932), would cause some inconvenience to the excepting party, but this argument from inconvenience cannot prevail over the statutory mandate of said \u00a7 135. However, it is to be observed \u2014 though not as a reason for the conclusion reached in the <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>case, or in the present case \u2014 that no such inconvenience would result from the application of said \u00a7 135, as interpreted in the <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>case and in this case, as is suggested by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>fendant, namely, that an excepting party who has presented a bill of exceptions to a judge for allowance \u201cmust . . . thereafter contact the judge every few days, no matter where the latter may be, to ascertain whether or not the judge has yet acted upon the bill.\u201d The excepting party is required only to inform himself as to the progress of the case as disclosed by the record thereof in the office of the clerk. See <em>Rosenbush </em>v. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>227 Mass. 41, 43; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>285 Mass. 83, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions relating to the trial on the merits have not been entered in this court. His exceptions relating to the order dismissing those exceptions \u2014 in substance an order \u201coverruling\u201d those exceptions \u2014 are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
