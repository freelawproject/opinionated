L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 193A, seeks to restrain the alleged violation by the respondent of the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 164A, inserted by St. 1938, c. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\">Section 164A reads as follows: \u201cIf a policy of industrial life insurance upon which premiums have been paid for three years or more is surrendered to the company for a cash surrender value or paid up insurance or extended term insurance or lapses for non-payment of premiums, the agent shall not be charged with a decrease for said premium and no deduction shall be made from his commission or salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2SK\">This section was approved April 21, 1938, and went into effect July 21, 1938. The alleged violation is found in the terms of a new form of agreement between the company and its \u201cindustrial\u201d agents which was put into operation on July 4, 1938, after the enactment of \u00a7 164A, but before that section took effect. The portion of the new form of agreement which it is contended violates the statute is in these words, \u201cSec. 9. (c). That, in the calculation of my \u2018Net First-Year Premiums\u2019, I [the agent] shall not receive credit for any \u2018first-year premiums\u2019 on any policy written by me on the life of any person, or any relative sharing the home with the person, who has terminated a policy of any kind or description, either by non-payment of premiums payable under the terms thereof or by surrender, not more than three months before or within three months after such policy is written. A policy lapsed for non-payment of premiums, and having continuing benefits under paid-up or extended insurance, shall be deemed to have terminated for the purposes of this Section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>304 Mass. 53, we were called upon to construe \u00a7 164A. We there held this section to mean \u201cthat in computing the agent\u2019s commission or salary no deduction shall be made on account of the surrenders or lapses to which the statute refers from the commission or salary which under his contract the agent would receive if there had been no such surrenders or lapses\u201d (page 54), and that \u201cThe purpose was to exclude these surrenders and lapses as elements operating adversely to the agent in computing his commission or salary\u201d (pages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>54, 55). In the case now before us the respondent argues, in substance, that it makes no \u201cdeduction\u201d from the agent\u2019s commission or salary, but that the substitution of a new policy for an old one involves loss to the insured, and that therefore the company, desiring to make it an object to its agents to discourage such substitution rather than to encourage it for their own personal - advantage, merely provides that it will not obligate itself to pay any commissions on \u201cfirst-year premiums\u201d on policies taken out on the life of any person \u201cor any relative sharing the home with the person\u201d who terminates a policy by surrender or lapse in the manner described within three months before or after the new policy is written.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\">We cannot agree with this argument. In general, the company pays first year commissions on policies written by its agents. It does not refuse to accept the \u201cre-written\u201d or \u201creplacement\u201d policies, as they are called. It permits its agents to write such policies. In general, it does not even deny to its agents first year premium commissions on policies which replace former surrendered or lapsed policies. It simply reduces the amount which it would otherwise pay its agents for first year premiums upon new policies written by them by a sum which is dependent upon surrenders and lapses of \u201cindustrial\u201d policies within three months. And in instances where the former policy is not surrendered or lapsed until after the new policy is written it cannot even be determined that any reduction will be made in the agent\u2019s compensation until some time after the event (writing of the new policy) out of which the right to a commission commonly arises. Whether the statute has been violated is to be determined with reference to the substance of the relation between the company and its agents and not with reference to the form of bookkeeping entries adopted. In view of the object to attain which the statute must have been enacted we cannot avoid the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s form of contract does make a \u201cdeduction\u201d within the meaning of that word in the statute \u201con account of the surrenders or lapses to which the statute refers from the commission or salary which under his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tract the agent would receive if there had been no such surrenders or lapses.\u201d <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>304 Mass. 53, 54. In so far as the respondent\u2019s form of contract deprives its agents of first year premium commissions because of the surrender or lapse in the manner described in the statute of \u201cindustrial\u201d policies upon which premiums have been paid for three years or more, it is in conflict with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\">But the respondent further contends that the statute is unconstitutional in that it unwarrantably interferes with the respondent\u2019s freedom to contract, deprives the respondent of property without due process of law and of equal protection of the laws, and is not a valid exercise of the police power of the Commonwealth. The question of constitutionality was not argued and was not decided in <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>304 Mass. 53. We are of the opinion, however, that the statute is not unconstitutional upon any of the grounds urged. All of the contracts here involved between the respondent and its agents were entered into after the statute was enacted, although many of them must have been entered into before it took effect. We are therefore not here concerned with the impact of a statute upon a contract made before the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">It is well settled that the business of insurance is subject to a large degree of legislative regulation. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Hardison, 199 Mass. 190, 198. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Ancient Order of United Workmen of Massachusetts, </em>244 Mass. 556, 567. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>251 Mass. 569, 607. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Commercial Travellers Eastern Accident Association, </em>302 Mass. 74, 77. <em>German Alliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Insurance of Kansas, </em>233 U. S. 389. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wanberg, </em>260 U. S. 71. This power extends to the reasonable regulation in the public interest of insurance brokers, <em>La Tourette </em>v. <em>McMaster, </em>248 U. S. 465, and agents, <em>Stipcich </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>277 U. S. 311, 320, and of the compensation paid to agents. <em>O\u2019Gorman &amp; Young, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>282 U. S. 251. <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Ozlin, </em>310 U. S. 53, 65, 66. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>New, </em>243 U. S. 332, 352, 353, 354. But quite apart from the peculiar position of the insurance business the right of freedom to contract in general is subject to reasonable legislative control under the police power. The subject is fully discussed in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>163 Mass. 589, in <em>Holcombe </em>v. <em>Creamer, </em>231 Mass. 99, and in numerous other cases among which may be mentioned <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston Transcript Co. </em>249 Mass. 477, 483; <em>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>219 U. S. 549, and <em>West Coast Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379. Compare <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>271 Mass. 598. Legislative power of control in the interest of the public welfare exists, within reasonable limits, even though its exercise may affect the subsequent carrying out of executory contracts entered into before the legislation takes effect. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 523, 553. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Works, </em>264 Mass. 460, 466. <em>Home Building &amp; Loan Association </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>290 U. S. 398. <em>Veix </em>v. <em>Sixth Ward Building &amp; Loan Association of Newark, </em>310 U. S. 32, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\">The statute here assailed does not appear to be capricious, arbitrary, or unreasonably discriminatory. The Legislature may have believed that insurance agents dealing with \u201cindustrial\u201d insurance policies were commonly persons of comparatively small income; and that it was an unfair practice for the companies to insist upon methods of calculating the agents\u2019 compensation which might result in an agent finding at the end of a period of work that the earnings upon which he depended for a livelihood were in considerable part swept away by reason of surrenders and lapses which he could not control and for which he was in no wise to blame. Whether, as contended by the respondent, the public welfare would be better served by a contract which would encourage the agents to exert themselves to the utmost to prevent surrenders and lapses was a matter for the Legislature to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Classification as a group of insurance agents dealing with \u201cindustrial\u201d policies for the purpose of alleviating the conditions of their employment in the particular to which the statute is directed cannot be pronounced palpably unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>able. In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>163 Mass. 589, at page 595, the then justices of this court said that the regulation of contracts by statute not amounting to a determination of rates or prices \u201chas not been confined to public employments or to business which may be said to be affected with a distinct public interest,\u201d but that it \u201crelates to a great variety of contracts, and has been passed, some of it to promote the public health or the public morals or the public convenience, some of it for the protection of individuals against fraud, and some of it for the protection of classes of individuals against unfair or unconscionable dealing.\u201d In <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>United States, </em>157 U. S. 160, at 165, 166, it is said that government \u201cmay restrain all engaged in any employment from any contract in the course of that employment which is against public policy.\u201d See the discussion of classification in <em>Radice </em>v. <em>New York, </em>264 U. S. 292, 296-298. There are instances where interference with freedom of contract brought about by legislative classification comparable to that made by the statute here in question has been upheld. Thus a statute requiring employers to redeem in cash \u201cstore orders\u201d issued in payment of wages due their employees <em>(Knoxville Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Harbison, </em>183 U. S. 13), a statute prohibiting the payment of seamen\u2019s wages in advance <em>(Patterson </em>v. <em>Bark Eudora, </em>190 U. S. 169), and a statute requiring coal to be measured for the purpose of fixing the miners\u2019 compensation before being screened <em>(McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>211 U. S. 539; <em>Rail &amp; River Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission of Ohio, </em>236 U. S. 338) have been held valid. Examples of statutes in this Commonwealth restricting an employer\u2019s freedom to contract with specified classes of employees may be found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 153, 154, regulating so called \u201cfines\u201d imposed upon weavers (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>155 Mass. 117; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lancaster Mills, </em>212 Mass. 315), and in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7 158, prohibiting deductions from wages of women and children in manufacturing or mechanical establishments while the machinery is stopped. See also G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 149, \u00a7 148, as amended, relating to the weekly payment of wages <em>(Erie Railroad </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>Williams, </em>233 U. S. 685); G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151, as appearing in St. 1937, c. 401, \u00a7 1, the \u201cminimum fair wage for women and minors\u201d law <em>(West Coast Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379), and G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1933, c. 68, regulating the charges of attorneys, physicians and hospitals in workmen\u2019s compensation cases <em>(Gritta\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 525, 528). And we have already referred to a case upholding a statute that included a prohibition to an insurer against allowing a commission to any person for acting as its local agent in excess of that allowed to any of its local agents on similar risks. <em>O\u2019Gor-man &amp; Young, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>282 U. S. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\">After the effective date of the statute the respondent could not lawfully employ agents to procure \u201cindustrial\u201d policies without obligating itself to pay them in accordance with the terms of the statute. See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Bark Eudora, </em>190 U. S. 169; <em>Midland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. </em>300 U. S. 109, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">A final decree is to be entered in the Superior Court permanently enjoining the respondent from enforcing section 9 (c) of. its \u201cAgent\u2019s Agreement,\u201d attached to its answer and marked \u201cB,\u201d by denying credit to its agents in computing their commissions or salaries by reason of the surrender to the company for cash surrender value or paid up insurance or extended term insurance or by reason of the lapse for nonpayment of premiums of any policy of \u201cindustrial\u201d life insurance upon which premiums have been paid for three years or more, and from making deductions from its agents\u2019 commissions or salaries because of such surrenders or lapses, and ordering the respondent to pay to its agents such sums as it has failed to credit to them or has deducted from their commissions or salaries because of such surrenders or lapses occurring on or after July 21, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
