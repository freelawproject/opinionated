The decision turns on whether federal or state law governs the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">M</p>\n<p id=\"b319-2\">From the time of California s admission to the Union in 1850, the United States owned the upland on the north side of the entrance channel to Humboldt Bay, Cal. In 1859 and 1871, the Secretary of the Interior ordered that certain of these lands, which fronted on the Pacific Ocean, the channel, and Humboldt Bay be reserved from public sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since that time the land has been continuously possessed by the United States and used as a Coast Guard Reservation. The Pacific shoreline along the Coast Guard site remained substantially unchanged until near the turn of the century when the United States began construction of two jetties at the entrance to Humboldt Bay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jetty constructed on the north side of the entrance resulted in fairly rapid accretion on the ocean side of the Coast Guard Reservation, so that formerly submerged lands became uplands.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One hundred and eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>four acres of upland were created by the seaward movement of the ordinary high-water mark. This land, which remains barren save for a watchtower, is the subject of the dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The controversy arose in 1977 when the Coast Guard applied for permission from California to use this land to construct the watchtower.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At this time it became evident that both California and the United States asserted ownership of the land. The United States eventually built the watchtower without obtaining California\u2019s permission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Invoking our original jurisdiction, California then filed this suit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>quiet title to the subject land.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted leave for California to file a bill of complaint. 454 U. S. 809 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">California alleges that upon its admission to the Union on September 9, 1850, Act of Sept. 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 452, and by confirmation in the Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71301 <em>et s\u00e9q., </em>California became vested with absolute title to the tidelands and the submerged lands upon which, after construction of the jetties, alluvion was deposited, resulting in formation of the subject land. Because the accretion formed on sovereign state land, California maintains that its law should govern ownership. Under California law, a distinction is drawn between accretive changes to a boundary caused by natural forces and boundary changes caused by the construction of artificial objects. For natural accretive changes, the upland boundary moves seaward as the alluvion is deposited, resulting in a benefit to the upland owner. <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>206 Cal. 662, 667, 275 P. 789, 791 (1929). Wh\u00e9n accretion is caused by construction of artificial works, however, the boundary does not move but becomes fixed at the ordinary high-water mark at the time the artificial influence is introduced. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Santa Monica, </em>63 Cal. App. 2d 772, 794, 147 P. 2d 964, 975 (1944). It is not disputed that the newly formed land in controversy was created by the construction of the jetty. Therefore, if state law governs, California would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>By its answer, and supporting memoranda, the United States contends that the formerly submerged lands were never owned by California before passage of the Submerged Lands Act in 1953, and that the disputed land was not granted to California by the Act. The United States also submits that the case is governed by federal rather than state law and that under long-established federal law, accretion, whatever its cause, belongs to the upland owner. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>18 How. 150, 156 (1856); <em>County of St. Clair </em>v. <em>Lovingston, </em>23 Wall. 46, 66 (1874); <em>Jefferis </em>v. <em>East Omaha Land Co., </em>134 U. S. 178, 189-193 (1890); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 F. 2d 4, 10-11 (CA9 1965).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If such federal law controls, title to the deposited land vested in the United States as the accretions formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Recognizing that the choice-of-law issue was clearly drawn, California moved for summary judgment and the United States moved for judgment on the pleadings. No essential facts being in dispute, a special master was not appointed and the case was briefed and argued. We conclude that federal law governs the decision in this case and that the land in dispute is owned by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">I \u2014 I HH</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">In <em>Borax Consolidated, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>296 U. S. 10 (1935), the city filed suit to quiet its title to land claimed to be tideland and to belong to the city by virtue of a grant from the State. The defendant claimed by virtue of a patent from the United States issued after California entered the Union. In an opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, and with a single dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sent, the Court held that if the land in question was tideland, the title passed to California at the time of her admission to the Union in 1850; that it remained to be determined whether the land at issue was tideland; and that this issue was \u201cnecessarily a federal question\u201d controlled by federal law. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201cPetitioners claim under a federal patent which, according to the plat, purported to convey land bordering on the Pacific Ocean. There is no question that the United States was free to convey the upland, and the patent affords no ground for holding that it did not convey all the title that the United States had in the premises. The question as to the extent of this federal grant, that is, as to the limit of the land conveyed, or the boundary between the upland and the tideland, is necessarily a federal question. It is a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States; it involves the ascertainment of the essential basis of a right asserted under federal law. <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>137 U. S. 661, 669, 670; <em>Brewer-Elliott Oil Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>260 U. S. 77, 87; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holt Bank, </em>270 U. S. 49, 55, 56; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>283 U. S. 64, 75. Rights and interests in the tideland, which is subject to the sovereignty of the State, are matters of local law. <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, </em>94 U. S. 324, 338; <em>Skively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>[152 U. S. 1,] 40; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>140 U. S. 371, 382; <em>Port of Seattle </em>v. <em>Oregon &amp; Washington R. Co., </em>255 U. S. 56, 63.\u201d <em>Borax Consolidated, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, supra, </em>at 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The Court went on to hold that tidelands extend to the mean high-water line, which the Court then defined as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">There was no question of accretions to the shoreline of the property involved in <em>Borax. </em>But some 30 years later, Mrs. Stella Hughes, the successor in interest to the owner of oceanfront property patented by the United States prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the entry of the State of Washington into the Union, sued the State seeking to quiet her title to accretions that had become attached to her land and that had caused a seaward movement of the shoreline. Under Washington law, the accretions belonged to the State, the owner of the tidelands, and Mrs. Hughes would no longer own property fronting on the ocean. Under federal law accretions are the property of the upland owner. The trial court found that federal law applied. The Washington Supreme Court reversed, holding that Washington law applied and that the State owned any land that accreted after statehood. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>State, </em>67 Wash. 2d. 799, 410 P. 2d 20 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We in turn reversed, reaffirming the decision in <em>Borax </em>that federal law determined the boundary between state-owned tidelands and property granted under a federal patent and holding that the same law applied to determine the boundary between state-owned tidelands and oceanfront property where accretions had extended the shoreline seaward. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>389 U. S. 290 (1967).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The justification for employing federal law was the special nature of the coastal boundary question: \u201cThe' rule deals with waters that lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea. This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the \u2018supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 293. We went on to decide that under federal law, the federal grantee of the uplands had the right to the accumulated accretions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Except for the fact that in the present case the upland to which the accretions attached has always been owned by the United States, this case and <em>Hughes </em>are similarly situated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Unless <em>Hughes </em>is to be overruled, judgment must be entered for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">California urges that for all intents and purposes <em>Hughes </em>has already been eviscerated by <em>Oregon ex rel. State Land Board </em>v. <em>Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel </em>Co., 429 U. S. 363 (1977). <em>Corvallis </em>involved a dispute between the State of Oregon and an Oregon corporation over the ownership of land that became part of a riverbed because of avulsive changes in the river\u2019s course. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of the land to the corporation because that was the result dictated by federal common law, which, under <em>Bonelli Cattle Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>414 U. S. 313 (1973), was the proper source of law. A majority of this Court reversed, overruling <em>Bonelli </em>and holding that the disputed ownership of the riverbed should be decided solely as a matter of Oregon law. Bonelli's error was said to have been reliance on the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Once the equal-footing doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in Arizona, \u201cit did not operate after that date to determine what effect on titles the movement of the river might have.\u201d 429 U. S., at 371. State, rather than federal law, should have been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">California urges that in rejecting <em>Bonelli </em>and holding that disputes about the title to lands granted by the United States are to be settled by state law, the Court also rejected <em>Hughes </em>since that case involved land that had been patented by the United States to private owners. We do not agree. <em>Corvallis </em>itself recognized that federal law would continue to apply if \u201cthere were present some other principle of federal law requiring state law to be displaced. \u201d 429 U. S., at 371. For example, the effects of accretive and avulsive changes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>course of a navigable stream forming an interstate boundary is determined by federal law. <em>Id., </em>at 375. The <em>Corvallis </em>opinion also recognized that <em>Bonelli </em>did not rest upon <em>Hughes </em>and that the <em>Hughes </em>Court considered oceanfront property \u201csufficiently different... so as to justify a \u2018federal common law\u2019 rule of riparian proprietorship.\u201d 429 U. S., at 377, n. 6. The <em>Corvallis </em>decision did not purport to disturb <em>Hughes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>442 U. S. 653 (1979), made clear that <em>Corvallis </em>also does not apply \u201cwhere the [United States] Government has never parted with title and its interest in the property continues.\u201d 442 U. S., at 670.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The dispute in <em>Corvallis </em>was between the State and a private owner of land previously in federal possession. In contrast, the riparian owner in <em>Wilson </em>was the United States, holding reservation land in trust for the Omaha Indian Tribe. The issue was the effect of accretive or avulsive changes in the course of a navigable stream. State boundaries were not involved. What we said in <em>Wilson </em>is at least equally applicable here where the United States has held title to, occupied, and utilized the littoral land for over 100 years: \u201c[T]he general rule recognized by <em>Corvallis </em>does not oust federal law in this case. Here, we are not dealing with land titles merely derived from a federal grant, but with land with respect to which the United States has never yielded title or terminated its interest.\u201d 442 U. S., at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>We conclude, based on <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Washington </em>and <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>that a dispute over accretions to oceanfront land where title rests with or was derived from the Federal Government is to be determined by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\">Controversies governed by federal law do not inevitably require resort to uniform federal rules. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe, supra, </em>at 672. It may be determined as a matter of choice of law that, although federal law should govern a given question, state law should be borrowed and applied as the federal rule for deciding the substantive legal issue at hand. <em>Board of Commissioners of Jackson County </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 343 (1939); <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>313 U. S. 289 (1941). This is not such a case. First, and dispositive in itself, is the fact that Congress has addressed the issue of accretions to federal land. The Submerged Lands Act, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1301 <em>et seq., </em>vested title in the States to the lands underlying the territorial sea, which, in California\u2019s case, extended three miles seaward from the ordinary low-water line. The Act also confirmed the title of the States to the tidelands up to the line of mean high tide. Section 5(a) of the Act, however, withheld from the grant to the States all \u201caccretions\u201d to coastal lands acquired or reserved by the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1313(a). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>light of this provision, borrowing for federal-law purposes a state rule that would divest federal ownership is foreclosed. In <em>Wilson, </em>where we did adopt state law as the federal rule, no special federal concerns, let alone a statutory directive, required a federal common-law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Moreover, this is not a case in which federal common law must be <em>created. </em>For over 100 years it has been settled under federal law that the right to future accretions is an inherent and essential attribute of the littoral or riparian owner. <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Pet. 662, 717 (1836); <em>County of St. Clair </em>v. <em>Lovingston, </em>23 Wall., at 68. \u201c\u2018Almost all jurists and legislators, . . . both ancient and modern, have agreed that the owner of the land thus bounded is entitled to these additions.\u2019\u201d <em>Jefferis </em>v. <em>East Omaha Land Co., </em>134 U. S., at 189, quoting <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>2 Wall. 57, 67 (1865). We rejected the invitation to rely on state law in <em>Hughes, </em>which California readily admits is a case \u201cin which the facts and issues are essentially identical,\u201d Statement in Support of Motion for Leave to File Complaint 16, and we see no reason at this juncture to adopt California\u2019s minority rule on artificial accretions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> even if we were free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Applying the federal rule that accretions, regardless of cause, accrue to the upland owner, we conclude that title to the entire disputed land in issue is vested in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Despite <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>California claims ownership of the disputed lands because all of the accretions were deposited on tidelands and submerged lands, title to which, California submits, was vested in the State by the equal-footing doctrine and confirmed by the Submerged Lands Act. But California\u2019s, claim to the land underlying the territorial sea was firmly rejected in <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19 (1947), which held that only land underneath inland waters was included in the initial grant to the States under the equal-footing doctrine. Furthermore, the Submerged Lands Act was a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 power to dispose of federal property, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>347 U. S. 272, 273-274 (1954), and \u201cdid not impair the validity\u201d of the <em>California </em>decision, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>363 U. S. 1, 7, 20 (1960).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event, whatever the ownership of the submerged lands, this approach, based as it is on the equal-footing doctrine and the federal statute, is not a claim that state law should govern but a claim that the historic rule that accretions belong to the upland owner is wrong and should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>replaced with a rule awarding title to the owner of the land on which the accretions took place. To accept this submission, however, would require rejecting not only <em>Hughes, </em>but also the long-established federal rule that accretions belong to the upland owner \u2014 a doctrine consistent with the majority rule prevailing in the States. See Part III, <em>supra. </em>Indeed, the proposed rule is also inconsistent with California\u2019s own law that accretions attributable to natural causes belong to the upland owner. For all these reasons, we refuse the invitation to depart from the long-settled rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Independent of the above analysis, California claims that the United States expressly surrendered title to the disputed land through the Submerged Lands Act. California argues the subject land falls within the general grant to the States of \u201clands beneath navigable waters.\u201d Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines \u201clands beneath navigable waters\u201d to include \u201call filled in, made, or reclaimed lands which formerly were lands beneath navigable waters.\u201d 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1301(a)(3). Because the jetty construction caused fairly rapid accretion, and, but for the construction of the jetties, the subject land would have remained submerged, California submits the accretion-formed land is \u201cmade\u201d land, whose title rests in California by virtue of the Submerged Lands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We do not read this provision of the Act as applying to the gradual process by which sand accumulated along the shore, although caused by a jetty affecting the action of the sea.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, to the extent that the accretions are to be considered \u201cmade\u201d land, they would fall within the reservation by the United States of \u201call lands filled in, built up, or otherwise reclaimed by the United States for its own use.\u201d This follows from the congressional object to assure each sovereign the continuing benefit of landfill and like work performed by each.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In any event, \u00a7 5(a) of the Act expressly withholds from the grant to the States all \u201caccretions\u201d to lands reserved by the United States, and both California and the United States agree that the exposure of the formerly submerged lands in dispute constitutes \u201caccretion.\u201d This reading of the Act adheres to the principle that federal grants are to be construed strictly in favor of the United States. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grand River Dam Authority, </em>363 U. S. 229, 235 (1960); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. Co., </em>353 U. S. 112, 116 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Finally, California submits that the Act granted title to the State by confirming the title of persons who, on June 5,1950, were entitled to such lands \u201cunder the law of the respective States in which the land is located . . . 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1311(a). This provision means nothing more than that state law determines the proper beneficiary of the grant of land under the Act; it is clear that federal law determines the scope of the grant under the Act in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We reaffirm today that federal law determines the boundary of oceanfront lands owned or patented by the United States. Applying the federal rule that accretions of whatever cause belong to the upland owner, we find that title to the disputed parcel rests with the United States. Accordingly, California\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, and the United States\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted. The parties, or either of them, may, before September 27,1982, submit a proposed decree to carry this opinion into effect, failing which the Court will prepare and enter an appropriate decree at the next Term of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-4\"> Secretarial Order, December 27, 1859; Secretarial Order, August 19, 1871.

Former Solicitor General Cox, in an opinion approved by the Attorney General, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that Congress intended each of the various categories of lands excepted by section 5(a) to include accretions. The terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of section 5(a) make this clear. The customary rights of landowners are set forth in full in the first of the several exceptions listed in section 5(a). Thus, it speaks of \u2018all tracts or parcels of land together with all accretions thereto, resources therein, or improvements thereon . . . Each of the other exceptions speaks simply of \u2018all lands.\u2019 Obviously, the more comprehensive word \u2018lands\u2019 was used instead of Tracts or parcels of land\u2019 and the explicit reference to accretions, resources and improvements was omitted in order to avoid repetition. There is no reasonable basis for any other conclusion. Congress would not have limited its exceptions of \u2018all accretions thereto, resources therein, or improvements thereon\u2019 to lands \u2018lawfully and expressly acquired by the United States\u2019 from any State or its grantees and then denied them where the lands were \u2018expressly retained\u2019 or \u2018acquired by the United States by eminent domain proceedings, purchase, cession, gift, or otherwise in a proprietary capacity. . . .\u2019 \u201d 42 Op.

California argues that as deposition occurred on submerged land, these areas went to a tideland phase \u2014 vesting title in the State\u2014 before eventually emerging as uplands. Federal law governs the scope <em>of </em>title initially vested by the equal-footing doctrine; at most, this argument suggests a different federal rule should apply to former tidelands. The sugr gesti\u00f3n has little to recommend it. Even leaving aside the concerns expressed in text, we see no reason for an exceptional rule to apply to land that once was, but no longer is, tideland. Moreover, implementation of the rule would require plotting the high- and low-water lines at all intervening times between statehood and the present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b331-4\"> The word \u201cmade\u201d was inserted into the provision in a bill introduced by Congressman Walter.

I believe that our decision in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>442 U. S. 653 (1979), requires the application of federal common law to resolve this title dispute between the United States and California, and that \u00a7 5(a) of the Submerged Lands Act indicates the source of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">The dispute in this case concerns the ownership of artificially caused accretions on oceanfront property belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the United States. The dispute centers on the legal effect of the movement of the \u201cmean high-water mark.\u201d That mark separates the fastlands continuously owned by the United States from the \u201ctidelands\u201d \u2014 the area of partially submerged lands between the mean high- and low-water marks. California\u2019s claim of title to the tidelands is based upon the equal-footing doctrine. Because the tidelands belong to it and because the accretions formed on the tidelands, California contends that state law applies to resolve this title dispute between it and the United States. The rule adopted by the California courts regarding artificially caused accretions holds that title to accreted land vests with the State rather than the riparian or littoral owner. The United States contends that federal common law applies and argues that the federal common-law rule holds that title to land formed by accretion vests in the owner of the riparian land.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The dispute in this case is similar to that in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe. </em>We held in <em>Wilson </em>that federal common law and not state law governs title disputes resulting from changes in the course of a navigable stream where an instrumentality of the Federal Government is the riparian owner. 442 U. S., at 669-671. The rule of <em>Oregon ex rel. State Land Board </em>v. <em>Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>429 U. S. 363 (1977), was distinguished. The <em>Corvallis </em>rule \u2014 that state law governs \u2014 applies where the dispute over the legal effect of a shifting riverbed does not involve claims of title by a federal instrumentality.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I agree with the Court that the <em>Wilson </em>rule applies to oceanfront property as well as riverfront property where the Federal Government is the littoral owner. <em>Wilson </em>should apply to the movement of the high-water mark along the ocean in a fashion similar to the way it applies to changes in the bed of a navigable stream. In the instant case, as in <em>Wilson, </em>it is irrelevant that the accretion, as a geographical \u201cfact,\u201d formed on land within the State\u2019s dominion, be it a river bottom or the ocean tidelands. The fact is that both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Wilson </em>and the instant case concern title disputes over changes in the shoreline where the Federal Government owns land along the shoreline.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In <em>Wilson, </em>we held that state law supplied the applicable rule of decision even though federal common law applied to resolve the title dispute. We found no need for a uniform national rule and no reason why federal interests should not be treated under the same rules of property that would apply to private persons. In contrast to <em>Wilson, </em>however, I agree with the Court that Congress in \u00a75(a) of the Submerged Lands Act has supplied the rule of decision. Section 5(a) withholds from the grant to the States all accretions to coastal lands acquired or reserved by the United States. I also agree with the Court that California did not acquire the disputed lands pursuant to the \u201cmade lands\u201d provisions in \u00a7 2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Consequently, the Court\u2019s discussion regarding the continuing vitality of <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>389 U. S. 290 (1967), is dicta. <em>Hughes </em>is unnecessary to the resolution of choice-of-law issues in title disputes between the Federal Government and a State or private person. Reliance on <em>Hughes </em>would be necessary only if we were to hold that federal common law, rather than state law, applied in a title dispute between a federal patentee and a State or private persons as to lands fronting an ocean. The instant case does not present that issue. It is difficult to reconcile <em>Hughes </em>with <em>Corvallis </em>and we should postpone that endeavor until required to undertake it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In summary, I think this case can be easily resolved as a title dispute between the United States and California concerning the legal effect of movement of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s high-water mark. <em>Wilson </em>and the Submerged Lands Act resolve the dispute. The continuing vitality of <em>Hughes </em>should be left to another day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
