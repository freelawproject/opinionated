The proposed complaint asks us to decide whether Howard Hughes was domiciled in California or Texas at the time of his death. The decision about domicile could determine which State is entitled to levy death taxes on the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">This motion renews the one which California made in November 1977. At that time, we denied leave to file. <em>Cali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>fornia </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>437 U. S. 601 (1978). Following the suggestion of four Justices who concurred in <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>the estate then sought a determination of Hughes\u2019 domicile by filing an interpleader action under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1335 in Federal District Court. This motion for leave to file a complaint accompanied the petition for certiorari in <em>Cory </em>v. <em>White, ante, </em>p. 85, in which California taxing officials requested review of the decision of the Fifth Circuit holding that the Federal Interpleader Act provided a jurisdictional basis for resolving the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We granted certiorari in <em>Cory </em>v. <em>White, </em>452 U. S. 904 (1981), and today have held that the Federal Interpleader Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1335, does not give a federal district court jurisdiction to resolve inconsistent death tax claims by the officials of two States. See <em>ante, </em>at 91. We reached that decision because the suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment under <em>Worcester County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>302 U. S. 292 (1937). We now also conclude that California\u2019s motion for leave to file should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">First, California\u2019s bill of complaint states a \u201ccontroversy\u201d between California and Texas within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a). It is undisputed that each State\u2019s authority to impose a death tax on the intangibles owned by a decedent depends on the decedent\u2019s having been a domiciliary of that State. Also, it is the law of each State that an individual has but one domicile. Thus only one State is entitled to impose death taxes; the outcome of this action would determine which State is privileged to tax. The other would be barred from doing so. It is apparent, therefore, that California and Texas are asserting inconsistent claims and are undeniably adversaries in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Moreover, in its Memorandum in Support of Motion to File Bill of Complaint 6, California asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cThe effective rate of tax in California on all amounts in excess of $400,000 is 24% <em>(see </em>Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code \u00a7 13406(g)); the effective rate of tax in Texas (includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ing the so-called \u2018pick-up tax\u2019) on amounts exceeding $1,000,000 is approximately 16% <em>(see </em>Tex. Tax Code Ann. Arts. 14.05, 14.12); and the federal estate tax on amounts in excess of $10,000,000 is 77%, less a credit of 16% for state death taxes <em>(see </em>26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72001, 2011). The combined marginal rate of tax is therefore 101%.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">California adds that interest on the unpaid taxes will further deplete the estate. Although these allegations have not been proved, they are sufficient under <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>306 U. S. 398 (1939), to characterize this case as a \u201ccontroversy\u201d between two States within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, supra, </em>this Court, raising the issue <em>sua sponte, </em>held that it had original jurisdiction over a suit \u201cbrought to determine the true domicile of decedent as the basis of rival claims of four states for death taxes upon his estate.\u201d 306 U. S., at 401. None of the States had reduced its claims to judgments, but all conceded that the estate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>insufficient to satisfy the total amount of taxes claimed. The Court compared the suit to a bill in the nature of inter-pleader, which permits a plaintiff threatened with rival claimants to the same debt or legal duty to bring an interpleader action before the institution of the independent suits. On the basis of this analogy, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cWhen, by appropriate procedure, a court possessing equity powers is . . . asked to prevent the loss which might otherwise result from the independent prosecution of rival but mutually exclusive claims, a justiciable issue is presented for adjudication which because it is a recognized subject of the equity procedure which we have inherited from England, is a \u2018case\u2019 or \u2018controversy,\u2019 within the meaning of the Constitutional provision- and when the case is one prosecuted between states, which are the rival claimants, and the risk of loss is shown to be real and substantial, the case is within the original jurisdiction of this Court conferred by the Judiciary Article.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 407-408.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As Justice Stewart wrote when California first petitioned this Court to resolve its dispute with Texas over Hughes\u2019 estate: \u201cThe facts alleged in the complaint now before us are indistinguishable in all material respects from those on which jurisdiction was based in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida.\u201d California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>437 U. S., at 606 (concurring opinion). We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Thus, this dispute is a controversy between two States within our original jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Second, it is appropriate to exercise our jurisdiction in this case. A determination that this Court has original jurisdiction over a case, of course, does not require us to exercise that jurisdiction. We have imposed prudential and equitable limitations upon the exercise of our original jurisdiction. As we explained in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U. S. 91, 93-94 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cWe construe 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1), as we do Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to make it obligatory only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief may be had. We incline to a sparing use of our original jurisdiction so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not suffer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">At the time we decided <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>it seemed to several Members of the Court that statutory interpleader might obviate the need to exercise original jurisdiction. Justice Brennan, for example, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cIf we have jurisdiction at all, that jurisdiction does not attach until it can be shown that the two States may possibly be able to obtain conflicting adjudications of domicile. That showing has not been made at this time in this case, since it may well be possible for the Hughes estate to obtain a judgment under the Federal Inter-pleader Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71335, from a United States district court, which would be binding on both California and Texas. In this event, the precondition for our original jurisdiction would be lacking. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ingly, I would deny California\u2019s motion, at least until such time as it is shown that such a statutory in-terpleader action cannot or will not be brought.\u201d 437 U. S., at 601-602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Our decision in <em>Cory </em>v. <em>White </em>has now shown that such a statutory interpleader action cannot be brought. Thus, the precondition for the exercise of original jurisdiction has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There were several other uncertainties that affected the case when we denied California\u2019s earlier motion. At that time, Texas urged that the controversy was not ripe because of the pending claim of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute that a \u201clost will\u201d left the entire estate to it and the contention that the so-called \u201cMormon Will\u201d was valid. A jury has since rejected the \u201cMormon Will,\u201d the Nevada Supreme Court and the Texas Probate Court the \u201clost will.\u201d Another changed circumstance is the expiration of a conditional settlement agreement between California and the estate. Texas had argued because of this allegedly collusive agreement, the case was not a justiciable case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We conclude that our original jurisdiction is properly invoked under <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>and we grant California leave to file its bill of complaint. The defendants shall have 60 days to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Texas asserts that California has not demonstrated the jurisdictional prerequisite of showing a \u201cthreatened injury\u201d of \u201cserious magnitude and imminent.\u201d Brief in Opposition to Motion for Leave to File 6, quoting <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>291 U. S. 286, 292 (1934). Texas explains that the true value of the estate is subject to dispute and litigation and that the estate can fully satisfy all potential death tax claims against it even under California\u2019s own valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The Court in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>however, required only that \u201c[t]he risk that decedent\u2019s estate might constitutionally be subjected to conflicting tax assessments in excess of its total value and that the right of complainant or some other state to collect the tax might thus be defeated was a real one.\u201d 306 U. S., at 410. The claims before us here are no more speculative than the ones there. As that case recognized, to bring an interpleader suit, \u201c[a] plaintiff need not await actual institution of independent suits; it is enough if he shows that conflicting claims are asserted and that the consequent risk of loss is substantial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 406. Thus, California\u2019s allegations are sufficient to present a controversy within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a). Despite the suggestion that we do so, we decline to overrule <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> As in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>the idiosyncratic pattern of the decedent\u2019s life provides a basis for more than one State\u2019s claims. Hughes spent much of his time in California and many of his business activities were based there. He was, however, born in Texas and long continued to use Texas as his mailing address and sometimes stated that Texas was his domicile. Indeed, a jury in Texas probate proceedings has already found Hughes to have been a domiciliary of Texas at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The administrator of Hughes\u2019 estate timely perfected an appeal of that judgment. Brief for Respondent Lummis in <em>Cory </em>v. <em>White, O. </em>T. 1981, No. 80-1556, p. 5. The Texas Court of Civil Appeals stayed the appeal of the Texas domicile judgment pending the outcome of the federal inter-pleader action. <em>Id., </em>at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b213-9\">Justice Powell,</author>\n<p id=\"AyR\">with whom Justice Marshall, Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">In <em>Cory </em>v. <em>White, ante, </em>at 89, the Court today reaffirms the holding of <em>Worcester County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>302 U. S. 292 (1937), that \u201cinconsistent determinations by the courts of two States as to the domicile of a taxpayer [do] not raise a substantial federal constitutional question.\u201d Under <em>Worcester County </em>there is no constitutional bar to both Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and California taxing the Hughes estate on the ground that he was a domiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Having reaffirmed the authority of <em>Worcester County, </em>the Court concludes that \u201cCalifornia and Texas are asserting inconsistent claims and are undeniably adversaries in [the interpleader action].\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 165. But its own premises will not support this conclusion. If both States legally can tax the Hughes estate, a controversy between them would arise only if both were to obtain money judgments against the estate and, further, if the estate then were to prove insufficient to satisfy both claims. Yet it is no more clear today than it was in 1978, when we unanimously decided <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>437 U. S. 601 (1978), that this situation ever will occur. Thus, under the Court\u2019s own assumptions, there is no ripe controversy between the States, and no basis for our consideration of the original complaint in No. 88, Original.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As if discomfited by the logic of its position, the Court argues that the jurisdictional allegations here at least are \u201cno more speculative,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 166, n. 1, than those in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>306 U. S. 398 (1939). Yet as Justice Stewart argued persuasively in our 1978 decision in <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>it is inescapable that <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida </em>was wrongly decided. See 437 U. S., at 606, 611-612 (Stewart, J., concurring). The mere possibility of inconsistent state determinations of domicile, resulting in a still more remote possibility of the estate\u2019s being insufficient to satisfy the competing claims, simply does not give rise to a case or controversy in the constitutional sense. \u201cThe necessity that the plaintiff who seeks to invoke judicial power stand to profit in some personal interest remains an Art. Ill requirement. A federal court cannot ignore this requirement without overstepping its assigned role in our system of adjudicating only actual cases and controversies.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U. S. 26, 39 (1976). See <em>Valley Forge Christian College </em>v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, </em>454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982); <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U. S. 490, 508 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Nor is the Court entitled to base its finding of original jurisdiction on an \u201canalogy\u201d between the original action and \u201ca bill in the nature of interpleader.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 167. Under the Interpleader Act, the stakeholder is the \u201cplaintiff.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1335. Having been notified of claims by two or more \u201cclaimants,\u201d the stakeholder normally would have standing to litigate the validity of each of the individual claims. The presence of these justiciable controversies between stakeholder and claimants satisfies the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement of Art. III. Interpleader jurisdiction merely provides for convenient resolution in a single forum. Interpleader jurisdiction thus is irrelevant to the question whether there is an independently justiciable controversy \u201cbetween\u201d States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
