BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-26\">Appellant Klopfenstein appeals from an adverse summary judgment in this diversity action which arose out of an aborted joint venture agreement. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ruled that the joint venture had been mutually rescinded or abandoned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant contends he raised a material issue of fact regarding his intent to terminate the joint venture. In the consolidated appeal, Klopfenstein contends attorney\u2019s fees were improperly awarded.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree with both contentions and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Klopfenstein and defendant-appellee Pargeter orally contracted to jointly seek a fast food franchise in Alaska. They met with representatives of the franchisor, prepared to incorporate a business, and arranged for a bank loan. Then Pargeter wrote to Klopfenstein on October 30, 1969, saying that he had decided to sever their joint efforts because of dissatisfaction between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Klopfenstein never replied to this letter, but informed the franchisor and the bank by letter that the joint applications were to be withdrawn and that he would compete with Pargeter for the franchise. Klopfenstein took no action to protest Pargeter\u2019s withdrawal from the joint venture or to reconcile his differences with Pargeter. Within six months Pargeter secured the franchise. Again, until this suit was filed in 1972, appellant took no action: he neither objected to Pargeter\u2019s withdrawal from the venture nor sought to revive it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The complaint alleges that appellee\u2019s letter of October 30th was a breach of the joint venture agreement and that therefore appellee holds half-interest in the franchise as a constructive trustee for appellant. The relief sought is specific performance and an accounting. <em>See generally Granik v. Perry, </em>418 F.2d 832 (C.A.5 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">We agree with the district judge\u2019s conclusion that no material issue of fact existed and that appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Appellant\u2019s inaction and his letters to the bank and franchisor show that either he construed the letter as an offer to rescind and accepted it, or he chose to abandon the joint venture when he realized Pargeter was dissatisfied. In either case the termination of the joint venture was supported by consideration because both parties were relieved of their contractual obligations. <em>See Johnson v. Koyle, </em>5 Utah 2d 9, 295 P.2d 834 (1956); J. Calamari and J. Perillo, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 339 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">Appellant contends his own affidavit, submitted in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, raises a material issue of fact. In the affidavit appellant Klopfenstein avers that he did not intend to rescind or abandon the contract. But the affidavit does not point to any conduct from which Pargeter or anyone else could infer that this was Klopfenstein\u2019s intention. Appellant\u2019s conduct unequivocally implied that he no longer intended to follow through with the joint venture, but instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>intended to seek the franchise alone or with a new partner. Undisclosed, subjective intentions are immaterial in this commercial transaction, especially when contradicted by objective conduct. Thus, the affidavit has no legal effect even if its averments are accepted as wholly truthful. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Appellant\u2019s objections to the award of attorney\u2019s fees are equally merit-less. In a diversity action the question of attorney\u2019s fees is governed by state law. <em>Schulz v. Lamb, </em>591 F.2d 1268 (C.A.9 1978); <em>Interform Co. v. Mitchell, </em>575 F.2d 1270, 1280 (C.A.9 1978). Appellant contends that although Alaska law allows recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, none are recoverable in federal court because their recovery is authorized by State rule of court, not by State statute. We disagree. Rule 82(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, is supported by legislation which specifies that the Supreme Court shall determine when attorney\u2019s fees are to be awarded. Alaska Statutes 09.60.010. Thus, the award of attorney\u2019s fees is authorized, though not mandated, by statute. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has indicated that state law regarding attorney\u2019s fees governs, whether its source is case law or statutory law. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 259 n. 31, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Finally, appellant contends that the district court abused its discretion in fixing the amount of fees awarded. We have carefully examined the supplemental record and conclude that appellee\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is adequately documented and that the district court used appropriate criteria in fixing the amount. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u2018 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">. The district court ruled in the alternative that the action was barred by laches. Appellant also contends that this issue presents a material issue of fact. Inasmuch as we uphold the district court\u2019s ruling that the parties terminated the joint venture, we need not review the alternative ground for its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">.
