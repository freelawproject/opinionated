In light of the decision in <em>Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979), we vacate and remand this action for further proceedings consistent with the rulings of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Plaintiff Broadmoor Improvement Association, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation comprised of approximately 750 blacks and whites who, for the most part, live in the Broadmoor residential area of New Orleans, Louisiana. Its corporate purpose is the preservation of the quality and racially integrated character of Broadmoor. The Association sued a real estate firm, Stan Weber and Associates, Inc., and several of its agent-employees alleging that defendants engaged in a pattern of \u201cblockbusting\u201d activity with the intended effect of steering white residents out of and blacks into the Broadmoor area. Specifically, the Association charged defendants with mailing no- \u2019 tices to white residents of Broadmoor which indicated that certain property in Broad-moor had been sold and offered the same sales service to the white residents who received the notices. At the same time defendants allegedly mailed different notices to black residents of Broadmoor which indicated that certain neighborhood property was for sale and inquired if a \u201cfriend\u201d might be interested in purchasing such property. It is from this alleged conduct that the Association sought injunctive relief and damages for the diminution in the value of property in Broadmoor, for the loss of quality of the residential neighborhood, and for mental suffering and distress based upon economic and social fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">The district court acknowledged that under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1982 and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3604, 3612, a corporate plaintiff may have standing to litigate certain violations under <em>Park View Heights Corp. v. City of Black Jack, </em>467 F.2d 1208, 1214 (8th Cir. 1972). It determined, however, that in this case plaintiff\u2019s corporate purpose was insufficient to constitute a personal and concrete stake in the controversy necessary to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>requirements of standing commanded by <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The court denied any representational standing to litigate claims of individual members. The court held that others who were more directly injured or affected by the alleged discriminatory conduct should litigate the issues raised. The district court specifically applied the so-called \u201cprudential considerations\u201d test of standing under <em>Warth v. Seldin, supra </em>at 499-500, 95 S.Ct. 2197. It held that the Article III standard for standing that <em>Traffieante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972), applied to a suit under \u00a7 3610 did not apply to a \u00a7 3604 claim under \u00a7 3612.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In <em>Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bell-wood, supra, </em>the Supreme Court has now decided that the <em>Traffieante </em>test applies equally to both \u00a7 3610 and \u00a7 3612 claims. Therefore both the summary judgment for defendants and the denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to substitute as party-plaintiffs members of the Association who resided in Broadmoor were decided under what is now known to be an erroneous view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Bellwood </em>ruled that individual residents who live inside the area targeted by real estate brokers for racial steering, as well as the affected municipal corporation, have standing under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq., </em>to challenge the legality of the practices of realtors and their agents which deprive such residents of the \u201cbenefits of interracial associations\u201d or \u201crob [the community] of its racial balance and stability.\u201d <em>Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>supra,-U.S. at-, 99 S.Ct. at 1614. Further the Supreme Court intimated that it would not be inappropriate for the district court to consider claims raised by nonresidents of the targeted area if they presented allegations of actual harm suffered as a result of the alleged discriminatory activity. <em>Id. </em>at --, n.25, 99 S.Ct. at 1614.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We therefore vacate and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with the decision in <em>Bellwood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
