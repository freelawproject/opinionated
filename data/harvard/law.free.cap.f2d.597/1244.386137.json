Alioto Fish Co. (Alioto) and operated out of San Francisco Bay and Eureka, California. McCune\u2019s complaint alleged that he was injured due to Alioto\u2019s failure to keep the <em>Mineo Brothers </em>in seaworthy condition and because of Alioto\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-20\">Only three persons were on board the <em>Mineo Brothers </em>at the time of McCune\u2019s injury: Wilson, master of the vessel; Farnham, a deck hand; and McCune, also a deck hand. The injury occurred when McCune\u2019s foot was caught by an unshielded moving part of a winch used during fishing operations. McCune was attempting to dislodge a \u201cdog\u201d or pawl which had become wedged tightly in the teeth of a sprocket on the drum of the winch, jamming the winch, when he was injured. As a result of the accident, McCune lost two toes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>On May 12,1973, Farnham died. McCune did not have Alioto served with his complaint until February 1974. About three months later, Alioto sent a letter to Rowe Machine Works, Inc. (Rowe), the manufacturer of the winch, tendering defense of the case to Rowe. In November 1974, Alioto filed a third party indemnity claim against Rowe under Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a). The indemnity claim set forth three theories of recovery: negligence, breach of warranty, and strict products liability. The indemnity cause was severed in February 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">In April and May of 1975, Alioto concluded the following agreement (the Hartford Agreement, after the name of Alioto\u2019s insurance carrier) with McCune:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-6\">(1) Defendant will pay $50,000 to Davis [McCune\u2019s attorney] as trustee in return for McCune\u2019s and Davis\u2019s covenant not to execute against F. Alioto Fish Company . in any amount should judgment be rendered against F. Alioto Fish Company in the pending suit . . . . The sum of $50,000 shall not be repaid to defendant, however, if plaintiff fails to obtain judgment against defendant or recovers a judgment against defendant in an amount less than $50,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-9\">(2) As part of the consideration for plaintiff\u2019s covenant not to execute, defendant agreed to remain in the lawsuit through judgment and any appeal, with the undersigned as counsel, ostensibly to defend F. Alioto Fish Company, and to pursue its indemnity action against Rowe Machine Works, Inc. Defendant is also to attempt to bring Rowe into the action under Rule 14(c), FRCP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">Pursuant to the Hartford Agreement, Alioto sought to amend its third party complaint to state a 14(c) claim against Rowe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McCune also amended his complaint to state a cause of action directly against Rowe on theories of breach of warranty and strict products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">Rowe moved to dismiss McCune\u2019s complaint against it on the ground of laches on January, 19, 1976, about six months after the amended complaints against it were filed. Although the district court found McCune\u2019s delay in naming and serving' Rowe to be unreasonable and inexcusable, it concluded that Rowe had not demonstrated that it had suffered prejudice from the delay. The motion was denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">Subsequently, on May 11, 1976, the district court entered an order dismissing McCune\u2019s complaint against Rowe, reversing its position on the question of prejudice to Rowe due to McCune\u2019s delay. At the same time, the court also ordered the following claims dismissed: Alio.to\u2019s 14(c) claim against Rowe, Rowe\u2019s cross claim for indemnity and contribution against Alioto, and McCune\u2019s claim against Alioto. The court stated that its May 11 order was not a final judgment and refused Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification on June 10, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-18\">Alioto\u2019s previously severed Rule 14(a) claim for indemnity came on for trial on June 21,1976. After trial, the district court ultimately concluded that Alioto\u2019s indemnity claim was barred by laches and that, in any event, Alioto was not entitled to indemnity or contribution on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-19\">II. <em>McCune\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-20\">McCune appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Alioto and Rowe. He also urges that the Hartford Agreement be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>A. <em>McCune v. Alioto</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">While the district court provided no rationale for its dismissal of McCune\u2019s complaint against Alioto, it is well-established that if any ground exists which would support a judgment, we must affirm. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943); <em>Helvering v. Gowran, </em>302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crain, </em>589 F.2d 996, 1001 n. 9 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Best, </em>573 F.2d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir. 1978). We conclude, as a matter of law, that the Hartford Agreement renders McCune\u2019s complaint against Alioto moot, and that the district court therefore properly dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">McCune sought only money damages from Alioto in redress of his injuries. The Hartford Agreement provided that McCune, in exchange for $50,000 and Alioto\u2019s promise to attempt to bring Rowe into the suit by way of a Rule 14(c) claim, would not seek any money from Alioto in redress of his injuries. The Agreement also provided that the money was McCune\u2019s to keep even if the court decided that he was entitied to less than $50,000 after trial of his \u201cclaim.\u201d The concrete controversy between McCune and Alioto \u2014 whether Alioto owed McCune any money and, if so, how much\u2014 was thus eliminated by the Hartford Agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McCune does not stand either to gain or to lose from pursuing his \u201cclaim\u201d against Alioto. Under these circumstances, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the claim, for there was no concrete case or controversy between McCune and Alioto. <em>See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 39, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976) (\u201cThe necessity that the plaintiff who seeks to invoke judicial power stand to profit in some personal interest remains an Art. Ill requirement.\u201d); <em>Construction Industry Association v. Petaluma, </em>522 F.2d 897, 903 (9th Cir. 1975) (\u201cplaintiff must show that he has a \u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); 13 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3530 at 168, \u00a7 3533 (1975). Hence, we affirm the dismissal of McCune\u2019s complaint against Alioto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>B. <em>McCune v. Rowe</em></p>\n<p id=\"AI-\">The district court found that McCune\u2019s claim against Rowe was barred by laches. McCune attacks the order of dismissal on three grounds, asserting that the district court erred in (1) failing to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) and 52(a) as to findings of fact, (2) failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the laches defense, and (3) finding that laches barred his claim. We reject these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Rule 41(b) requires that the district court make findings of fact in accordance with Rule 52(a) when it enters a judgment on the merits of a case. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>Dismissal of a claim on the ground that it is barred by laches is an adjudication on the merits. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Therefore, McCune is correct in asserting that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against Rowe must have been supported by findings of fact sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 52(a). However, we cannot agree with McCune that the district court failed to meet the Rule 52(a) requirements when it dismissed his claim against Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">In order to prevail upon a laches defense, a party must establish that there has been inexcusable delay and prejudice to it as a result of that delay. <em>See Espino v. Ocean Cargo Line, Ltd., </em>382 F.2d 67, 69 (9th Cir. 1967). In its order dismissing McCune\u2019s claim against Rowe, the district court expressly found that McCune had unreasonably and inexcusably delayed and that McCune\u2019s delay prejudiced Rowe. The court also referred to its earlier findings of fact in Rowe\u2019s initial motion for dismissal which discussed McCune\u2019s delay and the effects of that delay in great detail. Finally, the district court explicitly stated that its order of dismissal was not a final judgment; and prior to entering final judgment as to all claims in this case, it made further detailed findings on delay and the prejudice to Rowe resulting from that delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Not all of the findings of fact necessary to support a judgment or order need appear in a single document. <em>Rayonier, Inc. v. Poison, </em>400 F.2d 909, 922-23 (9th Cir. 1968). Here, looking to the whole record, and specifically to the three sets of findings made by the district court, we find findings of fact sufficiently explicit to give us a clear understanding of the basis of the court\u2019s decision. <em>See Forsyth v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>520 F.2d 608, 613-14 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Handeland v. Commissioner, </em>519 F.2d 327, 329 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Henry C. Beck Co. v. Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>456 F.2d 316, 320 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Rayonier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Poison, </em>400 F.2d at 923; <em>Dale Benz, Inc. v. American Casualty Co., </em>303 F.2d 80, 82 (9th Cir. 1962). Thus, the district court\u2019s findings meet the requirements of Rules 41(b) and 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">McCune argues that the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing in connection with its dismissal of his claim against Rowe. While we have stated that \u201cthe factual issues involved in a laches defense can <em>rarely </em>be resolved without some preliminary evidentiary inquiry,\u201d <em>Espino v. Ocean Cargo Line, Ltd., </em>382 F.2d at 70 (emphasis added), an evidentiary hearing was not required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">Here, the salient facts are not in dispute. McCune admits that he was injured on April 22, 1971. He also admits on this appeal, that Rowe did not have notice of its potential involvement until May 28, 1974.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He does not contest the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>Farnham, an eyewitness to the accident and a participant in the successful assault on the jammed winch, died on May 12, 1973, more than one year before Rowe had notice of the suit. Finally, he does not dispute the fact that although Wilson and Farnham managed to free the jammed winch after the accident, Wilson can no longer remember how they succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">As we previously noted, the two elements of the defense of laches are inexcusable delay and prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Espino v. Ocean Cargo Line, Ltd., </em>382 F.2d at 69. McCune offers no excuse for his delay of over three years in notifying Rowe of its potential liability. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 69 (Espino alleged reasons for his delay in his complaint \u2014 he was uneducated; he did not speak, read or write English; he thought his rights were limited by statute; he did not consult a lawyer for over one year after the accident). Instead, McCune merely contends that Rowe suffered no prejudice because of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">On this appeal, McCune argues that Rowe is strictly liable to him as a manufacturer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have held that in admiralty cases based upon strict products liability comparative fault is a factor mitigating liability: \u201call of plaintiff\u2019s conduct can be compared to the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Pan-Alaska Fisheries, Inc. v. Marine Construction &amp; Design Co., </em>565 F.2d 1129, 1139 (9th Cir. 1977). This partial defense makes the reasonableness of McCune\u2019s actions in attempting to unjam the winch an important issue in this case. The steps taken by Wilson and Farnham after the accident to free the winch are relevant to this issue of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">Therefore, based on the undisputed facts and the current status of the law of strict products liability in admiralty cases in this Circuit, we cannot say that the district court \u201cplainly erred\u201d in finding that Farnham\u2019s death and Wilson\u2019s loss of memory prejudiced Rowe. <em>See Espino v. Ocean Cargo Line, Ltd., </em>382 F.2d at 70, <em>citing Gutierrez v. Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>373 U.S. 206, 215, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And because the district court\u2019s conclusion that McCune\u2019s claim against Rowe is barred by laches is supportable by the undisputed facts in this case, we cannot say that the court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing on the laches defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">Having rejected each of the errors urged by McCune, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint against Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-13\">III. <em>Alioto\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">Alioto appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Rowe on Alioto\u2019s indemnity claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It contends that the court erred in finding that Rowe had no obligation to indemnify Alioto either under the doctrine announced in <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. </em>v. <em>Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), or otherwise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">A. <em>Ryan-type Indemnity: Warranty of Workmanlike Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-17\">The relationship between ALIOTO and ROWE does not give rise to the obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>tion to indemnify enunciated in <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124 [76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133] (1956). [Citations omitted.] Furthermore, ALIOTO and not ROWE had complete control and supervision over the installation of the winches and the danger from the alleged defect in the winches could have been eliminated at the time of installation (as ALIOTO did on the inboard side of the winches). Consequently, a crucial element in a <em>Ryan </em>case, performance of services by ROWE without supervision or control by ALIOTO, is missing. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Alioto contends that the district court erred in that <em>Ryan </em>-type indemnity is available in a case such as the one at bar. It argues that although <em>Ryan </em>-type indemnity is \u201cusually\u201d encountered only in \u201cservice\u201d type situations, \u201cthe reasoning behind <em>Ryan </em>and its progeny would logically extend maritime indemnity to shipowners liable because of injuries caused by a manufacturer\u2019s defective products supplied to the vessel for use aboard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">In <em>Ryan, </em>the Supreme Court was faced with the plight of a shipowner whose strict liability to a longshoreman for unseaworthiness was the result of a stevedoring company\u2019s improper storage of cargo. To ease the burden which the doctrine of unseaworthiness imposes on shipowners, \u201cwho often are held vicariously liable for the acts of third persons causing injury to seamen,\u201d <em>Flunker v. United States, </em>528 F.2d 239, 242 (9th Cir. 1975), the Court held that the shipowner could recover by way of indemnity from the stevedoring company. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-7\">The shipowner here holds petitioner\u2019s uncontroverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner\u2019s stevedoring operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily includes petitioner\u2019s obligation not only to stow the pulp rolls, but to stow them properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the <em>service </em>undertaken. This obligation is not a quasi-contractual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual obligation. It is of the essence of petitioner\u2019s stevedoring contract. <em>It is petitioner\u2019s warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adp2\">350 U.S. at 133-34, 76 S.Ct. at 237 (emphasis added); <em>see Hanseatische Reederei Emil Offen v. Marine Terminals, </em>590 F.2d 778, 781 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">The <em>Ryan </em>doctrine has been extended to non-stevedoring cases. <em>See, e. g., Garrett v. United States Lines, Inc., </em>574 F.2d 997 (9th Cir. 1978) (launch service); <em>United States v. San Francisco Elevator Co., </em>512 F.2d 23 (9th Cir. 1975) (repairs undertaken by subcontractor); <em>United States v. Tug Manzanillo, </em>310 F.2d 220 (9th Cir. 1962) (towing). It also \u201ccomprehends situations where there is no contractual relationship between the indemnitor and indemnitee.\u201d <em>Flunker v. United States, </em>528 F.2d at 243.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">However, Alioto\u2019s complaint is that Rowe supplied it with a defective <em>product, </em>not unworkmanlike <em>services. </em>It fails to cite any cases in which <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>warranty of workmanlike services has been transformed into a warranty covering the manufacture of products. Nor do we believe such a transformation is necessary or proper. Therefore, we must agree with the district court that the relationship between Alioto and Rowe does not give rise to a Ryan-type warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">B. <em>Other Claims for Indemnity: Strict Liability, Negligence and Breach of Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">After trial of Alioto\u2019s Rule 14(a) claim for indemnity, the district court made the following findings and conclusions, among others: (1) there was no defect in the winches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>supplied by Rowe which were a proximate cause of McCune\u2019s injuries, (2) McCune\u2019s injuries were due solely to his own negligence as well as that of Alioto and its employees, (3) Rowe made no warranties of any kind concerning the winches, (4) the uncovered moving parts in which McCune caught his foot were \u201copen, obvious, and apparent to anyone,\u201d (5) the winches were installed aboard the <em>Mineo Brothers </em>in 1962, (6) the injury to McCune occurred on April 22, 1971, and (7) Alioto did not complain to Rowe about the winches before the accident and did not notify Rowe of the accident until about June 1, 1974. From these findings and conclusions, the district court ultimately concluded that Alioto was not entitled to indemnity or contribution from Rowe for amounts paid to McCune as compensation for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">A district codrt\u2019s findings of fact can be overturned only if they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a): <em>McAllister v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); <em>Garrett v. United </em>States <em>Lines, Inc., </em>574 F.2d at 999; <em>Hanson v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 771, 772 (9th Cir. 1973). While negligence and proximate cause are, strictly speaking, mixed questions of law and fact, a district court\u2019s findings/conclusions regarding negligence and proximate cause may only be overturned when they are clearly erroneous. <em>See McAllister v. United States, </em>348 U.S. at 20-23, 75 S.Ct. 6; <em>Miller v. United States, </em>587 F.2d 991, 994 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Standard Oil Co., </em>495 F.2d 911, 916 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Soriano, </em>366 F.2d 699, 703-04 (9th Cir. 1966); 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2590 (1971). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous only when, \u2018although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garrett v. United States Lines, Inc., </em>574 F.2d at 999, <em>quoting United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, </em>343 U.S. 326, 339, 72 S.Ct. 690, 96 L.Ed. 978 (1952), <em>and United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we are not left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the district court in making the findings above mentioned. Therefore, those findings must stand. And because the findings must stand, we must affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Rowe: Alioto cannot establish crucial elements of its various theories of indemnification and contribution given these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">1. <em>Strict Products Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">This court has adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A as the law of products liability in admiralty cases. <em>Pan-Alaska Fisheries, Inc. v. Marine Construction &amp; Design Co., </em>565 F.2d at 1135. In order for a plaintiff to prevail on a strict products liability claim under \u00a7 402A, he must establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that his injury <em>was caused by </em>an <em>unreasonably dangerous defect </em>in a product sold or manufactured by the defendant. <em>Id?, </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A(l) (1965). The district court\u2019s finding that there was <em>no defect </em>in the winches sold by Rowe <em>which was a proximate cause </em>of McCune\u2019s injury thus precludes Alioto\u2019s recovery under this theory-</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">2. <em>Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">Likewise, Alioto cannot recover on a negligence theory. The district court\u2019s finding that McCune\u2019s and Alioto\u2019s negligence were the only proximate causes of McCune\u2019s injuries prevents Alioto from establishing that any negligence on the part of Rowe was a proximate cause of MeCune\u2019s injury. Thus, Alioto cannot establish one of the crucial elements of a negligence claim against Rowe. <em>See </em>W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts \u00a7 30, at 143 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-12\">3. <em>Breach of Warranty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-13\">Finally, the district court\u2019s findings prevent Alioto from stating an indemnity or contribution claim based upon a breach of warranty. The district court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>that Rowe made no warranties (as we have previously stated), is not clearly erroneous. Therefore, Alioto cannot succeed on an express warranty theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">However, a finding that Rowe did not expressly make any warranties does not necessarily preclude the implication of certain warranties as a matter of law. Assuming, as does Alioto, that U.C.C. \u00a7 2-315\u2014 the U.C.C. provision on implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose \u2014 is applicable to Rowe\u2019s sale of the winches, and also assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the requirements for an implied \u00a7 2-315 warranty were met and that the lack of a guard over the moving parts which caught McCune\u2019s foot constituted a breach of the \u00a7 2-315 warranty, the district court\u2019s findings nonetheless preclude Alioto\u2019s recovery on its implied warranty theory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Section 2-607(3)(a) of the U.C.C. conditions recovery for breach of a warranty.of fitness for a particular purpose upon the buyer\u2019s notifying the seller of the breach. If the buyer fails to notify the seller of a breach of the \u00a7 2-315 warranty within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered the breach, the buyer is without remedy for the breach. U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2-607(3)(a), 2-714; T. Quinn, Uniform Commercial Code Commentary and Digest \u00b6 2 \u2014 315[A][3] (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">The district court found that the exposed moving parts were open and obvious to all. If the lack of a guard over these parts was a breach of warranty, it should have been discovered at or near the time the winches were installed aboard the <em>Mineo Brothers </em>in 1962. Alioto notified Rowe of the alleged breach of warranty in 1974 \u2014 more than ten years after it should have discovered the breach. As a matter of law a delay of more than ten years between the time a breach should have been discovered and notification is not commercially reasonable. <em>See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-204(2), 2-607(3)(a) &amp; comment 4. Hence, Alioto cannot recover on its implied warranty theory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-10\">Having concluded that every theory of indemnity liability urged by Alioto is unavailing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Rowe on Alioto\u2019s indemnity claim, as we have affirmed the district court\u2019s orders and judgment in all other respects.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(c) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">When a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim . . . the defendant or claimant, as a third-party plaintiff, may bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable, either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff, by way of remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences. In such a case the third-party plaintiff may also demand judgment against the third-party defendant in favor of the plaintiff, in which event the third-party defendant shall make his defenses to the claim of the plaintiff as well as to that of the third-party plaintiff . and the action shall proceed as if the plaintiff had commenced it against the third-party defendant as well as the third-party plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">. McCune seeks relief from the Hartford Agreement because of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Alioto\u2019s 14(c) claim. He contends that the dismissal resulted in the failure of consideration for his giving up his right to enforce a judgment against Alioto. He also argues that the parties \u201ccontracted under the mistaken belief that Alioto and McCune had viable 14(c) rights and that the existence of this contract would in no way interfere with the enforcement of those rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">We note, at the outset, that the Hartford Agreement states that Alioto will <em>attempt </em>to bring Rowe into the suit by way of a Rule 14(c) claim. Moreover, McCune merely alleges in a conclusory manner that the parties based their agreement on their belief that they could prevail on the 14(c) claim. He presents no specific basis for his position, nor can we conceive of any. We find untenable the argument that two parties represented by counsel throughout their negotiations could contract based upon their \u201cbelief\u201d that the 14(c) claim was a \u201csure bet.\u201d As noted <em>supra, </em>the language of the contract belies such a contention. McCune received exactly what he bargained for: an attempt by Alioto to bring Rowe into the suit by way of a 14(c) claim and $50,000. Thus, there was no failure of consideration and no mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">McCune also seeks relief from the Hartford Agreement on the ground that it is void as illegal or against public policy. Because he did not raise this argument below, we do not address it here. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>Hansen v. Morgan, </em>582 F.2d 1214, 1217 (9th Cir. 1978). <em>Cf. Roberts v. Hollandsworth, </em>582 F.2d 496, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1978) (federal appellate court does not usually address issues not passed upon by lower court unless substantial injustice would result).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">Finally, McCune argues that the Hartford Agreement cannot be construed as a release binding him because he did not personally sign it. However, the cases cited by McCune do not support his contention that a seaman must personally sign a release in order for it to bind him. It is a general principle of contract law that an agent may bind his principal. <em>See </em>2 Williston on Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 273-281 (3d ed. 1959). McCune does not claim that his attorney was without authority to sign the Hartford Agreement on his behalf. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 274, 277-277B, 281. We therefore reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">. McCune also attacks the district court\u2019s dismissal of his cause against Alioto on the ground that the court failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) and 52(a) to support its or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>der of dismissal. Although Rule 41(b) requires that a district court make findings of fact pursuant to Rule 52(a) when it \u201crenders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff,\u201d it also provides that a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not a judgment on the merits. Since we have concluded that the district court was <em>without jurisdiction </em>to hear McCune\u2019s cause against Alioto and properly dismissed McCune\u2019s complaint in that regard, we must reject the assertion that findings of fact were necessary to the dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">. Rowe was given notice on May 28, 1974, by Alioto, not McCune, in a letter tendering defense of the case to Rowe. Alioto brought an indemnity claim against Rowe under Fed.R. Civ.P. 14(a) on November 8, 1974. McCune did not amend his complaint seeking to state a cause of action against Rowe until June 20, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>We need not decide whether May 28, 1974, November 8, 1974, or June 20, 1975, is the relevant date in a laches determination.

McCune has apparently abandoned his breach of warranty theory on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">. McCune argues that Rowe\u2019s delay in deposing Wilson until March 3, 1976, clearly establishes that the prejudice from the loss of testimony concerning the steps which Wilson and Farnham took to unjam the winch after McCune\u2019s accident was not due to his delay. The district court was presented with both the fact of McCune\u2019s delay and the fact that Rowe waited for some time before deposing Wilson. The district court found that the prejudice was due to McCune\u2019s delay. We cannot say that this finding of fact is clearly erroneous. Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a). It must therefore stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1314-19\">. Alioto does not appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of its Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(c) claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1314-20\">. Alioto also claims that the district court erred in holding that its indemnity claim was barred by laches. However, we need not reach this assignment of error, given our disposition of Alioto\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">. Congress has eliminated the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine in that class of cases in which it was first established. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b); <em>Flunker v.

While Alioto does not contend, on this appeal, that Rowe breached its implied warranty of merchantability, <em>see </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2-314, a breach of a \u00a7 2-314 warranty is also subject to \u00a7 2-607.

On this appeal, Alioto does not argue that Rowe breached any implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">. Alioto contends that under California law, notice to a manufacturer is not required. However, the authority cited by Alioto for this proposition at most establishes that notice to a manufacturer is not required when a plaintiff is proceeding on a strict products liability theory. Assuming without deciding that California law applies here, we note that California has adopted \u00a7\u00a7 1-204, 2-607 and 2-714 from the U.C.C. with only minor stylistic changes. <em>See </em>Cal. Comm. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1204, 2607, 2714. Thus, even under California law, timely notice is required for a breach of warranty claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1317-22\">.
