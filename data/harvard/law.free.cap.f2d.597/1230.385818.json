The bases for the revocation were that he violated Federal Aviation Regulations and had been convicted of possessing marijuana for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-19\">On the night of December 17,1975, Deputies Chapin and Mergell of the Mojave County, Arizona Sheriff\u2019s Office kept watch for drug smuggling activities at an isolated and deserted airstrip. A few hours after the Deputies arrived, they heard a plane flying low over the airstrip. The Deputies did not see the plane until moments before it landed; until then the plane was being operated without lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-20\">When the' engines were shut down, Chapin approached the plane and questioned the pilot. The pilot identified himself as \u201cDon Walters.\u201d Chapin then examined four documents which the pilot produced: a pilot certificate, California driver\u2019s license, a medical certificate, and a radio telephone operator\u2019s certificate. Each document was in the name of and signed \u201cDonald Lee Walters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-21\">The Deputies inspected the plane and found that its registration marks were concealed by a patch which showed false marks. Inside the cabin, where all but one of the four seats had been removed, the Deputies found 12 five-gallon cans of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-22\">The pilot was arrested for conspiracy to smuggle marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-23\">On the following day, a third Deputy inspected the plane and found that the tachometer cables had been disconnected. Later, the Deputies found that the plane was owned and registered in California by the Petitioner\u2019s business partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-24\">In May 1976, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revoked Petitioner\u2019s pilot license because of his 1974 marijuana conviction, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>of six violations of Federal Aviation Regulations committed during the flight on December 17, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Petitioner appealed asserting that 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15 was invalid because it exceeded the FAA\u2019s statutory authority and because the FAA lacked \u201cunequivocal\u201d proof that he was the arrested pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">At a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge in September 1976, Deputy Chapin testified that the photograph on the driver\u2019s license was of the pilot he arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Petitioner did not testify or call witnesses. The Judge found that the FAA proved, by a preponderance of \u201ccredible, reliable, probative, and substantial evidence,\u201d that Petitioner was the arrested pilot and that he violated Federal Aviation Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">The Judge upheld the FAA order of revocation after rejecting Petitioner\u2019s contentions that section 61.15 exceeded the FAA\u2019s statutory authority and was constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Petitioner again appealed, this time to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board held that section 61.15 is reasonably related to the safety purpose of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421 <em>et seq., </em>and that there is a rational connection between drug trafficking in the past and unsafe aircraft operations in the future. The Board also decided that the Judge applied the correct standard of proof on the issue of identity. It found no grounds for disturbing the Judge\u2019s findings of fact on that issue and affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">In this court, Petitioner renews both challenges to the revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">We hold that there is a rational relation between a conviction for the possession of drugs for sale and the unsafe use of aircraft for drug smuggling, and that section 61.15 is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">We also reject Walters\u2019 contention that the Judge applied the wrong standard of proof on the issue of identity. The Sheriff\u2019s Deputies\u2019 testimony made out a <em>prima facie </em>case that Petitioner was the pilot they arrested. The burden shifted to Petitioner to present evidence that he was not the pilot. <em>Newman v. Shaffer, </em>494 F.2d 1219 (2nd Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">Walters presented no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">Proof by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence is the proper standard. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(d). Here the agency met that standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">The petition for review of the revocation order is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1295-16\">. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15 provides that \u201c(a) No person who is convicted of violating any Federal or State statute relating to the growing, processing, manufacture, sale, disposition, possession, transportation, or importation of . marihuana ... is eligible for any certificate or rating issued under this part for a period of 1 year after the date of final conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>\u201c . . .

Even if the Petitioner were correct in contending that the identity issue must be proved by \u201cclear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence,\u201d the evidence here satisfied that standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
