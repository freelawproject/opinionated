Boney Kyzar, brings this action pursuant to the provisions of Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), seeking judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare reducing the child\u2019s insurance benefits payable to her on behalf of her two minor children. Having carefully reviewed the record in light of the argument of counsel, the court is of the opinion that the decision of the Secretary must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-18\">The facts are not in dispute. Peter L. Boney, the deceased insured, married Phala in August 1968. At the time of their divorce in July 1972, they had two children, Virginia and Emily, whom Peter continued to support until his accidental death in September 1974. During the interim, in June 1974, Peter married Candace Wilson, the former wife of Ewart 0. Wilson who is the father of her two daughters, Wendi and Shelley. Peter liyed with Candace and her children until his untimely death. Ewart, however, continued to support his two children at least through the date of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">After Peter\u2019s death, Phala filed a claim for child\u2019s insurance benefits on behalf of Virginia and Emily, the natural children, which was granted. Thereafter, Candace filed claims for mother\u2019s insurance benefits and for child\u2019s insurance benefits on behalf of Wendi and Shelley, the stepchildren, as well as the natural children. These claims were granted on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">As a result of the entitlement to benefits of Candace and the stepchildren, the original award to the natural children was reduced. Phala contested the reduction. After an unfavorable reconsideration determination, she requested a <em>de novo </em>hearing before an administrative law judge. In a decision dated February 28, 1977, the administrative law judge ruled that the benefits payable to plaintiff on behalf of the natural children were correctly reduced due to the entitlement of Candace and the stepchildren. This determination, became the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>final decision of the Secretary when it was approved by the Appeals Council on April 28, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">This court\u2019s scope of review is narrowly limited to the two-pronged question of whether the decision of the Secretary is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards. There being no dispute as to the first aspect of this inquiry, the court\u2019s only concern is whether the Secretary properly applied the law to the undisputed facts. ' The issue is whether the natural children of the deceased insured, who were both actually and statutorily deemed dependent upon the insured at the time of his death, must share their child\u2019s insurance benefits with the deceased insured\u2019s stepchildren, who met the statutory dependency criteria of the Act, but who were receiving child support payments from and were dependent upon, their natural father. This issue turns on the meaning of the terms \u201cdeemed dependent\u201d as used in Section 202(d)(4) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Child\u2019s insurance benefits are provided for in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d). Section 402(d)(1) states that an unmarried son or daughter\u2014 and under conditions met in this case, a stepson or stepdaughter \u2014 of an individual, who dies fully or currently insured under the Act, may apply for and be entitled to a survivor\u2019s benefit, if the applicant is under 18 years of age at the time of application (or is a full-time student and under 22 years of age) and was dependent, within the meaning of the statute, at the time of the parent\u2019s death. <em>Mathews v. Lucas, </em>427 U.S. 495, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 49 L.Ed.2d 651 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">A child shall be <em>deemed dependent </em>upon his stepfather or stepmother at the time specified in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, if, at such time, the child was living with . . . such stepfather or stepmother. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(4). (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The administrative Taw judge treated the term \u201cdeemed\u201d as the equivalent of conclusive presumption. The defendant contends that, under this presumption, proof of actual dependency of the stepchild on the insured is not necessary; in fact, a showing of non-dependency is not even permitted. Moreover, support furnished by the noncustodial natural parent is immaterial. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that such a construction causes the statute to run afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiff further contends that the statute creates only a rebut-table presumption and that evidence of actual non-dependency should be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">A survey of Supreme Court decisions dealing with similar provisions of the Social Security Act convinces this court that in \u00a7 402(d)(4) Congress meant to establish an objective test by which the dependency requirement of \u00a7 402(d)(1) is absolutely established upon proof that a stepchild was, for purposes of this case, living with the stepparent at the time of the latter\u2019s death. In particular, this court is guided to this conclusion by the recent cases of <em>Mathews v. Lucas, supra, </em>and <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). These cases leave no doubt as to the constitutionality of this statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">In <em>Mathews v. Lucas, </em>the Court was concerned with whether the child\u2019s insurance benefits provisions of \u00a7 402(d)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(3) regarding the treatment of certain illegitimate children are constitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court found that the Congressional desire for administrative convenience and economy was served \u201cby presuming dependency on the basis of relatively readily documented facts, such as legitimate birth, or existence of a support order or paternity decree, which could be relied on to indicate the likelihood of continued actual dependency . . . \u201d Congress was thus able \u201cto avoid the burden and expense of specific case-by-case determination in the large number of cases where dependency is objectively probable.\u201d 427 U.S. at 509, 96 S.Ct. at 2764. Notwithstanding its tendency to be overinclusive \u2014 by entitling to benefits some children who were not actually dependent \u2014 the statute was declared constitutional because it met the familiar rational relation test traditionally applied in equal protection analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201cSuch presumptions in aid of administrative functions, though they may approximate, rather than precisely mirror, the results that case-by-case adjudication would show, are permissible under the Fifth Amendment, so long as that lack of precise equivalence does not exceed the bounds of substantiality tolerated by the applicable level of scrutiny. <em>See Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 772, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2471, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>the constitutionality of the duration-of-relationship eligibility requirements for surviving wives and stepchildren of deceased wage earners, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(c)(5) and (e)(2) was before the Court. The district court had determined that these requirements were irrebuttable presumptions and as such were unconstitutional under the authority of <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. La Fleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974), <em>Vlandis </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973), and <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972). The Supreme Court reversed and held the statute constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Salfi </em>is instructive since the Court addressed two points which are central to plaintiff\u2019s argument: (1) the constitutionality of irrebuttable presumptions; and (2) the fact that the purpose of the Act is in some instances thwarted by the operation of the objective test. Plaintiff cites the same cases relied on by the district court in <em>Salfi </em>for the proposition that statutes creating conclusive presumptions are disfavored in the law and would be unconstitutional in the instant case. The <em>Salfi </em>Court specifically distinguished those cases, however, and this court is of the opinion that they are not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Taking plaintiff\u2019s argument at face value, it appears that if the Secretary is upheld in the instant case, a result will obtain which is contrary to the intent of the Act. If so, it is a direct inherent consequence of the imperfect operation of the objective test. It is a risk which the Court \u2014 if not the Congress \u2014 at least considered and found acceptable; the Court stated: \u201cWe also think that Congress could rationally have concluded that any imprecision from which [the duration-of-relationship requirement] might suffer was justified by its ease and certainty of operation.\u201d 422 U.S. at 780, 95 S.Ct. at 2474.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The Court\u2019s discussion in these cases of the statutory scheme of the Social Security Act in general and of the child\u2019s insurance benefits provisions in particular make it clear that in its use of the term \u201cdeemed\u201d the Congress intended that dependency would be conclusively established upon proof of the objective criteria \u2014 in the instant case, the fact that the stepchildren were living with their stepfather at his death. It follows that they were entitled to share in the child\u2019s insurance benefits based on his earnings and that the benefits of the natural children were properly reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">An appropriate order will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
