Petitioner was granted leave to file IFP. The district court conducted evidentiary hearings, and we agree with that court that hearings were required. Despite petitioner\u2019s request, counsel was not appointed for him, and he represented himself at the hearings. Under Rule 8, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254, the court was required to appoint counsel if petitioner qualified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(g). Rule 8 is applicable to cases commenced on or after February 11, 1977. <em>Browder v. Director, Department of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 265, 98 S.Ct. 556, 561, 54 L.Ed.2d 521, 532 n.9 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-22\">The judgment is REVERSED and the cause REMANDED for hearing with appointed counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
