The Board\u2019s decision affirmed a decision and order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) finding petitioner, The Home Indemnity Co., liable for death benefits under the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made applicable in the present case by the Defense Base Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, this court is without jurisdiction to review the present case and accordingly, the petition for review must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On December 9, 1970, Heyl &amp; Patterson International, Inc. (Heyl) entered into a contract with the United States Navy for the installation of an electrical power system at the United States Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The agreement contained a clause requiring Heyl to provide workmen\u2019s compensation for its employees as is required by the Defense Base Act and to contractually require any subcontractor to provide workmen\u2019s compensation insurance for its employees. Heyl provided coverage for its workers through the Travelers Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On May 11, 1971 Heyl entered into a subcontract with the Robert E. Lee Electric Company (Lee) for the completion of a portion of the work at Guantanamo Bay. The decedent, Jackie J. Stillwell, was an employee of Lee and assigned to work on the project at Guantanamo Bay. On July 25, 1973, Jackie J. Stillwell received a high voltage shock while working on the Guantanamo Bay project and died as a result thereof the following day. Lee secured workmen\u2019s compensation coverage through the petitioner, Home Indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The decedent\u2019s widow, respondent Barbara A. Stillwell, filed a timely claim for death benefits under the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act made applicable instantly by the Defense Base Act. Home Indemnity denied liability for the claim asserting that it did not provide Lee with insurance coverage for Guantanamo Bay. The matter was submitted to an ALJ for a formal hearing in accordance with 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(b). The ALJ found that Home Indemnity, through the representations of its authorized agent, did provide insurance coverage for Lee\u2019s work at Guantanamo Bay and that Home Indemnity was primarily liable for the payment of benefits to Mrs. Stillwell. The ALJ also found Travelers Insurance Co. secondarily liable for the benefits claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Home Indemnity and Travelers Insurance Co. appealed from the ALJ decision to the Benefits Review Board pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). The Board affirmed the decision of the ALJ finding Home Indemnity liable for the payment of benefits, but reversed the finding that Travelers Insurance Co. was secondarily liable for the benefits claim. Home Indemnity seeks review in this court of the Board\u2019s decision pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">From an exacting review of the jurisdictional statutes involved and the interrelationship of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act with the Defense Base Act, it becomes apparent we do not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">The Longshoremen\u2019s Act was enacted by Congress in 1927 for the purpose of insuring that every person engaged in maritime employment received workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. The Act provides that the employer is responsible for securing the payment of compensation payable under the Act to its employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1941 Congress enacted the Defense Base Act. The Defense Base Act makes applicable the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, with certain modifications, to a number of employment relationships, including work per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>formed upon the United States Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">One of the modifications of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act made by the Defense Base Act concerns judicial review of compensation orders. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(b) governs judicial review of compensation orders under the Defense Base Act and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfG\">Judicial proceedings provided under sections 18 and 21 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in respect to a compensation order made pursuant to this chapter <em>shall be instituted in the United States district court of the judicial district wherein is located the office of the deputy commissioner whose compensation order is involved if his office is located in a judicial district, </em>and if not so located, such judicial proceedings shall be instituted in the judicial district nearest the base at which the injury or death occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">The above statute is unambiguous and it clearly requires judicial proceedings to review a compensation order made pursuant to the Defense Base Act to be conducted in the United States district court of the judicial district where the office of the appropriate deputy commissioner is located. The Defense Base Act does not provide for direct review of compensation orders in the court of appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">Prior to 1972 judicial review of compensation orders under the Defense Base Act and the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was properly sought in the appropriate district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In 1972 Congress amended the Longshoremen\u2019s Act to its current form creating another level of administrative review, the Benefits Review Board,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and providing for direct review of the Board\u2019s decisions in the court of appeals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress did not, however, whether through legislative oversight or intent, amend the judicial review provisions of the Defense Base Act. Accordingly, we are bound to apply the current statutory scheme until Congress dictates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) as authority for the existence of jurisdiction in this court to review the instant petition is misplaced for two reasons. First, \u00a7 921(c) is the judicial review provision of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act and it is not applicable to the present claim brought under the auspices of the Defense Base Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(b) governs judicial review of Defense Base Act claims. Further, from a reading of the statute it becomes clear that \u00a7 921(c) is inapplicable to the case at bar. Section 921(c) provides that \u201cany person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain review of that order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred . . . Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not included in any judicial circuit. More particularly, for our purposes, Guantanamo Bay is not in the Sixth Circuit. Therefore, if we apply \u00a7 921(c) as the petitioner suggests, judicial review of the case in any forum may be foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Under the current statutory scheme the compensation order in the present case is reviewable in the appropriate United States district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(b). Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50.
