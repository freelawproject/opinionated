HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Douglas Earl Fossler appeals from his conviction on a two-count indictment charging him with the unlawful possession of a bomb not registered to him and not identified by a serial number in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5861(i). Following the jury\u2019s rendition of guilty verdicts on both counts, the District Court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Fossler on probation for a period of five years. Fossler presents three issues on appeal: (1) whether the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence under the \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine\u2019s rejection in <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960); (2) whether the District Court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment under the reasoning in <em>Petite v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 529, 80 S.Ct. 450, 4 L.Ed.2d 490 (1960), and <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 98 S.Ct. 81, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977); and (3) whether the District Court erred in delivering the <em>Allen </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge on two separate occasions when the jury indicated it could not reach a verdict. We find no merit in Fossler\u2019s first two arguments, but his <em>Allen </em>charge contention is persuasive. We therefore reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">The evidence shows that at approximately six o\u2019clock in the evening of May 30, 1976, an officer of the Kerrville, Texas, Police Department was notified by radio that there was a reckless driver in the 600 block of Lois Street. When the officer arrived at the 600 block of Lois Street, he saw Fossler leaning against his car, which was sitting in the front yard of a residence and was only a few inches away from a tree. A small girl had been up in the tree when Fossler ran his car onto the lawn and under the tree\u2019s boughs.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">The officer approached Fossler and asked him for his driver\u2019s license. The officer noticed that Fossler had difficulty trying to stand, had bloodshot eyes, and slurred his speech. When the officer asked Fossler if he had been drinking, Fossler replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The officer also talked to witnesses who said they had seen Fossler drive down the street very erratically, weave from side to side, and finally stop next to the tree. The officer came to the conclusion that Fossler was intoxicated and arrested him for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Shortly thereafter, another officer arrived to assist the arresting officer. The assisting officer was asked by a man who appeared to be the owner of the house if the car could be removed from the lawn. The assisting officer then asked Fossler whether he preferred that the car be towed to the police station or driven there by the officer. Fossler responded by giving the assisting officer the car keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The assisting officer opened the car door and looked under the front seat for open liquor or beer bottles that might spill en-route. When his brief search revealed a .22 caliber pistol under the driver\u2019s seat, he decided to drive the car to the station before taking an inventory of its contents pursuant to standing Police Department orders regarding impounded cars. As the officer drove the car to the station, he noticed an object, similar in size and shape to a softball, on the passenger side of the front seat. When the officer later inventoried the contents of the car, he discovered that the round object was a homemade bomb.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sphere was covered with masking tape and a piece of fuse was attached to it. The evidence presented at trial established that the homemade bomb was designed as a weapon with no legitimate lawful purpose. Although Fossler, who holds a graduate degree in biophysics, claimed that he made the bomb only to injure coyotes, he admitted that it was a dangerous device containing a blasting cap and could at least mutilate a person\u2019s hand. He also admitted that he told the police officer to drive his car, in which the bomb was found, to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In addition to the driving while intoxicated charge, Fossler was charged in the State District Court with possession of a destructive weapon. Fossler\u2019s motion to suppress evidence in the State proceeding was granted. The District Attorney thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was granted. Fossler was subsequently charged with the federal offenses alleged in the instant indictment. He filed a motion to suppress evidence and a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of <em>Petite v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 529, 80 S.Ct. 450, 4 L.Ed.2d 490 (1960), but both motions were denied. The trial and conviction which followed led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">In arguing that the District Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence, Fossler points out that the State Judge suppressed the evidence and concludes that he did so because Fossler\u2019s initial arrest by the state officer was unlawful and the subsequent search was therefore illegal. Thus, he argues, the rejection of the \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine in <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960), prohibits the use of the same excluded evidence in a subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">The holding of <em>Elkins v. United States </em>is not, however, wholly consistent with Fossler\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">[W]e hold that evidence obtained by state officers during a search which, if conducted by federal officers, would have violated the defendant\u2019s immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible over the defendant\u2019s timely objection in a federal criminal trial. In determining whether there has been an unreasonable search and seizure by state officers, a federal court must make an independent inquiry, whether or not there has been such an inquiry by a state court, and irrespective of how any such inquiry may have turned out. The test is one of federal law, neither enlarged by what one state court may have countenanced, nor diminished by what another may have colorably suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">364 U.S. at 223-24, 80 S.Ct. at 224 (footnote omitted). The District Court was thus correct in making an independent inquiry and determination regarding the suppression of evidence. <em>Accord, United States v. Garrett, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>565 F.2d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 974, 98 S.Ct. 1620, 56 L.Ed.2d 67 (1978), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Morgan v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 924, 98 S.Ct. 1487, 55 L.Ed.2d 517 (1978); <em>United States v. Bedford, </em>519 F.2d 650 (3d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 917, 96 S.Ct. 1120, 47 L.Ed.2d 323 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The District Court was correct as well in determining that, under Texas law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fossler\u2019s arrest was lawful. Fossler asserts that he could not have been properly arrested for driving while intoxicated because the officer did not see him driving, but rather found him leaning against his stopped car. Article 14.01(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure allows a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor, which driving while intoxicated is, only when the offense is committed in the arresting officer\u2019s presence or within his view. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has indicated, however, that an arrest for driving while intoxicated is not necessarily invalid merely because the arresting officer did not see the. defendant drive his car, since the defendant may still be subject to a public intoxication charge. <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>164 Tex.Cr.R. 321, 323, 298 S.W.2d 581, 582 (1957). The Fifth Circuit has recognized that where a defendant was arrested for the \u201cwrong\u201d offense, the arrest is nonetheless valid where the crime for which he was arrested and the crime for which there was probable cause to believe he had committed are closely related and there is no proof of sham or fraud. <em>Mills v. Wainwright, </em>415 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir. 1969). Hence, our inquiry focuses on whether there was probable cause to arrest Fossler for public intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Fossler contends that because he was in the front yard of a <em>private </em>residence when he was arrested, there was no probable cause then existing to arrest him for <em>public </em>intoxication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In view of his status as an uninvited stranger on the front lawn, his contention is unpersuasive. <em>See Pugh v. State, </em>55 Tex.Cr.R. 462, 117 S.W. 817 (1909). The Texas courts have traditionally held that a place may be a public one or not according to the circumstances. <em>See Clinton v. State, </em>64 Tex.Cr.R. 446, 142 S.W. 591 (1912). To hold that there was no probable cause to arrest Fossler for public intoxication merely because he had moments before driven his car from the public street up onto a stranger\u2019s lawn would be unreasonable, and we decline to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Having determined that Fossler\u2019s arrest was valid, we turn now to the lawfulness of the discovery of the homemade bomb in his car. Fossler\u2019s car was legitimately impounded and subsequently subjected to a routine inventory search. Indeed, there is every indication that Fossler chose to have his car driven to the police station by the police officer and that he willingly handed the keys to the officer for that purpose. The evidence discovered in the course of the inventory of the car is admissible against Fossler under <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). Moreover, the officer who conducted the inventory was rightfully in position to observe the homemade bomb in plain view on the front seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of the car as he examined the object in order to classify it for the inventory listing. The bomb was thus properly seized and admitted into evidence against Fossler under the plain view doctrine as well. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>565 F.2d 917, 921-22 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Fossler next contends that the District Court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment under the reasoning in <em>Petite v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 529, 80 S.Ct. 450, 4 L.Ed.2d 490 (1960), and <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 98 S.Ct. 81, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977). The situation this Circuit was confronted with in <em>United States v. Nelligan, </em>573 F.2d 251 (5th Cir. 1978), is very close to that found in the instant case. Fossler urges, as did Nelligan, application of the Department of Justice\u2019s <em>Petite </em>policy, but Fossler\u2019s federal prosecution and conviction followed an abortive state prosecution for the same unlawful conduct, as did Nelligan\u2019s. In neither case did the Government seek leave to implement the policy. On the basis of our reasoning and holding in <em>Nelligan, </em>rejecting Nelligan\u2019s <em>Petite </em>policy claim, we conclude that Fossler\u2019s <em>Petite </em>policy argument is groundless. <em>See United States v. Nelligan, </em>573 F.2d at 254-55. <em>Accord, United States v. Frederick, </em>583 F.2d 273, 274 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Musgrove, </em>581 F.2d 406, 407 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Fritz, </em>580 F.2d 370, 374-75 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 99 S.Ct. 340, 58 L.Ed.2d 338 (1978); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>579 F.2d 1184 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 257, 58 L.Ed.2d 243 (1978); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>578 F.2d 735, 739-40 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 263, 58 L.Ed.2d 246 (1978); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>574 F.2d 1359, 1360-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed.2d 425 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Fossler finally contends, and we agree, that the District Court abused its discretion in delivering the <em>Allen </em>charge on two separate occasions when the jury indicated it could not reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">The jury retired at about 12:00 noon on Friday. At 5:10 P.M., the jury foreman sent a note to the trial judge telling him that the jury could not reach a unanimous decision. The judge then gave an <em>Allen </em>charge orally with no objection by Fossler. At 9:55 P.M., the jury foreman again sent word to the judge, telling him that the jury could not reach a verdict. The trial judge, without objection by either party, then sent the jury home for the weekend. On Monday, at 9:30 A.M., court reconvened and the trial judge gave the jury the full written charge minus the <em>Allen </em>charge. At 2:25 P.M., the jury foreman for a third time sent word to the judge that the jury could not agree to a verdict. The judge then, over the objection of Fossler, sent the jury a written copy of the <em>Allen </em>charge he had previously given orally. A verdict of guilty was returned about an hour later.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-19\">In <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>480 F.2d 518 (1973), the Fifth Circuit, <em>en banc, </em>approved the <em>Allen </em>charge within the limitations established by previous decisions. The District Court\u2019s delivery of the <em>Allen </em>charge, as first given, was within the acceptable bounds set by this Circuit\u2019s decisions. The <em>Allen </em>charge given by the District Court, reproduced below,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is virtually identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the charge approved in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>468 F.2d 652, 657 n. 5, <em>aff\u2019d on rehearing en banc, </em>480 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1973). The District Court carefully and commendably heeded our observation in <em>United States v. Foshee, </em>569 F.2d 401, 406 (5th Cir. 1978), \u201cthat risk of reversal is always great when a judge varies one jot or tittle from the standard <em>Allen </em>charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Unfortunately, however, there was no Fifth Circuit authority on point when the District Court later had to determine the prudence of repeating the <em>Allen </em>charge after the jury sent word to him a second and a third time that a verdict could not be reached. No Fifth Circuit case to date has dealt with the propriety of twice giving a traditional <em>Allen </em>charge over the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In three other circuits that have considered the question of giving the <em>Allen </em>charge twice, the circumstances have been different from those we are confronted with in this case. In <em>United States v. Kahaner, </em>317 F.2d 459, 483-85 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 836, 84 S.Ct. 74, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963), and <em>White v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 740, 750 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 850, 81 S.Ct. 96, 5 L.Ed.2d 74 (1960), the Second and Fourth Circuits upheld the use of two <em>Allen </em>charges, but they specifically relied on the fact that the jury had requested that the instruction be repeated. Recently, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>560 F.2d 507, 517-18 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 1451, 55 L.Ed.2d 496 (1978), the Second Circuit again affirmed a conviction which had been obtained following a second <em>\u201cAllen </em>-type\u201d charge. Although they noted that the chances of coercion may increase with each successive appeal by the court to the jurors to try to reach a verdict, the Court was unwilling to hold that a second <em>Allen </em>-type charge is error <em>per se. </em>Instead, they opted for requiring a case-by-case determination of coercion. Applying that principle in <em>Robinson, </em>the Court focused on three factors in concluding that the effect of the second charge was minimal: (1) appellant\u2019s counsel failed to object; (2) the second charge was brief and mild in nature; and (3) the jury deliberated for three hours between the <em>Allen </em>-type charges and for more than four hours after the second such charge before reaching its verdict. The same \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, based on the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>preme Court\u2019s language in <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965), was employed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>536 F.2d 1287, 1289-92 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 981, 97 S.Ct. 494, 50 L.Ed.2d 590 (1976), in upholding the use of two \u201cbalanced\u201d <em>Allen </em>charges. In <em>Marsh, </em>however, defense counsel did not object when either of the <em>Allen </em>charges was given, and when counsel did move for a mistrial on the basis of the jury instructions, the <em>Allen </em>charges went unmentioned. 536 F.2d at 1291, 1292. Also, <em>Marsh </em>involved a habeas corpus proceeding, and thus the only question that was before the Court was the constitutionality of the <em>Allen </em>charges. These two distinctions were noted by the Ninth Circuit in a subsequent decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seawell, </em>550 F.2d 1159, 1163 n. 9 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.--, 99 S.Ct. 591, 58 L.Ed.2d 666 (1978). In <em>Seawell, </em>the Court was faced with a direct criminal appeal from a conviction obtained after an <em>Allen </em>charge had been repeated. The jury had not requested a repetition of the instruction and defense counsel had made timely objections. The Court elected, on the basis of their supervisory powers, to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule, \u201cconclud[ing] that as a sound rule of practice it is reversible error to repeat an <em>Allen </em>charge in a federal prosecution in [the Ninth] circuit after a jury has reported itself deadlocked and has not itself requested a repetition of the instruction.\u201d 550 F.2d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We do not elect to adopt such a <em>per se </em>rule. We opt instead to continue the practice of assessing the impact of the judge\u2019s statements in light of his language and the facts and circumstances which formed their context, just as we have previously done in evaluating the effect of a single <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>See Government of Canal Zone v. Fears, </em>528 F.2d 641, 642 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>citing Jenkins v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">We hold that, under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test, the District Court\u2019s repetition of the <em>Allen </em>charge at Fossler\u2019s trial coerced a verdict from the jury. The jury indicated at three separate points in time, over a three day period, that it could not reach a decision. Defense counsel objected to the District Court\u2019s giving the isolated, written second <em>Allen </em>charge to the jury. Only one hour after the second <em>Allen </em>charge was sent to the jury, a guilty verdict was returned. In light of these circumstances, we must reverse Fossler\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-18\">. <em>Allen v.

We recognized in that case that appellant Cook criticized three <em>\u201cAllen </em>-type\u201d charges to the jury, but we explicitly pointed out in our discussion that only one was properly delineated an <em>Allen </em>charge. Furthermore, there was no objection by Cook to any of the three charges, and the single <em>Allen </em>charge was found to have been mild and balanced. 586 F.2d at 576-78. Our decision in <em>Cook, </em>affirming that appellant\u2019s conviction, is thus inapposite to the question with which we are now confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Our decision in <em>Government of Canal Zone v. Fears, </em>528 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1976), is similarly inapplicable, for there also the appellant failed to object at trial to any of the three questioned sets of remarks made by the judge to the jury, only one of which qualified as a full <em>Allen </em>charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
