The denial of Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence presents the principal question on appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-23\">On February 7, 1978, at approximately 10:45 a.m., Portland Police Officers Charles Ault and Henry Dunn stopped a car that Thompson was driving in a residential area of northeast Portland. The vehicle had a broken taillight lens, was traveling at a speed which slightly exceeded the \u201creasonable and safe\u201d speed for that area, and had rolled through a stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-24\">The officers asked the driver for his driver\u2019s license. Thompson responded that he did not have it with him. Ault then asked Thompson for anything that had his name on it. Thompson produced on envelope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>bearing the name Hewey Thompson and an address. Ault then asked Thompson to step out of his car and come to the police car so that a radio check could be run on his driver\u2019s license. This was stated to be standard police procedure; the officers testified that their standard procedure also requires a pat-down search for weapons of anyone about to be placed in a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Ault told Thompson to put his hands on top of the patrol car so that a pat-down search for weapons could be conducted. During the pat-down, Ault said, Thompson removed his left hand from the police car three or four times and attempted to reach for his inside coat pocket \u201cas if [he were] going for something\u201d. Ault testified that he could not determine what it was that Thompson was reaching for. Thompson was wearing a long, bulky overcoat. Ault testified that \u201c[j]ust to pat it you couldn\u2019t feel sufficiently to find anything out.\u201d The officers warned Thompson that if he did not stop trying to reach for his inside coat pocket, they would have to handcuff him. Despite this warning, Ault testified, Thompson again attempted to reach for his inside coat pocket whereupon the officers handcuffed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Ault next reached into the coat pocket that Thompson had been attempting to reach. The officer pulled out an envelope, open at the top. Ault could see that the envelope contained checks, although he could not see the names on any of the checks. At this point, Ault admitted, he was not concerned that the envelope might</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">contain a weapon. Without asking Thompson\u2019s permission or inquiring whether the contents would help confirm Thompson\u2019s identity, however, Ault removed the checks from the envelope and examined them. Observing a name that had been mentioned in a recent stolen-property report, Ault arrested Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Thompson was indicted for possession of checks stolen from the mail. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Thompson moved to suppress the checks found in the envelope. The motion was followed by a hearing at which both officers testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Although he denied the motion, the trial judge suggested that <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, may have required Ault to return the envelope unopened to Thompson\u2019s pocket once he determined it did not contain a weapon. The judge\u2019s concern was correct. <em>Terry </em>does not permit a search into the envelope on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">We examine four possible intrusions into rights protected by the Fourth Amendment: the stop, the pat-down search, the removal of the envelope from the coat pocket, and the inspection of the envelope\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">1. <em>The stop. </em>Ault and Dunn said they observed Thompson commit three traffic infractions: operating a motor vehicle with a broken taillight lens;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> driving a motor vehicle in excess of the basic speed rule; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and rolling through a stop sign.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>three violations are Class B traffic infractions under Oregon law. Having witnessed these violations, the officers were justified in detaining Thompson and his vehicle under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">2. <em>The pat-down search. </em>Thompson\u2019s inability to produce a valid driver\u2019s license upon request indicated that he was driving without a license in his possession, and that he may also have been driving without a license having been issued to him. Either default is a violation of Oregon law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thompson\u2019s inability to produce adequate identification justified the request that he get out of his car and sit in the police car while a standard police identification process took place. Under the circumstances, the actions of the officers, including the pat-down, were also reasonable under <em>Terry. See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977); <em>United States v. Madril, </em>445 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>404 U.S. 1010, 92 S.Ct. 692, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">During the pat-down, Thompson repeatedly attempted to reach for his inside coat pocket, despite the officers\u2019 repeated warnings not to. On these facts, we believe the handcuffing was also justified as a reasonable implementation of police duty under <em>Terry </em>and <em>Mimms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">3. <em>The search of the pocket. </em>Had Thompson been lawfully arrested, the intrusion into his pocket and the removal of the envelope might have been justified as a search incident to the custodial arrest. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Ault admitted, however, that Thompson was not under arrest when Ault reached into his pocket.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Oregon law, in order to arrest a driver for a Class B traffic infraction, an officer must be able to point to specific articulable facts justifying his or her decision to lodge the person in jail rather than giving the person a traffic citation. See <em>State v. Tucker, </em>34 Or.App. 203, 209-10, 578 P.2d 803, 807 (1978); <em>State v. Carter, </em>34 Or.App. 21, 32, 578 P.2d 790, 796 (1978) (en banc).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Ault\u2019s testimony on cross-examination reveals, he did not fulfill this requirement. Thus, Thompson was not under arrest for a violation of state law when Ault reached into his pocket. He could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>have been under arrest for possession of the stolen checks at this point, either. The officers had no logical basis to believe he had committed that crime. Because the defendant was not under arrest at the time of the search, the propriety or impropriety of removing the envelope must be judged, not under <em>Robinson, </em>but under <em>Terry</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In <em>United States v. Hill, </em>545 F.2d 1191, 1193 (9th Cir. 1976), this court held that <em>Terry </em>does not limit a weapons search to a pat-down. Any reasonably limited intrusion designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other instruments of assault is permissible. Ault\u2019s reaching into the defendant\u2019s coat pocket to determine whether he was carrying a weapon constituted such a limited intrusion; it did not transgress the limitations of the Fourth Amendment. Thompson\u2019s repeated efforts to reach into his pocket despite the officers\u2019 warnings not to, coupled with Ault\u2019s inability to determine from a pat-down whether the pocket of the bulky coat contained a weapon, justified the probe of the pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">4. <em>The examination of the envelope. </em>The examination of the contents of the envelope, on the other hand, violated Thompson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Once Ault had felt the envelope and removed it from the coat pocket, he had no concern that it might contain a weapon. He admitted he was merely \u201csuspicious\u201d about the envelope. In fact, the government\u2019s brief concedes that \u201c[o]nce the envelope was removed from defendant\u2019s coat pocket, it was ascertained that it did not contain any weapons.\u201d Thus, Ault\u2019s opening of the envelope and examination of its contents was not \u201can intrusion reasonably designed to discover instruments of assault\u201d as required by <em>Terry. United States v. Hill, </em>545 F.2d 1191, 1193 (9th Cir. 1976); cf. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 255\u201459, 94 S.Ct. 467 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Supreme Court has held \u201cthat a search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 17-18, 88 S.Ct. at 1878 (citing earlier decisions). While Ault\u2019s \u201cfrisk\u201d of Thompson for weapons was constitutionally valid at its inception, the officer\u2019s intrusion into the envelope transgressed the limits of a <em>Terry </em>search. <em>See Tinney v. Wilson, </em>408 F.2d 912, 915-17 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">In its brief, the government argues that the intrusion into the envelope was reasonable as a \u201cbrief identity search\u201d, relying on <em>United States v. Sedillo, </em>496 F.2d 151 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 947, 95 S.Ct. 211, 42 L.Ed.2d 168 (1974). A close reading of <em>Sedillo </em>indicates that the intrusion involved in that case was justified under the plain view doctrine and not on the theory of a \u201cbrief identity search\u201d, a justification in which we find no merit. The officers here had already been given a name and address by Thompson, and Ault admitted that their planned check with state motor vehicles would have verified this information. Moreover, the officers had nothing but an unfounded hunch that whatever they might find in the envelope would help prove or disprove the data Thompson gave them. In short, without reaching the question whether an \u201cidentity search\u201d could ever be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, we hold that the search of the envelope under the circumstances was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Ault\u2019s discovery of the stolen checks in Thompson\u2019s envelope did not follow a lawful arrest, and resulted from an unconstitutional extension of a \u201cfrisk\u201d for weapons. We conclude, therefore, that the search violated the constitutional rights of the defendant and that his motion to suppress the checks as fruits of an unconstitutional search and seizure should have been granted. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">.
