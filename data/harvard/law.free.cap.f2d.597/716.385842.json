Prior to July 1975, each of them received as compensation an amount, which when added to his retirement pay, equaled the pay and allowance he would have received had he been on active duty; this amount included a Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ). In addition, each was furnished Government housing at no expense, or if none was available, was paid a Living Quarters Allowance (LQA).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">On July 3, 1975 (55 Comp.Gen. 44), the Comptroller General issued a decision holding that under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d), plaintiffs were not entitled to' receive the Basic Allowance for Quarters if they were occupying rent-free Government-furnished quarters. As a result of that decision, the DOD stopped the inclusion of BAQ or LQA in the compensation received by the junior ROTC instructors occupying Government housing. Also, the Department discontinued the payment of a combination of LQA and BAQ paid to those plaintiffs who were not assigned to Government housing \u2014 thereafter they received only BAQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">In this suit, plaintiffs seek recovery of the additional allowances which they had received prior to the decision of the Comptroller General. The parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment present only questions of law, and since we have concluded that the Comptroller General\u2019s decision is a correct interpretation of the applicable statute&gt; we hold that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">The statutory authority under which plaintiffs were employed as junior ROTC instructors, is contained in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031 (1970) and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-14\">\u00a7 2031. <em>Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-15\">sfc * <em>* </em>* 5k *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-16\">(c) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall, to support the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps program\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-17\">(1) detail officers and noncommissioned officers of an armed force under his jurisdiction to institutions having units of the Corps as administrators and instructors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-18\">sfc sk sfs s{: sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-19\">(d) Instead of, or in addition to, detailing officers and noncommissioned officers on active duty under subsection (c)(1), the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize qualified institutions to employ, as administrators and instructors in the program, retired officers and noncommissioned officers * * whose qualifications are approved by the Secretary and the institution concerned and who request such employment, subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-20\">(1) Retired members so employed are entitled to receive their retired or retainer pay and an additional amount of <em>not more than </em>the difference between their retired pay and the active duty pay and allowances which they would receive if ordered to active duty, and one-half of that additional amount shall be paid to the institution concerned by the Secretary of the military department concerned from funds appropriated for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such a retired member is not, while so employed, considered to be on active duty or inactive duty training for any purpose. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">As shown, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d)(1) expressly prescribes a limitation on the amount of compensation which such instructors may be paid. The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. To prevail, plaintiffs must show that if they had been called to active duty, they would have been entitled to BAQ and at the same time to free Government housing. The conditions under which the payment of BAQ to active-duty personnel is made are set forth in 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 (1970). That section specifically provides that where a member of the uniformed services is assigned to quarters appropriate to his grade, rank or rating, and adequate for himself and his dependents, he is not entitled to a Basic Allowance for Quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention, that when not assigned to free quarters, they are entitled to both BAQ and LQA, is likewise contrary to the language of the statute. LQA is the civilian counterpart to BAQ, and is provided to reimburse Federal civilian employees serving overseas for housing costs when not assigned to Government quarters. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923(2). In essence, plaintiffs maintain they were entitled to a double housing allowance \u2014 the allowance provided for military personnel, as well as a similar allowance provided for civilian Government employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Generally, the language of the statute is the best indication of the legislative intent. Congress often expresses its purpose in the customary meaning of the language employed. When the requirements of a statute are detailed and specific, as they are in this case, they must be applied with precision. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gordon, </em>391 U.S. 83, 91, 92, 88 S.Ct. 1517, 20 L.Ed.2d 448 (1968). Here, the limitation on the amount of allowances which plaintiffs were entitled to receive is couched in emphatic, mandatory language. In the face of such clarity, we cannot understand plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the statute does not set a ceiling on the allowances to which they were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Normally, in a situation where the governing statute is as clear and explicit as it is here, there is no occasion to resort to the legislative history. However, plaintiffs have advanced an argument based on the provisions of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923, both relating to allowances in lieu of free public housing for civilian teachers and other civilian employees working abroad. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">(a) Under regulations which shall be prescribed by or under authority of the President, each teacher (other than a teacher employed in a substitute capacity) shall be entitled, in addition to basic compensation, to quarters, quarters allowance, and storage as provided by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">(b) Each teacher (other than a teacher employed in a substitute capacity) shall be entitled, for each school year for which he performs services as a teacher, to quarters <em>or </em>a quarters allowance equal to those authorized by the Act of June 26, 1930. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-13\">When Government owned or rented quarters are not provided without charge for an employee in a foreign area, one or more of the following quarters allowances may be granted when applicable: ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-14\">(2) A living quarters allowance for rent, heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity, and water, without regard to section 529 of title 31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">Plaintiffs contend that when Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d), dealing specifically with them, Congress did not intend to alter the provisions regarding the allowances provided for in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923. From this it follows, they say, that in addition to the pay and BAQ provided by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d), they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>entitled to receive the allowances, either LQA or free Government housing, provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923 or 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The pertinent legislative history of Pub.L. 88-647, now codified as 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d), is contained in the following extract from the Comptroller General\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">The phrase \u201cactive duty pay and allowances\u201d is neither defined in the l\u00e1w nor in the legislative history of that law. However, it is noted that the prior history of the program and the proposed legislative changes in the program which were introduced between 1950 and the introduction of H.R. 9124 in 1963 (which eventually became Public Law 88-647), reference was continually being made to the detailing of active duty personnel to the various educational institutions where JROTC units were maintained. While section 2031(c) carries forward this concept, the legislative history of H.R. 9124, indicates that considerable opposition to a continuation of a JROTC program existed. One of the objections apparently raised was the cost of the program in terms of the active duty personnel who were to be detailed as administrators and instructors. It appears that in response to such objections, the language presently contained in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d)(1) was introduced and in H.Rep.No. 925, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 (1963), the following explanation appears:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">* * * The committee was of the opinion that the military departments should be permitted to utilize retired personnel * * * so as to minimize the drain of these programs on their active duty military personnel and also reduce the budgetary implications of these programs. Retired military personnel receive between 50 to 75 percent of their basic pay while on the retired rolls. The Government receives no particular benefit from this payment. Therefore, the committee believes that many retired officers would be desirous of volunteering for duty in connection with the ROTC program and, thus, permit the military departments to operate these programs with such retired personnel with consequent savings in both dollars and manpower. [55 Comp. Gen. at 47].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">As indicated, the House Report reflects the desire of the military to utilize retired personnel in lieu of active-duty personnel, not only to reduce costs, but to relieve the drain on active-duty personnel. The report also shows the desire of Congress to utilize retired military personnel in order that the Government might derive some benefit from the retired pay received by these individuals. All of this reinforces the interpretation that the statute imposes a limitation on the allowances which the junior ROTC instructors are entitled to receive. Plaintiffs have cited no legislative history, nor have we found any, which supports their contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next argument is based upon Army Regulation AR 145-2, par. 6-37, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-14\">6-37. Deductions from instructors\u2019 wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-15\">The wages received by instructors are subject to the same deductions as all other wages in which an employer-employee relationship exists. Deductions for taxes, insurance, dues, fees, etc., are the responsibility of the school. Although an instructor may receive an amount \u201cequal\u201d to the military pay and allowances he would receive if on active duty, the payments he receives are not, in fact, military pay and allowances paid by the Army.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">According to plaintiffs, this regulation demonstrates that the Department of the Army considered the additional amounts received by the ROTC instructors to be \u201cwages\u201d and not \u201callowances.\u201d The use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d between \u201cmilitary pay\u201d and \u201callowances\u201d defeats plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the compensation they received did not consist in any part of allowances. In any event, the regulation does not aid plaintiffs\u2019 case, because it is nothing more than a paraphrase of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d)(2), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>states that the junior ROTC instructors employed under the statute are not \u201cwhile so employed, considered to be on active duty or inactive duty training for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXo-\">In furtherance of their argument that the statute merely provides a formula for establishing wages and not allowances, plaintiffs rely on a letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 2, 1969, which stated that BAQ payments pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d)(1) cannot be excluded from gross income under Treas. Reg. sec. 1.61-2(b), but must be included in gross income. The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\">* * * Subsistence and uniform allowances granted commissioned officers, chief warrant officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces * * * and amounts received by them as commutation of quarters, are to be excluded from gross income. Similarly, the value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is to be excluded from gross income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The Internal Revenue Service letter is nothing more than a recognition that the retired ROTC instructors referred to in the letter were not actually on active duty and therefore, were not entitled to the exclusion which the regulation allows to active duty military personnel. The letter does not state that the BAQ payments received by the retired ROTC instructors were \u201cwages\u201d rather than \u201callowances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Plaintiffs also invoke the doctrine of estoppel against the Government as a basis for recovery. They contend that the defendant supplied them with literature which indicated that they would receive the additional compensation here claimed, and that the actions and conduct of Government officials prior to the time the Comptroller General issued his decision, estop the Government from denying plaintiffs the additional allowances they are seeking in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">We have carefully examined the documents upon which plaintiffs rely and have found nothing which states that the plaintiffs would be entitled to receive BAQ plus rent-free housing or an additional LQA. One of the documents relied on by plaintiffs is a letter of October 29, 1973, addressed to plaintiff, Joseph N. Brant, by the Chief, Dependent\u2019s Schools Teachers, Recruitment Branch. The letter states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">Housing will be furnished by the Government at Government expense or you will receive living quarters allowance which usually covers expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">Another document relied on by the plaintiffs states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">6. Department of the Army approved retired instructors will be paid by the school in the amount which, when added to their retired pay, will equal the amount of their active duty pay and allowances exclusive of hazardous duty pay. \u201cActive duty pay and allowances\u201d means the current pay and allowances authorized for the rank or grade of the individual if he were called to active duty in his current rank or grade. \u201cAllowances\u201d include quarters and subsistence allowances for all individuals so employed and uniform maintenance allowance for retired enlisted personnel. Station housing and cost of living allowances may be included if such allowances would be paid to active duty personnel on duty at that institution. Special and incentive pays are excluded. Schools may pay retired instructors more than the amount specified above. The schools are responsible for determining the exact amount to be paid and for adjusting instructor\u2019s pay if legislation is passed changing retired or active duty pay. The wages received by retired instructors are subject to the same deductions as all other wages and are not considered military pay and allowances as paid by the Army.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">However, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the defendant had represented to the plaintiffs that they would receive LQA or free housing in addition to the BAQ, such representations would have been contrary to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d). Notwithstanding such statements, nor the fact that the defendant erroneously paid plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>additional allowances prior to the Comptroller General\u2019s ruling of 1975, plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, because of the now well established doctrine that the Government cannot be estopped by statements or actions of its agents from enforcing a law passed by Congress. <em>Montilla v. United States, </em>457 F.2d 978, 198 Ct.Cl. 48, 63-64 (1972); <em>Parker v. United States, </em>461 F.2d 806, 809, 198 Ct.Cl. 661, 667 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In <em>Parker, </em>where the plaintiff had much stronger grounds for asserting estoppel against the Government, we declared that \u201cno official of the Navy [has] the authority to nullify or contradict the mandate of a statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that their Fifth Amendment rights of due process have been violated in that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(d) has been applied to preclude their receipt of LQA or free housing in addition to BAQ. All civilian Federal employees living in foreign areas receive quarters, or allowance in lieu of quarters, in addition to the pay they would normally receive in the United States. Plaintiffs contend that the Comptroller General\u2019s decision unfairly discriminates against them, because the junior ROTC instructors receive only the same pay as their counterparts in the United States and are not provided the additional allowances given to civilian Federal employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923 and 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 for foreign service.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">We reject this argument, because there is no factual basis for plaintiffs\u2019 contention that there is discrimination between the allowances paid to civilian employees and to junior ROTC instructors. As previously noted, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5923 and 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 905 provide that civilian teachers and other Federal employees are entitled to either free quarters or an allowance for quarters (LQA) when serving abroad. It is undisputed that the retired military personnel hired as junior ROTC instructors also receive either rent-free quarters or an allowance for quarters during the period of their employment. Defendant informs us that the only difference between the two systems is that the military junior ROTC instructors receive a BAQ as their housing allowance, while civilian teachers receive an allowance designated as LQA. There may be some difference in the actual amount of money received, but plaintiffs\u2019 due process argument is not pitched on this difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether plaintiffs have discharged the difficult burden of showing a denial of due process under the standards laid down by the Supreme Court and this court. <em>See Puglisi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>564 F.2d 403, 215 Ct.Cl. 86 (1977), <em>cert. denied </em>435 U.S. 968, 98 S.Ct. 1606, 56 L.Ed.2d 59 (1978); <em>Bruinooge v. United States, </em>550 F.2d 624, 213 Ct.Cl. 26 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">In accordance with the foregoing opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted. Judgment is entered pursuant to Rule 102(d) that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover as a matter of law. However, in view of defendant\u2019s first counterclaim (asserted in its answer filed April 18, 1977), entry of judgment dismissing the petition will be deferred pending the disposition of the counterclaim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is hereby remanded to the Trial Division for trial or other resolution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\">. Defendant\u2019s second and third counterclaims against plaintiff Joseph N. Brant were voluntarily dismissed by defendant on March 23, 1979. J</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
