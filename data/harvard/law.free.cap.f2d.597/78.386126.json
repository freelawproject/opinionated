The court also concludes there is no substantial evidence to support a finding that such railings would be feasible under the conditions shown to have existed at the job site where the citation was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Accordingly, petition for review is granted and the decision of the Commission is vacated. <em>Power Plant Division v. OSHRC, </em>590 F.2d 1363 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Diamond Roofing Co., Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>528 F.2d 645 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
