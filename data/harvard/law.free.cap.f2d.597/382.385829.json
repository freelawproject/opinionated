(Bank), executor of Ethel S. Brice (Brice), to recover federal estate taxes. The district court held a power of appointment given to Brice was part of the estate, though Brice was at all times incompetent to exercise the power. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Brice was the donee of a general power of appointment over a trust established by her husband\u2019s will. From a time prior to the grant of the power until she died, she lacked legal capacity to exercise that power. Brice\u2019s will stated an intention not to exercise the power. Brice\u2019s heirs contested her will, and the Bank settled by paying a total of $75,000 to five will contestants.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The Bank seeks to exclude from Brice\u2019s gross estate the value of the trust, to deduct the settlement amount, and to recover a resulting refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The dispositive issues are (1) whether Brice\u2019s estate, for federal estate tax purposes, includes the value of the trust when she was at all material times legally incompetent to exercise the power of appointment, and (2) whether the payment made in settlement was a deductible administration expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Having considered the entire record, and heard oral argument, we agree with the judgment and well-reasoned opinion of Judge Marsh, reported at 451 F.Supp. 1296. Seeing no value in recasting that opinion in words of our selection, we adopt as our own its relevant portions, adding for completeness these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">(1) POWER OF APPOINTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Whether the cases relied on by the Bank, <em>Finley v. United States, </em>404 F.Supp. 200 (S.D.Fla.1975), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 78-1066 (5th Cir. Jan. 3, 1978) and <em>Estate of Gilchrist v. Commissioner, </em>69 T.C. 5 (1977), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 78-2400 (5th Cir. June 20, 1978),<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> are significantly distinguishable on their facts, they are without binding effect here. Moreover, they were in our view wrongly decided and should not be followed in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-18\">The Bank\u2019s attacks on the cases referred to by the district court are without merit. That the donee in <em>Fish v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 1278 (9th Cir. 1970) was competent for a period prior to death is irrelevant. I.R.C. \u00a7 2041(a)(2) makes the instant of death the critical time for ascertaining possession of a taxable power of appointment. In <em>Round </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>332 F.2d 590 (1st Cir. 1964), the trust instrument terminated decedent\u2019s power upon his permanent incapacity, unlike the present instrument granting Brice an unrestricted power. Although the inability of the decedent in <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Noel, </em>380 U.S. 678, 85 S.Ct. 1238, 14 L.Ed.2d 159 (1965), was due to particular circumstances other than an absence of legal capacity, that distinction provides no basis for reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">In essence, the Bank\u2019s case founders on the shoals of the district court\u2019s statutory interpretation, with which we concur, <em>i. </em>e., that \u201cexercisable\u201d in I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 refers to the scope of the power set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>granting instrument, not to the donee\u2019s actual capacity to exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The Bank\u2019s reliance on authorities not cited below is misplaced. <em>Estate of Minot v. </em>Commissioner, 45 T.C. 578 (1966) concerned a power created prior to October 21, 1942, and governed by I.R.C. \u00a7 2041(a)(1), unlike the present power, governed by I.R.C. \u00a7 2041(a)(2) and included in the gross estate whether or not exercised. <em>Estate of Stockdick v. Phinney, </em>16 A.F.T.R.2d 6202 (S.D.Tex. June 14, 1965), holding that an incompetent surviving spouse cannot possess an \u201cexercisable\u201d power to qualify the interest for the marital deduction, is at odds with Treasury rulings consistently holding the mental capacity of a surviving spouse irrelevant. Rev.Rul. 75-350, 1975-2 C.B. 367; Rev.Rul. 55-518, 1955-2 C.B. 384. Moreover, in the authority relied on for the holding in <em>Stockdick, Starrett v. Commissioner, </em>223 F.2d 163 (1st Cir. 1955), the trust instrument provided that the donee would lose certain rights upon becoming incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Final Treasury Regulation \u00a7 20.2041-3(b) (1958) omitted this sentence from the October 1956 proposed regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">A power of appointment is considered to exist on the date of the decedent\u2019s death even though the decedent was at death and at all times since the creation of the power, under physical, mental or legal disability (whether or not adjudged incompetent).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Bank says the omission reflected Treasury\u2019s determination that the sentence was contrary to congressional intent. However, the Internal Revenue Service memo relied on by the Bank expressly says the sentence was \u201cconsistent with a published Revenue ruling [Rev.Rul. 55-518, <em>supra].\u201d </em>Treasury\u2019s proposed regulations encompassed gift and estate taxes. Its proposal respecting gift taxes made competency relevant. The omitted sentence would have inconsistently made competency irrelevant with respect to estate taxes. Though present Treasury regulations respecting estate taxes are silent on the question of competency, the \u201cinconsistency\u201d has been resolved against the Bank\u2019s position. Treasury\u2019s gift tax regulation, \u00a7 25.2503-4, promulgated November 15, 1958, and applicable to gifts made during 1955 and subsequent years, T.D. 6334, 23 Fed.Reg. 8904 (1958), provides that if a \u201cminor is given a power of appointment . . . the fact that under the local law a minor is under a disability to exercise\u201d the power \u201cdoes not cause the transfer to fail to satisfy the conditions of section 2503(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">(2) ADMINISTRATION EXPENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The Bank says the settlement payment is deductible because it preserved the estate against higher costs of a \u201cnuisance\u201d suit and constituted only 4% of the estate. But the statutes and regulations permit deduction for claims based on personal obligations of the decedent, I.R.C. \u00a7 2053; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 20.2053-4 (1958), not for payment to an heir claiming as such. The status of the claimant is the determinative factor, not whether the claim is meritorious or whether the amount paid be a large or small percentage of the estate. Employment of the latter considerations as tests of deductibility would be administratively unworkable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b447-15\"> The tax court follows the court to which appeal lies. <em>Golsen v. Commissioner, </em>54 T.C. 742 (1970). <em>Estate of Reid v. Commissioner, </em>71 T.C. No. 74 (Feb. 15, 1979), relied on by the Bank, is, like <em>Finley, supra, </em>and <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>appealable to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In <em>Estate of Alperstein v. Commissioner, </em>71 T.C. No. 32 (Dec. 6, 1978), from which appeal lies to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the existence of a power is held independent of the donee\u2019s capacity to exercise it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
