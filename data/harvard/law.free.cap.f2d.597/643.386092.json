The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief and Tyler timely appealed. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Defendants are Claude Woodson, allegedly the Chief Social Worker at the St. Louis County Jail, and St. Louis County. We agree with the District Court that the complaint fails to state a claim against defendant St. Louis County. The complaint alleges only that the County failed to take any action to prevent the confiscation or to secure the return of Tyler\u2019s papers. It thus fails to allege that the confiscation was pursuant to an established County practice, policy or custom as is required to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against a local government unit. <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal with respect to defendant County.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">However, with respect to defendant Woodson, we hold the complaint states a claim for relief. It alleges that on January 24, 1978 at St. Louis County Jail defendant Woodson confiscated Tyler\u2019s \u201clegal papers.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to a court order most of the papers were returned to Tyler. However, a large envelope was not returned. This envelope allegedly contained</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">log sheets for approximately a year or so, listing names of witnesses, addresses, their expected testimonies, and listing each and every occurrence relating to plaintiff of his pending charges, including statements of witnesses that may be useful. The envelope also contained numerous clippings from news articles that would also be used and an affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6B\">The complaint further alleges that these materials were compiled in preparation for Tyler\u2019s three pending criminal cases, and that the lack of these materials impaired Tyler\u2019s ability to defend himself at trial. The complaint requests the return of the papers and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">In <em>Tyler v. \u201cRon\u201d Deputy Sheriff, </em>574 F.2d 427, 429 (8th Cir. 1978), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">The taking of a prisoner\u2019s legal papers states a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985 if the taking results in interference with or infringement of the prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts. <em>Sigafus v. Brown, </em>416 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">However, in that case, the alleged taking was for a period of only a few hours and all papers were returned to the plaintiff. Further, plaintiff failed to allege that he was in any way prejudiced by the temporary taking of his papers. Accordingly, we held the complaint insufficient to state a claim for infringement of the prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">In the present case, Tyler has specifically alleged that defendant Woodson confiscated his papers, that important papers have not been returned, and that the confiscation- interfered in a specific manner with his access to the courts. Construing, as we must, the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiff and resolving all doubts in his behalf, we hold the complaint adequately states a claim for relief against defendant Woodson. We are mindful that in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint the issue is not whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>plaintiff will ultimately prevail or is likely to prevail, but only whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claim. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). With respect to defendant Woodson, we, therefore, reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Finally, Tyler also appeals the denial of his motion to disqualify the judge of the District Court. This claim is without merit. The affidavit in support of the motion states no facts to support Tyler\u2019s allegations of bias and prejudice as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. Moreover, even if true, the assertions Tyler makes in his memoranda to the District Court and in his brief on appeal are not such as to mandate disqualification either under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. And, plaintiff\u2019s assertions notwithstanding, we can discern no reason why the judge should be called as a witness in this case. Therefore, the District Court properly denied the motion for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\">. The language of the complaint is \u201cdefendant Woodson had plaintiff\u2019s legal papers confiscated.\u201d This sufficiently alleges that Woodson personally was responsible for the alleged confiscation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">This is the second suit Tyler has filed regarding this same alleged incident. The first suit was dismissed without prejudice because the complaint stated no facts indicating that the named defendants were personally involved in the taking of Tyler\u2019s papers, and his dismissal was affirmed on appeal. <em>Tyler v. Sachell, </em>590 F.2d 340 (8th Cir., 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
