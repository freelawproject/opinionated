Agee asserts four grounds for reversing his conviction: (1) The United States Attorney should not have introduced evidence which had been suppressed in a prior state prosecution arising out of the same incident; (2) the trial court did not include in its instructions to the jury a charge which Agee\u2019s counsel had requested; (3) it was disclosed to the jury that in a conversation with the police prior to his arrest, Agee did not inform them that there were narcotics in his car; (4) the trial judge questioned Agee in the presence of the jury regarding his decision to waive his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-19\">\u2022 While all of the issues raised by Agee on this appeal have had our attention, it is the third issue \u2014 concerning Agee\u2019s conversation with the police prior to his arrest \u2014 that resulted in our ordering rehearing of this appeal <em>en banc.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Agee </em>claims in connection with this issue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Hale</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Doyle v. Ohio</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>require the reversal of his conviction. This is so, he argues, because his exercise of the right to remain silent was disclosed to the jury. Contrary to Agee\u2019s argument, we hold that his rights under <em>Haie </em>and under the Fifth Amendment were not violated. Finding no merit in Agee\u2019s other arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">Agee was arrested on February 12, 1976 by Philadelphia Police Officers Michael Zagursky and Robert Wissman. The arresting officers testified that they observed Agee driving an automobile which made two turns without signalling. They followed Agee\u2019s vehicle and waived it over to the side of the road. They then left their vehicle and walked up to the car which they had stopped. Officer Wissman testified that he observed that the driver, Agee, was attempting to conceal under the seat a foil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>package containing glassine packets of tan powder. As he approached the car on the passenger\u2019s side, Officer Zagursky saw a similar package on the floor in front of the passenger, Andrew Smith. Believing the powder in the packages to be heroin, they placed Agee and Smith under arrest and seized the foil packages. Subsequent analysis revealed that the packages contained a mixture of heroin, quinine, procaine and reducing sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Agee and Smith with possession of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (1976). After a trial at which Agee testified but Smith did not, the jury found both defendants guilty of the charge. After sentencing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Agee appealed from his conviction; he also appealed from the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion for entry of a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Agee testified at his trial, giving an account of the events leading to his arrest on February 12, 1976. On direct examination, he testified that, on that date, Smith was a passenger in Agee\u2019s unlicensed taxicab, and that he may have been a passenger in his taxicab on prior occasions. While Agee was driving with Smith as his passenger, a policeman in a patrol car signalled to him to pull over to the side of the road. He did so and then informed his passenger that they had been stopped by the police:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">A. \u201cI pulled over on the side and so my passenger, Smith, asked me \u2014 he said, \u2018Why are you stopping.\u2019 I said, \u2018The policeman is in back of me. They\u2019re pulling me over.\u2019 Smith said to me, T have dope on me.\u2019 He throwed a bag of silver foil bag over across over to me and I picked it up. I was going to throw it back on him. I didn\u2019t know whether to throw it back on him or throw it out the window or what.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">A. I started to throw it over to him. I didn\u2019t know whether to throw it to him or throw it out the window. Then I got a little thing in the center of my car called a \u2014 got a little thing I could lift up. Q. Is that the console?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">A. Console, yes. So I tried to lift up this console to put it in there. I couldn\u2019t get it up because I used, always would use a pencil to stick it in one of those holes to push it up if I want to put something in there. So I couldn\u2019t hide it under there. So I put it under my seat and I got out of my car right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Q. What happened next?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">A. I got out of my car. I walked back toward the policeman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">His testimony regarding the events immediately preceding his arrest was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">\u201cNow, I thought that they felt like they were stopping me because I didn\u2019t have no brakelights. This is why I thought they were stopping me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">So anyway I come to the back. So I told the policeman, I said, T know why you\u2019re stopping me, because I don\u2019t have any brakelights.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">So I showed him my owner\u2019s card and my driver\u2019s license. So he looked at my owner\u2019s card and my driver\u2019s license. So he asked me, you know, so he said, \u2018Do you have any weapons on you?\u2019 So I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t have any weapons.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-19\">He said, \u2018Do you have any dope?\u2019 So I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t have no dope on me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-20\">So he searched me. So then I went to open up the trunk of my car The police officer didn\u2019t bother about looking into the trunk. He went straight to the front of my car. He looked underneath the seat. He found this package that I had stuck underneath the seat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>After the completion of Agee\u2019s direct testimony, he was cross-examined first by Smith\u2019s attorney and then by the government. During his cross-examination of Agee, Smith\u2019s counsel asked Agree whether he had \u201cmade any statement to the police at any time?\u201d Agee replied that he had not. The government then asked a series of questions which retraced Agee\u2019s testimony on direct examination. Agee admitted that, at the time he left his car to speak with the police, he knew that there were drugs in Smith\u2019s possession. Agee also admitted that he had concealed some of those drugs under his seat. He was then asked whether his purpose in approaching the policemen was \u201cto keep the police from coming up to your car.\u201d Agee replied that \u201c[t]hat\u2019s what I had in mind.\u201d He further testified that \u201cwhat was in [his] mind\u201d was to \u201ctell Smith to take his stuff and get out of my car\u201d. The prosecutor then asked Agee:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Q. But it wasn\u2019t in your mind to say to the police, \u201cThat man in my car has dope. Arrest him.\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On <em>redirect </em>examination, Agee testified that he had not told the police that Smith had drugs because he wanted to consult with a lawyer and did not believe that the policemen would tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">During their summations, the attorneys for both Smith and the government returned to the subject of Agee\u2019s conversation with the police prior to his arrest. Smith\u2019s counsel argued that the jury should consider Agee\u2019s \u201ctesti[mony] that he did not advise the police as to what happened in the car.\u201d The prosecutor reviewed Agee\u2019s account of what he did and did not tell the police prior to his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">Did he not, when he, intentionally knowing that these were narcotics, hide the narcotics from the police, went back to the police car and attempted to diver [sic] the police from finding the narcotics instead of saying to the police, \u201cHey, that guy has dope. Arrest him,\u201d when he conceals the narcotics from the police with the intention of giving them back to Smith, knowing that in all probability Smith is going to sell them?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Agee contends that these were \u201creferences to and comments on [his] exercise of his right to remain silent [and] were improper and require a new trial.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">The government has urged that this court may not consider Agee\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim, because Agee did not object at trial to the questions and to the parts of the summation which purportedly referred to Agee\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d prior to his arrest. The record reveals that prior to the trial, Agee\u2019s attorney had made a motion to exclude questions regarding the \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest.\u201d The district court declined to rule on the motion <em>at that time. </em>However, the court stated that during the trial, it would, out of the hearing of the jury, entertain a request for a ruling and that it would give an appropriate instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. During the trial, Agee\u2019s counsel failed in each instance to object to the questions and arguments which he now asserts were references to his client\u2019s silence at arrest. Because we hold that no error occurred which would have been reversible even if timely objections had been made, we need not consider whether the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine would have any application to these circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In two recent decisions, <em>United States v. </em>Hale<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court has considered whether a prosecutor may ask questions or make comments which reveal to the jury that the defendant exercised his right to remain silent <em>after </em>his arrest. In <em>Hale, </em>a defendant who had been charged with robbery in the district court for the District of Columbia testified that the money which the police had found on his person had been given to him by his wife. The prosecution impeached his testimony by causing him to admit during cross-examination that he had not informed the police of the source of the money at the time of his arrest. The Supreme Court, exercising its supervisory authority over the federal courts, ordered a new trial. It found that in the circumstances of the case, Hale\u2019s silence lacked significant probative value and that any reference to it carried with it an \u201cintolerably prejudicial impact.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In the subsequent case of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>the defendants testified that they had been \u201cframed\u201d by a government informant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked each defendant whether he had told this to the policeman after he arrested them; each replied that he had not. The Supreme Court held that, \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Here Agee argues, like the defendants in <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle, </em>that because he was questioned at trial about his \u201csilence\u201d at the time of his arrest, he should be granted a new trial either under the rule of evidence announced in <em>Hale </em>or under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the record reveals that Agee, unlike the defendants in the cases considered by the Supreme Court, had not remained <em>silent </em>regarding the facts of the crime with which he was charged. Instead, according to Agee\u2019s own testimony, he made statements to the police which he knew to be false and which he hoped would prevent them from discovering an ongoing crime. This circumstance distinguishes the present case from <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">If Agee had stood mute (as the defendant in <em>Hale </em>did)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or had asked \u201cwhat\u2019s this all about,\u201d and then remained silent (as the defendants in <em>Doyle </em>did),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> perhaps this would be a different case. However, the prosecution in its cross-examination of Agee <em>did not </em>open new avenues of inquiry; it merely caused Agee to repeat what he had already admitted in response to his counsel\u2019s questions: that he had attempted to deceive the police. In this context, it is clear that the question to which Agee now objects \u2014 whether it was \u201cin [his] mind\u201d to inform the police that Smith had dope \u2014 was not a reference to Agee\u2019s purported silence. Rather, it referred to his admission that what he had in mind when he approached the police and engaged them in conversation was to keep the police from coming up to his car. Moreover, it was this attempted deception, not Agee\u2019s \u201csilence,\u201d that was emphasized by the prosecutor in her summation, the relevant parts of which are reproduced at the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">\u201cSilence\u201d at the time of arrest is the critical element of the Fifth Amendment right on which Agee relies in this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The Supreme Court has described that right as \u201cthe right \u2018to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The rationale which the Supreme Court adopted for its decision in <em>Doyle </em>was that it is fundamentally unfair for the prosecution to impose a penalty at trial on a defendant who has exercised that right by choosing to remain silent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The very statement of that rationale demonstrates that <em>Doyle </em>can have no application to a case in which the defendant did <em>not </em>exercise his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Courts in other circuits have so held.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>One difficulty which we have encountered in responding to the dissenting opinion is that it fails to confront either the record in this case or the thrust of the majority opinion. The dissent persists in discussing this case as though it involved comment on Agee\u2019s \u201csilence,\u201d when, as we have pointed out, even a casual reading of the record reveals that Agee simply did not remain silent regarding the facts of the crime with which he was charged.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore \u2014 contrary to the characterization given to the majority opinion by the dissent (at pp. 368-369) \u2014 we do not find it necessary to decide whether <em>Doyle </em>has any application to a case in which the defendant\u2019s alleged \u201csilence\u201d occurred <em>prior </em>to his arrest and the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. It is abundantly clear from this record that Agee did not remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Here, as we have indicated, the record reveals unequivocally that Agee did not exercise his right to remain silent regarding the facts of the incident. Nor did the prosecutor suggest that he did. Instead, the thrust of her questions and her argument was that Agee made a deliberate choice to lie to the police in order to conceal from them an ongoing crime. If we were to hold that a prosecutor may not question or refer to a defendant\u2019s statements and conduct which were designed to deceive the police regarding the commission of a crime, we would be extending the holding of <em>Doyle </em>far beyond its rationale. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">A new trial might nonetheless be required here if we were to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments greatly outweighed their probative value. In <em>Hale, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201csilence during police interrogation lacked significant probative value . . . \u201d 422 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 2138. Evidence that a suspect remained silent after he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings is insolubly ambiguous, because it cannot be determined whether he remained silent because he was exercising his Fifth Amendment right or because he fabricated his exculpatory testimony at a time subsequent to his arrest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> No such ambiguity is present here, because as Agee\u2019s own testimony has shown, Agee did not stand mute nor did he assert his right to do so. Instead, Agee testified that he approached the police and spoke with them, answering when he was asked whether he had any dope. His testimony regarding what he chose to do and say when he approached the police officers provided a context which emphasized the probative value of what he chose <em>not </em>to say to the police. Although evidence concerning Agee\u2019s actions, statements and omissions prior to his arrest may have required careful evaluation by the jury in light of his exculpatory testimony at trial, it is clear that this evidence did not suffer from the \u201cinsoluble ambiguity\u201d which concerned the Supreme Court in <em>Hale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Another factor which leads us to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and Agee\u2019s answers were admissible is that their probative value was not confined to the issue of Agee\u2019s credibility. Not only were the prosecutor\u2019s questions designed to show that Agee\u2019s direct testimony was suspect, but they also bore upon the substantive crime with which he was charged. In <em>Hale, </em>the sole purpose of the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence was to suggest that his exculpatory testimony was a recent fabrication.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, here it was certainly relevant to the crime charged to prove that Agee had made a conscious choice between informing the police of an ongoing crime and deceiving them so that they would leave without discovering the heroin.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Whatever prejudice Agee may have suffered from the revelation that he had chosen to conceal an ongoing crime from the police occurred first during his own testimony on direct examination.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In view of these circumstances, Agee\u2019s reliance on <em>Hale </em>is without foundation: the prosecutor\u2019s question and argument had probative value and did not violate the holding of Hale<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Having concluded that Agee\u2019s <em>Hale/Doyle </em>arguments fail insofar as they pertain to the government, we turn next to an examination of two isolated references made by Smith\u2019s counsel to Agee\u2019s \u201csi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>lence.\u201d Because the issue is barely presented, if at all, by this record, we need not discuss whether <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>are applicable when the reference to a defendant\u2019s silence is made by his <em>co-defendant </em>rather than by the prosecutor<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Here the record reveals but one ambiguous question and one reference in argument by Smith\u2019s counsel which might arguably be said to implicate Agee\u2019s \u201csilence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">During his long cross-examination of Agee, Smith\u2019s counsel asked him: \u201cDid you make any statement to the police at any time?\u201d Agee replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Later, in his summation, Smith\u2019s counsel again touched briefly on the question \u25a0 of what Agee did and did not tell the police: <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">He [Agee] testified that he did not advise the police as to what happened in the car. All of these are things that have to be taken into consideration in determining the weight of the evidence, the credibility and the truth and the reasonableness of Mr. Agee\u2019s story \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqR\">During the trial, Agee never voiced any objection to either of these remarks which he now construes as comments on his \u201csilence.\u201d It was only in his post-trial motion that for the first time he suggested that they might be precluded by <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>Even if we were to conclude that these were references to Agee\u2019s silence at arrest, we would have reservations about holding that, in the absence of contemporaneous objection, this was plain error.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The only arguable distinction between the questioning and argument by the government, which we have held to be proper, and that by counsel for Smith is that the question which Smith\u2019s attorney asked was more broadly framed and did not refer explicitly to Agee\u2019s encounter with the police prior to his arrest.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, our review of the record has satisfied us that, in the context of this four-day trial, the jury would have understood and recollected this question and Smith\u2019s statement during argument as references to Agee\u2019s initial feneounter with the police. The direct examination of Agee, all subsequent cross-examination and all references in argument to what Agee stated and failed to state to the police concerned his pre-arrest encounter with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Therefore, we conclude that Agee\u2019s argument concerning his co-defendant\u2019s comment and question must be rejected under the same analysis which we have previously set forth with respect to the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>comments. Agee did not exercise his right to remain silent, and therefore the Fifth Amendment may not be invoked to preclude comment on what he said and failed to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Even assuming, however, that the question asked of Agee by counsel for Smith fell within the <em>Hale/Doyie </em>proscription, it is clear to us that it was harmless.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This is not a ease in which repetitive questioning focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>546 F.2d 583, 594-95 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 906, 97 S.Ct. 1701, 52 L.Ed.2d 391 (1977). Only a single question was involved here, and it was not followed up by counsel for Smith.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, the question was ambiguous, and we do not believe that it was understood and recollected by the jurors as anything more than a reference to Agee\u2019s initial encounter with the police. Furthermore, this question did not directly link Agee\u2019s purported silence with his exculpatory testimony. Nor do we believe that this single question could have added to whatever adverse inferences the jurors may have drawn from Agee\u2019s own direct testimony that he had concealed heroin from the police and lied to them when he was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">A single question, which may or may not have referred to pre-arrest silence and which was not highlighted or followed up in cross-examination or in summation by the prosecutor or Smith\u2019s attorney, could not have added to the prejudice which Agee may have suffered as a result of his previous testimony regarding his conduct and his conversation with the police prior to his arrest.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In the context of this record and in view of the circumstances to which we have adverted, we hold that there is no reasonable possibility that the lone question asked by Smith\u2019s counsel and the statement in his summation contributed in any way to Agee\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Agee contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the heroin which had been seized at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Following their arrest, Agee and Smith were charged with possession of heroin with intent to \u201cdeliver\u201d in violation of Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 35 \u00a7 780-113 (1977). They moved in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to suppress the heroin. After a hearing, that court found on May 13, 1976 that the testimony of the Philadelphia police officers regarding the circumstances of the arrest was not credible. It therefore ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the police did not have probable cause to arrest Agee and Smith and that the narcotics seized incident to that arrest must be suppressed. Thereafter their state indictments were nolle prossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Subsequently on July 20, 1976, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned the present indictment which charged Agee and Smith with possession of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (1976). Once again, the defendants moved to suppress the heroin seized in Agee\u2019s car.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion, finding that the police had probable cause to arrest both Agee and Smith and that the narcotics were seized while they were in \u201cplain view\u201d of the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Agee contends that the district court erred when it refused his motion to suppress the heroin. He asserts that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the government from relitigating the ruling by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Agee\u2019s suggestion that <em>Ashe v. </em>Swenson<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> precluded the district court from finding, as it did, that the police had probable cause to arrest Agee is without merit. The United States was not a party to the suppression hearing held in the state court nor were the actions of its officers under consideration in that forum. To hold that a state court determination respecting the conduct of state officials is binding on the United States would extend the <em>Ashe </em>doctrine beyond its logical boundaries. <em>See United States v. Sifuentes, </em>504 F.2d 845, 849 (4th Cir. 1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>446 F.2d 200, 202 (4th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Because the district court was not bound by the state court\u2019s action, it did not err when at trial it permitted the introduction into evidence of the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Agee sought to have the district court include in its instructions to the jury the following charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">The length of time which a person holds an object is relevant to the issue of knowing and intentional control and thus to legal possession. If you find that a person holds an object only flectingly [sic] and monentarily [sic] and thereby does not form an intent to exercise dominion and control over that object, then you are instructed that you must find that the defendant did not knowingly and intentionally possess that object and you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">His request was denied. Agee argues that this denial was error which warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">However, we do not agree that the district court erred in refusing Agee\u2019s request for charge. The district court correctly instructed the jury regarding the meaning of \u201cpossession\u201d.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The court was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>to illustrate the application of that legal concept by suggesting the particular inference which the defense hoped that the jury would make in this case, nor was it required to use the particular language or form of the charge suggested by Agee.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Agee also contends that the district court judge made statements in the presence of the jury which implied that Agee would incriminate or perjure himself if he testified in his own behalf. Agee claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because his testimony was singled out for cautionary comment by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">After Agee had taken the oath as a witness, the district court judge questioned him regarding his awareness of his right <em>not </em>to testify:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The Court: Mr. A gee, I know that Mr. Turner, of course, has informed you that as a defendant in this case you have absolutely no duty or compulsion to testify and you have your absolute right under the Fifth Amendment to remain silent and I would instruct the jury that they could not hold that against you.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Now, do you understand that by testifying, however, you are subjecting yourself, obviously, to the same scrutiny as any other witness has and that your testimony is, of course, under oath and my question: Are you voluntarily giving up your privilege, fully understanding your privilege to not testify under the Fifth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The Witness: Your Honor, I would like to talk to my lawyer and let him to explain this to me more better so I can clearly understand this.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">The Court: Very good. I think you should talk to your client, Mr. Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">Mr. Turner: Your Honor, I would object to the remarks of the Court in the presence of the jury. I would request a side bar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">The Court: Well, let me just say this on the record. It is my absolute standard procedure whenever any defendant takes the stand that the defendant understands the rights that he is giving up so that there could be no question about that and I don\u2019t see any need for a side bar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">If you wish to have one, we can have one. However, I think Mr. Agee has requested that he would like to discuss\u2014 Mr. Turner: In that case, I will request a recess, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">The Court: All right, How long a period will that be?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">Mr. Turner: About one minute will be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">The Court: We can stay here while you discuss matters with Mr. Agee.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">Mr. Turner: Mr. Agee, will you step back here, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">(A discussion takes place which is held off the record.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-23\">The Court: Mr. Agee, you have had an opportunity to discuss the matter I have just set forth with Mr. Turner and will you tell me what your decision is?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">The Witness: I intend to take the witness stand, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-25\">The Court: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-26\">We have no doubt that a trial judge may question a defendant who chooses to testify in his own behalf in order to ascertain whether he is doing so with a full awareness of his rights under the Fifth Amendment. A procedure such as the one utilized by the district court here can be valuable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>exposing beforehand, problems that such a witness may experience if he testifies. However, even though we recognize the value of such a practice, we are also cognizant of the inherent dangers that such an inquiry presents where the court\u2019s questioning takes place before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Here the record reveals that the judge did not excuse the jury nor did he take any other steps to prevent the jurors from hearing his examination of Agee and his colloquy with Agee\u2019s counsel. While we approve of the careful consideration which the district court judge gave to Agee\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment and the concern which he exhibited, we are severely troubled by the manner in which the court implemented this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Although we indicate in our later discussion that the district court judge\u2019s comments could not have affected Agee adversely inasmuch as Agee in fact did testify, we are nevertheless convinced that better practice requires that any such inquiry, no matter how solicitous of a defendant\u2019s rights, must be conducted with the jury not present. Excusing the jury, while time consuming and in some instances burdensome, will nevertheless guard against any unjust or improper inference being drawn by the jury especially if the defendant elects not to testify \u2014 an inference which may not be fully dispelled by a cautionary instruction. Thus, we will require that henceforth all such questioning and discussion be held outside the jury\u2019s presence or in such a fashion that the jurors cannot hear the colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Despite our disapproval of the district court\u2019s practice in this case, we nonetheless conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s questions contributed to Agee\u2019s conviction. <em>See Schneble v. Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972). Here, nothing in the district court judge\u2019s remarks could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the judge believed that Agee\u2019s testimony would be incriminating or perjurious. Indeed, the only reasonable inference which the jury could draw from the court\u2019s remarks was that Agee had made a free and voluntary decision to testify, as indeed he had. Such a decision to testify could well have impressed the jury favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">We observe that this case presents circumstances far different from those presented in <em>Webb v. Texas</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>United States v. Morrison.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Webb, </em>the trial judge admonished a prisoner who had been called as a witness for the defense regarding the dangers of perjury, assuring him that if he were convicted of that crime he would not be eligible for parole. The witness thereupon refused to testify. The Supreme Court held that the defendant had been deprived of his right to put on a defense. In this case, however, no reference was made by the court to the possibility that Agee would perjure himself,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> nor did the court\u2019s comments prevent Agee from taking the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">In <em>Morrison, </em>the prosecution informed a defense witness prior to the trial that, if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>testified, she might implicate herself in the crime. When she was called as a witness by the defendant, she refused to answer many of the questions put to her by defense counsel on the ground that they might incriminate her. We held there that the prosecutor had interfered with the defendant\u2019s right to have his witness give evidence in his favor. By contrast, here Agee was not deterred from giving evidence in his own behalf and no threats of further prosecution were made by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The circumstances which led to the reversal of the convictions in <em>Webb </em>and <em>Morrison </em>\u2014in <em>Webb, </em>a statement by a trial judge that he would make certain that a defense witness was prosecuted if he perjured himself; and in <em>Morrison, </em>a statement by a prosecutor that it would not be in a witness\u2019s interests to testify for the defense, leading in both cases to a refusal by a key defense witness to give testimony \u2014 are just not present here.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Indeed, as we have previously indicated the only inference which the jury could reasonably have drawn from the court\u2019s questioning and statements was that Agee, having been informed of his rights by the court\u2019s neutral questioning, was testifying of his own free will, voluntarily and without any government compulsion. In such a situation, we perceive no reasonable possibility that the court\u2019s action contributed to Agee\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The dissenting opinion agrees that the questioning of a witness regarding his knowledge of his Fifth Amendment rights must be done outside the jury\u2019s presence. To that extent, we are unanimous. What disagreement the dissent does register is with our conclusion, based on our review of the record, that this error was harmless. The dissent apparently disagrees, because it would grant a new trial. The short answer to that suggestion is that a majority of this court has reviewed the record and has concluded that there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s questions contributed to Agee\u2019s conviction. <em>See Schneble v. Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">The judgment of sentence will be affirmed. We will also affirm the order which denied Agee\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal or a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\">. Agee\u2019s appeal, initially heard by a panel of this court, was ordered to be reheard by the court <em>en banc </em>on April 17, 1978.

We note, however, that the error asserted on this appeal is predicated on the <em>cumulative effect </em>of a number of questions asked of Agee and statements made in summation. Had Agee\u2019s counsel objected at side bar to any of these questions, the district court \u2014 if it found that objection to be meritorious under <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>\u2014 could have precluded further questioning or argumentation on this point, perhaps avoiding the cumulative prejudicial effect of which Agee now complains. The failure of Agee\u2019s counsel to make contemporaneous objections not only deprived the district cv art of the opportunity to take remedial action at an early stage, but it also leads to the conclusion that, having originally recognized this issue, counsel made a tactical decision not to object during trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">. 422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">. 422 U.S. at 180-81, 96 S.Ct. 2240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\">.

What does he say, even if you believe George Agee, was his intention? To hide those narcotics in his car, to divert the police to conceal that fact from the police so that he could give them back to Mr. Smith and put Mr. Smith out of his car and say, T don\u2019t want to be involved in this. Go on your way and peddle the dope.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Did he not, when he, intentionally knowing that these were narcotics, hide the narcotics from the police, went back to the police car and attempted to divert the police from finding the narcotics instead of saying to the police, \u2018Hey, that guy has dope. Arrest him,\u2019 when he conceals the narcotics from the police with the intention of giving them back to Smith, knowing that in all probability Smith is going to sell them? Is he not putting himself in the position of being an aider and abetter of Smith? Is he not making it possible, under Mr. Agee\u2019s own testimony, for a narcotics pusher to go out on the street and sell heroin? For if Mr. Agee had not hidden the narcotics, if Mr. Agee\u2019s plan had worked, which of course it did not, Mr. Smith would, indeed, have been able to go out and go on his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Finally, as I have suggested to you earlier, even if you do believe him, even if you do believe everything the defendant Agee said from that witness stand, didn\u2019t he tell you that he took that, that he knew from what Smith said to him that it was dope, that he intended to conceal it? It was not just a split second. He tried to get the console thing open and that wouldn\u2019t go and then he got it under the car and then on top of that he went out in the back and tried to divert the police. Wasn\u2019t he then helping Smith to keep that narcotics and go back out on the street with it? Didn\u2019t he himself by those actions put himself into this scheme, even if you believe Agee\u2019s testimony that he didn\u2019t see it before, that for some reason Smith took it out of concealment when the police showed up?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">. <em>Miranda v.

However, here we have determined that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Agee did not violate his Fifth Amendment rights and we have been shown no other basis which would warrant our overturning the district court\u2019s admission of this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\">. In <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle, </em>it was the prosecutor in each case who questioned the defendants regarding their exercise of their right to remain silent. The Supreme Court did not consider whether similar questioning by counsel for another defendant would have required a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. Earlier in his summation, counsel for Smith had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Mr. Agee\u2019s testimony was rather interesting and novel and I must say that I have been in this case since February of 1976 and this was the first time I heard that story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Agee\u2019s counsel made an objection to this statement at sidebar on the grounds that: (1) the date on which Smith\u2019s attorney entered the case was not in the record, and (2) it characterized Agee\u2019s testimony as a \u201cstory\u201d. No objection was made on any <em>Hale/Doyle </em>ground. The court then instructed the jury to disregard the statement because it was irrelevant and was not supported by evidence in the record. Subsequently when ruling on Agee\u2019s post-trial motion, the court observed that Agee did not object to the adequacy of this instruction, nor did Agee argue that Smith\u2019s counsel had com-merited on Agee\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d prior to trial. In this situation, it is evident that no Fifth Amendment right of Agee\u2019s was implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b422-13\">. We have previously discussed our reservations about applying the plain error doctrine to this case, in which Agee!s counsel may have made a tactical decision <em>not </em>to object at sidebar during the trial, and where objection at an early stage of the trial might have permitted the district court to avoid the <em>cumulative </em>prejudice from a number of questions and comments of which Agee now complains. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b422-14\">. The statement by Smith\u2019s counsel during summation that Agee testified that he did not advise the police about what had happened in the car is not so broadly framed as his question during cross-examination.

Similarly, in <em>Hale, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the government had not contended that the error was harmless. 422 U.S. at 175 n.3, 95 S.Ct. 2133. We are persuaded and we so hold that violation of the rule announced in <em>Doyle </em>will not warrant a new trial if there is no \u201creasonable possibility that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction,\u201d as there was not here. <em>Schneble </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.

Here, counsel for Smith asked a single question. We have already concluded that the subsequent cross-examination and summation by the government was proper and that Smith\u2019s summation did not mention or dwell upon the subject of the one question which Smith had asked concerning Agee\u2019s statements.

However, the court held that this error was harmless, because the question was not followed .p and the jury had already heard damaging testimony that King had, prior to the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, stated to the police \u201cYes, you made a good catch this time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">.

Two of those grounds, however, are meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">I. THE TRANSACTION</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">Agee and codefendant Andrew Smith were arrested by the Philadelphia police on February 12, 1976. They were indicted for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and tried jointly. In that trial Philadelphia police officers Michael Zagursky and Robert Wissman testified that on that morning they stopped an automobile for making two turns without signalling. Officer Wissman approached the driver\u2019s side of the stopped automobile, where Agee was seated, and Zagursky approached the passenger\u2019s side, where Smith was seated. Both officers testified that, while approaching the front of the car, they saw foil packages containing glassine packets of tannish-white powder. One package was on the floor of the car immediately in front of Smith. The other was in the hands of Agee, who, according to Wissman, was attempting to shove it under the car seat. Wissman testified that he then removed Agee from the car and arrested him for possession of what the officer believed to be heroin. After making the arrest, Officer Wissman retrieved the packages from the floor of the car at the edge of the seat and between the brake pedal and the seat The packets were later found to contain a mix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ture of heroin, quinine, procaine, and reducing sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Agee testified on his own behalf, while Smith did not. Agee stated that on the day of his arrest he was driving an unlicensed taxicab and that he had picked up Smith, whom he did not know, as a passenger. He testified that he drove Smith to one location, waited for him, and, at Smith\u2019s request, started to drive him back to the spot where he had first picked him up. The unlicensed taxicab had a defective brake-light. According to Agee\u2019s testimony, when the police stopped the car, Smith threw one tin foil packet at him and said \u201cI have dope on me.\u201d Agee claimed that he had no prior knowledge of Smith\u2019s possession of narcotics. Agee tried unsuccessfully to conceal the packet in the console compartment of the car and finally thrust the packet under the seat. He then left the car and walked to its rear, where he said to one of the officers, \u201cI know why you\u2019re stopping me, because I don\u2019t have any brakelights.\u201d When the officer asked him if he had any weapons or narcotics, he answered negatively. The officer searched him, and then searched the car. In the latter search the officer found the packets referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">II. TRIAL REFERENCES TO AGEE\u2019S SILENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">At the outset of the joint trial, obviously anticipating that his client would take the stand, Agee\u2019s attorney called to the district court\u2019s attention the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975). He asked for a preliminary ruling that the appellant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest was inadmissible for any purpose and that such silence should not be the subject of any inquiries or comments during the course of the trial. When asked by the trial judge to explain why he was raising the issue early in the trial, counsel answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Well, your honor, I don\u2019t want it to arise during the proceedings when the jury is in the box.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at p. A-151. When the court declined to rule on the issue in advance, Agee\u2019s counsel repeated his request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">[Wjhen they [the arresting officers] made the arrest, it\u2019s my understanding that no statements were made by Mr. Agee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">I would respectfully request that the Court bar questioning either on direct or cross examination on that specific point by either counsel for the Government or my co-counsel, Mr. Gershenfeld. Once again, under Hale, your Honor, I believe it would be blatantly inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWK\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at p. A \u2014 156. The court responded to counsel\u2019s request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">Well, the fact that no statement was made, the jury is certainly going to be appropriately instructed and you can have the appropriate instruction when it goes to the jury that the fact that no statement was made cannot in any way be taken as evidence of any admission, that he has an absolute right to be silent, so forth and so on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at pp. A-156-57. Agee\u2019s counsel persisted in seeking to prevent questioning at trial on the subject of Agee\u2019s silence at the time of arrest. However, the district judge ruled that only at such time as a specific question regarding Agee\u2019s silence was asked would he rule on counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-16\">Counsel for the government and for co-defendant Smith were present during this colloquy, in which the court in effect ruled that they could at least inquire, in the presence of the jury, about Agee\u2019s silence at the time of arrest. During the course of the trial both lawyers took advantage of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-17\">The majority makes much of counsel\u2019s failure to object at every stage of the line of interrogation which the court, after repeated objection, actually invited. Opinion, <em>post </em>at 353 n. 5. To say, as the m.'jority does, that this failure reflects a tactical decision not to object during trial, is patently unfair to conscientious counsel who made every reasonable effort to prevent refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ence to his client\u2019s silence, and who forewarned the court and counsel. To say that the district court was deprived \u201cof the opportunity to take remedial action at an early stage\u201d is, considering the colloquy quoted above, a misstatement of the record. For two reasons the majority\u2019s argument about the need for a simultaneous objection should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In the first place, the objection was made quite explicitly at the outset of the case. Agee\u2019s counsel pointed out that it would be improper for the government or for codefendant\u2019s counsel to inquire about or comment upon the subject matter in the presence of the jury. All of the participants in the trial were aware of Agee\u2019s objection. Instead of ruling that no such inquiry should be made, the district court in effect permitted the attorneys for the government and for Smith to ask the question and to put Agee in the position of objecting before the jury. Under these circumstances the policy behind the simultaneous objection rule of affording the opportunity to avoid error is not implicated. Everyone involved in the case was forewarned and, consequently, the error could have been avoided. It requires extraordinary suspension of perception to treat the trial court\u2019s ruling as anything but a plain invitation to trespass in a forbidden evidentiary area. Secondly, even in cases where no objection whatsoever was made, it has been held repeatedly that prosecutorial utilization of the defendant\u2019s silence is plain error. <em>E. g., United States v. Harp, </em>536 F.2d 601, 602 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>425 F.2d 204, 206 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>United States v. Nolan, </em>416 F.2d 588, 594 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 912, 90 S.Ct. 227, 24 L.Ed.2d 187 (1969); <em>United States v. Brinson, </em>411 F.2d 1057, 1059 (6th Cir. 1969). <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>162 U.S.App. D.C. 305, 498 F.2d 1038, 1040-44 (1974), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975) (cross-examination of defendant with regard to silence at time of arrest not harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s obvious strategy was to convince the jury that Agee, the car owner, rather than Smith, the passenger, possessed the heroin. Consequently, on cross-examination Smith\u2019s counsel questioned Agee:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Q. Did you make any statement to the police at any time?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at p. A-254. Later, in his closing argument to the jury, Smith\u2019s counsel argued that Agee\u2019s silence about the narcotics in his car impeached his credibility at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">He [Agee] testified that he did not advise the police as to what had happened in the car. All of these are things that have to be taken into consideration in determining the weight of the evidence, the credibility and the truth and the reasonableness of Mr. Agee\u2019s story \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at p. A-279.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Agee included the following dialogue:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">Q. You had in mind that you could straighten it out with the police back in the rear of the car about your brakelights and then go on your way. Is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">A. No, had in mind straightening that out and not just going on my way, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Q. Well, what was in your mind?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">A. What was in my mind? If I could get out of the policemen not giving me a ticket I was going to tell Smith to take his stuff and get out of my car. That\u2019s what was in my mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Q. But it wasn\u2019t in your mind to say to the police, \u201cThat man in my car has dope. Arrest him\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-20\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at pp. A-255-56. In her closing argument, the Assistant United States Attorney went even further than Smith\u2019s counsel had gone in arguing the importance of Agee\u2019s silence at the t: Tie of his arrest. The government attorney contended that Agee\u2019s silence was affirmative evidence of Agee\u2019s commission of the charged offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Now, whether or not you believe the defendant Agee\u2019s testimony, I suggest to you that even if you accept it, <em>he makes himself guilty of the crime charged.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Did he not, when he, intentionally knowing that these were narcotics, hide the narcotics from the police, went back to the police car and attempted to divert the police from finding the narcotics <em>instead of saying to the police, \u201cHey, that guy has dope. Arrest him,\u201d </em>when he conceals the narcotics from the police with the intention of giving them back to Smith, knowing that in all probability Smith is going to sell them? Is he not putting himself in the position of being an aider and abetter of Mr. Smith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJg\">Appellant\u2019s Appendix, at pp. A-266-67 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It has long been an assumption of the law of evidence that a <em>\u201cfailure to assert </em>a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an assertion of the non-existence of the fact.\u201d IIIA Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). For a moment I pass the question whether that assumption, when applied to a traffic stop by a Philadelphia police officer of a driver of an unregistered and mechanically defective taxicab, realistically comports with the behavioral expectations of the parties. Applying the assumption to the present case, the government contends that Agee\u2019s silence about the presence of the heroin amounted to an affirmative denial of such presence and thus to purposeful concealment of the drugs. Where silence is equivalent to an assertion, that silence becomes relevant to a witness\u2019 testimony as a prior inconsistent statement if the assumed affirmation is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 present testimony. If offered against a party to the action, that silence is relevant as an admission, regardless of that party\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In a criminal prosecution, however, there is obvious tension between the rule of evidence treating silence as an affirmation arid the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. For many years in state prosecutions, under the rule of <em>Twining v. New Jersey, </em>211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97 (1908), the Supreme Court resolved this tension by permitting the defendant\u2019s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination to be used as evidence that the defendant could not, if he testified, deny the charge against him. Such use of a constitutionally protected right to remain silent came to an end in <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), where the Supreme Court held the privilege against self-incrimination applicable to state prosecutions. After <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>it was clear that since the defendant in a criminal case had a constitutional right to remain silent, his exercise of that right could not be used against him substantively as an affirmation by silence. The privilege against self-incrimination received further support from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), which dealt with the circumstances in which actual statements, rather than silence, would be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), the Court held that although an actual statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>could not be used as substantive evidence against the defendant, it could be used for impeachment purposes as a prior inconsistent statement if the defendant testified in a manner inconsistent with that prior statement. After the decision in <em>Harris v. New York, </em>the courts of appeals divided on the question whether, despite the rule of <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>an affirmation by silence could be used for impeachment purposes when the defendant took the stand at his trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Supreme Court resolved this conflict in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975), and <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 48 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). In <em>Hale </em>the Court held that the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence could not be used even for impeachment purposes. The Court reasoned, first, that the defendant\u2019s silence was not sufficiently probative of an inconsistency with his in-court testimony to warrant admission of the silence as impeachment evidence. 422 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct. 2133. In addition, the Court believed that admitting into evidence the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence would be highly prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 95 S.Ct. 2133. The decision in <em>Hale </em>applied only to federal prosecutions. However, in <em>Doyle </em>the Court held that the rule excluding even the impeaching use of such silence was constitutionally required and therefore binding on the states. If, as <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>hold, a defendant\u2019s silence cannot be treated as a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes, a <em>fortiori </em>it cannot be used substantively as an admission tending to prove the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Agee testified that he did not report Smith\u2019s possession of the heroin because he did not think that the police would believe him and because he wanted to speak to an attorney before making a statement. He acknowledged that he was aware that contraband was in his car. There is no inconsistency between Agee\u2019s trial testimony and his silence as to Smith\u2019s possession of narcotics. Indeed the government does not urge that Agee\u2019s silence was admissible on impeachment grounds, even though counsel for codefendant Smith argued as much to the jury. Rather, the government argues, as it did to the jury, that Agee\u2019s silence was admissible as substantive proof that Agee was an accessory to Smith\u2019s offense of possessing heroin with intent to sell. This argument is based upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\"><em>Whoever </em>commits an offense against the United States or <em>aids, abets, </em>counsels, commands, induces or procures it commission, <em>is punishable as a principal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">(Emphasis supplied). By failing to tell the police of Smith\u2019s possession, the government argues, Agee aided and abetted Smith\u2019s possession, even though Agee believed that disclosure would tend to incriminate himself because the police would not believe his version of the facts. In effect, the government takes the position that anyone having knowledge of any offense which is ongoing in nature, such as a possessory offense, becomes a principal in that offense if he does not immediately disclose the offense, even though such disclosure might tend to incriminate him. Appellee\u2019s Brief, at p. 8. I have no difficulty with such a construction of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) when a defendant takes active steps to conceal the crime. Thus I think that it was proper to argue to the jury that by moving to the rear of the car Agee may have intended to divert attention from the contraband. But here the government went further and argued the silence alone was criminal. So construed, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) would run afoul of the fifth amendment guarantee against self-incrimination, for resort to silence would be penalized criminally. I do not so construe the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The government also urges that the use to which Agee\u2019s silence was put falls outside the <em>Hale-Doyle </em>prohibition because in those cases the silence referred to occurred after the defendant\u2019s arrest and after he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, while in this case the silence occurred prior to arrest and prior to any <em>Miranda </em>warnings. It is true, as the government urges, that <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>dealt only with post-arrest and post-<em>Miranda </em>warning silence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>do not believe that the result should be any different here. For one thing, there is at least a serious ambiguity about Agee\u2019s status at the time of his silence referred to in the government\u2019s cross-examination and closing argument. On the government\u2019s evidence, Agee was subjected to a full body search immediately after the traffic stop. Accordingly, at the time of his silence, Agee might have been subject to constraints imposed by the police officers, thereby triggering even the narrowest application of <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>If, at the time of his silence, Agee was in the custody of the policemen, the fact that <em>Miranda </em>warnings may not have been given does not preclude the application of the rule enunciated in <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, while the prosecutor\u2019s comments were arguably restricted to the time frame prior to the appellant\u2019s arrest, Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s comments were certainly not so restricted. Thus, the conduct of Smith\u2019s counsel might put this ease squarely within the proscription of <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>More importantly, the government is flatly wrong in contending that anything turns on the presence or absence of custody or of the presence or absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Its attempt to rely on these factors misstates the issue and attempts to treat a proposed exception to the general applicability of the fifth amendment as if it were the rule. <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>are not the rule. Rather the rule appears in fifth amendment cases like <em>Malloy v. Hogan. Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>simply refused to extend the <em>Harris v. New York </em>exception of impeaching use to silence. Neither <em>Hale </em>nor <em>Doyle </em>suggests that the possibility of substantive rather than impeaching use of such silence was ever contemplated by the Court. Allowing substantive use of silence not only would circumvent the holdings of <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle, </em>but also would amount to overruling <em>Malloy v. Hogan </em>and reviving <em>Twining v. New Jersey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As I read its opinion in this case, the majority apparently agrees that the government\u2019s argument as to \u00a7 2(a) and as to the inapplicability of <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>to pre-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence is mistaken. It admits, albeit tacitly, that mere silence when having knowledge of another\u2019s crime is not evidence of an offense. Similarly, it acknowledges, again implicitly, that the <em>Hale-Doyle </em>prohibition covers silence which precedes arrest and the administering of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We part company, then, simply over an interpretation of the record, which the majority reads as disclosing no comment on silence, but only comment on speech or action.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">I do not believe that, fairly read, the prosecutor\u2019s argument at trial can be understood as anything but an assertion to the jury of the same point that the government advances on appeal \u2014 that silence by a person having knowledge of a possessory offense is itself a crime under \u00a7 2(a). It is one thing for the majority tacitly to reject that argument. It is quite another to refuse to take government counsel at her word about her intention in making the argument to the jury. The very argument made in this appeal belies the majority\u2019s overgenerous treatment of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Besides ignoring the government\u2019s stated purpose in examining Agee\u2019s failure to offer exculpatory remarks, the majority also concludes that the prosecutor\u2019s statements referred only to Agee\u2019s actions and words, and not to his silence. In so holding, the majority notes that Agee did not remain mute when the police encountered him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Rather, \u201che made statements to the police which he knew to be false and which he hoped would prevent them from discovering an ongoing crime.\u201d Opinion, <em>supra </em>at 354. Yet, as the majority acknowledges, the <em>Hale-Doyle </em>rule does not apply only when a suspect remains mute. In <em>Doyle, </em>after all, the defendant was by no means totally \u201cmute\u201d when he was interrogated by the police. Indeed, he stated \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about,\u201d as if to deny knowledge of the underlying events. 426 U.S. at 614 n.5, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Even so, the prosecutor\u2019s comments on Doyle\u2019s failure to protest his innocence were judged reversible error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The majority apparently recognizes that the <em>Hale-Doyle </em>rule does not require total silence. \u201cIf Agee . . . had asked \u2018What\u2019s this all about,\u2019 \u201d the majority suggests, \u201cperhaps this would be a different case.\u201d Opinion, <em>supra </em>at 354. Why should it be a different case? In both instances the jury is asked to speculate on the substantive significance of a failure to speak.' Where, as here, the government\u2019s remarks are, by its own admission, directed at the substantively incriminating character of a defendant\u2019s silence, I do not see how the precise words spoken by the defendant, when first encountered by the police can be said to make a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The majority also concludes that the remarks of Smith\u2019s counsel did not transgress Agee\u2019s rights under <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>It relies, in part, on the failure of Agee\u2019s attorney to make a contemporaneous objection, as well as its belief that the challenged statements referred to actions and not true silence. I have explained above why these positions are without merit. The majority further contends that any violation which Smith\u2019s attorney may have caused was harmless. From this record, however, it is clear that Agee\u2019s failure to exculpate himself was significant to the government\u2019s case. I cannot say, therefore, that there was not \u201ca reasonable possibility that the improperly admitted [testimony] contributed to the conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Sehneble v. Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Because of its myopic approach to the record and its niggardly reading of <em>Doyle, </em>the majority, insisting that there was no comment on silence, does not address the question whether, <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>aside, the circumstances disclosed in this record present an appropriate case for the application of the evidentiary rule equating silence with affirmation. I do not believe they do. The rule is usually justified in terms of behavioral expectations. In other words, common human experience suggests that people generally will deny false accusations and will fully disclose facts when making formal disclosures, as in testimony or pleadings. <em>See </em>IIIA, Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). But common human experience does not suggest that a driver of an illegal taxicab stopped by a Philadelphia police officer for what the driver thought was a motor vehicle violation, and confronted, according to his testimony, with the unexpected knowledge that his vehicle contained contraband and with an inquiry about guns and drugs in his possession, would react by volunteering any more information than was volunteered here. It seems to me as likely as not that the reaction would be to say as little as possible. In addition, prior to arrest it is less likely that a defendant will be confronted with a formal accusation of guilt. Absent such an accusation, a defendant\u2019s silence is highly ambiguous. For both of these reasons, the inference sought to be drawn from silence here was not sufficiently reliable to be properly admissible as substantive or impeachment evidence, even apart from any fifth amendment problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Since both the prosecutor and counsel for codefendant Smith made improper references to Agee\u2019s silence in cross-examination and in oral argument to the jury, the judgment of conviction should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">III. THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S ADMONITION ABOUT THE PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"ARh\">Immediately after Mr. Agee took the stand and was sworn, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The Court: Mr. Agee, I know that Mr. Turner, of course, has informed you that as a defendant in this case you have absolutely no duty or compulsion to testify and you have your absolute right under the Fifth Amendment to remain silent and I would instruct the jury that they could not hold that against you.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Now, do you understand that by testifying, however, you ,are subjecting yourself, obviously, to the same scrutiny as any other witness has and that your testimony is, of course, under oath and my question: Are you voluntarily giving up your privilege, fully understanding your privilege to not testify under the Fifth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Witness: Your Honor, I would like to talk to my lawyer and let him to explain this to me more better so I can clearly understand this.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The Court: Very good. I think you should talk to your client, Mr. Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Mr. Turner: Your Honor, I would object to the remarks of the Court in the presence of the jury. I would request a side bar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The Court: Well, let me just say this on the record. It is my absolute standard procedure whenever any defendant takes the stand that the defendant understands the rights that he is giving up so that there could be no question about that and I don\u2019t see any need for a side bar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">If you wish to have one, we can have one. However, I think Mr. Agee has requested that he would like to discuss^\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Mr. Turner: In that case, I will request a recess, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">The Court: All right. How long a period will that be?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Mr. Turner: About one minute will be \u25a0 sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">The Court: We can stay here while you discuss matters with Mr. Agee.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Mr. Turner: Mr. Agee, will you step back here, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">(A discussion takes place which is held off the record.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">The Court: Mr. Agee, you have had an opportunity to discuss the matter I have just set forth with Mr. Turner and will you tell me what your decision is?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">The Witness: I intend to take the witness stand, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">The Court: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">Agee urges that the likely inference a juror would draw from singling him out for such interrogation was that his testimony would either incriminate him or be perjurious. The government contends, on the other hand, that if the interrogation had any effect at all, \u201cit is likely that [it] enhanced Agee\u2019s credibility by emphasizing the voluntary nature of his testimony.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief, at p. 14. The majority is not so naive as to accept the contention that Agee\u2019s credibility was enhanced. It finds, instead, a neutral effect. I think that Agee\u2019s version of the probable effect on a juror is far more likely than either the government\u2019s or the majority\u2019s. The purpose of the trial court\u2019s remarks, in my view, was far from neutral. It was intended, I believe, to discourage Agee from testifying. If the jury so understood it, the interrogation certainly was prejudicial. Since such questioning of the defendant may be prejudicial and since I can think of no reason why any defendant represented by able counsel should be subjected to it in the presence of the jury, I strongly disapprove of the practice. Even the majority finds it hard to justify. It is true that, a trial judge may, and sometimes even should, warn a witness of his fifth amendment rights and of the dangers of perjury. But he cannot, by such warnings to a witness, tilt the scales of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>against the defendant. <em>See Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (trial judge\u2019s extended warning to defense witness not to lie discouraged the witness from testifying and denied the defendant the opportunity to present witnesses in his defense). When the witness is a defendant who is represented by able counsel and who is about to testify on his own behalf, the need for any such warnings seems to me non-existent. Despite its acknowledgment that engaging in such interrogation is bad practice, the majority strains to distinguish the governing case law, thus giving trial judges a blueprint for the partial evasion of the holding in <em>Webb v. Texas. </em>I find particularly disingenuous the majority\u2019s distinction of <em>Webb </em>on the basis of an ostensible absence in this case of a reference to possible perjury. To what else was the trial court referring when he warned Agee \u201cNow, do you' understand . that your testimony is, of course, under oath. . . . \u201d? None of the government witnesses was given such a warning. I understand it, and the jurors undoubtedly understood it, as a particular admonition that the defendant should resist the temptation to commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">While the majority cannot quite bring itself to endorse the trial court\u2019s practice of warning testifying defendants, in the presence of the jury, about the privilege against self-incrimination and the dangers of false swearing, it cannot, either, bring itself to order a new trial. Tongue clicking over bad practices has become a familiar routine in this court. <em>E. g., United States v. LeFevre, </em>483 F.2d 477, 478 80 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Benson, </em>487 F.2d 978, 981 82 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Somers, </em>496 F.2d 723, 736-42 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 832, 95 S.Ct. 56, 42 L.Ed.2d 58 (1974); <em>United States ex rel. Perry v.

Our tongue clicking over improper argument by government counsel has been notoriously ineffective in preventing it, as the persistent need to resort to gentle chastisement amply demonstrates. Bland expressions of disapproval of improprieties and tepid endorsements of \u201cthe better practice\u201d are no substitute for the exercise of appellate judicial responsibility. I would grant a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">. <em>Compare United States v.

We do not read <em>Doyle </em>in that way.
