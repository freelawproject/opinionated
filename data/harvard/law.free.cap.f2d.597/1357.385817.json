After carefully reviewing the briefs and oral arguments presented by the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>ties, as well as the decision of the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals (board), we hold in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Blake Construction Company, Inc. (plaintiff), was the successful bidder on contract No. GS-03B-16644 for construction of the superstructure (Phase II) of the J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) Building, Washington, D.C. Under this contract, awarded by the General Services Administration (GSA) on June 14, 1971, plaintiff was to supply the finish hardware for the structure, including the locksets which were to be installed on the doors of the FBI Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">In March 1972, plaintiff, on behalf of its supplier,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> submitted a physical sample, the Falcon Lock Set No. 2520 HG 32D (Type 86E), to GSA for approval. However, defendant\u2019s contracting officer determined that the Falcon lockset did not meet contract specifications as to fabrication; specifically, that the. rose and knob of the lockset were of wrought fabrication instead of cast fabrication, as specified in paragraph 6.2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the contract specifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These objections were detailed in the contracting officer\u2019s final decision letter of May 22, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">Plaintiff thereupon submitted another lockset, the 763 Milan by Corbin, one of the samples listed in the contract specifications for trim design.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This lockset, more expensive than the rejected Falcon lockset, was accepted by the contracting officer as meeting contract requirements, although it was ultimately discovered that the Corbin was also of wrought, not cast, fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-17\">Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal from the contracting officer\u2019s decision letter and a complaint with the board, seeking payment to plaintiff and its supplier of an amount sufficient as an equitable adjustment to compensate them for the allegedly wrongful rejection of the Falcon lockset. Following a hearing, the board, on August 29, 1973, held that while the Falcon lockset met contract requirements with regard to appearance, it did not meet contract specifications with regard to fabrication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On November 19, 1976, plaintiff filed a petition in this court seeking a reversal of the board\u2019s decision and an order remanding the case to the board for determination of the appropriate equitable adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-19\">The only issue in the case involves the interpretation <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of contract specification section 0870, \u201cFinish Hardware.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that Interim Federal Specification FF-H-00106b,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> incorporated by reference into the contract through paragraph 1.8 of section 0870 of the specifications and paragraph 17.1.1 of the General Conditions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> allows the supplier the option of furnishing trims of wrought fabrication whenever cast fabrication is specified; that paragraph 6.2 of the contract specifications provides that, \u201c[t]rim material shall be * * * of cast fabrication\u201d; that nowhere in the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>has the Government amended, modified, or eliminated the option; and that, therefore, the board was wrong in holding that the trim material had to be of cast fabrication alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Defendant contends that the option, otherwise available under paragraph 3.2.3 of the interim federal specifications, could, under paragraph 17.1.1 of the General Conditions, be \u201cmodified or * * * otherwise provided in the specifications\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that paragraph 1.8 of the contract specifications<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> referred to \u201cmodified requirements specified herein\u201d; that paragraphs 6.2, 6.5, and 6.6 of the contract specifications <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> called for cast fabrication; and that by specifying \u201ccast fabrication,\u201d the Government had effectively specified its option as to the selection of type of fabrication and had rendered the supplier\u2019s option inoperative. Defendant\u2019s position is that there is a \u201chierarchy\u201d of specifications and that, in the event of a conflict, contract specifications \u201ccontrol\u201d over federal specifications.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">To accept defendant\u2019s argument would be to assume that the act of \u201cspecifying\u201d cast fabrication both triggers and eliminates the supplier\u2019s option, for the option is not available except \u201c[w]hen cast trims are <em>specified.\u201d </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) Defendant\u2019s interpretation violates one of the cardinal principles of contract interpretation, that an interpretation which gives reasonable meaning to all parts of an instrument is preferred to one which leaves a portion of it useless, inoperative, void, meaningless, or superfluous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That defendant\u2019s interpretation rendered one portion of the contract meaningless and superfluous was succinctly explicated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Broxton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-16\">The only way [the contractor/supplier] can elect to use wrought fabrication is for the specifications to require cast fabrication. If the specifications do not specify cast fabrication then the wrought[-]cast fabrication option in Paragraph 3.2.3 can not be exercised. If, however, cast fabrication is specified, [plaintiff] under the majority decision is barred from using wrought fabrication! Such an interpretation entraps the contractor and produces an intolerable result. [73-2 BCA at 48,182.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">We think paragraph 6.2 of section 0870 of the contract specifications can be read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-18\">Trim material shall be stainless steel of cast [or 0.050-inch minimum thickness wrought] fabrication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-19\">There is no language in the contract (or in the bid invitation) expressly restricting or eliminating the fabrication option; the Government may not eliminate the option simply through an act of omission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-21\">As a secondary ground for its decision, the board determined that the requirements of paragraph 3.2.3 of the interim federal specifications were not met, the basis of its reasoning being that that paragraph not only begins \u201c[w]hen cast trims are specified,\u201d but continues with the language <em>\u201cin US32 or US32D finishes\u201d </em>(emphasis sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>plied), whereas the language of paragraph 6.2 of the contract specifications states that \u201c[t]rim material shall be stainless steel of cast fabrication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">We fail to discern any significance in the difference of phraseology. The board itself recognized that the language \u201cin US32 or US32D finishes\u201d was superfluous since paragraph 23 of the contract specifications listed every Type 86E lockset as stainless steel with US32D finish. Defendant interprets the board\u2019s position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-5\">The Board determined that paragraph 3.2.3\u2019s requirement that cast trims be specified in a certain finish was not met because the contract requirements went beyond specifying cast trim merely by finish, and specified the cast trim by fabrication as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">As we interpret this opaque language, redundancy is the key to eliminating the option: \u201ctrim\u201d should read \u201ccast trim,\u201d and \u201c[Cast t]rim ** * * shall be * * * of cast fabrication\u201d means something more emphatic than \u201ccast trim.\u201d Defendant would have paragraph 3.2.3 read \u201cwhen trims are specified in US32 or US32D finishes <em>and of cast fabrication,\u201d </em>instead of \u201c[w]hen <em>cast </em>trims are specified in US32 or US32D finishes,\u201d before it would concede that plaintiff has the better of the argument. We are not inclined to be that exacting.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">In view of our holdings set forth above, we do not find it necessary to reach and do not pass upon plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant was estopped to reject the Falcon lockset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, deny defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and remand the case to the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals for a determination of the equitable adjustment due plaintiff and its supplier for the wrongful rejection of the Falcon lockset, with further proceedings before this court stayed for a period of 6 months from the date hereof. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel is designated to advise the court by letter to the trial judge of the status of the remand proceedings pursuant to Rule 149(f). Attention of counsel and the board is also directed to Rule 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-14\">Section 0870, \u201cFinish Hardware,\u201d of the contract specifications provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-15\">1.

See Appendix A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1422-10\">. The contracting officer also found the lock-set\u2019s appearance objectionable, but since the board found that the Falcon lockset did meet contract specifications as to appearance, and defendant apparently accepts that finding, there is no need for us to rule on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1422-24\">.

The \u201cfabrication\u201d holding was 2 to 1, Mr. Broxton dissenting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1422-22\">. Plaintiffs reference to 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 (1976) \u2014asserting the board\u2019s interpretation was not supported by substantial evidence \u2014 is misplaced. An issue as to the meaning of language in a contract is for this court to decide independently, as no finality is attached to a conclusion of law reached by the board. <em>Allied Paint Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>470 F.2d 556, 200 Ct.Cl. 313 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1422-23\">. See Appendix A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1422-25\">.

See Appendix A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">. As we find no conflict between the contract specifications and the interim federal specifications, we need not address defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff had a duty to seek clarification of the contract provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">. See V 3.2.3 of Appendix B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">. <em>Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v.

Since we find plaintiff\u2019s interpretation reasonable, and defendant\u2019s unreasonable, there is no need to resort to the doctrine of <em>Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. v. United States, </em>109 Ct.Cl. 390, 418 (1947), that any contract provisions susceptible to more than one reasonable construction must be construed against the party who drafted the contract. As defendant points out in its cross-motion for summary judgment and opposition to plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, \u201ccontracts are not necessarily rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties disagree as to the meaning of their provisions.\u201d <em>See Southern Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>364 F.2d 439, 453, 176 Ct.Cl. 1339, 1361-62 (1966), <em>quoting Jefferson Constr. Co. v.

There was evidence before the board that the supplier made diligent but unsuccessful efforts to find a lockset of the required design and fabrication, and that the 763 Milan, thought to be of cast fabrication, was determined to be of wrought fabrication only after independent testing. This suggests that the option, provided in the interim federal specifications, had its genesis in a practical observation that neither method of fabrication offered any significant advantage over the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
