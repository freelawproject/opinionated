BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">In this case United Gas Pipe Line Company (United) and various intervenors <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contend that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has acted arbitrarily in denying recovery of costs that they \"should reasonably be able to pass on to their customers. We agree that the challenged Commission action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is unreasonable and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">\n<em>The Commission Sets The Stage: Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">This dispute began when \u2014 in the context of a critical natural gas shortage \u2014 the Commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued Order 410,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which announced the initiation of its advance payment program. Under this program interstate pipeline companies advanced funds, interest free, to producers for exploration and development of natural gas reserves. The producers, in turn, committed the gas to be developed with those funds to the individual pipeline companies that had made the advances and thus to the interstate market. To encourage the pipelines to participate and to offset the resultant costs of the program, the Commission allowed them to include the costs of the advance payments in their rate base.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-23\">In doing so the Commission explained that this method of accounting would have \u201cencouraging effects\u201d on gas supply. 44 FPC at 1143. It further stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7y\">particularly at the present time when there are indications of a natural gas shortage, it is not in the public interest for pipeline companies to bear the costs of assuring themselves and their customers a future supply of natural gas. We believe that, when it is necessary for pipeline companies to make advance payments in order to contract for gas supplies, it is equitable that the companies should earn on the amounts advanced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afk\"><em>Id. </em>at 1144.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Order 410 and its companion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>orders,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which governed the program from its inception through December 28, 1972, were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as a \u201cjustifiable experiment in the continuing search for solutions to our Nation\u2019s critical shortage of natural gas.\u201d <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>of <em>New York v. FPC, </em>1972, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 307, 317, 467 F.2d 361, 371 <em>(New York Comm\u2019n </em>I).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In late December of 1972 the Commission issued its Order 465,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which extended the advance payment program for one year, up to Dec. 31, 1973, and made specific changes regarding which costs could appropriately be included in rate base and the schedule for repayment of advances. Following a round of comments from various producers, pipelines, and affiliated companies, the Commission again extended the program, up to Dec. 31, 1975, in its Order 499.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It also announced a general policy to deny rate base treatment for advances \u201cin excess of costs for exploration and development, and production incurred by the producer within a reasonable time from the date such amounts advanced are included in the pipeline\u2019s rate base.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Before Order 499 the only guidance the Commission had offered provided that advances would be allowed in rate base if found reasonable and appropriate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">Upon review of Orders 465 and 499 the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Commission\u2019s action did not \u201camoun[t] to the kind of evaluation of the experience under the programs [required] to discharge [its] responsibility \u2018to determine [as instructed in <em>New York Comm\u2019n I, </em>467 F.2d at 371] whether its justifying objectives are being satisfactorily met at an acceptable level of ultimate economic cost to the nation\u2019s gas consumers.\u2019 \u201d 167 U.S.App.D.C. at 110, 511 F.2d at 348.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>remanded the proceeding for further consideration, but allowed the advance payment program to remain in effect pending Commission action on remand. In response to the District of Columbia\u2019s mandate, the Commission issued its Order on Remand,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> terminating the program prospectively as of December 31, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\n<em>The Star Makes Her Entrance: United\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">United participated in the Commission\u2019s advance payment program <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, in various rate proceedings, applied for rate base treatment of the costs of making advances. The proceedings in question here concerned costs incurred from April 6, 1974, through May 19, 1975 (the period). Settlement negotiations among United, the Commission staff, and United\u2019s customers ultimately resulted in a Stipulation and Agreement pursuant to which United\u2019s rates and refunds were based on United\u2019s actual operating experience during such period.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After reviewing the settlement agreement, the Commission issued Order No. 815,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in which it approved the agreement, but only with the addition of significant modifications. One of these was the denial of rate base treatment for $23,380,650 of the $79,238,960 of outstanding advances United carried during the period. Reasoning that all advances spent more than 30 days after inclusion in rate base (front-end advances) were \u201cpresumptively extravagant\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Commission found that it would be unjust and unreasonable to pass the costs on to United\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">United sought rehearing on Opinion No. 815, thus prompting the Commission\u2019s issuance of Opinion No. 815-A. In response to United\u2019s argument that the Commission had elevated its \u201cpresumption\u201d to a retroactively applied legal standard, the Commission merely stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aui\">[o]ur conclusion that a portion of United\u2019s advance payments at issue in this proceeding are unreasonable and inappropriate costs for rate making purposes reflects nothing more than our judgment on the record that the carrying cost of the advances challenged in this case should not be borne by United\u2019s consumers. The Commission has not announced a new rule and applied it retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1R\">Apparently distinguishing between the meaning of \u201creasonable\u201d in regulatory and business contexts, the Commission further added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">[t]he \u2018reasonable and appropriate\u2019 standard applied here is simply a restatement of this Commission\u2019s statutory obligation to review all pipeline expenditures in order to determine their prudence. We do <em>not </em>find that, as a matter of business acumen, United was unwise to enter into front-end advance payment agreements. We find only that under settled rate making practices these particular expenditures by United were of no present bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>fit to its customers during the locked in period involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">\n<em>The Plot Thickens: United\u2019s Claims And The Applicable Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">United now appeals to this Court, claiming that because they gave insufficient guidance regarding any timing relationship between advance and expenditure, the Commission\u2019s Orders 465 and 499 did not constitute reasonable notice of the FERC\u2019s subsequently imposed 30-day presumption. Moreover, United asserts, the Commission did not properly analyze the circumstances surrounding the advancing of the funds. The Commission counters that it has merely imposed the \u00a7 4(a) \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and has determined that in this case, considering all the record evidence, 30 days was a reasonable time to allow between the pipeline\u2019s advances and the producers\u2019 spending the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The Supreme Court has defined our responsibilities as a reviewing Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">First, [we] must determine whether the Commission\u2019s order, viewed in light of the relevant facts and of the Commission\u2019s broad regulatory duties, abused or exceeded its authority. Second, [we] must examine the manner in which the Commission has employed the methods of regulation which it has itself selected, and must decide whether each of the order\u2019s essential elements is supported by substantial evidence. Third, [we] must determine whether the order may reasonably be expected to maintain financial integrity, attract necessary capital, and fairly compensate investors for the risks they have assumed, and yet provide appropriate protection to the relevant pub-lie interests, both existing and foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">(a) All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any natural-gas company for or in connection with the transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges, shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is declared to be unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\"><em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>1968, 390 U.S. 747, 791-92, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 1373, 20 L.Ed.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">It has further instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">[a] presumption of validity . .attaches to each exercise of the Commission\u2019s expertise, and those who would overturn the Commission\u2019s judgment undertake \u201cthe heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 767, 88 S.Ct. at 1360. We are not, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">obliged to examine each detail of the Commission\u2019s decision; if the \u201ctotal effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the [Natural Gas] Act is at an end\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">We thus begin our consideration of this appeal with an examination of the context in which United made its advance payment contracts. As we have previously explained, this was \u201ca time of severe natural gas shortage when experimental programs fashioned to alleviate this problem were being implemented.\u201d <em>United Gas Pipeline Co. v. FPC, </em>1977, 179 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 551 F.2d 460. In one of these programs the Commission not only authorized but encouraged pipelines to make essentially interest free loans in order to attract natural gas supplies for interstate pipelines.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Creating the impression that it was regulating the particulars of the program,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sion modified and clarified its initial advance payment order several times between 1970 and 1973. None of these modifications, however, specified a concrete timing relationship between pipeline\u2019s advance and producer\u2019s expenditure.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">As a result of the Commission\u2019s program, advance payments became an accepted practice, indeed an essential tool,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> for pipelines attempting to contract for gas supplies. When, in Order 499, the Commission did announce its intention to impose some sort of requirement, it merely provided that the advances had to be expended within a reasonable time after their inclusion in rate base. \u201cThere was no hint whatsoever of a rigid 30-day rule or \u2018line of credit\u2019 analysis being read into Order No. 499.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>7 Cir., 1979, 590 F.2d 664 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Examining first the Order 465 advances, we find that the Commission unreasonably denied rate base treatment. The 30-day \u201cpresumption,\u201d as applied to these payments, arbitrarily imposes a new dimension and a new restraint, especially in light of other specific modifications in 465 and previous orders.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s Orders 465 and 499 provided no detail, or even broad explanatory statements, instructing the pipelines regarding a payment-expenditure relationship. The first time they really announced this requirement was in Opinions 769 and 769-A, see note 18, <em>supra. </em>The law will not tolerate this sort of after-the-fact, in fact retroactive, imposition of standards. <em>Hill v. FPC, </em>5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 355.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, there was simply no evidence either to support or justify the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>sumption of extravagance for these non-thirty day advances. The Commission stresses the testimony of Staff Witness Benna, but as we will later discuss, he did not really address the issue. We thus reverse the Commission\u2019s determination and approve the settlement agreement regarding the advances made during the period covered by Order 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Regarding the Order 499 advances we also think that the Commission imposed an unreasonably harsh standard. Admittedly, that order did impose some timing requirement, but we agree with the Seventh Circuit that this relatively vague guideline<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> did not constitute sufficient notice <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to the pipelines that they must make all advances on a 30-day installment basis.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In response to the Commission\u2019s insistence that it has not applied the 30-day \u201cpresumption\u201d as a rigid rule, we point out that since its initial application in Opinion 769,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Commission has imposed 30 days as the standard of reasonableness in every advance payments rate proceeding.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In justifying its application of presumptive invalidity in this case the FERC relied heavily on the testimony of staff witness Benna, who stated that from his two years experience working as an Engineer-Mechanical with Shell Oil Co., he had determined that most producers had to pay their bills within 30 days. Based on this information, he had concluded that 30-day installment advances would provide sufficient leeway to allow producers to finance exploration or development of new gas supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">There are a number of reasons why we conclude that this testimony carries little weight and is inadequate to support the Commission\u2019s holding. First, as United points out, Benna was not involved in Shell\u2019s accounting or financial departments. In testifying simply that producers paid current bills in thirty days, he failed to deal with the fiscal requirements of producers in undertaking the often substantial advance-commitment obligations. Even had Order 499\u2019s test<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> been the Commission\u2019s stated policy throughout the program, this reasoning \u2014 unaccompanied by other more persuasive evidence \u2014 could not have justified FERC\u2019s now disallowing front-end advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Second, the witness did not know or attempt to evaluate what costs other than the payment of current bills were incurred or accrued by each of the producers \u2014 some of which had limited financial resources \u2014 in participating as integral parts of a program of such magnitude. Indeed he as much admitted that he lacked such knowledge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>his admission that, in his studies of seven typical advance payment projects,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> less than five percent, if that many, of the advances were made in the manner in which he proposed. This testimony, standing essentially alone, does not support the Commission\u2019s action regarding United\u2019s Order 465 or 499 advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace, </em>1974, 416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134, does not aid the Commission\u2019s defense of its Orders 815 and 815-A. The Opinion does support allowance of agency discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">[it is] plain that the Board is not precluded from announcing new principles in an adjudicative proceeding and that the choice between rulemaking and adjudication lies in the first instance within the Board\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 294, 94 S.Ct. at 1771. It indicates, however, that some limits govern that discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">The possible reliance of industry on the Board\u2019s past decisions with respect to buyers does not require a different result. It has not been shown that the adverse consequences ensuing from such reliance are so substantial that the Board should be precluded from reconsidering the issue in an adjudicative proceedings. Furthermore, this is not a case in which some new liability is sought to be imposed on individuals for past actions which were taken in good-faith reliance on Board pronouncements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 295, 94 S.Ct. at 1772.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">We think that the Commission\u2019s action in Orders 815 and 815-A falls within the exception contemplated in <em>Bell Aerospace. </em>Clearly, if the orders stand, United and other pipeline companies will incur substantial unrecoverable costs in reliance on past Commission decisions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We cannot help but think that the resulting enormous yearly losses would hinder the Commission\u2019s very purpose for instituting the program.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">Having found that the Commission acted unreasonably in applying a 30-day reasonableness standard to United\u2019s Order 499 advances, we reverse the Commission\u2019s orders as they relate to those payments and remand for further Commission action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">\n<em>The Curtain Falls: Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6r\">We fully recognize the Commission\u2019s duty to protect consumers from excessive natural gas prices and more importantly, the obligation of the Commission to consider in rate fixing the continuation of an adequate supply to meet consumer\u2019s demands, both now and in the future. We also realize, however, that the pipelines are bound to provide adequate service to their customers. When the companies, with Commission blessing, have acted reasonably in incurring certain costs to obtain gas supplies, the customers will have to pay. The alternative is no gas service. The Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>recognized the pipelines\u2019 dilemma in <em>FPC v. Texaco, </em>noted <em>supra </em>417 U.S. at 393, 94 S.Ct. 2315, when it expressed concern that, in the absence of proper Commission guidance, pipelines would risk incurring unrefundable (from producers) expenses that might later be disallowed (in rate base). Indeed the Commission has already approved producer profits from the advances at issue here, thus precluding refund actions.

FPC, </em>1974, 417 U.S. 283, 94 S.Ct. 2328, 41 L.Ed.2d 72 \u2014 Opinion 499 stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfVZ\">[o]ur review of the data compiled in the Summary Report indicates that the advance payment program has continued to meet its objectives of bringing additional gas supplies into the interstate market at acceptable cost to the nation\u2019s gas consumers. The total amount of proven reserves resulting from the advance payment program has increased from 9.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in the lower 48 states noted in Order 465 to approximately 10.3 Tcf. A more significant increase has occurred in the total of potential reserves discovered within the lower 48 states which has risen from a level of 4.75 Tcf in Order 465 to a level of 9.5 Tcf in the present Summary Report. This dramatic increase in potential reserves has occurred, for the most part, as a result of advances made pursuant to contracts subject to Order No. 465. This is borne out further by a comparison of the levels of proven and potential reserves found in the first 7-8 months period under Order 441 (46 FPC 1178) and a comparable period under Order No. 465. For Order 411, the level of proven resources was .8 Tcf while under Order 465 it was .5 Tcf. However the level of <em>potential </em>reserves within the lower 48 states increased from .56 Tcf under Order 441 to 4.97 under Order 465. This increase in the level of potential reserves is due, in part, to the fact that Order No. 465 re-allowed exploratory advances while continuing to permit advances for gas development and production while advances under Order 441 were limited to gas development and production alone.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">.
