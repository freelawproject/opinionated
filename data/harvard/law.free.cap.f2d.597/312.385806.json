In the first place, appellants failed to file any requests for jury instructions and made no objections to those given. They are, therefore, precluded by Fed.R.Civ.P. 51<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from assigning as error a failure to give a specific instruction. Moreover, the transcript ordered by appellants on appeal and furnished to us does not contain the jury instructions. This is the responsibility of appellants. Fed.R.App.P. 10(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">As to the claim that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the award as to liability and damages, the appeal record does not show that a motion for a directed verdict, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a motion for a new trial was ever made. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. We have, however, examined the transcript of the trial and find sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict both as to liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Appellants did object timely and properly to the court\u2019s granting appellee\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and prejudgment interest. The motion for attorney\u2019s fees was based on P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, \u00a7 1461(6) and Rule 44.4(d) and (e) of the Puerto Rican Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Recognizing that the Puerto Rican statute and Rules of Procedure are part of the substantive law of the Commonwealth, we have allowed attorney\u2019s fees thereunder in diversity cases. <em>Fan American World Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>357 F.2d 341, 342 (1st Cir. 1966). The applicability of state statutes awarding attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses in diversity cases was established in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Finance Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). But we have never extended the allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of such costs arising under federal law. We noted this in <em>Betancourt v. J. C. Penney Co., Inc., </em>554 F.2d 1206, 1209 (1st Cir. 1977): \u201cThe federal court in a diversity case <em>although not otherwise, </em>of course recognizes the Puerto Rican rule allowing attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded specially for obstinancy, . \u201d (emphasis added). <em>See also Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago, </em>562 F.2d 114, 118 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In <em>F. C. Instrument Corp. v. Union de Tronquistas de Puerto Rico, </em>558 F.2d 607, 610 n.3 (1st Cir. 1977), we specifically stated, \u201clocal rules as to attorney\u2019s fees and other damages have no place in a \u00a7 303 action [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187].\u201d In proscribing punitive damages in section 303 cases based on peaceful union secondary activities, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">In short, this is an area \u201cof judicial decision within which the policy of the law is so dominated by the sweep of federal statutes that legal relations which they affect must be deemed governed by federal law having its source in those statutes, rather than by local law.\u201d <em>Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., </em>317 U.S. 173, 176 [63 S.Ct. 172, 174, 87 L.Ed. 165.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Union v. Morton, </em>377 U.S. 252, 261, 84 S.Ct. 1253, 1259, 12 L.Ed.2d 280 (1964). The same reasoning applies to an action such as this one brought pursuant to Chapter 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The judgment as to liability and general damages is affirmed. The judgment based on attorney\u2019s fees and prejudgment interest is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\">. Appellee also alleged violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 411 and 412, but this action has been treated by the parties and the court below as brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 and we continue to so view it. The amended complaint also alleged a cause of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. This count was dismissed by the district court and there has been no appeal from the dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\">. \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. \u201cWithin 10 days after filing the notice of appeal the appellant shall order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as he deems necessary for inclusion in the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-16\">.
