However, the majority of the panel (Judges Ainsworth and Clark) point out that this Court held in <em>United States v. Bush, </em>5 Cir., 1979, 582 F.2d 1016, 1021 (Morgan, J.) that the appropriate remedy for such a violation is \u201creturn of the . . . property, . not its suppression as evidence at trial.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Echols, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 577 F.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Thus, even had the Government \u201cabridge[d] the public\u2019s First Amendment right to access to\u201d expressive matter in this case, the proper remedy would be \u201creturn of the allegedly obscene materials\u201d to the owner, with the Government retaining sample films for evidentiary purposes, \u201cnot suppression of these items at a subsequent obscenity trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Cangiano, </em>2 Cir., 1972, 464 F.2d 320, 328, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>413 U.S. 913, 93 S.Ct. 3047, 37 L.Ed.2d 1023, <em>on remand, </em>491 F.2d 905, <em>cert. denied, </em>418 U.S. 934,94 S.Ct. 3223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1171 (1974); <em>Huffman v. United States, </em>1971, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 244, 470 F.2d 386, 392. <em>See United States v. Womack, </em>1974, 166 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 49-50 n.48, 509 F.2d 368, 382-83 n.48; <em>United States v. Sherwin, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 539 F.2d 1, 8 n.11 (en banc). <em>Cf. United States v. Alexander, </em>8 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 1169, 1176; <em>Tyrone, Inc. v. Wilkinson, </em>4 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 639, 641; <em>Metzger v. Pearcy, </em>7 Cir., 1968, 393 F.2d 202, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">We have found no decision that has deviated from the foregoing authority and that has applied the exclusionary rule under circumstances similar to those here. There was no First or Fourth Amendment violation in this ease, and therefore exclusion of the sexually explicit films from evidence in this case would have been erroneous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
