We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-27\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">Luke Air Force Base (Luke), located near Phoenix, Arizona, was established in 1941. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Jet aircraft operations began there in 1951. Over the years newly-developed jets have been placed at Luke. Luke has also been the site of training of pilots from our allies\u2019 air forces, including West German pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">On January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) went into effect. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321-4361. Beginning in September of 1974, the Government located F-15 aircraft at Luke. Prior to and during the stationing of the F-15 aircraft at Luke, the Air Force had prepared environmental impact statements (EIS).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Owners of lands near Luke filed suit through their unincorporated association against numerous federal officials involved in Luke operations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging the training of German pilots and location of the F-15 at Luke. They sought declaratory, injunctive, monetary, and mandamus relief. Their complaint contained six counts, each of which was rejected by the district court. They appeal as to four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">II. <em>Count I: Location of F-15 Aircraft at Luke</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Section 102 of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332, provides in part that all agencies of the Federal Government shall\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">(C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-12\">(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-13\">(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-14\">(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-15\">(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-16\">(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1280-17\">Pursuant to this requirement of an EIS, the Air Force had prepared an EIS dealing with its proposal to locate F \u2014 15 aircraft at Luke. Appellants\u2019 complaint alleged that the EIS did not satisfy statutory requirements. After extensive written and oral argument, a trial, and personal observations of Luke, the district court held that the Air Force\u2019s EIS satisfied statutory requirements. 415 F.Supp. 1298 (D.Ariz.1976). Appellants claim that the district court erred in three major respects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>A. <em>Incremental or Total Environmental Effects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">Appellants argue that the EIS stated only that the \u201cbeddown\u201d of the F-15 at Luke \u201cwill not cause any increased adverse environmental effects,\u201d but did not discuss the total environmental effect of Luke operations. They claim that the EIS should also discuss the pollution effects of present Luke operations (other than the F-15) so that the cumulative effect of introducing the F \u2014 15 to Luke may fully be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">In <em>County of Suffolk v. Secretary, </em>562 F.2d 1368 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1064, 98 S.Ct. 1238, 55 L.Ed.2d 764 (1978), the Second Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-6\">In making such a determination [of whether an EIS contains sufficient information to satisfy \u00a7 102(2)(C) of NEPA], a court is governed by the \u201crule of reason,\u201d under which an EIS need not be exhaustive to the point of discussing all possible details bearing on the proposed action but will be upheld as adequate if it has been compiled in good faith and sets forth sufficient information to enable the decision-maker to consider fully the environmental factors involved and to make a reasoned decision after balancing the risks of harm to the environment against the benefits to be derived from the proposed action, as well as to make a reasoned choice between alternatives. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1375; <em>see Sierra Club v. Andrus, </em>581 F.2d 895, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1978), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Andrus </em>v. <em>Sierra Club, </em>-U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 829, 59 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979). Rather than imposing a per se rule requiring detailed discussion of overall environmental effects, the rule of reason means that the inquiry is whether, and to what degree, discussion of the overall environmental impact of on-going operations is necessary reasonably to set forth sufficient information to enable the decision-maker to consider the environmental factors and to make a reasoned decision. Here the EIS stated that advent of the F-15 would not increase significantly the pollution at Luke. Under the circumstances of this case, the district court did not err in concluding that the EIS was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">Appellants cite numerous cases they read as requiring very extended discussion of the cumulative and overall effects of the F \u2014 15. However, even those cases most helpful to appellants\u2019 claim do not indicate that the EIS here was inadequate. For example, in <em>Virginians for Dulles v. Volpe, </em>541 F.2d 442, 445 (4th Cir. 1976), the Fourth Circuit held that <em>\u201cthe vastly expanded use </em>of the [Washington, D.C. area] airports requires an impact statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Illinois ex rel. Scott v. Butterfield, </em>396 F.Supp. 632 (N.D.Ill.1975), the state of Illinois sued the Federal Aviation Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Board, claiming that expansion of activities at O\u2019Hare International Airport violated NEPA. The court rejected the claim that the expansion was insulated from NEPA \u201csimply because O\u2019Hare International reached its tremendous size prior to enactment of the N.E.P.A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640. Noting that plaintiffs challenged the \u201cfurther <em>increase </em>in aircraft traffic and operations,\u201d the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-14\">[W]hile no claim would lie which compels the production of an environmental impact statement reviewing the feasibility of maintaining O\u2019Hare as a major commercial international airport in light of its reputation as a significant source of pollution, we believe a claim would lie which compels the production of a statement giving consideration to the environmental effects of activities creating increased operational growth of the Airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-16\">Here, there was no significant increase in operations producing a significant increase in pollution that could only be evaluated in the context of very detailed discussion of on-going operations. Indeed, the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>of flights at Luke has decreased since introduction of the F-15. In effect, appellants seek to turn the EIS regarding the introduction of the F-15 into an evaluation of maintaining Luke as an air force base at all. Even the authorities relied upon by appellants reject such an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">B. <em>Rationalization</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">Appellants contend that the preparation of the EIS was only a rationalization for a decision already made by the Government. They argue that NEPA requires that the decision-maker carefully consider the EIS in reaching its decision and that the Air Force\u2019s failure to do so here violates NEPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">The district court found that although the initial steps of determining to beddown the F \u2014 15 at Luke were taken before preparation of the EIS, the process of decision-making proceeded hand-in-hand with preparation and promulgation of the EIS. 415 F.Supp. at 1300-01. Also, although the Government felt that exigencies of national defense required taking steps to deploy the F-15 prior to final preparation of the EIS, the decision-makers reviewed the EIS before finalizing the F \u2014 15 decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Thus, the district court found that the Government considered the EIS in its decision-making. This finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">C. <em>Consideration of Alternatives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">The district court noted that decisions of this court indicated that the statutory requirement of consideration of alternatives did not require consideration of every imaginable alternative. Rather, \u201c \u2018the EIS need only set forth those alternatives \u201csufficient to permit a reasoned choice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 415 F.Supp. at 1302, <em>quoting Life of the Land v. Brinegar, </em>485 F.2d 460, 472 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 961, 94 S.Ct. 1979, 40 L.Ed.2d 312 (1974); <em>see Trout Unlimited v. Morton, </em>509 F.2d 1276, 1286 (9th Cir. 1974). Cognizant of that standard, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-13\">In the instant case, the \u201chard look\u201d has been taken. The EIS reveals that the Air Force made a good faith presentation of the environmental impact incident to <em>reasonable </em>alternative courses of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1282-14\">415 F.Supp. at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-15\">Appellants contend that this conclusion must be rejected because, in evaluating the alternatives, the EIS did not take into account the overall environmental effect of Luke. We have already rejected the premise of this argument. <em>See </em>part IIA <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-16\">Appellants also contend that there was evidence in the record which could be read as establishing that greater care could have been taken with respect to discussing alternatives. We decline appellants\u2019 invitation to re weigh the evidence; we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the EIS adequately discussed reasonable alternatives to bedding down the F \u2014 15 at Luke. <em>See Life of the Land, </em>485 F.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-17\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-18\">The district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-19\">Upon consideration of all of the evidence adduced at trial by all parties, it is the conclusion, of this court that the Air Force complied with the provisions of the Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in the preparation and promulgation of the Environmental Impact Statement with respect to the beddown of the F \u2014 15 aircraft</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1282-20\">415 F.Supp. at 1304. Appellants have not shown that the district court erred in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-21\">III. <em>Count II: Taking Without Just Compensation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-22\">Appellants alleged that Luke activities reduced the value of their property and thereby effected a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>Specifically, they claimed that overflights and other Luke activities interfered with their communication and enjoyment of activities like watching television and sleeping. They also claimed that noise pollution and fear of crashes reduced property values. They sought injunctive and declaratory, but not monetary, relief. The district court dismissed the claim. It also refused later to transfer the claim to the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">A. <em>Dismissal of Count II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Although acknowledging that the district court would otherwise lack jurisdiction over count II because of sovereign immunity, appellants urge that their claim falls within the exception enunciated in <em>State of Washington v. Udall, </em>417 F.2d 1310 (9th Cir. 1969). There this court indicated that under some circumstances sovereign immunity would not bar a suit claiming that Government officials had engaged in ultra vires acts, even though immunity had not otherwise been waived. <em>Id. </em>at 1316. Appellants claim that in allowing Luke activities, defendants-appellees have exceeded their statutory authority given a statute prohibiting the military from acquiring real property not owned by the United States unless properly authorized. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2676.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\"><em>State of Washington v. Udall </em>is not applicable to the instant case. First, although appellants utilize the forms of ultra vires analysis, the essence of their complaint is not that appellees have acted in an ultra vires manner and this exceeding of authority has harmed them. Rather, appellants claim that the Luke activities \u2014 whether ultra vires or not \u2014 annoy them and harm property values. Thus, <em>State of Washington v. Udall, </em>concerned with affording persons a method of challenging ultra vires acts by Government officials, is not relevant here. <em>See </em>417 F.2d at 1316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">Second, this court has noted an exception to the <em>State of Washington v. Udall </em>exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine. In <em>State of Washington </em>v. <em>Udall, </em>the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-12\">[T]he purposes [of] the doctrine of sovereign immunity may be controlling in some suits ... so that the suits must be dismissed as suits against the Government, even though the officers were not acting pursuant to valid statutory authority, because the relief sought would work an intolerable burden on governmental functions, outweighing any consideration of private harm. In such cases a party must be denied all judicial relief other than that available in a possible action for damages. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1318. Later cases have indicated that the court must balance the burden on governmental functions against the private harm if immunity is found. <em>See, e. g., Martinez v. Marshall, </em>573 F.2d 555, 560-61 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>De Lao v. Califano, </em>560 F.2d 1384, 1391 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-14\">In the instant case appellants prayed for, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-15\">An order permanently restraining the defendants . . . from operating . any . . . aircraft, from Luke Air Force Base in such a way as to deprive the plaintiffs of the enjoyment and use of their interest in real property as a result of noise pollution caused by said aircraft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-18\">Although the cry of \u201cnational defense\u201d cannot justify Government illegality, we note that appellants\u2019 requested relief would impinge upon a serious national matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-19\">On the other hand, if sovereign immunity is found, appellants\u2019 injury is not severe. Appellants do not deny that they could have sued for just compensation under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>appellant has in the past received compensation for an avigation easement resulting from Luke activities. <em>Tal Wi-Wi Ranchers, </em>156 Ct.Cl. 700 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">We conclude that the exception to sovereign immunity provided by <em>State of Washington v. Udall </em>does not apply to the present case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed count II of appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">B. <em>Transfer to the Court of Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">Appellants asked the district court to transfer their claim to the Court of Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c). This request came about nine months after count II was dismissed. The district court refused to transfer the cause. Appellants now contend that transferring is necessary so that they can avoid the statute of limitations which would otherwise bar a new action in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Transfer to the Court of Claims rests within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See Sherar v. Harless, </em>561 F.2d 791, 795 n.10 (9th Cir. 1977). Though the district court should carefully consider the effect of the statute of limitations, <em>id. </em>at 794, in view of the passing of nine months we do not believe the district court abused its discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">IV. <em>Count IV: FAA Control Over Military Noise Pollution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">Count IV alleged that under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended by the Noise Control Act of 1972, the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (Administrator and FAA) had a non-discretionary duty to regulate the use of airspace by military aircraft so as to control noise pollution and safety hazards. Claiming that the Secretary and Administrator had not performed this duty, appellants prayed that the court order them to issue regulations controlling military aircraft noise. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that FAA jurisdiction over military aircraft is limited to air traffic control and does not encompass regulation of military aircraft noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">On appeal appellants now claim that two statutory provisions confer jurisdiction upon the FAA to regulate military aircraft noise: \u00a7 611 of the Federal Aviation Act as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431, and \u00a7 307 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-12\">A. <em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-13\">Section 1431(b)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-14\">In order to afford present and future relief and protection to the public . . . from aircraft noise and sonic boom, the FAA . . . shall prescribe . such regulations as the FAA may find necessary to provide for the control and abatement of aircraft noise and sonic boom .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-16\">Noting the great congressional concern with noise pollution that led to the Noise Control Act of 1972, of which this provision is a part, appellants contend that \u00a7 1431(b)(1) grants the FAA jurisdiction to control military aircraft noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-17\">Although \u00a7 1431(b)(1) does not on its face expressly exclude FAA control over military aircraft noise, it must be so read. First, the legislative history of \u00a7 1431(b)(1) indicates that Congress intended to deal with noise from civilian and not military aircraft. <em>See, e. g., </em>S.Rep.No.1160, 92 Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S. Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4655, 4661-63, 4668 (report on Noise Control Act of 1972); S.Rep.No.1353, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1968] U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2688, 2692 (report on Aircraft Noise Abatement amendments to Federal Aviation Act of 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-18\">Second, Congress placed \u00a7 1431 in Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>amended, cognizant that Title VI, entitled \u201cSafety Regulation of Civil Aeronautics,\u201d authorizes FAA control only over civilian aircraft. The Aircraft Noise Abatement amendments of 1968 added \u00a7 1431 to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. P.L. No. 90-411, \u00a7 1, 82 Stat. 395. The Senate Report on these amendments noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-5\">Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act, within the framework of which this legislation will operate, applies only to civil aircraft, excluding thereby U. S. military aircraft. FAA issues no certificates for aircraft operated by the military departments. The committee believes that the division between military and civil aircraft should be preserved with respect to noise standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">S.Rep.No.1353, at 2692. Later the Noise Control Act of 1972 provisions dealing with aircraft noise pollution were enacted as amendments to \u00a7 1431, still a part of Title VI. P.L. No. 92-574, \u00a7 7(b), 86 Stat. 1239-41. By contrast, when Congress wished to extend FAA <em>air traffic control </em>to military aircraft, it moved the statutory provision authorizing FAA air traffic control from Title VI to a different title of the Act applicable to both civil and military aircraft. H.Rep.No.2360, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1958] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3741, 3756.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-7\">Finally, this court has recently written: [T]hough the courts remain the final interpreters of an act of Congress [citations omitted], the courts have also repeatedly recognized that an administrative agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute it administers is deserving of considerable respect. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeS\"><em>Smith v. Califano, </em>597 F.2d 152, 156 (9th Cir. 1979). In the instant case the Secretary and Administrator have consistently not applied \u00a7 1431(b)(1) to military aircraft noise. \u201cWe are thus most reluctant to disregard the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 1431(b)(1) does not authorize the FAA to control noise pollution resulting from military aircraft flights from Luke.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">B. <em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-14\">Section 1348(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-15\">The Administrator is further authorized and directed to prescribe air traffic rules and regulations governing the flight of aircraft, for the navigation, protection, and identification of aircraft, for the protection of persons and property on the ground, and for the efficient utilization of the navigable airspace, including rules as to safe altitudes of flight and rules for the prevention of collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land and water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-16\">Noting that the Government agrees that this provision, not in Title VI, applies to both military and civilian aircraft,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> appellants claim that it authorizes and directs the FAA to control noise pollution from military aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Subsection (c) does not mention noise pollution. Labelled \u201cAir traffic rules\u201d and appearing in a section entitled \u201cAirspace control and facilities,\u201d the language of the subsection appears to deal with air traffic control in the sense of directing the flow of air traffic. <em>See United States v. Christensen, </em>419 F.2d 1401, 1403-04 (9th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Moreover, the legislative history of this provision indicates that it was enacted, not to deal with noise pollution, but rather in response to \u201ca series of \u2018fatal air crashes between civil and military aircraft operating under separate flight rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1404, <em>quoting </em>H.Rep.No.2360, at 3742. The subsection was thus directed at locating within the Federal Aviation Agency the \u201cauthority to regulate the use of all airspace over the United States by both civil and military aircraft, and to establish and operate a unified system of air-traffic control.\u201d H.Rep.No.2360, at 3745.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Finally, Congress placed the 1972 provision dealing explicitly with noise pollution in \u00a7 1431, even though, as part of Title VI, \u00a7 1431 applies only to nonmilitary aircraft. <em>See </em>part IVA <em>supra. </em>It would be inconsistent to say that \u00a7 1348(c), enacted in 1958, was meant to deal with noise pollution from military aircraft when Congress placed the provisions of the Noise Control Act of 1972 dealing with aircraft noise in a section and title applicable only to nonmilitary aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">C. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Neither \u00a7 1431(b)(2) nor \u00a7 1348(c) grants the FAA authority to control noise pollution from military aircraft. <em>A fortiori </em>these provisions do not confer a non-discretionary duty upon the Secretary or Administrator to issue regulations dealing with noise pollution from military aircraft using Luke. Because as a matter of law the Government was entitled to prevail on this claim, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. See <em>Loya v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>583 F.2d 1110, 1113-14 (9th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">V. <em>Count VI: Environmental Impact Statement and German Training</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">Count VI alleged that a 1971 agreement between the United States Government and the Federal Republic of Germany for training of German air force pilots at Luke constituted a \u201cmajor federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d and that therefore an EIS had to be prepared. <em>See </em>NEPA \u00a7 102, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332. Because none was prepared, appellants asked the district court to enjoin the training until preparation of an EIS. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the 1971 agreement was not a \u201cmajor federal action significantly affecting\u201d the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">A. <em>Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-14\">The parties agree that an EIS is required only for \u201clegislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d NEPA \u00a7 102(2)(C), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C); <em>see </em>Conf.Rep.No.765, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1969] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2767, 2769; <em>Port of Astoria, Oregon v. Hodel, </em>595 F.2d 467, 476 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-15\">In the district court the Government supported its motion for summary judgment with extensive papers and affidavits. The Government summarized its supporting papers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>The decision to train German pilots in the F \u2014 104 at Luke AFB was made prior [to the effective date of the NEPA, January 1, 1970]. That this decision was final is demonstrated by the fact that the training has remained at Luke AFB for its entire duration of over ten years, with only minor alterations having been made in certain areas of emphasis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The Government continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-6\">[T]he training of German F \u2014 104 pilots at Luke has remained essentially the same since the beginning of training in 1964 except for the fact that since 1974 the F-104 operations at Luke have been decreasing [and will end in fiscal 1982]. The 1971 agreement was not meant to, and did not result in, any change in the operations of the F-104 at Luke AFB. Since the agreement did not cause any change in the F-104 operations at Luke, it is clear that the \u201cquality of the human environment in the vicinity of Luke AFB\u201d was not affected by the decision to enter into the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">Finally, the Government\u2019s papers established that the 1971 agreement between the United States and Germany \u201cwas merely a formalization of the understanding that had previously evolved between [the countries].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Standing on their prior papers, appellants did not file affidavits in opposition to those filed by the Government. Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-9\">When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his <em>response, </em>by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, <em>must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">(Emphasis added.) This court has read this provision as meaning that if facts stated in the supporting papers of the movant are not contradicted by facts stated in the supporting papers of the opponent of the summary judgment motion, then the facts so stated in the movant\u2019s papers are taken as true for purposes of determining the propriety of summary judgment. <em>Jones v. Halekulani Hotel, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 1308, 1310 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">Because appellants did not \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d the facts set forth in the Government\u2019s supporting papers are uncontroverted and must be taken as true. The remaining question is whether, accepting those facts as true, the Government is entitled to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">B. <em>Effect of NEPA on On-going Projects</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-14\">The effective date of NEPA was January 1, 1970. As a general matter, NEPA was not to be given retroactive effect. <em>See San Francisco Tomorrow v. Romney, </em>472 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1973). In the present case the Government\u2019s uncontroverted papers establish that the decision to train German pilots at Luke was made long before 1970. The papers also establish that training of German pilots began long before 1970. The critical question is whether the formalization of the German-American training program through the 1971 diplomatic agreement constituted a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d affecting the environment in view of the prior decision and training activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-15\">In some cases this court has found that a project, begun prior to the effective date of NEPA, had progressed so far that what remained could not be considered a \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d In other cases, this court has found that federal participation in completing a project begun before the effective date but not completed by that date was substantial enough to constitute a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d requiring an EIS. <em>See Cady v. Morton, </em>527 F.2d 786, 794 n.6 (9th Cir. 1975). As we wrote in <em>San Francisco Tomorrow :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>The controlling question ... is whether or not subsequent to January 1, 1970, some further major action which would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, was required of the Federal Government .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">472 F.2d at 1024; <em>see Port of Astoria, </em>595 F.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Although such a determination will, of necessity, depend heavily upon the unique factual circumstances of each case, prior decisions suggest that here there was no further major federal action. In <em>San Francisco Tomorrow </em>we rejected the claim that amendatory contracts to an otherwise completed project constituted a major federal action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-6\">Amendatory contracts which increase the federal funding only to provide for the rising costs ... do not constitute \u201cfurther major federal action\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Instead, such amendments represent but confirmation of the Federal Government\u2019s earlier decision .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1025. Similarly, in <em>Robinswood Community Club v. Volpe, </em>506 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir. 1974), we wrote in relation to the application of NEPA to a highway project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-8\">Once the engineering design stage is finalized, the plan, the implementation of which results in an impact on the environment, has been completed. Each house that is moved, each mound of dirt that is excavated, each ribbon of concrete that is laid has an impact on the environment, but that impact is determined by the plan already adopted. Of course, the government will have substantial participation in the project subsequent to January 1,1970. But mere participation is not enough. The real question is whether the government\u2019s continued participation constitutes <em>\u201cfurther </em>major Federal actions having a significant effect on the environment . . . .\u201d 36 Fed.Reg. 7727 (1971) (emphasis added). After final design approval, nothing <em>further </em>occurs which (1) is major and (2) has a significant effect on the environment other than what is contemplated by the approved design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-14\">In the present case the United States and Germany approved the \u201cdesign\u201d of the Ger-man training long before the effective date of NEPA. The pollution resulting from the German training is \u201cwhat is contemplated by the\u201d understanding to train. That the understanding was formalized by the 1971 agreement did not affect the pollution produced by the training; the 1971 agreement was \u201cbut confirmation of the Federal Government\u2019s earlier decision . . . .\u201d <em>San Francisco Tomorrow, </em>472 F.2d at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-16\">Indeed, ours is a more compelling case in which to find no major federal action than <em>Robinswood Community Club </em>or <em>San Francisco Tomorrow. </em>While <em>Robinswood Community Club </em>intimates that approval of the design suffices to avoid further major federal action, in the present case a large portion of the implementation of that design\u2014 the training of the German pilots \u2014 has already taken place, and in the same manner as the future training of German pilots; in fact, the Government\u2019s uncontroverted papers indicate that the total number of training flights is decreasing. And while <em>San Francisco Tomorrow </em>stated that an amendatory contract did not constitute a major federal action, here the Government\u2019s papers established that the 1971 agreement did not significantly amend the understanding between Germany and the United States, but rather \u201cconfirmed\u201d the pre-existing understanding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>We conclude, then, that given the uncontroverted facts presented by the Government\u2019s papers, the 1971 agreement did not constitute a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d requiring promulgation of an EIS. Because the Government was entitled to prevail as a matter of law, the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of the Government was proper. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), (e); <em>Loya, </em>583 F.2d at 1113-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Having determined that the district court properly rejected appellants\u2019 claims, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1279-16\">. For a more detailed statement of the facts underlying this appeal, see the district court\u2019s published opinion, 415 F.Supp. 1298 (D.Ariz. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">. Named as defendants were the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, Wing Commander of Luke Air Force Base, Commander of Luke Air Force Base, Secretary of Transportation, and Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. We will refer to these defendants-appellees as the \u201cGovernment,\u201d distinguishing any of them only as relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">Appellants also named as defendant Major Armand Schmidt of the Air Force of the Federal Republic of Germany. Although appellants filed their appeal as to Major Schmidt as well as the American officials, they indicated that they did not disagree with the district court\u2019s actions as to Major Schmidt. Accordingly, this court prior to oral argument dismissed the appeal as it pertained to Major Schmidt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">. Appellants also contend that there was evidence from which one could draw inferences different from those drawn by the district court. They have not shown, however, that the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-19\">Appellants also argue that the district court, in writing its opinion, improperly copied \u201cnearly verbatim the arguments submitted by the federal defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment . . .\u201d Although this court has warned of the dangers of summarily adopting the proposed findings of the victorious party, <em>see Industrial Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., </em>437 F.2d 1336, 1339-40 (9th Cir. 1971), if the content of the district court\u2019s opinion is not erroneous, we do not believe the <em>source </em>of that opinion should taint it. Moreover, we note that in this case the district court carefully modified the Government\u2019s arguments as it felt proper, thereby dispelling the fear that the district court too readily accepted the victors\u2019 words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-21\">Appellants contend lastly that the district court erred because its opinion did not expressly respond to or comment upon every factual and legal argument made by appellants. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>do not believe that the district court has an obligation to address explicitly every point raised by the parties. The district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion adequately stated the facts found and the court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">. We assume <em>arguendo </em>that NEPA requires that the decision-maker carefully consider the EIS. We do not address the Government\u2019s contention that as long as the EIS satisfies the technical requirements of NEPA, the attention paid to it by the decision-maker is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">. Given our conclusion <em>infra, </em>we do not determine if appellees\u2019 conduct violated this statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">. Appellants contend that the statute of limitations would now bar them from filing a Tucker Act claim in the Court of Claims. We do not believe that appellants\u2019 failure to pursue in a timely manner their proper legal remedies warrants a different conclusion. To find an exception because of the passing of the limitations period would be to reward appellants for their slothfulness. This result is reinforced because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>appellants were also dilatory in pursuing another possible avenue of recovery of monetary damages: transfer to the Court of Claims. <em>See </em>part IIIB <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1284-19\">. Having so determined, we do not address the Government\u2019s contentions that appellants would in any event not be entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">. Congress noted of Title VI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-9\">The authority of the Administrator under this title with respect to prescribing minimum rules and regulations and standards of safety is expressly limited to civil aircraft. For this reason, section 601(a)(7) of existing law (relating to the authority of the Administrator to prescribe air-traffic rules) has been omitted from this title and such authority is now contained in section 307(c) of title III . and applies to both civil and military aircraft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKn\">H.Rep.No.2360, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1958] U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3741, 3756.

Moreover, the FAA forecasts that passengers will increase in number from 10,300,000 in 1972 to 16,000,000 in 1980 at National and from 2,465,000 to 7,658,000 at Dulles.

Moreover, the Government\u2019s papers established that the number of training flights after 1970 would be equal to or less than the number undertaken before 1970, unlike the significant increase in the operations at National and Dulles airports.
