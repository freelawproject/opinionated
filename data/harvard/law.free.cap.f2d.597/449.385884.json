It appears to be one of first or near-first impression and hence, though we agree with the disposition made below, we write briefly to explain our affirmance. Since the text of the statutes concerned lends itself to several interpretations, we have sought to follow that which we think expresses congressional intent. As to the prospective application of these taxes, at least, a consideration of almost equal importance to correctly divining that intent is that we should arrive at a clear and workable interpretation of these somewhat doubtful provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">First, a few facts. Taxpayer produces and markets retreaded tires. The first step in the manufacturing process is to get and clean a used-tire casing, buffing off the remaining original tread to ready it for the new. Next, new tread rubber \u2014 the subject of this tax \u2014 is applied to the tire surface by an extruding machine. Finally, the old casing and new rubber are placed in a curing mold, where heat bonds them together and imprints the new tread.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Tread rubber is wasted at several stages of this process, and the major question presented by this appeal is what, if any, of this wasted rubber should be taxed. Some of it is lost through accretions to the ex-truder head, some is ruined by scorching; the United States does not claim a tax on this rubber. It does, however, seek to tax that lost by application to tires that fail final inspection and to those destroyed by testing for quality control. The taxpayer resists and seeks as well to obtain a credit for rubber remaining on tires returned under warranty. It prevailed below, except as to the warranty items.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">The statutory scheme imposes on manufacturers a tax of a nickel a pound on tread rubber used in retreading tires \u201cof the type used on highway vehicles,\u201d exempting that used \u201cotherwise.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The phrases quoted are critical. Obviously they exclude from taxation rubber used on tires unsuited for highway service, and this the government concedes. The difficulty arises as to tread rubber applied in confecting such a retreaded tire as would be \u201cof the type used on highway vehicles\u201d but which does not survive the manufacturing process. This may happen, as we note above, either when the tire does not come out right and fails inspection or when it is selected as a specimen for testing quality and destroyed by examination. Are these \u201cof the type\u201d? If so, the tread rubber used on them is taxable; \u201cotherwise\u201d it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">Both parties make arguments, among others, focussing on the time and place at which the condition of these tires is to be determined. The United States focusses on the extruder head. Here, it contends, is where the tread rubber is \u201cused\u201d; and if at this stage the partly confected recap is \u201cof the type\u201d from which a highway model can be made, the rubber on it is taxable. This interpretation is administratively feasible and probably economically so, as well; doubtless the tax on the wasted tire rubber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>will simply \u2014 like the cost of these wasted tires themselves \u2014 be apportioned among the acceptable products as a cost of doing business. We cannot accept it, however. In the first place, at this second stage of the manufacturing process, the casing and rubber are simply not a tire at all, let alone one \u201cof the type,\u201d etc. They may or may not become one; whether they will cannot be known for various reasons. One of these reasons, in the second place, is that whether the tire will be \u201cof the type\u201d is determined not at the second stage of the process but at the third, where the tread is imprinted. If at that stage the tire becomes a \u201cracing slick,\u201d for example, it is not suitable for highway use, being given an essentially treadless configuration suitable for maximum traction on dry surfaces but not for general road use. The same is true of lug-type treads, designed for rough ground and mud but producing undesirable vibration at normal highway speeds. These considerations are, indeed, recognized by the government in a Revenue Ruling with which its present contentions appear to conflict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Taxpayer, on the other hand, seeks to focus on the tires in question \u2014 the defective and test specimens \u2014 as they exist after they have been found to fail inspection, or after testing in the case of the specimens. At this time their sidewalls are slashed to prevent their use. After this, they are manifestly not \u201cof the type.\u201d The difficulty with this particular mechanical approach is that the specimen tires, at least, were unquestionably serviceable tires \u201cof the type\u201d on which tread rubber was \u201cused\u201d before the taxpayer deliberately destroyed them. Whether the defective tires were \u201cof the type\u201d before being slashed is more questionable, but some at least would doubtless have served their time, or part of it, without incident, like those returned under warranty after partial attrition of their treads by highway service.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Thus, neither time-focussed argument satisfies entirely. Nor does the statute specify any particular time in the process of manufacture \u2014 and surely inspection and testing are necessary parts of that process \u2014 at which we are to view the tires as \u201cof the type\u201d or as \u201cotherwise.\u201d We are therefore driven behind the statutes\u2019 phraseology to the concerns that prompted them. What was Congress trying to do by its riddling reference to tires <em>of the type </em>used on highway vehicles? We conclude from the legislative history that it sought to measure the incidence of this tax as closely as is administratively feasible (and no closer) by actual wear and tear on the highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Representative portions of this history point in this direction, and we have found none indicating otherwise. The tax on tread rubber was enacted as part of the Highway Revenue Act of 1956, which created the Highway Trust Fund and allocated what committee reports of both houses called \u201chighway user taxes\u201d such as this fund. H.R.Rep.No.2022, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1956-2 Cum.Bull. 1285, 1287); S.Rep.No.2054, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1956-2 Cum.Bull. 1308, 1309); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1956, p. 2822. Not all taxes so allocated arise from actual highway use, but some do and all are on related uses \u2014 fuels, accessories, tires, etc. As to the tax under consideration, Congress recognized that <em>actual </em>use of a tire or retread on the highways was not a practical criterion, since actual use could not feasibly be</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>monitored. Hence, it adopted \u201cof the type\u201d in an effort to come as close to measuring the tax by actual use as was administratively feasible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ael\">The additional tire tax and also the new tax on tread rubber have been restricted to tires of the type used on highway vehicles (or tread rubber for recapping these tires) because Title II of both the House and your committee\u2019s version of this bill is designed to raise revenue for a highway program. It is necessary to base the additional taxes on \u201ctires of the type used on highway vehicles\u201d because of the difficult administrative problems which would be involved in attempting to base the tax on the actual use to which the tires are placed. For example, it would not be possible to determine finally the use to which a tire might be placed until that tire was worn out since, although initially placed on a nonhighway vehicle, it could readily be transferred to a highway vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">H.R.Rep.No.10660, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (1956-2 Cum.Bull. 1312). Congress meant, then, to come as close to taxing only tread rubber used on the highways as it practically could. Bearing this principle in mind, we return to our case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Tires destroyed in the manufacturing process never see and never wear on the roads. It is perfectly feasible, administratively, to exempt them and entirely consistent with one tenable reading of the statute: their sidewalls slashed at the end of the process, they are not \u201cof the type.\u201d We conclude that rubber applied to them should not be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">As for highway-type tires returned under warranty after partial use, an exemption for unused tire rubber remaining on them would also be consistent with the legislative intent that we divine. Indeed, it would be the interpretation of the statute most consistent with that intent. In addition, it would be consistent with the tax treatment of new tires so returned, on which a proportionate credit is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Nevertheless, we cannot adopt it. Such tires have actually been used on the highways. We cannot say that they are not \u201cof the type\u201d; they <em>are </em>of it, and they have been so used. The statute makes no reference to tires which are at one time \u201cof the type\u201d and at a later time are not. To be sure, the destroyed test specimens arguably fit this category; but these are destroyed in the course of the manufacturing process, and the statute seems, implicitly at least, to focus on that process. This has long ended by the time partly used tires are returned from actual service on the roads. Admittedly, a reading of the statute to allow a credit for tread rubber remaining on such returned tires is possible: at the time of their return for defects, they are no longer tires \u201cof the type.\u201d But the statutes make no reference to tires that are partially \u201cof the type\u201d but not wholly. Weighing such indications of legislative intent as we have found against the language of the statutes, we do not feel warranted in going so far in the face of their terminology as such a result would require. If Congress concludes we have followed its statutory language too slavishly, it can change that language. We cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">I.R.C. \u00a7 4071.
