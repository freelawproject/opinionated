After exhausting his state remedies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nero petitioned federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He alleged that in the state proceeding against him he had been denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The district court concluded that Nero\u2019s counsel had been reasonably effective and denied his petition. Nero appeals that denial. We agree with Nero that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-18\">During the closing argument in Nero\u2019s armed robbery trial, Nero\u2019s attorney noted that police witnesses had referred to Nero as a \u201cpolice character.\u201d Nero\u2019s attorney informed the jury that Nero did have a police record and that he had not put Nero on the stand because he had not wanted that record to come out. The prosecutor stated in his closing argument that since Nero\u2019s attorney had brought up Nero\u2019s record, he would tell the jury something about it. He then stated that Nero had been convicted twice before for burglary and once on heroin charges. Nero\u2019s attorney objected to the mention of the heroin conviction because he claimed that Nero had not been convicted of that crime. The prosecutor agreed to withdraw the reference to the heroin conviction, and the trial court, at the request of Nero\u2019s attorney, instructed the jury to disregard the heroin conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Nero claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to move for a mistrial when the court would have automatically granted one. According to Nero, the prosecutor\u2019s statements relating to Nero\u2019s past convictions were inadmissible; and because they were made within the hearing of the jury, Nero was entitled to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">The rule in Louisiana is that the state may not introduce evidence of other crimes committed by an accused unless the evidence comes within a specific statutory provision authorizing its admission. <em>State v. Ledet, </em>345 So.2d 474, 477 (La.1977); <em>State v. Prieur, </em>277 So.2d 126, 128 (La.1973). Under the only statutory provisions which could conceivably be applicable in this case, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15:445 and 15:446,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the state must show \u201cthat the evidence of other crimes is not merely repetitive and cumulative is not a subterfuge for depicting the defendant\u2019s bad character or his propensity for bad behavior, and that it serves the actual purpose for which it is offered.\u201d <em>State v. Ledet, </em>345 So.2d 474, 478 (La.1977). In addition, the state must follow certain procedural rules for admitting the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghoram, </em>290 So.2d 850, 851-52 (La. 1974). In this case the state did none of this. We therefore conclude that the evidence of Nero\u2019s past convictions was inadmissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-18\">Under article 770 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure, the judge must order a mistrial, upon the defendant\u2019s motion, if the district attorney makes comments within the hearing of the jury relating to \u201c[ajnother crime committed ... by the defendant as to which evidence is not admissible.\u201d La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. art. 770 (West 1967). Thus, in this case, the Louisiana court would have declared a mistrial had Nero\u2019s attorney requested one. The attorney, however, did not make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>necessary motion because he was unaware that Nero was entitled to a mistrial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">To decide if Nero was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because of his attorney\u2019s failure to request a mistrial, we must examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances and the entire record\u201d to see \u201cwhether reasonably effective assistance was rendered.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>565 F.2d 881, 887 (5th Cir. 1978). Appellee argues that under our totality of the circumstances test, the failure of Nero\u2019s counsel to request a mistrial cannot alone render his assistance ineffective. We disagree. Sometimes a single error is so substantial that it alone causes the attorney\u2019s assistance to fall below the sixth amendment standard. This case presents such an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">We can hardly imagine anything more prejudicial to Nero than allowing the jury in his armed robbery case to hear the prosecutor\u2019s comments that Nero had been convicted twice before of burglary and once on drug charges. The jury may well have convicted Nero of the charged offense because it was aware of his prior convictions. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>340 So.2d 1294, 1296 (La.1976). It is because of the extreme prejudice of remarks relating to inadmissible convictions that article 770 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure allows the defendant to move for an automatic mistrial when these remarks have been made in the presence of the jury. La.Code Crim.Pro.Ann. art. 770 (West 1967). These remarks are so prejudicial that the official comments to article 770 note that they \u201cnormally are not cured and cannot be cured by an admonition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Nonetheless article 770 provides that if the defendant requests that only an admonition be given, \u201cthe court shall admonish the jury to disregard the remark or comment,- but shall not declare a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Appellee argues that since Nero\u2019s attorney did request an admonition \u2014 an alternative specifically provided by article 770 \u2014the attorney\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial cannot be constitutionally deficient. We agree that if an attorney makes a reasonable tactical decision to request an admonition instead of a mistrial, his action will not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. However, this did not happen in Nero\u2019s case. Nero\u2019s attorney clearly was not making a tactical decision since he was unaware that Nero was entitled to a mistrial. Moreover, Nero\u2019s attorney only requested an admonition as to the heroin conviction. The jury was therefore free to consider that Nero had twice before been convicted of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Nero\u2019s attorney allowed the State to introduce inadmissible evidence of Nero\u2019s past convictions. The attorney failed to move for a mistrial when the court would have automatically granted one. This error by Nero\u2019s attorney is crucial since the evidence of past convictions is so prejudicial that it can render the entire trial fundamentally unfair. For these reasons we hold that Nero was denied the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment. We reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case with instructions that the district court order the petitioner released from custody if he is not retried within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed Nero\u2019s conviction, <em>State v. Nero, </em>319 So.2d 303 (La. 1975), and Nero was denied relief on his sixth amendment claim in his state habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1056-19\">. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-20\">\n<em>BY MR. GROSZ [PROSECUTOR] DURING CLOSING ARGUMENT:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-21\"><em>* * * </em>After Mr. Kabacoff [defense attorney] has brought out about his criminal rec-</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ord, let me tell you something about his criminal record, gentlemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">\n<em>BY MR. KABACOFF:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Your honor, I\u2019m going to object to this. He\u2019s not allowed to do it. I\u2019ve already told them that he has a criminal record, and I think they realize it, and I\u2019d be glad to tell them the crimes he\u2019s been convicted of and let it go at that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">\n<em>BY MR. GROSZ:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">If you don\u2019t mind, Mr. Kabacoff. Starting off in 1967, convicted of attempted burglary and received six months. 1971 went to Angola for a year for burglary. 1971 he made the big jump. Went to Angola for three years for heroin. Then 1972 .</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">\n<em>BY MR. KABACOFF:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Your honor, I\u2019m going to object to that last conviction. He has not been convicted of that crime .</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">\n<em>MR. GROSZ:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">I\u2019ll withdraw it, your honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-14\">\n<em>BY MR. KABACOFF:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">Regardless, the jury has heard it. I would like you to instruct them not to pay any attention to it and disregard it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">. The evidence of Nero\u2019s past convictions was clearly not introduced as part of the res gestae under La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 15:447. Nor was it introduced for impeachment purposes under La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15:481 &amp; 15:495. The only other statutory provisions authorizing admission of extrinsic offense evidence are La.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15:445 &amp; 15:446 which provide that evidence of similar offenses may be admissible under certain circumstances to show the defendant\u2019s knowledge, intent, or system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1057-20\">. The fact that the prosecutor mentioned Nero\u2019s past convictions in closing argument, after the defense attorney had stated that Nero had a record, should not affect their admissibility. <em>State v. Ghoram, </em>290 So.2d 850, 853 (La. 1974) held that \u201cthe rules applicable to the introduction or prior offenses under R.S. 15:445 and 15:446 apply at every stage of the trial, including the State\u2019s . . . rebuttal.\u201d And, as we have stated, the State did not comply with these rules. Furthermore, we don\u2019t think the mere statement that Nero had a record, made by Nero\u2019s attorney to explain the references to Nero as a \u201cpolice character,\u201d \u201copened the door\u201d to the introduction of Nero\u2019s past convictions. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>332 So.2d 251, 253 (La. 1976); <em>State y. Hunt, </em>310 So.2d 563, 568 (La. 1975). Such a construction would go against Louisiana\u2019s policy of allowing the State to introduce extrinsic offense evidence only when the evidence fulfills certain conditions and the state follows certain procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-22\">But even if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were held to be admissible on the theory that Nero\u2019s attorney had \u201copened the door\u201d or had, by his comments, agreed to their admission, <em>see </em>footnote 2 <em>supra, </em>it would not change our conclusion in this case. We would consider the conduct of Nero\u2019s attorney in \u201copening the door\u201d or in agreeing to the admission of these convictions as further evidence that Nero did not receive effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">. In Nero\u2019s supplemental motion for a new trial, Nero\u2019s attorney stated that he was a civil attorney with very little criminal experience and at the time of trial he was not aware of Nero\u2019s right to a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
