CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In the bankruptcy sale that generated this appeal, the bankruptcy court refused to confirm Mr. Abbotoni\u2019s bid of $23,333, which was both the only and the highest timely bid at public auction. Instead it extended the bidding period upon receiving a late offer from Mr. Winchenback for $26,-200. The court subsequently confirmed sale to Mr. Winchenback for $28,350, which was the highest bid submitted during the bidding extension. Mr. Abbotoni appealed, and the district court affirmed. After careful consideration of the arguments made on this appeal, we affirm the decision below for essentially the reasons set forth by the district court in its thoughtful analysis. While the case is perhaps close, we agree that the bankruptcy court acted within the scope of its broad discretion in extending the period for filing sealed bids and in confirming the sale to Mr. Winchenback for $28,350.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">We add only a few observations. The policy favoring confirmation of a bankruptcy sale to the highest bidder at a fairly conducted public auction gives way to the goal of benefitting the bankrupt estate and its creditors when the sale price would be \u201cgrossly inadequate.\u201d <em>Munro Drydock, Inc. v. M/V Heron, </em>585 F.2d 13, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">\u201c[G]ross inadequacy is said to exist when \u2014 apart from situations involving fraud or unfairness, which is not the case here \u2014 there is a substantial disparity between the highest bid and the appraised or fair market value, and \u2018there is a reasonable degree of probability that a substantially better price will be obtained by a resale . . . .\u2019 4B Collier on Bankruptcy 170.98[17] at 1192 (14th ed. 1978); <em>Reid v. King, </em>157 F.2d 868, 870-71 (4th Cir. 1946).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 15. Here, the bankruptcy court was entitled to find, as it did, that a substantial disparity existed between Mr. Abbotoni\u2019s $23,333 bid and the fair market value of the property. It is true that the $38,500 appraisal upon which the bankruptcy court relied was not made by an appraiser appointed by the court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(f) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 606(a), but instead by an appraiser secured by the Small Business Administration \u2014 the sole interested creditor. But there was no objection to the introduction of that appraised value, and appellant \u2014 despite opportunity\u2014 presented no evidence that the appraisal was incorrect. That appraisal was the sole evidence in the record of the property\u2019s fair market value, and the bankruptcy court was by virtue of its familiarity with the property and the surrounding circumstances in a good position to evaluate its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Similarly, we cannot say the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in concluding that a substantially better price probably would be obtained by a resale. While Mr. Winchenback\u2019s initial bid of $26,200 may not have represented an extraordinary increase over Mr. Abbotoni\u2019s timely bid of $23,333, <em>compare Munro Drydock, Inc. v. M/V Heron, </em>585 F.2d 13, it was 12.3% higher and thus within the range of what traditionally has been considered a possible \u201cupset\u201d bid, <em>see </em>4B Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 70.-98[17], at 1191 (14th ed. 1978). That Mr. Abbotoni\u2019s bid was the only timely bid \u2014 and therefore had prevailed as much by default as through a truly competitive bidding process \u2014 is a further factor favoring the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. In addition, the bankruptcy court did not merely accept Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Winchenback\u2019s upset bid and foreclose Mr. Abbotoni from obtaining the property, a procedure which, had it occurred, we would have questioned. Rather, the court afforded a period during which higher bids could be filed. Mr. Abbotoni thus had an opportunity to prevail in the end, and in fact submitted a bid higher than the upset bid, only to be outbid once more by Mr. Winchenback. It is not an inappropriate use of hindsight to note, moreover, that the bankrupt estate gained a 21.5% price increase by the extension of the bidding period.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">As stressed in <em>In re Gil-Bern Industries, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 627, 628-29 (1st Cir. 1975), we would not approve of a bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to confirm a sale lightly, \u201cmerely to gain a few extra dollars in one case,\u201d because of the important policy concern \u201cthat nothing impair public confidence in the regularity of judicial sales.\u201d At the same time, we recognize that there are certain circumstances in which the best interests of the estate and creditors may warrant a bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to confirm. The bankruptcy court must be accorded sufficient discretion to decide the truly close cases as best it can in view of these competing considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
