Stegmaier sought general injunctive and other relief for alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988. She alleged that Trammell violated her rights to freedom of belief, speech and association by threatening to discharge her as Deputy Circuit Clerk because she failed to support him in the election for the office of Circuit Clerk. The district court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), ordered the trial of this action on the merits consolidated with the hearing scheduled on appellant\u2019s application for injunctive relief. In its Memorandum of Decision, dated January 13, 1977, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>court found appellant was entitled to none of the relief requested, holding that under <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), Trammell\u2019s replacement of Stegmaier was an \u201cauthorized patronage dismissal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">We affirm, holding that a public employee occupying a position of confidence, loyalty, and trust by virtue of her status as the single deputy and assistant to an elected official may be discharged solely on the ground of political affiliations without infringing her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">On March 18, 1974, appellant was appointed Deputy Circuit Clerk for Cherokee County, Alabama, by Fred Green, then Circuit Clerk. Green was defeated by appellee Trammell for the Democratic Party nomination for the position of Circuit Clerk in a primary runoff election held on May 25, 1976. In the November 2, 1976, general election Trammell was elected Circuit Clerk. One of his opponents was Green, who had run again as an independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">After his election Trammell informed appellant that she would be replaced as Deputy Circuit Clerk on January 18, 1977, the date on which Trammell was to begin serving his elective term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on November 11, 1976, appellant commenced this action seeking general injunctive and other relief for alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988, She alleged that Trammell violated her rights to freedom of belief, speech and association by threatening to discharge her because she failed to support him for the office of Circuit Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">In his answer Trammell admitted that he informed appellant she would be replaced, denied each and every other allegation contained in the complaint, and noted that appellant had declined other employment in the office of the Circuit Clerk which he had tendered. Trammell raised several defenses. First, he asserted that as a newly elected Circuit Clerk, whose duties and responsibilities included judgment and policymaking decisions as well as the collection and safekeeping of public funds, he had the right to discharge appellant and appoint someone of his own choice. Second, Trammell contended that he was under a duty as the newly elected Circuit Clerk to select a qualified, competent individual in whom he had great confidence where his predecessor, Green, had been indicted for embezzlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">By way of affidavit in support of his motion for summary judgment Trammell stated that he intended to appoint Dean Perron to the position of Deputy Circuit Clerk. Mrs. Perron was one of the original candidates in the Democratic primary for the office of Circuit Clerk. In Trammell\u2019s opinion Perron was \u201can experienced businesswoman, fully competent to act as Deputy Circuit Clerk,\u201d and a person in whom he had much trust and confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">Trammell, by his affidavit, again denied that he wanted to discharge appellant because she failed to support his candidacy for the office of Circuit Clerk, but he did \u201crecognize\u201d that it was Stegmaier\u2019s duty and obligation to remain loyal to her employer, Fred Green, and to support him for re-election. Trammell also asserted that the position of Deputy Circuit Clerk is a policymaking position, involving obligations of trust. Furthermore, he claimed that the Deputy Circuit Clerk, as the chief assistant to the Circuit Clerk, enjoys a confidential relationship with the Clerk. Finally, Trammell argued that since the Deputy Circuit Clerk has the responsibility of running the Clerk\u2019s office in the absence of the Clerk, the Deputy\u2019s duties included various policymaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For all these reasons Trammell maintained that he had the legal right to' select a Deputy Circuit Clerk of his own choice and preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">This cause came on for hearing on January 10, 1977, pursuant to the district court\u2019s order of December 29, 1976, by which the trial of the action on the merits was advanced and consolidated with the hearing for interlocutory injunctive relief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). According to the terms of the district court\u2019s December 29th order, and as reflected by the record, the cause was submitted to the court for final decision on the merits upon conclusion of oral argument in the hearing for injunctive relief. The record does not reflect that any testimony was taken at this hearing, it appearing that the district court decided the issues raised on the basis of the appellant\u2019s complaint and the defendant\u2019s answer and affidavit in support of his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The district court found that appellant was entitled to none of the relief requested. The court held that under <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Bums, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), Trammell\u2019s replacement of appellant was an \u201cauthorized patronage dismissal\u201d. This conclusion was attained through a two-step analysis. First, the district court found that the position of Circuit Clerk was a \u201cpolicymaking position\u201d as that term was envisioned in <em>Elrod. </em>Second, the position of Deputy Circuit Clerk was a \u201cpolicymaking position\u201d by virtue of statutory language and judicial interpretation vesting the deputy with duties and authorities concurrent with the Clerk. Hence, the district court concluded, since a \u201cpolicymaking position\u201d is specifically susceptible to \u201clawful patronage dismissals\u201d under <em>Elrod, </em>Stegmaier was entitled to no relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>While appellant raises thirteen points of asserted error only one basic question emerges \u2014 whether the district court erred in finding that appellant fell within the policymaker exception in <em>Elrod v. Burns, supra, </em>and, therefore, was subject to patronage dismissal without infringement of her constitutional rights. We necessarily begin by reviewing <em>Elrod </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">II. <em>Elrod v. Burns </em>AND ITS PROGENY</p>\n<p id=\"Ai9D\">A. <em>Progenitor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">In <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), the Supreme Court of the United States held that patronage dismissals of public employees \u2014 discharging employees on a partisan, political basis \u2014 infringe first amendment interests. Respondents in <em>Elrod, </em>all Republicans, were employees<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Cook County, Illinois Sheriffs Office under a Republican sheriff. When a Democratic sheriff assumed office respondents were discharged or threatened with discharge <em>solely </em>because they did not support, were not members of, or had failed to obtain sponsorship by one of the leaders of the Democratic party. Thereafter, respondents brought suit against the Sheriff of Cook County, the Mayor of Chicago, as well as the Democratic Organization and Democratic County Central Committee of Cook County. Their complaint alleged that they were discharged or threatened with discharge solely for the reasons that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic party. They sought declaratory, injunctive, and other relief for alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">On review the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which had reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of respondents\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Although five justices joined in the result, there was no majority opinion for the Court: Mr. Justice Brennan announced the Court\u2019s judgment in his plurality opinion, while Mr. Justice Stewart concurred in the result but refrained from joining in the plurality\u2019s \u201cwide-ranging opinion\u201d. 427 U.S. at 374, 96 S.Ct. at 2690.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">The plurality opinion held that while patronage dismissals infringe first amendment interests, they could survive constitutional challenge if they furthered some \u201cvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>tal government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and association in achieving that end, and the benefit gained . . . outweigh[s] the loss of constitutionally protected rights\u201d. 427 U.S. at 363, 96 S.Ct. at 2685 (footnote omitted). Three government interests were offered by petitioners in <em>Elrod </em>in justification of patronage dismissals: the need to insure effective government and the efficiency of public employees, the need for political loyalty of employees, and the preservation of the democratic process. On the facts presented, the <em>Elrod </em>Court rejected each interest as inadequate to justify infringement of respondents\u2019 first amendment rights of belief and association. 427 U.S. at 364-73, 96 S.Ct. at 2685-89. With regard to the need for political loyalty, however, Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s plurality opinion did establish that patronage dismissals were constitutionally justified where limited to \u201cpolicymaking positions\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-6\">A second interest advanced in support of patronage is the need for political loyalty of employees, not to the end that effectiveness and efficiency be insured, but to the end that representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate. The justification is not without force, but is nevertheless inadequate to validate patronage wholesale. Limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions is sufficient to achieve this governmental end. Nonpolicymaking individuals usually have only limited responsibility and are therefore not in a position to thwart the goals of the in-party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-7\">No clear line can be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking positions. While nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility, that is not to say that one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policy-making position. The nature of the responsibilities is critical. Employee supervisors, for example, may have many responsibilities, but those responsibilities may have only limited and well-defined objectives. An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymaking position. In determining whether an employee occupies a policy-making position, consideration should also be given to whether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals. Thus the political loyalty \u201cjustification is a matter of proof, or at least argument, directed at particular kinds of jobs.\u201d <em>Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, </em>473 F.2d at 574. Since, as we have noted, it is the government\u2019s burden to demonstrate an overriding interest in order to validate an encroachment on protected interests, the burden of establishing this justification as to any particular respondent will rest on the petitioners on remand, cases of doubt being resolved in favor of the particular respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">427 U.S. at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. at 2687 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-12\">Mr. Justice Stewart declined to join in the plurality\u2019s consideration of the constitutional validity of the patronage system <em>generally. </em>Instead, he viewed the \u201csingle substantive question involved in <em>[Elrod </em>as being] whether a <em>nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential </em>government employee can be discharged from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs\u201d. 427 U.S. at 374-75, 96 S.Ct. at 2690 (emphasis added, Stewart, J., concurring). The answer was that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">B. <em>Progeny</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-14\">Courts and commentators have read Mr. Justice Stewart\u2019s narrow position as the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Elrod. See Ramey v. Harber, </em>589 F.2d 753, 757 &amp; nn. 2, 3 (4th Cir. 1978), <em>aff\u2019g in part and rev\u2019g in part, </em>431 F.Supp. 657 (W.D.Va.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 2823, 61 L.Ed.2d 275 (1979); Comment, <em>Patronage And The First Amendment After Elrod v. Burns, </em>78 Colum.L.Rev. 468, 473 n. 55 (1978). <em>See generally Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>(1977) (\u201cWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . \u201d). Accordingly, most judicial interpretations of Elrod have found that a <em>policymaking, confidential </em>employee can be discharged from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs. <em>See, e. g. Johnson v. Bergland, </em>586 F.2d 993, 995 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>McCollum v. Stahl, </em>579 F.2d 869, 872 (4th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1225, 59 L.Ed.2d 460 (1979); <em>Alfaro de Quevedo v. de Jesus Schuck, </em>556 F.2d 591 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Norbeck v. Davenport Community School District, </em>545 F.2d 63, 67 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 917, 97 S.Ct. 2179, 53 L.Ed.2d 227 (1977); <em>Besig v. Friend, </em>460 F.Supp. 134, 139 (N.D. Cal.1978); <em>Finkel </em>v. <em>Branti, </em>457 F.Supp. 1284, 1289 (S.D.N.Y.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>598 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1979) <em>cert. granted, </em>U.S. ---, 99 S.Ct. 3095, 61 L.Ed.2d (1979); <em>Miller v. Board of Education, </em>450 F.Supp. 106, 109 (S.D.W.Va.1978); <em>Tanner v. McCall, </em>441 F.Supp. 503, 512 (M.D.Fla.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">Therefore, if appellant Stegmaier is properly classified as a policymaking, confidential employee, the district court was correct in finding that she was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">III. POLICYMAKERS</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">The district court found, as a matter of fact, that the position of Circuit Clerk was a policymaking position. Recognizing that the Deputy Circuit- Clerk is vested with powers concurrent to the Circuit Clerk\u2019s, the district court then concluded that the office of Deputy Clerk was also a policy-making position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-18\">Our review of this factual finding<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is limited by the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a). Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). A finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court, although finding some evidence to support the finding, is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>C. A. Roberts Co., </em>570 F.2d 1232, 1236 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1978). Where, as in the case sub judice, the case was submitted to the district judge solely upon the basis of the pleadings and affidavits, the burden of showing findings clearly erroneous is somewhat less than where the factual findings were based in part upon the credibility of witnesses. <em>Village Fair Shopping Center Co. </em>v. <em>Sam Broadhead Trust, </em>588 F.2d 431, 434 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Jahre, </em>472 F.2d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 1973). In the light of these general principles we conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding as a matter of fact that the position of Circuit Clerk is a policymaking position within the meaning ascribed to that term in <em>Elrod v. </em>Burns: applicable Alabama constitutional and statutory provisions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> clearly reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>that policymaking decisions with regard to the operation of the Circuit Clerk\u2019s office in the Alabama unified judicial system are made by the Administrative Director of the Courts, not Circuit Clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Under <em>Elrod v. Burns </em>the question of whether a particular public employee is a policymaker can be answered only by analyzing the nature of the employee\u2019s responsibilities. 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. \u201c[Tjitles alone do not provide the answer\u201d. Note, <em>Will the Victor Be Denied the Spoils? Constitutional Challenges to Patronage Dismissals, </em>4 Hastings L.Q. 165, 182 (1977). <em>Elrod </em>also requires that in close cases doubt should be resolved in favor of the public employee subjected to patronage dismissal. 427 U.S. at 368, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Unfortunately, <em>Elrod </em>does not provide any definition of \u201cpolicymaking positions\u201d other than intimating that policy makers have broad responsibilities with ill-defined objectives, and may act as advisers or formulate plans for the implementation of broad goals. 427 U.S. at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Policymakers also may be identified as public employees whose responsibilities require more than simple ministerial competence, whose decisions create or implement policy, and whose discretion in performing duties or in selecting duties to perform is not severely limited by statute, regulation, or policy determinations made by supervisors. <em>See Johnson v. Bergland, </em>586 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>Newcomb v. Brennan, </em>558 F.2d 825 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 968, 98 S.Ct. 513, 54 L.Ed.2d 455 (1977). A policymaker also may be an individual who \u201ccontrols or exercises a role in a decision making process as to the goals and general operating procedures of [an] office\u201d. <em>Ramey v. Harber, </em>431 F.Supp. 657, 666 n. 15 (W.D.Va. 1977), <em>aff\u2019d in part &amp; rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>589 F.2d 753 (4th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. , 99 S.Ct. 2823, 61 L.Ed.2d 275 (1979). The statutory duties and authority of Circuit and Deputy Circuit Clerks under Alabama\u2019s unified judicial system do not fall within the scope of the term \u201cpolicymaker\u201d as that term has been defined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">In 1973 Article VI of the Alabama Constitution was amended to provide for a \u201cunified judicial system\u201d. Ala.Const. art. VI, \u00a7 6.01(a) (Amendment No. 328, ratified Dec. 27, 1973). Under this constitutional provision Circuit Clerks are elected by qualified voters in each county for six-year terms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6.20(b). On October 9, 1975, the Alabama Legislature adopted a measure designed to implement the new judicial article of the Alabama Constitution. Act No. 1205, 1975 Ala.Acts (codified in scattered sections of Ala.Code tit. 12 (1975)). Under this act the administrative office of courts was created. Ala.Code tit. 12, \u00a7 12-5 \u2014 1 (1975). The administrative office of the courts was given authority to \u201cserve as an agency to apply for and receive grants or other assistance and to coordinate or conduct studies and projects in connection with the improvement of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Under Alabama\u2019s unified judicial system the state department charged with the duty of' assisting the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama in connection with his duties as chief administrative officer of the courts is the department of court management. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-3(a). Among other duties, the department of court management is required to work with the clerks of all state courts to \u201ccollect, obtain, compile and digest information and statistics concerning the administration of justice in the state\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-3(b)(l). \u201cUnless the chief justice otherwise directs, the department of court management, <em>under the direction of the administrative director of courts, </em>shall have the responsibility for trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>court administration\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-6 (emphasis added). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-8 (administrative director of courts ex officio head of department of court management and head of administrative office of courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Section 12-5-10 of thq Alabama Code prescribes the duties and authorities of the administrative director of the courts. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-5\">In addition to any other duties and responsibilities that may be assigned to the administrative director of courts by the chief justice, he shall have the following duties and authority with respect to all courts, subject to the direction of the chief justice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-6\">(1) To require the filing of reports, the collection and compilation of statistical data and other information on the judicial and financial operation of the courts and on the operation of other offices directly related to and serving the courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-7\">(2) To determine the state of the dockets and evaluate the practices and procedures of the courts and make recommendations concerning the number of judges and other personnel required for the efficient administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-8\">(3) To prescribe uniform administrative and business methods, systems, forms and records to be used in the offices^of the clerks and registers of courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-9\">(4) To prepare and submit budget recommendations for state appropriations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the unified judicial system, with the exception of appellate courts, and to authorize expenditures from funds appropriated for these purposes as permitted or authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-10\">(5) To investigate, make recommendations concerning and assist in the securing of adequate physical accommodations for the unified judicial system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-11\">(6) To procure, distribute, exchange, transfer and assign such equipment, books, forms and supplies as are acquired with state funds or grant funds or otherwise for the unified judicial system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-12\">(7) To make recommendations for the improvement of the operations of the unified judicial system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-13\">(8) To prepare and submit an annual report on the work of the unified judicial system to the chief justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-14\">(9) To assist the chief justice in performing his duties relating to the transfer and assignment of justices and judges for temporary or specialized duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-15\">(10) To assist the judicial conference in its tasks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-16\">(11) To promote, carry on and assist in programs designed to aid in the continuing education of justices, judges and other court personnel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-17\">(12) To take necessary steps in the collection of unpaid court costs, fines and forfeitures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-18\">(13) To serve as a liaison with the executive and legislative branches of the state government; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-19\">(14) To perform such additional administrative duties as may be assigned by the chief justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-20\">Ala.Code tit. 12, \u00a7 12-5-10 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-21\">The administrative director of courts also is responsible for the direction of expenditure of funds for all courts, for all functions, directly or indirectly affecting the operation of any court.

That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-22\">In connection with studies, projects and functions designed to improve or effect the administration of justice, the operation of courts and continuing. legal and judicial education, the administrative director of courts, the department of court management and the chief justice are authorized to <em>use the services of </em>any member of the judiciary of any court and court-supportive personnel, including, but not limited to, court reporters, <em>clerks, </em>registers, bailiffs, law clerks, court ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>ministrators, secretaries and employees in clerks\u2019 offices and registers\u2019 offices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">In contrast to the broad duties and responsibilities of the administrative director of the courts, the authority and duties of the office of Circuit Clerk are <em>specifically </em>delineated by statute. Although elected under the Alabama Constitution, Circuit Clerks are employed and paid by the State of Alabama. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-17-80. The authority of the Circuit Clerk is found in section 12-17-93 which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Clerks of the circuit court have authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-8\">(1) To administer oaths and take acknowledgments and affidavits in all cases in which the authority to administer such oath or take such affidavit is not confined to some other officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-9\">(2) <em>To appoint deputies, with full power to transact all business of such clerks, such deputies first taking an oath to support the Constitution and laws of this state and faithfully to discharge the duties of deputy clerks of the court for which they act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-10\">(3) To receive the amount of any judgment entered in the courts of which they are clerks, either before or after the issue of execution thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-11\">(4) To exercise such other powers as are, or may be, conferred by law, including administrative rules of procedure promulgated by order of the supreme court of Alabama.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-17-93 (1975) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">The Circuit Clerk\u2019s duties are also specifically defined by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-14\">(a) It is the duty of the clerks of the circuit court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-15\">(1) To sign and issue all summons, subpoenas, writs, executions and other processes, under the authority of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-16\">(2) To keep a consolidated docket sheet of civil and criminal cases, the names of the parties, the character of action or offense, the names of the attorneys and the sheriff\u2019s return, which must be entered in all civil and criminal cases standing for trial, in the order in which they are brought, and the bench notes, orders, rulings on motions and pleadings, other preliminary matters and final judgment which have been made in each case by the judge, which shall be the official minutes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-18\">(3) To keep all papers, books, dockets and records belonging to their office with care and security, with the papers filed, arranged, numbered and labeled, so as to be of easy reference, and the books, dockets and records properly lettered; and to allow parties to inspect the records free of charge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-19\">(4) To make out and deliver, on application and payment of the legal fees therefor, to any person applying for the same, a correct transcript, properly certified, of any paper or record in their offices; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-20\">(5) To exercise such duties as are, or may be, conferred upon them by law, including administrative rules promulgated by order of the supreme court of Alabama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-21\">(b) Any clerk of any circuit court who fails to perform any duty imposed on him, for the failure to perform which no other punishment is provided, shall, on conviction, be fined not exceeding $200.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-22\">Id. \u00a7 12-17-94 (1975). Other duties of Circuit Clerks include: certifying a copy of indictments against convicts sentenced to the penitentiary, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-17-96; paying money in his possession at the expiration of his term of office to his successor upon demand, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-17-97; preparing monthly reports on forms approved by the chief examiner of public accounts, showing the amount of fines, trial tax, district attorney fees and other fees that accrue to the benefit of the state, county or municipality that were collected the preceding month, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-1-19; notifying the parties or one of their attorneys of record of the date of a court-ordered special session of court, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-11-7; transferring a case to the docket of the appropriate court when filed in a court lacking jurisdiction, <em>id: </em>\u00a7 12-11-9; accepting payment from parents legally obligated to support a child after a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>determination that such support is required under state law, id. \u00a7 12-15 \u2014 11; retaining charges moved for by a party which the trial judge refuses to give, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-16-13; issuing jury venires, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-16-74; filing and retaining books and lists prepared by grand jury foremen, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-16-199; serving as ex officio clerk of the district court and having administrative responsibility for and supervision of records and clerical services of the district courts, id. \u00a7 12-17 \u2014 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Circuit Clerks, therefore, have <em>no authority </em>to make policy decisions with regard to: compilation of data and statistics; prescription of administrative and business methods, systems, forms, and records used in the Clerk\u2019s office; preparation of budgetary recommendations; investigation and recommendation regarding physical facilities; and procurement, distribution, and assignment of equipment, books, forms, and supplies. This authority is expressly vested in the administrative director of the courts. Ala.Code tit. 12, \u00a7 12-5-10 (1975). The only role the Circuit Clerk plays in the broad scheme of policy determination is ministerial \u2014 -the clerk\u2019s \u201cservices\u201d are available to the administrative director of the courts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-5-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">The district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Circuit Clerk occupies a policymaking position. Consequently, even though the Deputy Circuit Clerk has authority concurrent to the Circuit Clerk\u2019s, the deputy cannot be deemed a policymaker. This conclusion, however, does not require reversal of the judgment entered below: it is firmly established that an appellate court must affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment if the result is correct even though it is based upon an improper ground. <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943); <em>Eltra Corp. </em>v. <em>Ringer, </em>579 F.2d 294, 298 &amp; n. 12 (4th Cir, 1978); <em>Lum Wan v. Esperdy, </em>321 F.2d 123, 125 (2d Cir. 1963); <em>cf. Raven </em>v. <em>Panama Canal Co., </em>583 F.2d 169, 171 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1787, 60 L.Ed.2d 240 (1979) (successful party in the district court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">We must decide, therefore, whether the district court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed because appellant Stegmaier occupied a position of confidence, loyalty, and trust. This requires consideration of two questions: (1) whether there is a \u201cconfidential employee\u201d exception to <em>Elrod v. Burns </em>in addition to the \u201cpolicymaking employee\u201d exception; and (2) if there is such an exception, whether appellant Stegmaier falls within its scope even though the elected official with whom she would have to \u201cenjoy\u201d a relationship of confidence, loyalty, and trust is not a policymaking public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">IV. CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">A question raised by the concurring opinion in <em>Elrod </em>is whether the language \u201cnonpolicymaking, noneonfidential\u201d established two classes of public employees subject to patronage dismissals. One commentary and analysis of <em>Elrod </em>has suggested that the concurring opinion created two exceptions to the Court\u2019s general proscription of patronage dismissals, permitting patronage dismissals of confidential employees as well as public employees in policymaking positions. <em>The Supreme Court, 1975 Term, </em>90 Harv.L.Rev. 186, 193-94 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-12\">[T]he policymaking and confidential employee <em>exceptions . . </em>. are justified by state interests sufficient to outweigh the accompanying burdens on first amendment rights. Elected officials must be able to assemble their own loyal staffs of advisors and administrators to assist them in formulating and implementing the policies necessary to carry out their electoral mandates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-14\"><em>Certainly elected officials should be permitted to dismiss their predecessor's personal secretaries and a few others who work closely with such officials in positions requiring a relationship of mutual trust. </em>However, courts should construe the exception narrowly and guard against efforts to invoke it in support of across-the-board patronage dismissals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 194 &amp; n. 41 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">Another commentator has suggested that a confidential employee might be deemed a policymaker within the meaning of <em>Elrod, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>confidentiality being one criterion \u201cthrusting a governmental position to the policy-making end of the scale\u201d. Comment, <em>Patronage Dismissals and Compelling State Interests: Can the Policymaking/Nonpolicymaking Distinction Withstand Strict Scrutiny, </em>1978 Southern Ill.Univ.L.J. 278, 285. On the other hand, this same commentator has also observed that a confidential employee, under the rationale of the <em>Elrod </em>plurality and the language of the concurrence, could be a second class of public employees subject to patronage dismissals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA9\">Surely the rationale underlying the policymaking employee justification of patronage dismissals is equally applicable to one who, although not in a position to formulate or implement policies, occupies a position with such access to confidential information that he could covertly restrict the implementation of the policies of the newly elected official. On the other hand, it can be argued that an alternative available would be dismissal for cause when such covert actions occur. However, this alternative may not be as effective as dismissal of a confidential employee because of political incompatability [sic] with his elected superiors; to await discovery of covert action may prove devastating to policy implementation by the new administration. If a standard is to be established it would seem that one in a confidential position should be no less subject to patronage dismissal than one in a policymaking position: in either case dismissal may be deemed necessary to insure \u201cthat representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 285-86 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">The existence of a confidential employee exception is further buttressed by the <em>Elrod </em>plurality opinion\u2019s repeated citation of a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit written by then Circuit Judge Stevens, who did not participate in <em>Elrod </em>although a member of the Supreme Court. <em>Illinois State Employees Union, Council 34 v. Lewis, </em>473 F.2d 561 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 928, 943, 93 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 35 L.Ed.2d 590, 609 (1973). In <em>Lewis </em>Justice Stevens, then Circuit Judge Stevens, stated that the question before the court was whether a nonpolicymaking employee may be discharged for refusing to transfer his political allegiance from one political party to another. In reversing the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, erroneously predicated on rejection of the non-movant\u2019s version of the facts, then Circuit Judge Stevens said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-8\">Plaintiffs properly do not challenge the public executive\u2019s right to use political philosophy or affiliation as one criterion in the selection of policy-making officials. Moreover, <em>considerations of personal loyalty, or other factors besides determination of policy, may justify the employment of political associates in certain positions. </em>It is difficult to believe, however that any such justification would be valid for positions such as janitors, elevator operators or school teachers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">473 F.2d at 574 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">One <em>post-Elrod </em>decision has found that the <em>Elrod </em>concurrence requires that public employees be nonconfidential employees, as well as nonpolicymakers, before they can maintain an action for patronage dismissal. <em>Finkel v. Branti, </em>457 F.Supp. 1284 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>598 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1979) <em>cert. granted, \u2014 </em>U.S. , 99 S.Ct. 3095, 61 L.Ed.2d - - (1979). In <em>Finkel </em>plaintiffs, assistant public defenders, had been appointed to their positions by a Republican Public Defender, also an appointee. Their employment was to be terminated when a Democratic Public Defender was appointed. Plaintiffs alleged that they were nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential employees who were satisfactorily performing their duties; therefore, attempting to replace them on political grounds violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The <em>Finkel </em>court enjoined the termination or attempted termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment upon the sole ground of their political beliefs, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs were neither policymakers nor confidential employees. In attaining this result, the <em>Finkel </em>court said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>In <em>Elrod </em>and its progeny, the requirements of \u201cnonpolicymaking\u201d and \u201cnon-confidentiality\u201d are discussed in a manner that makes clear that the concepts are related to one another. More specifically, the discussion in the cases suggests that the concept of confidentiality is ancillary to the concept of policymaking. <em>An employee is a \u201cconfidential employee\u201d if he or she stands in a confidential relationship to the policymaking process, </em>e. g., <em>as an advisor to a policymaker, or if he or she has access to confidential documents or other materials that embody policy-making deliberations and determinations, </em>e. g., <em>as a private secretary to a policymaker.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">457 F.Supp. at 1291 (emphasis added). Finding that plaintiffs were nonconfidential employees, the <em>Finkel </em>court emphasized that any confidential relationship between plaintiffs and the Public Defender was in the latter\u2019s capacity as a supervisor, <em>not </em>in his role as decisionmaker about the orientation and operation of the public defender\u2019s office <em>(i. e. </em>a policymaking role).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">While agreeing, in general, with the <em>Finkel </em>court and the commentaries discussed above that a confidential employee may constitutionally be discharged solely upon the basis of political affiliation when he stands in a confidential relationship to a policymaker or the policymaking process, we hold that appellant Stegmaier falls within the confidential employee exception even though the position of Deputy Circuit Clerk does not stand in a confidential relationship to a policymaker or a policymaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Where a state, through its constitution, has decided to make certain public offices elective, it has also chosen to vest the electorate with the power to select one candidate over another for any reason. In the case of a Circuit Clerk under the Alabama unified judicial system, it is clear that a candidate for the office of Circuit Clerk can have no \u201cpolicy platform\u201d on which to seek office since policy decisions as to the operation of his office, the administration of justice, practice and procedure in the circuit courts, and the expenditure of funds are beyond his duty and authority. The public, however, does have the right under the Alabama Constitution to elect its Circuit Clerks and, presumably, attempts to elect capable and honest individuals when doing so. If there is any policy \u201cpresumably sanctioned by the electorate\u201d, <em>Elrod v. Burns, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687, in its election of one individual as Circuit Clerk over another, it is that of honesty and integrity. This presumption is especially strong where the nature of the Circuit Clerk\u2019s position involves the handling of private and public litigant\u2019s fees and judgments. <em>See generally </em>Ala.Code tit. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 12-17-93, 12-17-94 (1975); note 3 <em>supra. </em>When, by statute, a deputy clerk is empowered to conduct all business which the clerk is authorized to conduct, Ala.Code tit. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 12-17-93(2) (1975), and when, by statute, the clerk is subject to civil liability and fines for failure to perform his statutory duties, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-17-94(b), the Circuit Clerk must be afforded the opportunity to select his single deputy clerk; he must be able to select a deputy in whom he has total trust and confidence and from whom he can expect, without question, undivided loyalty. Of course these general remarks in no way reflect any judgment on appellant Stegmaier\u2019s competence, honesty or integrity; they serve simply to justify why Circuit Clerk Trammell was justified in selecting a Deputy Clerk of his own choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">We conclude, therefore, that appellant Stegmaier falls within the confidential employee exception to <em>Elrod v. Burns, supra, </em>notwithstanding the fact that appellee Trammell, as Circuit Clerk, does not occupy a policymaking position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">The judgment entered by the district court below is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">. \u201cBy reason of the indictment of the incumbent [for embezzling], the office became vacant and [Trammell] received an interim appointment prior to the term for which he was elected.

Although noting that <em>Elrod </em>might be distinguishable, the district court did not rest its decision on that basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-20\">A credible argument could be made in this action based solely on the verified complaint and uncontroverted affidavits that Mrs. Stegmaier will not be (assuming Mr. Trammell carries through on his promised action) the victim of a patronage dismissal and thus <em>Elrod v. Bums, supra, </em>would be distinguishable on its facts. To this end the court would point out first, the plaintiff and the defendant are members of the same political party; second, the defendant offered the plaintiff another position in the Circuit Clerk\u2019s office; and finally, that the defendant attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to secure additional funds for the Circuit Clerk\u2019s office from the Cherokee County Commissioners so that the plaintiff, if she accepted the proffered position, would suffer no loss of income. However, <em>the court does not find it necessary to base its conclusion that plaintiff in this action is not entitled to any relief on the theory that the present action is distinguishable from Elrod v. Bums, supra. </em>Even if the court places this action squarely within the ambit of <em>Elrod </em>\u2014that is, assumes that the defendant\u2019s replacement of the plaintiff as the Deputy Clerk would in fact constitute a patronage dismissal \u2014 -the criteria articulated in the <em>Elrod </em>opinion when viewed in conjunction with the relevant statutory authority fully satisfy the court that Mr. Trammell\u2019s replacing Mrs. Stegmaier as Deputy Clerk would be an authorized patronage dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-21\">Record at 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Bearing in mind that the district court\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Elrod </em>must be considered dicta, we note that the factual basis for distinguishing <em>Elrod </em>from the instant case may be a distinction without a difference. The fact that the public employee being discharged and the individual threatening discharge are members of the same political party is not dispositive if the consequence of the attempted patronage dismissal is politically coercive. <em>See Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 355, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2680-81, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (\u201cThe cost of the practice of patronage is the restraint it places on freedoms of belief and association.\u201d). Furthermore, the fact that Stegmaier was offered other employment in the Clerk\u2019s office at a lower pay scale would not ameliorate any violation of her constitutional rights. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Bergland, </em>586 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1978) (sufficient irreparable injury to warrant issuance of preliminary injunction where nonpolicymaker alleged that he was removed from his position for partisan political purposes, even though he was assigned to a new position at the same salary but with lesser responsibilities and prestige).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">.
