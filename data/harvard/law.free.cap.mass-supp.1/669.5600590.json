In substance, this \u201cagreement\u201d provided that if Baystate employed the services of an attorney to collect fhe charges due it, then the defendant would consent to pay \u201creasonable\u201d collection and attorney\u2019s fees. Baystate, in Count II, requested a fee of $740.33 \u2014 a figure which was one-third of the amount sought-to be collected in the principal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">The defendant failed to file an answer or other responsive pleading and, in due course, Baystate filed a motion for default judgment. Accompanying the motion for default judgment was a \u201cMemo of Damage's\u201d which included an affidavit from Baystate\u2019s attorney as to prevailing fees both in the Commonwealth and in the county for handling these kinds of matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Following a hearing, a finding for the plaintiff was entered in the sum of the principal amount of $2,220.55. However, the trial judge reduced the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee from the figure of $740.33, originally sought,'to a figure of $250.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">The question of whether the trial judge had the power to take this action in the face of the \u201cagreed upon\u201d higher figure constitutes the sole question on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">In this Commonwealth, agreements between parties which contain provisions for the payment of attorney\u2019s- fees in the event an attorney is used to collect delinquent charges are valid. Leventhal v. Krinsky, 325 Mass. 336 (1950). While agreements may obviously provide for precisely delineated and specified amounts, it is recognized that the more widely prevalent practice is simply to specify that the appropriate fee shall be a \u201creasonable one.\u201d \u201cReasonableness\u201d can only be assessed on a case by case basis in the. light' of the totality of attendant circumstances surrounding the transaction or event at issue. In determining what is \u201creasonable\u201d on the present record it is at least relevant that the defendant and the plaintiffs attorney never entered into free bargaining relations with each^ther in any realistic sense. For this reason the appropriate reference is not to what the attorney usually charges in matters of like scope or what the \u201cprevailing rates\u201d might be but, rather, what the' services rendered were objectively worth in the context of the litigation at issue. Heller v. Silverbranch Const. Corp., Mass. Adv. Sh. (1978) 2850; Hayden v. Hayden, 326 Mass. 587 (1950); Dillon\u2019s Case, 324 Mass. 113 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-20\">In this regard, the trial judge is in a unique position to appraise the value of the services in question. He knows, for example, how long a trial may have lasted; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>relative difficulty of the legal and factual issues involved in a proceeding and the degree of diligence or competence demonstrated by a particular attorney. For all of these reasons the determination of what constitutes a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d is preeminently a question of fact and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Heil v. McCann, 360 Mass. 507 (1971); Elliot v. Warwick Stores, Inc., 329 Mass. 406 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Finally, plaintiffs reliance on the Uniform Commercial Code seems misplaced. G.L. c. 106, sec. 2-301(1) applies to the sale of goods and'not to service contracts. Moreover, it is our view that G.L. c. 106, sec. 1-205 is equally inapposite because the lack of meaningful bargaining interaction between the defendant and plaintiffs attorney renders familiar \u201cusages of the trade\u201d considerations inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">There being no prejudicial error in the court\u2019s finding of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, the report is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-8\">Larkin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b351-9\">McGuane, J.</judges>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b350-15\">\u2605Judge Cimini, now retired, was present at the oral argument of this case but did not participate in the preparation of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
