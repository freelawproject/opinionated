On May 17, 1956, the action came on regularly for trial against respondent Bechtel and the following proceedings occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">After the opening statement counsel for Bechtel moved for a nonsuit on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action against him. It was suggested by the court that the parties submit briefs on the question of whether evidence could be introduced under the pleadings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">Appellants\u2019 attorney stated: \u201cWe can\u2019t brief it, if Tour Honor please, because five days from now this action is beyond the five year period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">After further discussion the following exchange occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">\u201cThe Court: I know. You must bring it to trial. You are bringing it to trial now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">\u201cMr. Culp : This is the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-15\">\u201cThe Court: You are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-16\">\u201cMr. Culp : That\u2019s why I am making a motion for nonsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-17\">\u201cThe Court: You are bringing it to trial. And the passage of time doesn\u2019t affect you here, once I take hold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-18\">\u201cMr. Culp: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-19\">\u201cThe Court: And I am taking hold here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-20\">\u201cMr. Bowman: May we then, before we are required to brief that point, at least start the evidence so that we will have started the trial ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-21\">\u201cThe Court: No, Counsel, I think that we want to clear the decks and make\u2014I\u2019d like to cite that Latin maxim Festina lente, make haste slowly. Let\u2019s make haste slowly, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-22\">\u201cMr. Culp: I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the best way to save time in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-23\">Appellants\u2019 attorney then received permission to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-24\">Appellants\u2019 attorney stated: \u201cAnd I understand, then, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>trial is postponed.\u201d The court replied: \u201cYes, it\u2019s postponed to he fixed for a later date, mutually agreeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Finally this exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cMb. Bowman : Well, I understand counsel won\u2019t raise the five year business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cMb. Culp : Well, Counsel hasn\u2019t made any statement whatever, and he\u2019s not going to.\u201d (This in the face of counsel\u2019s previous statement while he was seeking the ruling of the court: \u201cThis is the trial.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\u201cThe Coubt: Well, he can raise all the\u2014 What shall I say?\u2014 the objections that he wants to. But, Counsel, I think we\u2019re in the trial of this thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">On May 28, 1956, a notice of motion for summary judgment and an affidavit in support thereof were filed. The record does not indicate that the complaint had been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The minute order dated June 12,1956, recites that a hearing was held on appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure, section 583. The motion to dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure, section 583 was argued and submitted and the court ordered that the motion be submitted on briefs. The motion for summary judgment was argued and the court ordered that this motion stand submitted until a ruling was entered on respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The minute order dated June 26, 1956, states that respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cis hereby granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Code of Civil Procedure, section 583, makes it mandatory to dismiss an action <em>\u201c . . . </em>unless such action is brought to trial within five years after the plaintiff has filed his action. ...\u201d The main question is whether by the proceedings had on May 17,1956, the action was \u201cbrought to trial\u201d within the meaning of the section. Cases have held, in construing this section, that an action is brought to trial if even one witness is sworn and gives any testimony. <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.2d 16 [98 P.2d 207]; <em>Mercantile Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>218 Cal. 770 [25 P.2d 12] ; <em>Kosturos </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 700 [125 P.2d 572]; <em>Krasnow </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.App.2d 141 [59 P.2d 442].) The record shows that counsel for appellants was well aware of this rule and in view of it requested the trial court to be allowed to \u201c . . . start the evidence so that we will have started the trial.\u201d The trial court denied this request and counsel for respondent Bechtel supported this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Before the recent ruling of the Supreme Court, enlarging the scope of cases in which motions for new trial may be granted <em>(Carney </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>49 Cal.2d 84 [315 P.2d 305]) it had been the rule that a new trial could only be granted where there had been a trial on an issue of fact (see the cases collected in <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Simmonds, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at pp. 88-89). Despite this ruling the courts had held that where the case was brought on for trial and the plaintiff was prevented from introducing any evidence by reason of motion for nonsuit or objection that the complaint failed to state \u00e1 cause of action there was, in such situation, a trial so as to permit the granting of a motion for new trial. <em>(Stow </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>178 Cal. 140 [172 P. 598] ; <em>Bice </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 342 [277 P.2d 106]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>California Mut. Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>40 Cal.App.2d 374 [104 P.2d 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The situation in this case is parallel to that in the last cited cases. Appellants were present for trial and asked leave to produce at least one witness but were denied that privilege because of counsel\u2019s attack on the sufficiency of their pleading. The procedure of counsel for appellants in this respect followed exactly the procedure recommended in <em>Miller &amp; Lux Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>192 Cal. 333, 342 [219 P. 1006]. Under the circumstances we are satisfied that the ease was brought to trial on May 17, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Counsel for respondent argues that in any event the dismissal may be supported under that portion of Code of Civil Procedure, section 583, which gives the court discretionary power to dismiss \u201c . . . whenever plaintiff has failed for two years after action is filed to bring such action to trial. ...\u201d No ease has been cited authorizing the court to dismiss under this provision after the action has in fact been brought to trial and we are satisfied that such motion must be made before the action is brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">It is doubtless true that unreasonable delay in bringing an action on for further trial after a partial trial would justify the court in dismissing under its inherent power, but the order here is expressly based on Code of Civil Procedure, section 583, and it so recites.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">We have not undertaken to assess the merits of counsel\u2019s objections to the complaint since the order appealed from is not based on that ground and that matter is not properly before us for decision on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Kaufman, P. J., and Draper, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
