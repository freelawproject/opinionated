J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">The defendants, Ernest Ames and his wife, appeal from a judgment that \u201cthe defendant Ernest Ames surrender to the plaintiffs the note dated February 12, 1948, for $3,000.00, secured by deed of trust, signed and executed at Los Angeles, California, by James R. Cole and Eulalie Cole, and payable to Ernest Ames, and that the deed of trust given to secure the same, ... be, and the same hereby is, cancelled and annulled, and rendered wholly void and of no force and effect, and that the cloud created by the said deed of trust and note upon the title of the plaintiffs\u2019 be, and the same hereby is, removed . . . ; and defendant Ernest Ames- is hereby ordered and directed to execute a reconveyance of the said deed of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Respondent James R. Cole, a veteran of World War II, and his wife, purchased a home from one Arnold in 1948. The Bank of America agreed to and did make a \u201cG. I. Loan\u201d of $10,000 evidenced by respondents\u2019 note secured by a first deed of trust. The purchase was \u201cfinanced under the G. I. Bill,\u201d a \u201cG. I. Loan\u201d secured by Fairchild, the real estate agent of the owner. Respondents agreed to and did pay $1,600 plus escrow charges in cash. The purchase price shown in the Escrow File is $11,600. The $3,000 note and second deed of trust referred to in the above quoted judgment (although dated and delivered to appellants by the realtor after the close and outside of the escrow) were signed at the same time as the $10,000 note and trust deed in favor of the bank, both were then left by appellants with Fairchild, and they were \u201ca part of the purchase price of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The deal was managed by Fairchild, representing Arnold, under whose instructions the $3,000 note and trust deed were made in favor of defendant Ames in payment of Arnold\u2019s debt to Ames. Respondents had never owned real property and knew nothing about the law. Appellants and respondents had no dealings with each other. Fairchild represented to respondents that the deal had been approved by the Veterans Administration. On cross - examination, respondent James R. Cole was asked, \u201cNow, when did you first become familiar with the fact that there was some law governing the placing of a second trust deed on property in which a Government loan had been obtained?\u201d He replied that when. respondents had missed a payment and appellants had threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ened foreclosure about January or February, 1949, a \u201creal estate friend\u201d had advised him to see the Veterans Administration, and the Veterans Administration had sent him to see the United States Attorney. He was then asked, \u201cAnd did the U. S. Attorney advise you at that time as to whether this transaction was proper or legal or not?\u201d His answer was that \u201cMr. Steel told me that that was strictly illegal and to stop payment on it, and I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The instant action was filed in February, 1955. By their answer, appellants pleaded that the action was barred by the limitations of the following sections of the Code of Civil Procedure: Section 338, subdivision 4, providing that an action for relief on the ground of fraud must be brought within three years after the discovery of the facts constituting the fraud; section 343, providing that an action seeking \u201crelief not hereinbefore provided for\u201d\u2014cancellation of the note and trust deed because of illegality\u2014is barred in four years; and section 318, providing that an action to adjudicate ownership of real property is barred in five years after knowledge of the adverse claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Appellants rely upon the cited sections of the Code of Civil Procedure, <em>supra, </em>and the decision in <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>20 Cal.2d 640, 645 [128 P.2d 526, 141 A.L.R. 1422]. The Moss decision does not determine the issue in the instant action. Whether the statute of limitations has run, depends upon the nature of the action.  A scrutiny of the allegations of the complaint and the character of the relief sought discloses that the gravamen of the instant action is to remove a cloud and quiet respondents\u2019 title to real property. The alleged fraud and illegality of the transaction are merely incidental and not determinative of the nature of the action.  A party is not required to take action against a hostile claim which is not of a nature to ripen into a valid adverse title.  An action to remove or cancel an adverse claim such as that of appellants in the instant action is not barred by lapse of time until the illegal or voidable claim is asserted in some manner. <em>(Secret Valley Land Co. </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>187 Cal. 420, 425-426 [202 P. 449] ; <em>Newport </em>v. <em>Hatton, </em>195 Cal. 132, 145-146 [231 P. 987].) The trial court correctly held that the instant action was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">No claim of laches is made by appellants and no showing is made of any disadvantage to appellants resulting from respondents\u2019 delay in bringing the instant action.  Lapse of time alone does not bar a suit to quiet title. <em>(Carlson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Lindauer, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 292, 310 [259 P.2d 925]; <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Tapo Oil Co., </em>144 Cal.App.2d 404, 412 [301 P.2d 274].)  Respondents, who live upon the property and have made no payments on the trust deed note since learning of its alleged invalidity, have a continuing right to the aid of a court of equity to determine the nature and effect of the adverse claim in an action brought by or against them. (44 Am.Jur. 47; 74 C.J.S. 69; 22 Cal.Jur. 123, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Appellants contend that \u201c [i]t is a fatal and material variance where fraud is alleged but something else is proven. \u201d, and on oral argument state that, the action was not tried as one to quiet title and that quieting respondents\u2019 title was a mere afterthought included in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We are persuaded however, that the action was tried and decided as a quiet title action and that, as in <em>Colbert </em>v. <em>Colbert, 28 </em>Cal.2d 276, 281 [169 P.2d 633], \u201cthere is no variance between the allegations in the pleading and the proof which misled the appellant to his prejudice; thus the court was justified in finding according to the evidence in spite of the alleged limited scope of the pleading.\u201d Unlike the case of <em>Schirmer </em>v. <em>Drexler, </em>134 Cal. 134, 139 [66 P. 180], and other cases relied upon by appellant, the facts proved and found in the instant action are related to the issues framed by the pleadings and none are in direct conflict with the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u201c \u2018No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof is to be deemed material, unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 469.) Where a matter has been treated as in issue at the trial and a finding made upon that issue, the complaint becomes immaterial. <em>(Boro </em>v. <em>Ruzich, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 535 [137 P.2d 51].) \u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 356, 358 [200 P.2d 893].) Appellants claim no misunderstanding of the issues to be tried in the instant action. Also, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed if the findings, supported by the evidence, are sufficient to warrant the relief granted on any legal theory.\u201d <em>(Sears </em>v. <em>Rule, </em>27 Cal.2d 131, 140-141 [163 P.2d 443].)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">It is appellants\u2019 claim that since they did not actively participate in procuring a veteran\u2019s loan in violation of federal law, and the federal guarantee of a portion of the loan made by the bank was entirely separate from and covered no part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>of the note and trust deed in their favor, any illegality of such procurement should not taint their note and trust deed, or prevent their collection of the balance due them as shown by their cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">While, in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Hampton, infra, </em>both parties, the plaintiff contractor and the defendant buyers, were fully aware of the illegality of the transaction, and in the instant action neither the respondents or the appellants were cognizant of such violation, we are of the opinion that such distinction is not sufficient reason for enforcing the note and trust deed for such illegal excess over and above the purchase price represented to the Veterans Administration in order to procure federal guarantee of a portion of the loan and to the bank in order to procure the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Wainscott, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 345 [268 P.2d 835], relied upon by appellants, the innocent parties were the bank, the Veterans Administration and the holder of the questioned note and trust deed, who had been induced by the real estate agent for the veteran to transfer his real property to the veteran without other consideration. In the instant action there is an important difference. Here the appellants gave up and respondents received from them nothing of value in consideration for the note and trust deed. Neither had ever seen or heard of the other before. The seller who received the illegal excessive price (represented by the note and second trust deed in favor of appellants) had it so made in performance of his agreement with appellants for the sharing of his profits on several deals including the one with respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u201c The statute was intended solely to aid the veteran in the establishment of a home. Any benefit to a contractor was incidental. However, if a secret contract for an amount in excess of the appraised value may be exacted from a veteran, the purpose of the act is defeated.\u201d <em>(Young </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>36 Cal.2d 799, 806 [228 P.2d 1, 19 A.L.R.2d 830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The facts of the instant action do not justify the enforcement of a note and trust deed for the illegal excess of the purchase price over the appraisal by the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Appellants urge that the obligation of the wife is \u201cseveral and divisible from the husband and nothing was illegal as to her interest; hence, her promise is enforceable.\u201d To that argument, respondents reply that since the property is held in joint tenancy \u201cwith its essential unity of title,\u201d the veteran alone had the right to lift the lien from the property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and that \u201cto permit the wife to be held under circumstances such as these would nullify the statute.\u201d In support of their respective positions in this regard the parties cite no authorities and our research has found no case in point. The veterans\u2019 wives were parties to the cases of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, Lewis </em>v. <em>Wainscott, supra, Rosenblum </em>v. <em>Corodas, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 802 [260 P.2d 151], and <em>Sattler </em>v. <em>Van Natta, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 349 [260 P.2d 982], but no issue was raised concerning them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The question is whether a second trust deed for an amount in excess of a \u201cproper appraisal,\u201d executed by a veteran and his wife who are joint tenants, is illegal and unenforceable as to all, or half only, of the amount of such excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The facts of the Young, Lewis, Rosenblum and Sattler cases, <em>supra, </em>as well as the facts now engaging our attention, indicate that the federal guaranties were made in the permitted proportions of the full amount of the loan, not the prescribed portion of half of the loan. 38 II.S.C.A. \u00a7 694 provides that such guaranty shall not exceed <em>50 </em>per cent of the amount of the loan or $4,000, whichever is smaller. In the instant action the loan procured from the bank was $10,000 and the guaranty $4,000. If the guaranty was to apply to one-half only of the property and one-half only of the loan, it should not have exceeded $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cA joint tenancy is one estate and in it the rights of the spouses are identical and coextensive.\u201d <em>(Siberell </em>v. <em>Siberell, </em>214 Cal. 767, 773 [7 P.2d 1003].)  As expressed by Lord Coke, \u201cIt appeareth . . . that joyntenants have the lands by one joint title and in one right . . .; which is the reason, that joyntenants have one joint freehold . . . .\u201d In <em>Reina </em>v. <em>Erassarret, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 418, 422 [203 P.2d 72, 7 A.L.R.2d 1309], the court discusses the nature of joint tenancy and says \u201cthat title does not vest in the survivor upon the death of the cotenant nor does it descend to him from such cotenant because it has already vested in him by, and at the time of, the original grant; and that the interest of two joint tenants is not only equal or similar but also one and the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">While, as urged by appellants, the statement in section 694 that the term \u201cveteran\u201d shall include \u201cthe unremarried widow\u201d of a veteran might be construed as excluding from the protection of the act the wife of a veteran, we are persuaded that the correct construction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the practical construction acted upon by the Veterans Administration and the banks in granting and accepting federal guaranties of loans made upon properties owned in joint tenancy by a veteran and his wife as though the title stood in the name of the veteran alone. To hold the obligation of the veteran\u2019s wife to pay an amount in excess of the fair value or \u201cproper appraisal\u201d legal and enforceable by foreclosure of a trust deed upon the home of the veteran and his family would not give to the veteran the assistance in procuring and protection in maintaining a home as intended by the act. Therefore, the whole note and trust deed for an amount in excess of a \u201cproper appraisal\u201d is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In the instant action, it was adjudged that the $3,000 note and trust deed securing payment thereof, executed by respondents as part of the purchase price for their home, are invalid and unenforceable under the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 694 (as it was prior to the amendment thereof in 1956), that a loan made to a veteran to be used for purchasing a dwelling to be occupied as his home is guaranteed upon certain conditions, including the condition that \u201cthe price paid or to be paid . . . does not exceed the reasonable value thereof as determined by proper appraisal made by an appraiser designated by the Administrator,\u201d and the decision in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>36 Cal.2d 799, 805-806 [228 P.2d 1, 19 A.L.R.2d 830], that, when such federal guarantee of a loan to a veteran is procured, an agreement to pay an amount in excess of such appraisal is illegal and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Appellants contend that the judgment cannot be sustained for the reason that no evidence properly before the court tends to prove any \u201cproper appraisal\u201d in the instant action to which said section 694 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">In this regard appellants urge as reversible error the admission, over their objection, of Exhibit 4, which consists of four documents from the home loan file of the Bank of America, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">(1) A printed form entitled \u201cVeterans Administration Appraisal Report,\u201d bearing a penciled map and plan, photographs of a house, and typewritten insertions showing the lender to be the Bank of America; the veteran to be a stranger to this action; the property to be the same as that described in the complaint and cross-complaint in the instant action; bearing the purported signature of Ernest Adams under the printed words \u201cAppraiser\u2019s Signature,\u201d the printed statement that the appraiser estimates the \u201cReasonable Value\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cas is\u201d, and the typewritten figure $11,600.00; and showing the date to be November 7, 1947.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">(2) A printed form entitled \u201cHome Loan Report\u201d which bears a carbon copy of typewritten insertions therein showing veteran\u2019s name to be James R. Cole; amount of loan $10,000; title to the property described in the purported appraisal to be fee simple in respondents as joint tenants; the total to be paid to the contractor $11,600; other expenses $220.00; that the price to be paid by the veteran does not exceed the value thereof as determined by proper appraisal dated November 7, 1947, made by appraiser Ernest Adams; and that the veteran, James R. Cole, over his signature and over.the date February 14, 1948, requests \u201cthe Administrator to endorse my honorable discharge or certificate of eligibility for $4,000.00 of the guarantee benefit available to me,\u201d said form also bearing the purported signature of Harry Christensen, as manager of the 25th and Central Branch Number 354 of the Bank of America, and having the portion thereof \u201cFor Use by Veterans Administration\u201d left entirely blank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">(3) Title Insurance and Trust Company\u2019s Policy Number 2769195 dated February 5, 1948, insuring James R. Cole, Eulalie Cole and Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, a corporation, in the sum of $11,600, showing title to the same property vested in James R. Cole and Eulalie Cole, his wife, as joint tenants, and showing said property to be subject to only one trust deed dated January 23, 1948, as security for indebtedness of $10,000 in favor of the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, a corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(4) Photostatic copy (which appellants stipulated should have the same force and effect, if any, as would the original) of a deed of trust note for $10,000, dated January 23, 1948, signed by James R. and Eulalie Cole, in favor of the Bank of America National Trust <em>&amp; </em>Savings Association, a national banking corporation; to which is appended \u201cLoan Guaranty Certificate\u201d dated March 12, 1948, for Veterans Administration Loan No. L-HG 72463 Calif LA, to lending institution Bank of America, for loan of $10,000 dated January 23, 1948, to veteran James R. Cole, Serial No. 37 369 105 Army \u201cSubject to the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, Public Law 268, 79th Congress, and the regulations issued thereunder to the date of this certificate, 40 percent of the indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the loan identified above is hereby guaranteed,\u201d over the printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>words \u201cAdministrator of Veterans Affairs by\u201d and the purported signature of Jesse B. . . . (illegible and not mentioned in the record).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The portion of the record referred to by appellants in support of their contention reveals that one John T. Mack, assistant cashier of the Bank of America\u2019s 25th and Central Branch, produced the file of the bank from which said documents were taken; that they were the records of his bank, kept in the usual course of business, indicating that the transaction was \u201ca Veterans\u2019 guaranteed loan,\u201d and a \u201cFederal guaranteed loan.\u201d Objection was made to each of these documents \u201cas no foundation laid.\u201d The witness then testified that these documents are kept in the regular course of business at the bank; that he is custodian of the file and an officer at the 25th and Central Branch of the Bank; that he was not working at that branch when the loan was made; and that these \u201care regular documents.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel was asked to and did look at the documents, particularly at the legal description, after which he said, \u201cApparently it relates to this property, I guess.\u201d Respondents again offered the documents in evidence. Appellants again objected \u201cas no foundation having been laid properly\u201d and the objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In support of their claim that the admission of that evidence constituted prejudicial error, appellants cite and rely upon section 1953f of the Code of Civil Procedure; <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 188 [257 P.2d 690]; and <em>Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>31 Cal.2d 489 [190 P.2d 1],</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Said section 1953f provides: \u201cA record of an act, condition or event, shall, in so far as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The purpose of this act is to enlarge the exception to the hearsay rule, to eliminate the necessity of calling as a witness each person who had personal knowledge of the facts recorded, and to substitute the record of the transaction or event. <em>(Loper </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>23 Cal.2d 600, 608 [145 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">We do not regard the eases of <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Burr, supra, </em>and <em>Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>as authority for appellants\u2019 contention herein. In the Pruett case the questioned documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>were produced from the files of an Agricultural Commissioner who was a witness at the trial. They consisted of a copy of a letter and memo received by the witness from the Bureau of Chemistry of the State Department of agriculture. The court there held that the placing of correspondence in a business file did not necessarily make it admissible in evidence under the business records act; and that the copies of the letter and memo there in question were not business records of the commissioner who received and filed them, although similar copies might have been admissible if properly introduced from the file of the Department of Agriculture.  Where there is any basis for the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining that a proper foundation has been proved for admission of such evidence, an appellate court will not disturb such decision, but under the circumstances there shown the court held that \u201cthe question was not debatable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><em>Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>holds that it was not error to exclude hospital records where the sole foundation laid was the testimony of the custodian that they were day to day records of the patients in the hospital, including plaintiff while he was confined after his accident, and there was no evidence as to the mode of preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In the instant action, appellants assert that the federal law relating to veterans\u2019 loans is based on an appraisal being made by a duly appointed appraiser; and that the only evidence of these facts is contained in certain of the above mentioned documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The foundation for receipt into evidence of the Veterans Administration appraisal of the property was laid as follows: John T. Mack, as heretofore indicated, testified that he was manager of the branch bank involved. Then the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cQ. [By Mr. Maddox, attorney for respondents.] Do you have in your possession records of a loan made about January of 1948 to Mr. James Cole and Eulalie Cole and secured by a deed of trust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">\u201cA.

Brown [Attorney for appellants] : I object to that as not being the best evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\">\u201cThe Court: Do you wish to introduce the appraisal? Is that all you want out of that file, Mr. Maddox?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">\u201cMr. Maddox: I want the appraisal, the home loan report, and the deed of trust\u2014I think I want all of these documents. In fact I went over this with Mr. Mack and picked out the documents that we needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, may I suggest you tell Mr. Brown the documents that you want to use, and then you can just offer those documents, and we will save time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-15\">\u201cMr. Maddox : These documents may be left under the same arrangement as the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-16\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-17\">\u201cMr. Maddox: I\u2019d like to have these documents marked as Plaintiffs\u2019 next in order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-18\">\u201cThe Court: Marked or offered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-19\">\u201cMr. Maddox: I\u2019d like to have them offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-20\">\u201cMr. Brown : Objected to as no proper foundation, except I have no objection as to the form of one, being a photostat\u2014 one of them is a photostat of the original document\u2014but I object to all of them as no foundation laid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-21\">\u201cThe Court: Well, lay the foundation then, Mr. Maddox.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-22\">\u201cMr. Maddox : Your Honor, I am inclined to think that these have been authenticated as documents kept in the regular course of business at the bank, he is an officer of the bank\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-23\">\u201cThe Court: Well, to make sure ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-24\">\u201cQ. Bv Mr. Maddox: Are these documents kept in the regular course of business at the bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-25\">\u201cA. Yes, they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-26\">\u201cQ. And you are an officer at the 25th and Central branch, are you not? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cQ. These are regular documents, are they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, they are regular documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : No question about their being the documents that pertain to the property in this case, is there, Mr. Brown ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cMr. Brown: Was your Honor talking to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">\u201cMr. Brown: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you can look at them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">\u201cMr. Brown: I assume that they perhaps do relate to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s why I asked Mr. Maddox to show them to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">\u201cMr. Maddox : Look at the legal description.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-14\">(Mr. Maddox hands the documents to Mr. Brown who examines them.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-15\">\u201cMr. Brown: Apparently it relates to this property, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-16\">\u201cMr. Maddox: I again offer them, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-17\">\u201cMr. Brown : I again object as no foundation having been laid properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-18\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : They may be received and marked as Plaintiffs\u2019 4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-19\">We are satisfied that the copy of the Veterans Loan appraisal contained in the file and kept in the regular course of business by Bank of America was sufficient to give rise to an opinion by the court that, in the language of section 1953f of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cthe sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.\u201d In any event, in the case at bar, the question was debatable. <em>(Pruett </em>v. <em>Burr, supra, </em>203.) Furthermore, the error, if any, becomes immaterial as to the matter of the so-called G. I. appraisal in the light of the inferences to be drawn from testimony of the witness, Wesley J. Fairchild, the real estate broker, who testified, without objection and on cross-examination by appellants\u2019 counsel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-20\">\u201cQ. Well, was there any conversation as to why they were having to sign two different trust deeds? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-21\">\u2018\u2018Q. All right, what was said ? What did you tell them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-22\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t quote what I said. I might say in essence what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-23\">\u201cQ. Well, now, what in essence did you tell them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-24\">\u201cA. I told them that the seller refused to sell the property for the appraisal that had been given by the Veterans Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>istration\u2019s appraiser, and that they would have to pay, if they got the property, over and above it, which the seller was agreeable to taking a second trust deed for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cQ. And did you tell them'that they weren\u2019t to let the bank or the Veterans Administration know about this!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t recall telling them that, no, but I do know that it was brought out that they were explained that we were not supposed to pay more than the Veterans Administration appraisal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The witness further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">\u201cQ. [By Mr. Brown] : Do you remember anything else that you might have told them at that time about having to get around the Veterans Administration requirements and the laws connected with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201cA. Nothing more than the fact that this trust deed could not be handled through the escrow. As far as the escrow was concerned the property would have to show as being sold for the amount that the Veterans\u2019 appraiser appraised it for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">There is no showing that the admission into evidence of the 3rd and 4th parts of Exhibit 4, the policy of title insurance and the loan guaranty certificate (attached to the deed of trust note signed by respondents in favor of the bank) was at all prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">We find no reversible error in the ruling of the trial court. The evidence supports the findings and the latter support the judgment which must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">Fourt, J., and Drapeau, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 3, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
