The plaintiffs and one of the insurers appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The Buick was occupied at the time of the accident by five persons named Smith. The Chevrolet was owned by Rex Thwaits and driven by Charles Byron Osborne, both of whom were minors. All of the Smiths sued for damages for personal injuries. They joined as defendants Rex Thwaits and his mother, Chris Thwaits, Charles Byron Osborne and his parents, Harold G. Osborne and Arminta M. Osborne. The Thwaits had or thought they had liability coverage under a combination automobile liability policy Number CA 713138 issued jointly by The Security Insurance Company and The Connecticut Indemnity Company, in which the named insured was Chris Thwaits, the mother of Rex Thwaits. The Osbornes had two liability policies, Numbers 9162959 and 16082208 issued by appellant Farmers Insurance Exchange to Harold G. Osborne, the father of Charles and husband of Arminta. The Thwaits and Osbornes called upon their respective in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>surers to defend the Smith action. This the Security and Connecticut refused to do, claiming that the Thwaits policy is void and that if valid its terms do not protect Rex Thwaits or the Osbornes. Farmers took the position that any coverage afforded to Harold G. Osborne and Arminta M. Osborne by its policies is excess insurance only and does not cover Charles Byron Osborne at all. The trial court made holdings which require a reversal and can be best clarified when considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Security-Connbcttout Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">First as to the claims of the Thwaits under the Seeurity-Conneeticut policy. The Chevrolet was owned by Rex Thwaits, aged 17, for whom his mother bought it as a present when he graduated from high school; it was registered in his name as owner; it was a new car; his mother traded a 1949 used Ford on account of the purchase price and executed an agreement to pay to General Motors Acceptance Corporation the balance of the purchase price; Rex also signed this document. The insurance policy was already in existence, covering the Ford and designating Chris Thwaits, the mother, as named insured. On the day of its purchase, June 11, 1952, the coverage was transferred to the Chevrolet but the policy remained in the name of Chris Thwaits and Rex was not specifically mentioned therein as additional insured or otherwise. The insurance companies, Security and Connecticut, contended that the policy was thenceforth void because Chris Thwaits was not the owner of the Chevrolet and had no insurable interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>Insurable Interest of Chris Thwaits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The trial court did not pass upon this question but declared that the policy did not cover any liability of Rex 'Thwaits and that there was no duty upon the insurance companies to defend-him; that they had a duty to defend Chris Thwaits because it was alleged in the Smith personal injury complaint that she was the owner of the ear and that it was being driven by her agent, the truth or falsity of these allegations being immaterial. Appellants claim that the court\u2019s silence as to the issue of insurable interest was a failure to find upon a material -issue and prejudicial error. We are constrained to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">It is the duty of the court hearing an action for declaratory relief to make a complete determination of the controversy. <em>(American, Enterprise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Cal.2d 210, 219 [246 P.2d 935].) As to the prejudicial nature of failure to find upon a material issue in any case, see <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>29 Cal.2d 503, 512 [175 P.2d 838] ; <em>DeBurgh </em>v. <em>DeBurgh, </em>39 Cal.2d 858, 873 [250 P.2d 598]. The grievous nature of this error will become apparent as the discussion proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The rule that the purchaser of an insurance policy must have an insurable interest in the subject matter at the time of procuring the insurance pervades the entire field of insurance law, not excepting that of automobile liability protection. (44 C.J.S. \u00a7 175, p. 869.)  The object to be obtained by this rule, the reason for its being, is avoidance of wagering contracts. (Williston on Contracts (Rev. Ed.), \u00a7 1665A, pp. 4705-4706 ; 4 Appleman on Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a72121, pp. 18-19; 77 A.L.R. 1256, Anno.) Hence any kind of an interest in the risk attendant upon the existence or use of the insured property is enough to negate a wager and support the policy. (2 Joyce Law of Insurance (2d Ed.), \u00a7 888, p. 1920; Rest., Law of Contracts, \u00a7 520, comment e, p. 1008; 77 A.L.R. 1257, Anno.) This principle has been carried into sections 250 and 281 Insurance Code, which respectively read as follows: \u201c \u00a7 250. <em>Events subject to insurance. </em>Except as provided in this article any contingent or unknown event, whether past or future, which may damnify a person having an insurable interest, or create a liability against him, may be insured against, subject to the provisions of this code.\u201d \u201c\u00a7 281. <em>Definition. </em>Every interest in property, or any relation thereto, or liability in respect thereof, of such a nature that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the insured, is an insurable interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Mrs. Thwaits, though she had given the car to her son, signed a conditional sale contract and separately obligated herself to pay to General Motors Acceptance Corporation the full balance of the purchase price; the destruction of the vehicle would subject her to substantial loss in the absence of protecting insurance. Also, she had signed her minor son\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license and thus rendered herself liable for damages for injuries to person or property caused by his negligence arising out of driving the vehicle upon a highway (Veh. Code, \u00a7 352(a)). Mrs. Thwaits had an undoubted right to insure against this risk, especially as the car was intended primarily for the son\u2019s use upon the highway. The argument that it does not appear that he was driving (actually or constructively) or even present at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>accident seems to be contrary to the record and in any event is misplaced.  In all cases other than life insurance the question of insurable interest presents the matter of protection against possibilities, contingencies and hazards, not inevitable events. Mrs. Thwaits was insuring against these hazards generally, not that of one specific trip.  That she had a cognizable insurable interest appears from perusal of the following authorities, all of which proceed upon the basis that ownership is not an exclusive test of insurable interest: <em>Davis </em>v. <em>California Highway Indem. Exch., </em>118 Cal. App. 403, 405-406 [5 P.2d 447]; <em>American Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Heise, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 689 [289 P.2d 103]; <em>Fageol T. &amp; C. Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Indem. Co., </em>18 Cal.2d 731, 738 [117 P.2d 661] ; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Hanover Fire Ins. Co., </em>50 R.I. 203 [146 A. 763, 764]; 28 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 508, p. 256; 44 C.J.S. \u00a7 177, p. 783; 5 Am.Jur. \u00a7 513, pp. 793, 794; 77 A.L.R. 1256, Anno.) It thus appears that Mrs. Thwaits had an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance, the policy is not void and the court should have so determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>Sccurity-Connecticut Obligation to Protect Chris Thwaits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The court properly held that Security and Connecticut were obligated to defend Mrs. Thwaits because she was charged in the personal injury action with ownership of the Chevrolet and operation of same through her agent.  That obligation is measured by the terms of the policy applied to the allegations of the complaint whether they be true or false. <em>(Ritchie </em>v. <em>Anchor Cass. Co., </em>135 Oal.App.2d 245, 250 [286 P.2d 1000]; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Belt Cas. Co., </em>3 Cal.App.2d 624, 630 [40 P.2d 311].)  An insurer who has undertaken such defense is bound by the judgment (45 C.J.S. \u00a7 933, p. 1055), and if the defense proves unsuccessful the insurer must pay the judgment. This latter phase of Mrs. Thwaits\u2019 right to protection was not declared in the judgment but that should have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>Security-Connecticut Obligation to Protect Bex Thwaits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Security and Connecticut were obligated to protect Rex Thwaits. Their refusal to do so stemmed, at least partially, from the faulty view that the policy is void.  Reliance is also placed by respondents upon III of the insuring agreements, which says: \u201cWith respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018Insured\u2019 includes the named Insured and also includes any person while using the automobile and any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named Insured or with his permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Mrs. Thwaits was named insured; Rex Thwaits and Charles Osborne were using the automobile; Rex was responsible for its use by Osborne; and that use was with the permission of Mrs. Thwaits, the named insured. The trial judge found: \u201cthat the words \u2018using the car\u2019 clearly means driving the car; that Rex Thwaits was not driving the car on August 9, 1952, at the time of the accident.\u201d Also, \u201c [a]s the Named Insured, Chris Thwaits, was not the owner of the 1952 Chevrolet automobile, she could not give permission for its use.\u201d It is immediately apparent that herein some fundamental principles of insurance law were overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">They are thus stated in <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423, 437 [296 P.2d 801] : \u201cIt is elementary in insurance law that any ambiguity or uncertainty in an insurance policy is to be resolved against the insurer. [Citations.]  If semantically permissible, the contract will be given such construction as will fairly achieve its object of securing indemnity to the insured for the losses to which the insurance relates. [Citation.] If the insurer uses language which is uncertain any reasonable doubt will be resolved against it; if the doubt relates to extent or fact of coverage, whether as to peril insured against [citations], the amount of liability [citations] or the person or persons protected [citations], the language will be understood in its most inclusive sense, for the benefit of the insured.\u201d The language of the policy is presumed to be that of the insurer and when ambiguous it is to be construed in such manner as to provide full coverage of the indicated risk rather than to narrow the protection.  If the insurer would create an exception to the general import of the principal coverage clauses, the burden rests upon it to phrase that exception in clear and unmistakable language. <em>(Pendell </em>v. <em>Westland Life Ins. Co., </em>95 Cal.App.2d 766, 770 [214 P.2d 392].) If this is not done any ambiguity or uncertainty is resolved in favor of the policyholder.  The courts will not sanction a construction of the insurer\u2019s language that will defeat the very purpose or object of the insurance. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>United Ins. Co., </em>113 Cal.App.2d 493, 497 [248 P.2d 113] <em>; Narver </em>v. <em>California State Life Ins. Co., </em>211 Cal. 176, 180 [294 P. 393, 71 A.L.R. 1374].) Indeed an exception must be couched in terms which are \u201cclear to the ordinary mind\u201d <em>(Pendell </em>v. <em>Westland Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 770), or any doubts as to meaning will be resolved against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">That the word \u2018\u2018 using \u2019 \u2019 is not necessarily synonymous with \u201cdriving\u201d plainly appears from the discussion in <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Corti, </em>22 Cal.2d 454 [139 P.2d 645, 147 A.L.R. 861], which arose under section 402, Vehicle Code, the permissive use statute. The owner had entrusted his car to his son to be used by him; the son loaned the car to his friend.who was driving at the time of the accident. Section 402 imposes upon the owner liability for negligence of one \u201cusing or operating\u201d the car with his permission express or implied. The court drew a clear distinction between using and operating and held that the son was at all times using the car though not in physical possession of it or driving it at the time of the accident. The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Schauer is to the same effect. In the case at bar it was stipulated at the trial that \u201cat the time of the accident of August 9, 1952, and immediately prior thereto, Charles Byron Osborne, the driver of the 1952 Chevrolet automobile previously referred to, asked permission of Rex Thwaits to drive said Chevrolet automobile at the time of the accident referred to. \u201d  Rex Thwaits thus became legally responsible for the use of the car by Charles Osborne, for it was with his permission and in his immediate presence; he became liable on two theories, permission and agency. (See 7 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 321, p. 194; <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Corti, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 454, 461-462; Prosser on Torts (2d Ed.), p. 368; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Hanisch, </em>147 Cal.App.2d 742, 748 [306 P.2d 30].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The idea that Mrs. Thwaits, though she was the named insured, could not give permission to use the Chevrolet because she was not the owner also disregards principles governing construction of insurance policies. The language in question plainly refers to actual consent, not some theoretical concept. Mrs. Thwaits had told Charles Osborne, who was an intimate friend of her son and a daily visitor in their home, that he could drive the Chevrolet any time he wished, and had done so a dozen or more times; she was present at the start of the particular trip and gave Osborne permission to drive. This was permission in fact, enough to satisfy the terms of the policy and to preclude any inquiry whether she had a right to control the ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This is not a question of imputed liability under the consent statute (Veh. Code, \u00a7 402), but if it were, the case of <em>Patch&amp;n </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>y. <em>Eichmeyer, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 652 [225 P.2d 976], would be persuasive. In that ease a minor had purchased a motorcycle which he kept at the home of his parents where he resided; the mother had signed his application for a permit to operate. At page 655 the court said: \u201cThe matter of the parents\u2019 consent to the son\u2019s operation of the motorcycle is likewise a question of fact. Prom evidence that the parents had permitted William to buy and use the vehicle for more than a year and that the motorcycle could have been taken away from the son if the parents objected to its use, coupled with the fact that the mother had signed the application to operate a motor vehicle, an inference of consent to its use can hardly be deemed unsupported.\u201d In the present instance Rex, aged 17, lived at home and kept the Chevrolet there; his mother had signed his application for a driver\u2019s license and undoubtedly had the legal right to control her son\u2019s use of the vehicle either through causing his license to be cancelled (Veh. Code, \u00a7 353), or exercising general parental control over him (37 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a710, p. 149), such as forbidding his use of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Norris </em>v. <em>Pacific Indem. Co., </em>39 Cal.2d 420 [247 P.2d 1], is not opposed to the views just expressed. In that case a permittee, who had been instructed to let no one else drive the car, loaned it to a friend who when driving was involved in an accident. It was held that he was not an additional insured within the terms of a covering insurance policy because he had no permission in fact, express or implied, from the owner. The court distinguished <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Corti, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 454, upon the ground that it involved imputed liability under section 402, Vehicle Code, saying at page 424: \u201cSection 402 is not involved in the present case. The plaintiffs are not concerned with fastening imputed liability on the owner. They are not the beneficiaries of any statutory created liability. The plaintiffs seek to apply the policy language as a source of financial discharge of Irvin\u2019s [driver\u2019s] liability to the persons injured through his own negligence.\u201d At page 426: \u201cThe matter of the owner\u2019s imputed liability is not involved here; and the question of the operator\u2019s coverage under the owner\u2019s policy was not involved in the Souza ease. Since there is neither express nor implied permission for Irvin\u2019s use of the automobile, he is not protected by the omnibus clause in the policy of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\"><em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>32 Cal.2d 189, 191 [195 P.2d 414], does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>not support respondents\u2019 position. That case presented the question of whether a wife was liable under section 402, Vehicle Code, for her husband\u2019s negligence in driving an automobile which was owned as community property, this upon the theory that she had consented thereto. It was held that he had full control of community property and she could not give him permission to do what he already had a right to do. That has no pertinence to the interpretation of an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Rex Thwaits was covered by the Security-Connecticut policy and it should have been so adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>Security-Connecticut Obligation to Protect Charles Byron Osborne</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The Osbornes claim that they are also covered by the said Security-Connecticut policy. The court held against this contention and ruled that there was no duty on either of those insurers to defend any of the Osbornes.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">First, as to Charles, the minor son, who was driving the Chevrolet at the time of the accident. He falls within this phrase of III of the policy (quoted above), \u201cany person while using the automobile . . . with his [named insured\u2019s] permission.\u201d While the significance of the word \u201cusing\u201d is not confined to operating, the latter act undoubtedly is included within the term \u201cusing.\u201d  Again, Charles Osborne is covered because condition (8) of the policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> incorporates by reference the financial responsibility law of this state (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 410-423.1, especially \u00a7 415). Since the decision of <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 423, 434, it has been established law that the provisions of that statute prescribing the terms of motor vehicle liability policies become implied covenants of all such insurance. One of those requirements is: \u201cSuch policy shall insure the person named therein and any other person using or responsible for the use of said motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of said assured.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(Veh. Code, \u00a7 415(a) (2).) Clearly, Charles Osborne was using this Chevrolet and was doing so with the express permission of the assured. He is entitled to defense by Security and Connecticut and protection to the extent specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Security-Connecticut Obligation to Protect Senior Osbornes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The parents, Harold G-. Osborne and Arminta M. Osborne, are likewise protected by III of the same policy. The son, Charles, falls within the description \u201cany person while using the automobile\u201d with the permission of the insured. The parents had signed his application for a driver\u2019s license which he had at the time of the accident, thus becoming liable for his negligence (Veh. Code, \u00a7 352) subject to the statutory $5,000 and $10,000 limits. They therefore fall within the policy phrase \u201cany person . . . legally responsible for the use thereof\u201d because Charles was using it and they were obligated under the statute. They are entitled to a defense and to protection against any adverse judgment up to the maximum limit of the statute. The contrary holding of the trial court was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Re Farmers Insurance Exchange Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The court found that Farmers is not bound to defend or protect Charles Byron Osborne under its policy and no party claims error in that ruling. As to his parents the court ruled that Farmers had a duty to defend them because they signed Charles\u2019 application for a driver\u2019s license and the Smith complaint alleged that the Chevrolet was being driven by Charles as their agent; \u201cthat these allegations are sufficient allegations of a claim for \u2018damages . . . caused by accident and arising out of . . . use ... of the automobile,\u2019 as set forth in coverages A and B of Insuring Agreement I of said policies which is made applicable to \u2018any other automobile\u2019 with respect to the \u2018Named Insured\u2019 and his \u2018spouse\u2019 by Insuring Agreement Y relating to \u2018use of other Automobiles\u2019 as these words are used in said policies.\u201d It is urged by appellant Farmers that the court erred in failing to declare that its policies furnish only excess coverage for Mr. and Mrs. Osborne and that liability under the Security-Connecticut policy should be exhausted before that of Farmers becomes available. We have held that these two Osbornes are covered by the Security Connecticut policies and hence this argument as to excess insurance of the Farmers policy. Coverages A and B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of insuring agreement I, also Condition (16) and insuring agreement V(a) thereof are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">It is essential to determination of the question of excess insurance to ascertain whether Farmers policies do protect the senior Osbornes with respect to this accident.  This we must do independently of any concessions of counsel as to the legal effect of the policy <em>(Desny </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>46 Cal.2d 715, 729 [299 P.2d 257]). If the parents are not covered, the question of excess insurance does not arise.  Careful scrutiny of the quoted portions of the policy discloses that the insurer studiously refrained from protecting any driver of an automobile other than the named Ford except Harold G. Osborne and his spouse, or to protect them or either of them against liability for driving such \u201cother automobile\u201d by any other person. The statute (Veh. Code \u00a7 352) imposed liability upon them for the son\u2019s negligence, unless perchance he was acting as the agent or servant of another person (subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>(d)), but that fact does not enlarge the carefully restricted coverage of the insurance policy. This line of thought is emphasized by the discussion in <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Pacific Indem. Go., supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 420, 424. The question of excess insurance did not properly arise and the failure to determine it did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">No other points require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The judgment is reversed with instructions to the lower court to amend the findings and conclusions and enter judgment consonant with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Fox, Acting P.
