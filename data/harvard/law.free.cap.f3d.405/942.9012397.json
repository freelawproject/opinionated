Darby claimed he was not given an opportunity to contact the Jamaican consulate after his arrest, in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261, and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The district court denied the petition because the claim did not satisfy the requirements of the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, such that Darby could file his claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Darby asserts the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because: (1) his habeas petition was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because the jurisdictional language of \u00a7 2241 specifically includes alleged violations of \u201ctreaties of the United States,\u201d while \u00a7 2255 does not contain such a provision; and (2) the VCCR confers an individual right to consular assistance. The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law we review de novo. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 629 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>(11th Cir.1990). When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from us before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">A. <em>The \u201cSavings Clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (AEDPA\u2019s), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause, and, consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). The savings clause only applies to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding when (1) the \u201cclaim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a non-existent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. To prove an offense is non-existent, a petitioner must show he was imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1366 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Here, Darby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was an attempt to circumvent the AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Darby filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied with prejudice. Furthermore, before filing this \u00a7 2241 petition, Darby filed an application for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and we denied his application. A petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Even if Darby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not an attempt to circumvent the AEDPA, the district court did not err in dismissing the petition because Darby cannot meet the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. Darby\u2019s claim he was not allowed access to the Jamaican consulate is based on an allegation the VCCR confers such an individual right. However, this claim does not meet any of the requirements of the <em>Wofford </em>test. Darby\u2019s claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, and he did not show he was imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1366. Accordingly, Darby is not entitled to relief under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">B. <em>Exclusive Relief Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2211</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Section 2241 provides \u201c[t]he writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless ... [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or <em>treaties </em>of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (emphasis added). On the other hand, \u00a7 2255 provides relief for federal prisoners on \u201cthe ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Section 2255 does not reference treaty violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>The U.S. Supreme Court has noted \u201c[t]he Vienna Convention ... <em>arguably </em>confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest.\u201d <em>Breard v. Greene, </em>523 U.S. 371, 118 S.Ct. 1352, 1355, 140 L.Ed.2d 529 (1998) (emphasis added). However, the Supreme Court also pointed out \u201c[e]ven were [such claims] properly-raised and proved, it is extremely doubtful that the violation should result in the overturning of a final judgment of conviction without some showing that the violation had an effect on the trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">We need not decide whether \u00a7 2241 provides an exclusive remedy or whether the VCCR confers individual rights in order to resolve this case. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that \u00a7 2241 applies based on the inclusion of language concerning \u201ctreaties\u201d and the VCCR confers an individual right to consular assistance, Darby failed to show the alleged VCCR violation had a prejudicial effect on his trial. <em>See Breard, </em>118 S.Ct. at 1355. Although Darby claimed he was denied the opportunity to contact the Jamaican consulate following his arrest, he did not allege his lack of contact with the consulate affected his trial. Accordingly, Darby is not entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Darby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
