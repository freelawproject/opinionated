RLI issued a performance bond guaranteeing Cayenta Canada, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cCayenta\u201d) performance of a construction contract between SSEMC and Cayenta.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-25\">We previously issued a jurisdictional question in this case. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 responses to that question, we conclude that we do have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-26\">After a thorough review of the briefs on the merits and the record on appeal, we find no reversible error in the grant of summary judgment. By the plain language of the bond, RLI\u2019s obligations to SSEMC did not arise until SSEMC de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>dared Cayenta in default <em>and </em>\u201cformally terminated [Cayenta\u2019s] right to complete the contract.\u201d (R.l-5 at Ex. D, \u00b6 3.2.) Furthermore, the terms of the bond incorporate the terms of the construction contract (R.l-5 at Ex. D, \u00b6 1), and the construction contract states, \u201c[U]nder no circumstance shall the Bond remain in force later than May 30, 2003.\u201d (R.l-5 at Ex. C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">There is no record evidence that SSEMC declared Cayenta in default of the construction contract and terminated Cayenta\u2019s right to complete the contract prior to May 30, 2003. There is evidence to the contrary. Namely, on June 15, 2004, SSEMC sent Cayenta and RLI a letter which stated, \u201c[SSEMC] hereby gives notice to [Cayenta] and Cayenta\u2019s surety, RLI insurance Company ... of Cayenta\u2019s default of its obligations____[SSEMC] has allowed Cayenta more than 12 additional months within which to cure its failure to deliver....\u201d (R.l-5 at Ex. E.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">For the foregoing reasons, as a matter of law, RLI breached no obligation to SSEMC. Summary judgment for RLI was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
