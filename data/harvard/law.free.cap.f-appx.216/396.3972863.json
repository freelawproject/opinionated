The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because Jeffery\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). This court reviews such a dismissal de novo. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">A state prisoner may not maintain a \u00a7 1983 action if a judgment in favor of the prisoner would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence, unless the prisoner can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence already had been invalidated. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). The rule in <em>Heck </em>applies to proceedings that call into question the fact or duration of parole. <em>Littles v. Bd. of Pardons and Paroles Div., </em>68 F.3d 122, 123 (5th Cir.1995) (applying <em>Heck </em>to parole revocation).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Jeffery\u2019s argument that his claim if successful would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his parole proceedings is based on <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-83, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). In <em>Wilkinson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the claims of two state prisoners challenging the validity of state procedures for determining parole eligibility were properly brought under \u00a7 1983 because \u201cneither prisoner\u2019s claim would necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at \u2018the core of habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Unlike the prisoners in <em>Wilkinson, </em>Jeffery is not making a general challenge to parole procedures, he alleged a specific error in his case\u2014that the Board wrongly considered arrests which had been expunged to deny him parole. Jeffery sought a declaratory judgment stating that the consideration of those arrests was error and that the error was the sole reason for the denial of parole. Additionally, Jeffery sought compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged actions that caused him to be denied parole. Granting this relief necessarily implies that Jeffery was denied parole in error. The district court did not err in determining that Jeffery may not obtain relief under \u00a7 1983 until the decision to deny him parole is reversed or otherwise called into question. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Littles, </em>68 F.3d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Jeffery\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jeffery\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Jeffery has a prior strike. <em>Jeffery v. Canales, </em>No. H-04-3798 (S.D.Tex. Oct. 8, 2004) (un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>published). Because Jeffery has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
