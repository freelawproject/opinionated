Second, Njenga argues that she qualifies for withholding of removal because the one-year fifing deadline does not apply in that regard, her women\u2019s enterprise group qualified as a social group for the purposes of the INA, and the alleged persecutors were members of the government or persons the government was unwilling or unable to control. Third, Njenga argues that the IJ abused its discretion when it denied her request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">As a threshold matter we are obligated to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. <em>Chacon-Botero v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">An alien can apply for asylum if she \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may also be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in fifing an application within the period specified----\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Nevertheless, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) provides, \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">Recently, Congress enacted the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Stat. 281, 310 (2005), and changed certain rules governing immigration appeals. Because the effective date of the Act is May 11, 2005, many of the substantive provisions do not apply because Njenga filed her asylum application before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">By contrast, the REAL ID Act\u2019s jurisdictional provisions are applicable. For instance, section 106(a)(l)(A)(iii) of the REAL ID Act amended INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, adding subsection (a)(2)(D), which reads \u201c[njothing in subparagraph (B) [removing jurisdiction for review of denials of discretionary relief] or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(a)). Section 1252(a)(2)(D) \u201cshall take effect upon the date of the enactment\u201d and it shall apply to any case \u201cin which the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion was issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment.\u201d REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(b), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 311. This section of the REAL ID Act applies to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">However, we recently held that the enactment of the REAL ID Act did not vest us with jurisdiction to review a finding that an asylum application was untimely or that extraordinary circumstances justified an untimely filing because these were discretionary or factual determinations. <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957. Therefore, under current precedent, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests us of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determinations that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse her untimely filing. <em>Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Njenga failed to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances \u2022or changed country conditions justified her untimely filing. <em>See Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1217-18; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we dismiss Njenga\u2019s petition for review in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">As a general issue, when the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we would normally be called upon to review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Chacona-Botero, 427 </em>F.3d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). However, <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s interpretation is informed by the principle of deference articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Castillo-Arias v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (considering withholding of removal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA may show, among other things, that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of her membership in a particular social group. <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004). Here, Njenga bears the burden of demonstrating that she more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon return to Kenya. <em>See id. </em>This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1324 n. 2. Hence, an alien who is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum necessarily is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, <em>membership in a particular social group, </em>or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. See <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien may establish, among other things, a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor-membership in a particular social group-will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such [membership in a particular social group].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). Thus, an asylum applicant may not show merely that she is a member of a particular social group, but must show that she was persecuted on account of membership in a particular social group. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198. \u201cThe statute governing withholding of removal protects not only against persecution by government forces, but also against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">\u201cCongress did not directly speak on the issue of what constitutes a \u2018particular social group,\u2019 ... within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1196. Accordingly, we must follow the BIA\u2019s determination that women in Kenya involved in the marketplace or women who are trying to have financially rewarding jobs in Kenya are not a social group under the INA unless the interpretation is unreasonable, i.e., arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we held that the BIA\u2019s requirement of a \u201ccommon, immutable characteristic ... [that] is fundamental to [its members\u2019] individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>identities or consciences, which is consonant with the purposes that underlie the other four grounds for refugee status or withholding of deportation under the INA\u201d was a reasonable interpretation of membership in a particular social group for purposes of asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 1196-97 (internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 211, 233-34 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 447 (BIA 1987)). We further observed that the standard set forth in <em>Acosta </em>struck \u201can acceptable balance between (1) rendering particular social group a catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution, which would render the other four categories meaningless, and (2) rendering particular social group a nullity by making its requirements too stringent or too specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Njenga was not entitled to withholding of removal under the INA. First, the IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that women involved in the market enterprise, or women in Kenya who are trying to have financially rewarding jobs does not fit within the meaning of membership in a particular social group. <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1195. Njenga fails to demonstrate how this alleged social group shares common, immutable characteristics that are fundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences. <em>See id. </em>at 1196-97. To the extent working and earning an income was proffered as a partial basis for concluding that the women\u2019s enterprise was a distinct social group, the record before the IJ showed that Njenga did both of these when she worked in the travel industry for about four years before joining the women\u2019s enterprise. Furthermore, if Njenga could have changed the location of the textile stalls, then she would not have had to change a characteristic so fundamental to her individual identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Second, the IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that Njenga could not prove that the attackers were motivated by the government, or had any connection with the government. At the removal hearing, Njenga admitted that she was not certain of the thugs\u2019 identities, but only that she suspected their connection to the government. Moreover, the government presented evidence, and Njenga admitted, that the Kenyan government had pursued her landlord, who she claimed was responsible, at least in part, for the attacks. The evidence also showed that Njenga was encouraged to report any further attacks and to seek out the police\u2019s assistance in this respect. Thus, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Njenga failed to demonstrate that she was persecuted by anyone supported by the government or that the government was unable to protect her. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Because Njenga could not show that she was targeted on account of a protected group, or that she was persecuted by anyone supported by the government or that the government was unable to protect her, she was not entitled to asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the burden of proof for withholding of removal under the INA is higher that the burden to secure asylum, Njenga\u2019s claim for withholding of removal fails. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. In sum, the IJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>findings are supported by substantial evidence, and therefore, we deny Njenga\u2019s petition for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">The Attorney General may permit an alien to voluntarily depart the United States at the alien\u2019s own expense if, at the conclusion of a removal proceeding, the IJ enters an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and finds that: (1) the alien has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served; (2) the alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien\u2019s application for voluntary departure; (3) the alien is not deport-able under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title; and (4) the alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l). No court, however, shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure under subsection (b) of this section, nor shall any court order a stay of an alien\u2019s removal pending consideration of any claim with respect to voluntary departure. INA \u00a7 240B(f), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">A court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). We have \u201cinterpreted that requirement to be jurisdictional, so we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Similarly, the INA prohibits us from reviewing \u201cany other decision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified under this subehapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find that we have no jurisdiction to hear Njenga\u2019s claim for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">In this case, we lack jurisdiction both because Njenga did not raise this issue before the BIA, and because the IJ made a factual determination that she did not qualify for voluntary departure based on her lack of intent to leave. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f); <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323. Accordingly, we dismiss Njenga\u2019s petition as to the IJ\u2019s denial of her request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-11\">. Because Njenga did not raise the issue of CAT relief before the BIA, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies, and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). Moreover, because Njenga does not raise the issue of CAT relief in her counseled brief, that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\">. Njenga did not claim withholding of removal on the basis of female circumcision or genital mutilation before the IJ or BIA; thus, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies in this regard. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim on appeal. See <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323. In addition, the passing references in Njenga's argument in her counseled brief are insufficient to raise this issue on appeal, accordingly; she has abandoned it. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
