Jenkins appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Lennar Corporation (\u201cLennar\u201d), the law firm of Duane Morris &amp; Heckscher (\u201cDuane Morris\u201d), and Tower Hill Insurance Company (\u201cTower Hill\u201d) in her <em>pro se </em>action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. On appeal, Jenkins argues that we should affirm the entry of default judgment in her favor and that the district court did not enter a final judgment because it did not rule on her motions for default judgment. This argument is without merit, however, because the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment specifically denied all pending motions as moot. Jenkins also argues that the district court erred by converting Tower Hill\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment because the dismissal motion was untimely. This argument is also without merit because Tower Hill\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion was not untimely, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(2), and because the district court properly construed the dismissal motion as a motion for summary judgment, which can be filed at any time. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(b). On the merits of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, Jenkins argues that the district court erroneously applied the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Before granting summary judgment in favor of Lennar, Duane Morris, and Tower Hill, the district court granted a motion by Suncoast Construction Group (\u201cSuncoast\u201d) to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the grounds that Jenkins failed to allege facts showing a basis for federal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">We are obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking and must be satisfied not only to our own jurisdiction, \u201cbut also of that of the lower courts in a cause under review.\u201d <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.) (citation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 377, 163 L.Ed.2d 164 (2005). We have held that, when the district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it should dismiss the complaint <em>\u201csua sponte </em>if necessary, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3)\u201d instead of entering summary judgment on the merits. <em>Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1240 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">To bring an action in a federal district court, a claim generally must involve (1) a federal question, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, or (2) diversity of citizenship between the parties and an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; <em>Baltin v. Alaron Trading Corp., </em>128 F.3d 1466, 1469 (11th Cir.1997). The record demonstrates that Jenkins\u2019s action failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of either \u00a7 1331 or \u00a7 1332. First, according to Jenkins\u2019s complaint, all of the parties are citizens of Florida, so diversity of citizenship is not applicable. Second, Jenkins failed to present the district court with a federal question because, although she asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>that she is bringing her claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, none of the defendants could be liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">To obtain relief in a \u00a7 1983 action, the plaintiff \u201cmust show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). A private party is viewed as a \u201cstate actor\u201d for \u00a7 1983 purposes only if one of the following three conditions is met: (1) the state coerced or significantly encouraged the alleged unconstitutional action; (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally the state\u2019s exclusive prerogative; or (3) the state became a joint participant because it insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private parties. <em>Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the defendants are all private parties, and Jenkins did not allege any facts that would establish that any of the parties met any of the conditions to be considered a state actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The district court did not, however, exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to dismiss the claims against Lennar, Duane Morris, and Tower Hill for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and instead allowed the litigation to continue until it granted summary judgment in their favor. We conclude from the record that the district court should have dismissed the entire complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n, </em>324 F.3d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and remand this case with instructions to the district court to dismiss the complaint against Lennar, Duane Morris, and Tower Hill for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether <em>res judicata </em>applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\">. Suncoast is not a party to this appeal. Jenkins did not serve Suncoast with her appellate brief, and Suncoast did not enter an appearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
