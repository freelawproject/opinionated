Carroll, who was convicted of burglary, armed robbery, and felony murder, asserts his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inform the jury that his codefendant, Michael R. Crawford, who was identified as the shooter, was acquitted in a separate trial. Carroll maintains the outcome of his trial would have been different had his trial counsel informed the jury that Crawford had been acquitted. He claims the information would have caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, particularly in light of the fact he was portrayed by the State as the unarmed accomplice of the murderer, and not the actual shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, are also reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>Where a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal courts shall not grant habeas relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-5\">unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either (1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.... A state court conducts an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case. An unreasonable application may also occur if a state court unreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context. Notably, an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d is an \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-9\"><em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 1, 4, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). The legal standard governing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims is set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for adjudicating such claims. First, a movant must show counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 2064. The proper measure of attorney performance is \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2065. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if counsel made errors so egregious that he or she was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2064. Second, a movant must show the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>To prove prejudice, a movant must show there is a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>Id. </em>at 2068. \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2067. Finally, since both prongs of the test must be met, the court is not required to decide both prongs if the defendant is unable to meet one. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Even assuming Carroll can establish his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the state court\u2019s ruling on the prejudice prong was not an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established law. The state court concluded Carroll failed to establish a reasonable probability of a different result given the evidence against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>We agree. At trial, Verdean Deann Addison testified she observed Carroll and Crawford standing near the motel room of Vernon Raborn, the victim, approximately five minutes before she heard sounds resembling firecrackers. She also testified that, after hearing the loud noise, she saw Carroll and Crawford running towards a dumpster, and that Crawford was holding a nine millimeter semi-automatic gun at his side. Christine Miller testified immediately after the gunman shot Raborn, another man came into the motel room wearing a t-shirt covering his face, grabbed Raborn\u2019s wallet from under the mattress of the bed, and then ran. Additionally, both Addison and Ronald Wynn, a friend of Carroll\u2019s, testified Carroll admitted he was present when the victim was shot. Manoxia Moore testified she overheard a conversation in which Carroll stated he took Raborn\u2019s wallet. Further, in his taped statement, Carroll conceded he and Crawford went to Raborn\u2019s motel room, and Crawford knocked on the door, went into the room, and told the occupants to give him money. Thus, there was overwhelming evidence Carroll was a party to the crimes, given that Carroll (1) was seen by witnesses with Crawford near the victim\u2019s motel room, (2) acknowledged his culpability in the robbery to others, and (3) admitted he and Crawford went to Ra-born\u2019s motel room right before the murder occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Carroll\u2019s argument fails the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, and the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law or make an unreasonable determination of the facts. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
