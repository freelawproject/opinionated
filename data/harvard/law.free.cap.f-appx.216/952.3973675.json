On appeal, Moody argues that the district court erred by treating a 1982 conviction for third-degree burglary of a drug store as a qualifying conviction for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-25\">A person convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year is prohibited from possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). A defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is subject to the sentence-enhancement provision of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-26\">(1) In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">(2)(B) [T]he term \u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">(ii) is burglary....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), (e)(2)(B). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) and the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Day, 465 </em>F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The offense of burglary, in the context of \u00a7 924(e), does not depend on the definition adopted by the state where the person was convicted. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 590, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Moreover, burglary for \u00a7 924 purposes is not limited to the common-law definition. <em>Id. </em>at 593-96, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Rather, \u201ca person has been convicted of a burglary for purposes of a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a <em>building </em>or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">In determining whether a crime qualifies as a burglary, the district court should \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Applying <em>Taylor, </em>we have held that \u201ca district court only may inquire into the conduct surrounding a conviction if ambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995). Thus, where the state statute defines burglary as unlawfully entering a structure <em>or </em>a conveyance, a court would not be able to determine, based solely on the judgment, if a person was convicted of burglary of a structure or of a conveyance. <em>Day, </em>465 F.3d at 1266. Because burglary of a <em>conveyance </em>is not a \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as defined in <em>Taylor, </em>a court may need to look at the underlying conduct in order to determine whether the conviction was a qualifying conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Here, the Alabama statute, under which Moody was convicted in 1982, is unambiguous. It defines third-degree burglary as \u201cknowingly entering] or remaining] unlawfully in a <em>building </em>with intent to commit a crime.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-7-7 (emphasis added). Simply put, because the statutory language unambiguously includes the elements of \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d as outlined in <em>Taylor, </em>and provides for a term of imprisonment greater than one year, it is a qualifying offense under \u00a7 924(e). Accordingly, the district court did not err by sentencing Moody in compliance with \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
