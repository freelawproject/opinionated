See United States v. Watkins, </em>320 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2003). Guerra was convicted, <em>inter alia, </em>of health care fraud and conspiracy to eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>mit health care fraud, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1347. \u201cThe court, in imposing sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense, shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal, that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(7). Forfeiture proceedings under this provision are governed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Section 853(n)(6) provides only two ways in which third-party claimants can establish their interest in forfeited property. <em>United States v. Soreide, </em>461 F.3d 1351, 1354 (11th Cir.2006). Under this section,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-6\">[i]f, after the hearing [on the third-party claimant\u2019s petition], the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">(A) the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and such right, title, or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-8\">(B) the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 853(n)(6)(A), (B). Although proceedings under \u00a7 835(n) arise in the context of a criminal forfeiture, ancillary forfeiture proceedings are civil proceedings for the purposes of appellate review. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>244 F.3d 888, 907 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">As an initial matter, we dispose of claims that are not properly before us. We do not consider appellants\u2019 challenge to the forfeiture order based on their arguments that the evidence was insufficient to support Guerra\u2019s convictions, as it is raised for the first time in their reply brief. <em>Bauknight v. Monroe County, Fla., </em>446 F.3d 1327, 1330 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006). We do not consider appellants\u2019 claims to funds that were in various bank accounts before the beginning of the charged conspiracy. The only claimant seeking the return of these funds in the district court was Guerra, who is not a party to this appeal. To the extent that the appellants now assert a claim against this property (with the exception of Santos\u2019s asserted interest as an innocent owner or bona fide purchaser in the First Union account discussed below), we do not consider this claim because it is raised for the first time on appeal, <em>Narey, </em>32 F.3d at 1526-27, and it was not properly asserted under \u00a7 835(n) in a timely filed petition before the district court, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2); <em>Soreide, </em>461 F.3d at 1355 <em>(\u201cWe </em>will not vacate the summary judgment nor provide relief from the final order of forfeiture based upon a claim that was not asserted as required by the statute.\u201d). Santos also makes a claim to $200,000 from the sale of two pieces of real property she owned, which was used to pay off the mortgage on the La Paloma property as well as the excess amount of money from the sale. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>denied this claim, <em>inter alia, </em>because it was untimely and unverified. As Santos does not challenge this finding on appeal, she has abandoned the issue. See <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, as Santos raised this claim on December 22, 2005, over three months after the notice of forfeiture was published in the form of a post-trial unverified motion for partial adjudication of the La Paloma residence, we will not grant relief on appeal. <em>See Soreide, </em>461 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We now turn to the appellants\u2019 arguments that they are innocent owners and bona fide purchasers of the claimed assets. Unlike the civil forfeiture scheme, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853 does not contain a provision protecting innocent owners. <em>Soreide, </em>461 F.3d at 1354; <em>United States v. Jimerson, 5 </em>F.3d 1453, 1455 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.1993). As a result, we have rejected a claim under \u00a7 853(n) based on an assertion of innocent ownership. <em>Jimerson, </em>5 F.3d at 1455 &amp; n. 4. Accordingly, the appellants cannot prevail on the theory that they are innocent owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">They fare no better under the bona fide purchaser provision. The bona fide purchaser provision is only applicable to purchases of the defendant\u2019s interest in the asset and does not protect purchases from a third-party seller. <em>Soreide, </em>461 F.3d at 1356. \u201c[T]he term bona fide purchaser ... is generally understood to mean [o]ne who has purchased property for value without notice of any defects in the title of the seller.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>320 F.3d at 1283 (citation, emphasis, and quotation marks omitted) (omission and second alteration in original). Unsecured or general creditors are not bona fide purchasers within the meaning of \u00a7 853(n)(6)(B). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">As to the La Paloma residence, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Paula did not give consideration for the transfer of Guerra\u2019s interest in the La Paloma property on September 2, 2003. Although Paula made improvements to the property, he testified that his work on the La Paloma property was his contribution to the marriage and he did not expect to be paid. Although the parties stipulated that Guerra\u2019s interest was quit claimed for one dollar, Guerra testified that Paula did not pay her any money in return for the conveyance. As to Paula\u2019s argument that \u201clove and affection\u201d was consideration that supported the transfer, there is no evidence in the record on appeal that this was incorporated as part of the consideration for the transfer. In addition, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Paula was not reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture. Guerra transferred her interest in the property on September 2, 2003, months after both a temporary restraining order enjoining Guerra from alienating or disposing of any assets obtained as a result of the health care fraud or acquired by her after January 2000, and a preliminary injunction consistent with the temporary restraining order went into effect in a civil suit brought by the government, by which time Paula had attended seven hearings on the preliminary injunction, and had appeared before the grand jury to produce patient files from one of Guerra\u2019s companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">As to the Chevrolet, Paula\u2019s status, if any, as a bona fide purchaser on the original date of purchase based on the trade-in of the 1997 BMW is irrelevant to whether he was a bona fide purchaser under \u00a7 853(n)(6)(B). <em>See Soreide, </em>461 F.3d at 1356. Based on Guerra\u2019s testimony that Paula paid her nothing in consideration for transferring the title of the Chevrolet, the district court did not clearly err in finding that no consideration was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>to G\u00faerra in exchange for her transfer of the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">As to the Suzuki motorcycle, it is unclear whether the district court credited Guerra\u2019s testimony, as sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that Paula gave her $8,000 in cash to pay for the motorcycle. If the court did not, it did not clearly err in doing so, as Guerra could not remember when Paula gave her the money, Paula did not corroborate this testimony, and a copy of the alleged deposit slip was not introduced. Even if the court credited Guerra\u2019s testimony, it did not clearly err in finding that no consideration was given to Guerra in exchange for her transfer of the title. First, Guerra testified that Paula gave her nothing in exchange for the transfer of the title. Second, there was no evidence that the payment of the $8,000 was intended as consideration <em>for </em>legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">As to the Donzi vessel, Guerra testified that Paula did not give her any cash or consideration in exchange for the Donzi vessel and that it was a gift from her to Paula. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Paula did not give consideration for the transfer of Guerra\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">As to the bank accounts, there is no evidence that any of the appellants gave any consideration for any interest Guerra may have had in the accounts or in the funds deposited in the accounts. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding they cannot prevail under \u00a7 858(d)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that an innocent owner defense is not available to the appellants and that the district court did not clearly err in finding that they were not bona fide purchasers for value within the meaning of \u00a7 853(n)(6)(B). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 third-party claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-12\">. Guerra\u2019s direct appeal is currently pending before the Court. We previously dismissed this appeal, in part, for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that Guerra sought to appeal on her own behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-13\">. For the first time on appeal, the appellants also challenge the forfeiture of their interests on the grounds that the forfeiture is constitutionally excessive. Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not consider it. <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994). Before the district court, only the forfeiture of Guerra\u2019s property was challenged as constitutionally excessive. Guerra, however, is no longer a party to this appeal. To the extent that the appellants seek to raise an excessive fines claim on Guerra\u2019s behalf, they lack third-party standing because there is no hindrance to Guerra\u2019s own assertion of this claim in a direct appeal. <em>See Harris v. Evans, </em>20 F.3d 1118, 1122 (11th Cir.1994) (en <em>banc</em>).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b935-10\">. Although <em>Gilbert </em>considers 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(1), the RICO forfeiture provision, this provision is substantially identical to \u00a7 853(n) and our analysis of one provision is equally applicable to the other. <em>See Gilbert, </em>244 F.3d at 906 n. 47, 907.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
