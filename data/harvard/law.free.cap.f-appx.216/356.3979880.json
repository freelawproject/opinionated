Bates argues that the district court\u2019s reimposition of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(h) (2000) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because the addition of subsection (h) occurred in 1994 and did not apply retroactively to her 1989 offense. As Bates raises this issue for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). To establish plain error, Bates must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected her substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Bates\u2019 assertion that the district court relied on \u00a7 3583(h) in reimposing a term of supervised release is not supported by the materials included in the joint appendix. Though the district court did not identify the statutory authority relied upon in imposing its sentence, it is clear that the court need not have relied on \u00a7 3583(h) in reimposing a term of supervised release because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988), which was in effect at the time Bates committed her initial offense, provided for the reimposition of supervised release following revocation and reimprisonment. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Therefore, we conclude the district court did not err in reimposing a term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Bates\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
