Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (citations omitted); <em>In re: First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988); <em>In re: Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-23\">We find there has been no unreasonable delay in the district court. We further find Kokoski is not entitled to relief with respect to the reassignment of district court judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petitions for writs of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
