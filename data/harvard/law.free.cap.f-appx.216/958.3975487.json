The captain and four others, including appellant, who served as the vessel\u2019s crew, were aboard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-24\">On December 14, 2005, a Middle District of Florida grand jury returned a two-count indictment against appellant and the others aboard the vessel charging them, in Count One, with possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 46 Appendix, U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), 1903(g), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), and, in Count Two, with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Appendix, U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), 1903(g), 1903(j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). On March 16, 2006, appellant, having entered into a plea agreement with the Government, plead guilty to both counts, and on June 12, 2006, the district court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 135 months. He now appeals his sentences, contending that, in determining the sentence range under the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court erred in refusing to reduce his offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a downward adjustment of the offense level \u201cfor a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3) (2005). A defendant is granted a two-level adjustment as a minor participant if he \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5) (2005). A defendant bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense, by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. We have instructed that the district court first \u201cmeasure[s] the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [ ]he was held accountable at sentencing,\u201d then, if that is not dispositive, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants ... in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. The defendant\u2019s status as a drug courier does not alter this analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. The amount of drugs is \u201ca material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct,\u201d and \u201cthe Guidelines explicitly recognize that amount of drugs may be determinative in the context of minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Appellant failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he played a less significant of a role in trafficking the cocaine than at least the two other crew members who were indicted as codefendants. Thus, as a crew member on the vessel, his role in transporting the drugs was indistinguishable from two of his codefendants\u2019 roles, and he cannot be said to be any less culpable. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by refusing to reduce his offense level under \u00a7 3Bl.l(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Appellant contends that his sentences are unreasonable because the court miscalculated the sentence range under the Guidelines. We find no error in the court\u2019s calculation. And we find nothing in the record to support his claim that his sentences are unreasonable. Whether a sentence is unreasonable turns on the court\u2019s consideration of the purposes of sentencing that are spelled out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). The record discloses that the court properly considered those purposes in fashioning appellant\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-15\">. Appellant was to be paid $4000, $2000 of which he had already received, for assisting in the transportation of the cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
