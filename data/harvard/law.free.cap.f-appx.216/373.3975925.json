The evidence presented at the jury trial established that Jackson participated in a conspiracy to distribute prescription painkillers.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Upon resentencing, the district court again determined Jackson\u2019s base offense level to be 32, both as found by the jury and the court. The district court further determined, for the second time and contrary to the finding of the jury, that Jackson was a leader or organizer and thus added four levels to her offense level under the Guidelines, instead of three levels, which would have corresponded to the jury\u2019s finding that she was a manager or supervisor. The additional four levels brought Jackson to an offense level of 36, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court then heard argument with regard to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) factors, and specifically discussed the need in this case to avoid unwarranted disparities among codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The district court sentenced Jackson to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment on count one, a concurrent twelve-month term of imprisonment on count two, concurrent 144-month terms on counts 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15, and concurrent twelve-month terms on counts 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The district court further ordered Jackson to be placed on supervised release for three years on counts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15, and for one year on counts 2, 4, 6, 8,10,12, and 14, all to run concurrently to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Jackson again appeals, now asserting district court error in resentencing relative to her Fifth Amendment rights, claiming that post <em>-Booker, </em>the Fifth Amendment requires that facts relied upon in sentencing be found by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. Jackson further asserts that the district court was not free to reject the jury\u2019s finding relative to her role in the offense because of the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d of this case, <em>i.e. </em>because the Government requested a jury finding on this issue, on fairness grounds, the district judge should not now be permitted to reject that finding. She also contends that her sentence was not reasonable, based on the district court\u2019s findings relative to her role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Jackson first challenges the district court\u2019s application of a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in resentencing. This assertion is without merit. <em>See generally, United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>Booker, </em>a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gonza</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>lez, 407 F.3d 118, 125 (2d </em>Cir.2005); <em>McReynolds v. United States, </em>397 F.3d 479, 481 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Tabor, </em>439 F.3d 826, 830 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Jackson also challenges the district court\u2019s four-level role in the offense enhancement of her sentence on fairness and reasonableness grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our review of the sentencing transcript in this case reveals that the district judge clearly and accurately applied its statutory and legal obligations in resentencing Jackson, considered the arguments of counsel, and decided that its original findings relative to Jackson\u2019s role in the offense did not need to be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). As Jackson\u2019s sentence is within the properly calculated advisory guideline range, we find it to be presumptively reasonable, <em>see United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006), and we find nothing in Jackson\u2019s assertions on appeal sufficient to overcome that presumption. Moreover, Jackson\u2019s ultimate sentence on remand was below both the advisory range triggered by the four-level enhancement found by the district court, and two years below the bottom of the advisory guideline range the district court could have imposed based solely upon the jury\u2019s determinations with regard to Jackson\u2019s role in the offense, and far less than the maximum sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s findings. Finally, Jackson\u2019s assertion that the error was not harmless because even though the district court sentenced her well below even the guideline range applicable to the jury\u2019s findings, her sentence \u201cmay very well have been lower had the court started from the appropriate Guidelines range\u201d is sheer speculation and thus insufficient to support her request for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Jackson has failed to demonstrate error by the district court in resentencing. Upon resentencing, the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range and the relevant statutory factors. Accordingly, we affirm Jackson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\">. This court previously affirmed Jackson\u2019s conviction, but remanded her case to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which case was decided after Jackson\u2019s original sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>170 Fed.Appx. 812 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). In her original appeal, Jackson claimed a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error based on the district court\u2019s reliance on its own finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson was a USSG \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) \"leader or organizer\u201d (and not, as the jury found, a USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) \"manager or supervisor\u201d), as well as a statutory <em>Booker </em>error because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, not advisory. Citing <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005), this court rejected Jackson's claim of constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, finding that her argument misconstrued <em>Booker\u2019s </em>constitutional analysis, which focuses on the actual sentence imposed, not on the offense level used in computing the Guidelines sentence, and determining that because Jackson\u2019s actual sentence of 188 months for the conspiracy count fell short of the 210-month maximum that the district court could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>imposed based solely on the jury\u2019s determinations, there was no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. This court ordered resentencing because the district court applied the Sentencing Guidelines in a mandatory, rather than advisory, fashion. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>170 Fed.Appx. 812 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\">. Had Jackson's base offense level been increased by only three levels under the jury\u2019s \"manager or supervisor\u201d finding, the range would have been 168 to 210 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Jackson makes no claim or assertion that the district court\u2019s factual finding that she was a leader or organizer in the conspiracy was unsupported by the evidence or the product of clear error, <em>see United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 536 (4th Cir.2005) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1142, 163 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2006), and, indeed, she states on appeal that she is not complaining that the district court\u2019s f\u00edndings relative to her role in the offense were unsupported by the evidence or the product of clear error. Rather, her complaint is that the court decided the issue differently than the jury, based upon a different standard, and that the Government should not be allowed to take an inconsistent position in the matter, <em>i.e. </em>because it requested a jury finding on the issue of Jackson\u2019s role, it should be bound by that finding now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
