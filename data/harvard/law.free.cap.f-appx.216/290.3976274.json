Keflu claims she is eligible for asylum and the immigration judge\u2019s decision was not supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). \u201cPersecution in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>volves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds ____\u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We find Keflu failed to show she was persecuted on account of a protected ground or because of an imputed political opinion. We further find the evidence was not so compelling as to warrant a different result. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-16\"> Keflu does not challenge the denial of withholding of removal or withholding under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
