Karim argues that the BIA erred when it denied his motion for reconsideration, in which he sought an adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ment of status based on a pending visa petition for alien worker status.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We apply an abuse of discretion standard when we review motions to reconsider immigration proceedings. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Karim\u2019s motion for reconsideration, as the record reflects that Karim had not supplied the BIA with the requisite documentation to obtain an adjustment of status. <em>See United States v. Ryan-Webster, </em>353 F.3d 353, 355 (4th Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(b), 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Karim contends that his due process rights were violated because the BIA rejected his eligibility for an adjustment of status. We review due process challenges arising from deportation proceedings <em>de novo. Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Given Karim\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory prerequisites for obtaining adjustment of status on his alien worker petition, he cannot show that his constitutional rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider his removal proceedings. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Karim has filed a motion to remand his petition to the BIA for reconsideration based on the approval of his 1-140 petition. Although Karim has also attached an I-485 form, he fails to provide any evidence that the form has been approved. The BIA was not privy to these documents, and, moreover, Karim still has not satisfied the final requisite steps for obtaining adjustment of status. <em>See Ryan-Webster, </em>353 F.3d at 355-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION FOR REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
