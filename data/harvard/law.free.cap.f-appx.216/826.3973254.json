On appeal, Rotte does not challenge the Tax Court\u2019s deficiency determination. Rather, he argues that he was subject to harassment and wrongful actions by the Internal Revenue Service without due process of law beginning in the 1980s. After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error and affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-23\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Estate of Whitt v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>751 F.2d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency is presumed correct and the taxpayer has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>proving it incorrect.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>771 F.2d 478, 479 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides, in part, that \u201cCongress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. XVI. The Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) imposes a tax on the taxable income of every individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, with some exceptions not applicable to Rotte. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(a)-(d); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 l.l-l(a). Taxable income includes, but is not limited to, \u201cCompensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(a)(3), (b). The IRC defines a taxpayer as \u201cany person subject to any internal revenue tax,\u201d and a \u201cperson\u201d includes an individual. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(1), (14). Every individual except those specifically excluded, primarily those whose earnings were less than a specified amount, is required to file an income tax return. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012; <em>United States v. Pilcher, </em>672 F.2d 875, 877 (11th Cir.1982). A wage-earner who does not fall under one of the statutory exceptions is subject to both civil penalties and criminal prosecution if he does not file a proper income tax return and pay any taxes he owes. <em>See, e.g., </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6651 (imposing monetary penalties for fading to file a tax return or pay taxes); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6654 (same if a taxpayer whose employer does not withhold taxes fails to pay estimated taxes over the course of the tax year); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 (providing that it is a felony to attempt to evade the payment of taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Section 6214(b) of the IRC provides that the Tax Court is jurisdictionally limited to reviewing only those matters pertaining to the tax years that are the subject of the notice of deficiency. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6214(b). The Tax Court \u201cshall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year or calendar quarter has been overpaid or underpaid.\u201d <em>Id.; see Estate of Mueller v. Commissioner, </em>153 F.3d 302, 305 (6th Cir.1998) (concluding that \u201c\u00a7 6214(b) makes it abundantly clear that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction extends no further than the amount of the deficiency before it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">On appeal, Rotte does not challenge the validity of the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the amount of his income tax deficiency ($2,457) for tax year 2001. Nor does Rotte challenge the validity of the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the addition to tax ($584.15) he owes for failing to file an income tax return for tax year 2001. Accordingly, he has abandoned any such arguments on appeal. <em>See Allison v. McGhan Medical Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1317 n. 17 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cIssues that are not clearly outlined in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned.\u201d). Instead, Rotte alleges that he suffered harassment at the hands of the IRS during the 1980s and 1990s. Because Rotte\u2019s allegations of harassment have no bearing on the determination of the income tax deficiency or addition to tax for the 2001 tax year\u2014the sole tax year at issue in the IRS\u2019s notice of deficiency, and the sole tax year at issue in Rotte\u2019s petition for redetermination in the Tax Court\u2014any such allegations were beyond the scope of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6214(b) of the IRC. <em>See Estate of Mueller, </em>153 F.3d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The record demonstrates that the Tax Court correctly entered a final decision in favor of the Commissioner because Rotte did not meet his burden to establish that the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination was incorrect. <em>See Taylor, </em>771 F.2d at 479. Accordingly, the Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that Rotte was liable for a deficiency in federal income tax of $2,457 and an addition to tax of $584.15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
