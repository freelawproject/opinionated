The district court sentenced Hooks to 169 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-25\">Hooks contends that the district court violated his due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles, by imposing sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rather than under the mandatory guidelines applicable at the time of his offense. This claim is without merit. We have previously concluded that the retroactive application of the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>does not violate either due process or ex post facto guarantees. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 369-70 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>444 F.3d 250 (4th Cir.2006). We therefore reject Hooks\u2019 ex post facto claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Moreover, a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable.\u201d). We reject Hooks\u2019 contention that this principle violates <em>Booker. </em>Here, the district court properly consulted the guidelines and took them into account in determining Hooks\u2019 sentence, made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, considered the sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and imposed a sentence that was within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We therefore affirm Hooks\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
