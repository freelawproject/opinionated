Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">In determining Fabian\u2019s guideline range, the district court set Fabian\u2019s base offense level at 32. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (a)(3), (c)(4) (2003). The court then imposed a two-level enhancement because a dangerous weapon was possessed, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(1), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for a total offense level of 31. Considered together with Fabian\u2019s Criminal History Category of II, this offense level yielded a guideline range of 121-151 months imprisonment. On the Government\u2019s recommendation, the district court imposed a sentence of 90 months imprisonment\u2014approximately 75 percent of the low end of Fabian\u2019s guideline range\u2014based on Fabian\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West Supp.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-23\">Fabian argues on appeal that imposition of the two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon violated his Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, because Fabian\u2019s sentence was less than the high end of the guideline range that would have applied before the weapons enhancement was imposed and the acceptance of responsibility reduction was granted, Fabian\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 &amp; n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>For this reason, Fabian\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-17\"> Fabian was sentenced before the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendering the sentencing guidelines \u201ceffectively advisory.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
