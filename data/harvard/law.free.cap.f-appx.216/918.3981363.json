After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">A federal grand jury returned a 32-count indictment charging Holmes with (1) filing false claims against the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 (Counts 1-10, 21-26); and (2) converting public money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (Counts 11-20, 27-32). The indictment alleged that Holmes, on sixteen separate occasions, falsely claimed that she had not received Supplemental Security Income checks on behalf of her daughters. After receiving replacement checks from the SSA, Holmes negotiated the replacement checks even though she already had negotiated the original checks. Holmes pled guilty to Count 10 of the indictment, pursuant to a plea agreement, and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Holmes\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2). The PSI also recommended (1) a 4-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(C), because the total amount of loss to the SSA was $12,684.50; and (2) a 2-level increase for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, because Holmes violated the conditions of her bond by testing positive for cocaine on several occasions. With a total offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of I, Holmes\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 10 to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">At sentencing, the district court sustained Holmes\u2019s objection to the 2-level increase to her offense level for obstruction of justice, resulting in a total offense level of 10 and an advisory guidelines range of 6 to 12 months. The district court then requested argument concerning what sentence to impose. In response, Holmes\u2019s counsel argued that Holmes\u2019s cocaine addiction was \u201cthe root of the problem,\u201d and suggested that Holmes\u2019s punishment should \u201cget at the root.\u201d Accordingly, Holmes\u2019s counsel argued for a sentence of time served plus a \u201cresidential treatment program for whatever period within the guideline range the Court decides\u201d and a reasonable term of supervised release. Counsel also noted that Holmes had some very serious family circumstances and personal health issues, and that her only criminal history was two traffic violations. Holmes also addressed the court, during which she admitted that she had an addiction to cocaine and stated that she \u201cwant[ed] to get past [her] addiction\u201d and be there for her children. The government noted the seriousness of the offense, but also admitted that Holmes needed help for her drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">After stating that it had considered the statements of the parties, reviewed the PSI, and \u201cconsidered the statutory factors, especially those raised by [Holmes\u2019s counsel],\u201d the district court sentenced Holmes to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019 supervised release with a special condition that Holmes participate in a substance abuse treatment program, and ordered restitution in the amount of $12,684.50. The district court noted that the sentence was within the advisory guidelines range and that it found no reason to depart from the advisory guidelines range. In response to Holmes\u2019s objection to the length of her sentence, the district court explained, \u201cI\u2019m trying to put you in a position where you will have an opportunity to have a constructive life ahead of you when you finish your term of imprisonment. It\u2019s clear that you cannot do it on your own.\u201d Holmes now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">On appeal, Holmes argues that her 10-month sentence is unreasonable and that it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly-calculated advisory guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). We review the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). This \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential .... and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">After review, we conclude that Holmes has not shown that her 10-month sentence is unreasonable. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range, and Holmes does not challenge those calculations on appeal. The district court also indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, especially those advanced by Holmes\u2019s counsel, which included the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the need for the sentence to provide treatment for Holmes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Moreover, the district court specifically stated that it was imposing a sentence of 10 months in order to provide Holmes with an opportunity for rehabilitation from her cocaine addiction. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say that Holmes\u2019s 10-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
