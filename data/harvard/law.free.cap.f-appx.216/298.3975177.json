Dumas asserts that: (1) the search of his home was illegal; (2) there was insufficient evidence to prove possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (3) his sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Dumas first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence gathered as a result of the search of his residence. This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying such a denial for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Bush, </em>404 F.3d 263, 275 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 289, 163 L.Ed.2d 254 (2005). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2005). Despite Dumas\u2019 contention that the officers\u2019 search was outside the scope of what was necessary to \u201csecure the property,\u201d the signed consent form clearly gave consent to \u201cgo on the property, house and building(s) and inside the vehicle(s).\u201d Once inside the house, Dumas does not dispute that the officers found firearms and drugs in plain view. Accordingly, we find the district court did not err in denying the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Dumas next contends there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence supports the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). The court reviews both direct and circumstantial evidence and permits the \u201c[GJovernment the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">This court has \u201cdefined \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as \u2018evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). We find the evidence was sufficient to support Dumas\u2019 conviction. Contrary to Dumas\u2019 contention that the gun was merely present in a room with drugs, the evidence shows that a loaded shotgun, which was possessed illegally, was located in close proximity to large amounts of cocaine and cash. Moreover, other indicia of drug trafficking were found in the room. We therefore affirm this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Finally, we will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>variance sentence provided that the sentence, \u201cfalls within the statutory limits for the underlying offense and is \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>see United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A sentence that exceeds the advisory guideline range will generally be deemed reasonable \u201cif the reasons justifying the variance are tied to [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) and are plausible.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434. We find the record reflects that the district court here adequately and properly considered all of the sentencing factors and the statutory sentencing limits. Moreover, the court\u2019s extensive reasoning was tied to \u00a7 3553(a) and plausibly justified the variance. We therefore find Dumas\u2019 sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.\u2019 convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> The Government contends that Dumas has not previously raised the issue of the officers\u2019 use of the term \"secure\u201d versus \"search\u201d in the consent form, and thus it should be reviewed for plain error. However, it is clear from the record that the issue was discussed at both suppression hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
