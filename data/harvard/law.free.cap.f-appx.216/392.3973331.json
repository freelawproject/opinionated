R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Hosseini argues that her allegations that Judge Sharp was not acting in a judicial capacity when he gave her legal advice were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss based on judicial immunity. She argues that the magistrate judge was biased because she and the defendant had once been law clerks together and that the district court\u2019s disregard for the law indicates that bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-23\">Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from damages in \u00a7 1983 actions arising out of all acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions. <em>Krueger v. Reimer, </em>66 F.3d 75, 77 (5th Cir.1995). Hosseini\u2019s complaint alleged that Judge Sharp spoke with Hosseini in his chambers in connection with her brother\u2019s interdiction proceedings over which the judge was presiding and advised her as to what action could be taken to express her objections to the manner in which the interdiction proceedings were being handled. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>judge\u2019s actions were clearly judicial in nature and did not reflect that Judge Sharp was acting in the capacity of legal counsel for Hosseini. The judge\u2019s rulings in the interdiction proceedings were also judicial in nature. Even if the judge\u2019s rulings were in error or were the result of a malicious intent, Judge Sharp was not deprived of his immunity because the acts were all judicial in nature. <em>See Mays v. Sudderth, </em>97 F.3d 107, 110-11 (5th Cir.1996). In light of Judge Sharp\u2019s entitlement to absolute immunity, the district court did not err in determining that Hosseini\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Hosseini has not made any showing that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation or the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint were the result of personal bias. <em>See United States v. Couch, </em>896 F.2d 78, 81 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
