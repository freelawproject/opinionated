Monyei contends that the Board and Immigration Judge erred in finding her ineligible for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. </em>INS, 296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Monyei failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-21\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
