Wilkins appeals district court orders granting summary judgment to five Virginia law enforcement officials (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) in his action under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 2003). Wilkins alleges that Appellees presented false and misleading testimony to the federal grand jury that indicted him on drug charges of which he was later acquitted. The district court rejected Wilkins\u2019 claim, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wilkins had failed to present any evidence to support his allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-23\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment to Appellees.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-16\"> We also reject Wilkins\u2019 argument that the district court afforded him inadequate opportunity to conduct discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
