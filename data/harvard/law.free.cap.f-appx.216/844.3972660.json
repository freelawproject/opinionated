Second, Gamino argues that the district court deprived him of his right to due process of law by first, with the prosecutor, improperly inducing an informant to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, and then refusing to grant immunity to that witness. With our permission, Greenidge has adopted this argument on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, Greenidge argues, first, that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his convictions, because the only evidence of his knowledge and intent to commit the object offenses was his presence in the informant\u2019s vehicle, the fact that he was wearing a bulletproof vest, and a co-conspirator\u2019s uncorroborated testimony. Further, Greenidge argues that even if this is sufficient evidence under existing law, we should fashion a new rule of law requiring extrinsic, corroborative evidence of a defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent in addition to any cooperating codefendant\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Because Greenidge did not raise his Fifth Amendment argument before the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776. Accordingly, Greenidge must show: (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error cannot meet the plain requirement of the plain error rule if it is not clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>We have rejected challenges to reverse stings on numerous occasions. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1413 (11th Cir.1998). \u2018While the Supreme Court and this Court have recognized the possibility that government involvement in a criminal scheme might be so pervasive that it would be a constitutional violation, that standard has not yet been met in any case either before the Supreme Court or this Court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Greenidge admits that he is asking us to depart from precedent and fashion a new rule. Accordingly, even assuming that Greenidge could show error, he has not shown that it is plain error, and we affirm his convictions under this indictment in this respect. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322 (\u201c[a]n error cannot meet the \u2018plain\u2019 requirement of the plain error rule if it is not \u2018clear under current law1 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">\u25a0 To the extent that they were preserved, we review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004). \u2018We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a defendant\u2019s invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Hernandez, </em>141 F.3d 1042, 1049 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">\u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any [c]riminal [cjase to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. \u201cThis provision ... must be accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). While this privilege covers testimony that would either directly \u201csupport a conviction under a federal criminal statute\u201d or merely \u201cfurnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime,\u201d it only protects the witness where he or she \u201chas reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 71 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">\u201c[A] criminal defendant has a constitutional right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense.\u201d <em>Unites States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1108 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted). \u201cSubstantial interference with a defense witness\u2019 free and unhampered choice to testify violates due process rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Demps v. Wainwright, </em>805 F.2d 1426, 1433 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cWhen such a violation of due process rights occurs, a court must reverse the conviction without regard to prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, however, a witness\u2019s right not to be compelled to incriminate himself trumps a defendant\u2019s right to subpoena witnesses in his defense. See <em>United States v. Lacouture, </em>495 F.2d 1237, 1240 (5th Cir.1974) (noting that even if the defendant had subpoenaed a witness, that witness\u2019s presence \u201c[would] not override [her] privilege against compulsory self-incrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">The Supreme Court has reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction where the \u201cthe judge\u2019s threatening remarks, directed only at the single witness for the defense, effectively drove that witness off the stand.\u201d <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 353, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972). In that case, a state court judge <em>sua sponte </em>used very strong language with a witness, assuring him, for example, that if he lied under oath the judge would \u201cpersonally see that [his] case [went] to the grand jury and [that he would] be indicted for perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 93 S.Ct. at 352. The Court held that \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>light of the great disparity between the posture of the presiding judge and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the judge could well have <em>exerted such duress on the witness\u2019 mind as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\u201d Id. </em>at 98, 93 S.Ct. at 353 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Unlike the court in <em>Webb, </em>other than assuring the informant that his decision regarding whether or not to assert his Fifth Amendment rights did matter, the district court in this case did not make any remarks directed at him at all. Most of the debate regarding the assertion of his rights occurred before the informant was even present, and even after he was present the court neutrally informed him that it believed he needed counsel to advise him on his Fifth Amendment rights. Neither the court nor the government threatened the informant with the consequences of committing perjury. Ultimately, nothing the court or the government did could be said to have \u201cexerted ... duress\u201d on the informant or come anywhere close to preluding a \u201cfree and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, an undercover law enforcement agent introduced, through testimony, the essential facts that Gamino intended to establish through the informant. On this basis, the court gave an entrapment instruction, and Gamino\u2019s counsel was able to assert an entrapment defense in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Before the district court, Gamino pointed to no support for his contention that the informant waived his Fifth Amendment rights. Even if there were error, which we doubt, it is not plain error. Gamino has not shown that his substantial rights were affected or that the fairness of the proceedings was seriously affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Additionally, because the government did not move to grant the informant use immunity, the court had no discretion to do so. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6003. Finally, because the court appointed counsel in a neutral way, showing only concern for the informant\u2019s rights and without suggesting that the attorney should persuade him not to testify, and because there is no evidence that the attorney did anything other than enhance the informant\u2019s voluntary decision, Gamino\u2019s argument in this regard is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">As to the propriety of the informant\u2019s assertion of his right not to incriminate himself, the extensive debate provided the court with a detailed understanding of what the informant was expected to address in his testimony, including information regarding an unrelated cocaine transaction. Because this could have reasonably caused the informant to \u201capprehend danger from a direct answer,\u201d the court properly found that he was legitimately exercising his right not to testify. <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486, 71 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">For all these reasons, the district court did not err by finding that the informant in this case had legitimately exercised his Fifth Amendment right and did not deprive Gamino of his right to due process of law in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Because Greenidge did not ask the district court to apply a newly fashioned corroboration rule, we review that claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2006). Under this standard, Greenidge must show: (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must view the facts, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1236 (11th Cir.2001). As long as the jury \u201ccould find that the evidence established] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the evidence at trial did not need to \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>906 F.2d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1990). This is so because \u201c[a] jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1357 (11th Cir.1983). Similarly, \u201cwe resolve all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1194 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\u201cTo support a conviction of conspiracy, the government must prove [1] that an agreement existed between two or more persons to commit a crime and [2] that the defendants knowingly and voluntarily joined or participated in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1328 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 772, 163 L.Ed.2d 598 (2005). The government is not required to demonstrate the existence of a \u201cformal agreement,\u201d but may instead demonstrate by circumstantial evidence a meeting of the minds to commit an unlawful act. <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1182 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Nov. 13, 2006) (No. 06-7829). Proof that the accused committed an act which furthered the purpose of the conspiracy is relevant to the existence of agreement, <em>id., </em>as is evidence that the defendant \u201cknew the essential object of the conspiracy,\u201d <em>Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d at 1328. \u201cAlthough mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction, presence nonetheless is a probative factor which the jury may consider in determining whether a defendant was a knowing and intentional participant in a criminal scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1635, 164 L.Ed.2d 346 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction for attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants (1) acted with the kind of culpability required to possess cocaine knowingly and wilfully and with the intent to distribute it; and (2) engaged in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime under circumstances strongly corroborative of their criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001). To prove attempted Hobbs Act robbery, the government had to prove that the robbery would have affected commerce had it been completed. <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>171 F.3d 1351, 1354 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), the government must show that, during and in relation to their conspiracy to rob cocaine, defendants used, carried, or possessed a firearm in furtherance of that conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 937, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004). \u201cPossession may be actual or constructive, joint or sole .... [a]nd ... a defendant may be liable for a co-conspirator\u2019s possession if possession was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">As to the conspiracy counts, first, a co-conspirator testified expressly that Gamino and Greenidge had come to an agreement, and his description of Gamino\u2019s discussion recruiting Greenidge and their agreement to split the stolen cocaine showed that Gamino and Greenidge also had an agreement. Next, circumstantial evidence of Greenidge\u2019s knowledge and intent included: (1) the co-conspirator telling him they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>were going to rob cocaine; (2) Gamino speaking to him privately, possibly to discuss the planned crime; and (3) Greenidge\u2019s conduct in accompanying the others while carrying a weapon and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Accordingly, the jury could reasonably have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Greenidge had committed the conspiracy charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">For these same reasons, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Greenidge had acted with the culpability necessary to possess the cocaine, and that he had the intent to distribute it. Further, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he took a substantial step toward completing the offense when he armed himself and rode in the vehicle to the warehouse. Finally, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the robbery, if completed, would have effected commerce, as the undercover law enforcement agent testified that he told Gamino the cocaine had come from Colombia. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the attempt charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">As to the substantive firearms charge, given the testimony by the co-conspirator and the law enforcement photographer, as well as the physical evidence admitted through the photographer, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Greenidge had carried a firearm in relation to the conspiracy to rob the cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the co-conspirator admitted that he had carried a firearm, which also could have served to support the charge against Greenidge, as this was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">For all these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to support Greenidge\u2019s conviction on all counts and none of his convictions were a manifest miscarriage of justice. We also reject Greenidge\u2019s argument that the district court should have applied a corroboration rule. We need not address the legal issue because we conclude that there was ample corroboration. Moreover, any error by the court was not plain and did not affect his substantial rights or the fairness of the proceeding. <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322. Accordingly, this argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. Greenidge did not join in Gamino\u2019s arguments on this issue before the district court. Accordingly, with regard to Greenidge, we will review this issue only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Nevertheless, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the standard of review is not dispositive, because even Gamino\u2019s preserved arguments on the issue are meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\">. On appeal, Greenidge does not assert, as he did before the district court, that the government failed to prove that the cocaine moved in interstate commerce. Accordingly, that argument is waived. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-7\">. Although the photographer could not testify that the revolver was found in Greenidge's pocket, the <em>jury </em>could reasonably conclude, from the rest of his testimony and the photographs that he took at the scene, that it was found there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b876-25\">.
