On appeal, Herring argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Herring also contends that the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because the record did not show that Herring testified untruthfully as to any material issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">A. Denial of Herring\u2019s Motion to Withdraw His Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Herring first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Herring had agreed to plead guilty based upon the explanation of retained counsel, Clyde Taylor, that Herring should plead guilty as a delaying tactic to give counsel time to investigate and prepare for a suppression hearing and trial. Herring contends that his plea was thus unknowing and unintelligent because he did not receive reasonably effective assistance of counsel. He adds that judicial resources were not conserved because, if the district court denied his motion to suppress, he would have again pleaded guilty. Although the district court found prejudice to the government, the government had already prepared its case and was not relying upon any civilian witness who might lose memory or disappear. Herring concludes that Taylor, not Herring, was responsible for the delay because Taylor made misleading statements and promises, and Herring timely notified the district court of his desire to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">We will disturb a district court\u2019s decision to deny a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>a guilty plea only when it constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McCarty, </em>99 F.3d 383, 385 (11th Cir.1996). A decision is not an abuse of discretion unless it is arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">After the district court has accepted a defendant\u2019s plea, but before sentencing, a defendant may withdraw his guilty plea if he \u201ccan show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). The provisions of this rule should be \u201cliberally construed.\u201d <em>McCarty, </em>99 F.3d at 385.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, \u201c[tjhere is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Medlock, </em>12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cThe good faith, credibility and weight of a defendant\u2019s assertions in support of a motion [to withdraw] are issues for the trial court to decide.\u201d <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 472 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In determining if the defendant has met his burden for withdrawal, \u201cthe district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea,\u201d including the following factors: \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72 (citations omitted). Where a defendant has not satisfied the first two prongs of the analysis, we need not give considerable weight to the last two. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado, </em>808 F.2d 796, 801 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cThere is a strong presumption that the statements made during the [plea] colloquy are true.\u201d <em>Medlock, </em>12 F.3d at 187. Consequently, a defendant \u201cbears a heavy burden to show his statements [under oath] were false.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 168 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">We conclude from the record that under the first prong of the analysis, Herring had the close assistance of counsel, who met with Herring at least six to eight times and explained the plea agreement to him. Regarding the second prong, Taylor testified that he advised Herring that the option of withdrawing a guilty plea was \u201cno delaying tactic.\u201d There is a strong presumption that Herring\u2019s acknowledgment of his understanding and his statements as to his communications with the attorney are true, and we defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determination in favor of Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">In light of Taylor\u2019s testimony, the plea colloquy, and the length of time between the entry of the plea and Herring\u2019s motion to withdraw it, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision was not unreasonable. Consequently it was not an abuse of discretion, and we affirm Herring\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">Herring next argues that the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction for justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because the record did not show that Herring testified untruthfully as to any material issue. Herring claims that \u00a7 3C1.1 is not designed to punish a defendant for pleading not guilty or for moving to withdraw a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>The standards for reviewing the application of the Guidelines before the <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), decision apply after <em>Booker </em>as well. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA sentencing court under <em>Booker </em>still must consider the Guidelines, and, such consideration necessarily requires the sentencing court to calculate the Guidelines sentencing range in the same manner as before <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>at 1178-79. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the imposition of an enhancement for obstruction of justice for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the factual findings to the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). \u2018Where ... the district court must make a particularized assessment of the credibility or demeanor of the defendant, such as when applying the obstruction of justice enhancement for perjury, we accord special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, and we review for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Banks, </em>347 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant may qualify for a two-level enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">[i]f (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (n) a closely related offense ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. One may obstruct or impede justice by \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. 4(b). Perjury has been defined, for the purpose of applying this enhancement, as \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Though \u201cthe district court should make specific findings as to each alleged instance of obstruction by identifying the materially false statements individually ..., a general finding that an enhancement is warranted suffices if it encompasses all of the factual predicates necessary for a perjury finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cFour elements must be present in order for a court to make a finding that a defendant perjured himself: (1) the testimony must be under oath or affirmation; (2) the testimony must be false; (3) the testimony must be material; and (4) the testimony must be given with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a result of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763 n. 4. \u201cMaterial\u201d evidence under this Guideline is \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. 6. Even if a district court fails to make specific findings, \u201ca remand is unnecessary if the record clearly reflects the basis for enhancement.\u201d <em>See United States v. Uscinski, </em>369 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err. The record supports that Herring committed at least two instances of perjury regarding: (1) whether he understood the charges, and (2) whether he was coerced or bribed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">Because the district court did not clearly err in determining that Herring provided false testimony, the next issue to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>is whether the statements were material. Under the low threshold for materiality under the commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1, we conclude that Herring\u2019s false testimony that Taylor advised him to plead guilty as a stalling tactic was material. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Herring\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">. <em>McCarty </em>interpreted former Criminal Rule 32(e), which is now found at Rule 11(d) (presentence withdrawal of guilty plea) and 11(e) (post-sentence withdrawal). <em>See </em>2002 Advisory Committee Notes to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.
