We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Vittitoe\u2019s conduct carried a base offense level of twenty, which was increased two levels because the robbery involved the property of a financial institution. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(a) &amp; (b)(1) (2005) (\u201cUSSG\u201d). Due to the nature of this offense and Vittitoe\u2019s criminal history, Vittitoe was designated a career offender. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 (2005). Because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) is twenty years, Vittitoe\u2019s offense level increased to thirty-two. USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (2005). With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Vittitoe\u2019s total offense level was twenty-nine. This, coupled with a criminal history category of VI,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> yielded an advisory Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table) (2005). Vittitoe did not object to the application of the Guidelines as set forth in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On appeal, Vittitoe first posits that the presumption of reasonableness this court affords <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentences that are within a properly calculated Guidelines range is unconstitutional. A plethora of circuit precedent forecloses this argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because one panel of this court cannot overrule another, we decline Vittitoe\u2019s invitation to ignore established circuit authority. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346-47 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Vittitoe next asserts that his sentence is unreasonable. In <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, district courts must calculate the appropriate Guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and impose a sentence. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432-33. A sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">Vittitoe\u2019s 160-month sentence is presumptively reasonable because it is within both the properly calculated Guidelines range and the applicable statutory maximum. Although the district court did not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record, it was not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345; <em>see United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). The record reflects that the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and considered Vittitoe\u2019s personal history and circumstances in determining his sentence. Illustrative of the individualized sentencing consideration Vittitoe received is the fact that the district court made specific recommendations on the record regarding the mental health services Vittitoe should receive while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Vittitoe\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">.
