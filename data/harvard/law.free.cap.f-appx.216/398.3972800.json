Webber contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts that were not set forth in his indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">Webber\u2019s claims based on alleged errors that occurred at sentencing may not be asserted in this \u00a7 2241 petition because they fail to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court properly dismissed Webber\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
