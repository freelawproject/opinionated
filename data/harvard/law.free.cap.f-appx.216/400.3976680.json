In July 1999 the BIA dismissed Osabede\u2019s appeal of a decision by an immigration judge denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordering that he be removed to Brazil. Osabede\u2019s motion to reopen proceedings was due within ninety days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">In his motion to reopen, Osabede frivolously suggested that his motion was based on his failure to appear at his immigration hearing, an allegation that is flatly contradicted by the record of that hearing. Although a failure to appear may support the filing of an untimely motion to reopen under an exception enumerated in \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iii) and may support an exercise of jurisdiction by this court, <em>see Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005), Osabede has abandoned any reliance on such exception in his petition for review, <em>see Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Osabede\u2019s petition for review relies on no exception listed in \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C) and cites no equitable basis for avoiding the statutory ninety-day deadline for filing a motion to reopen. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over Osabede\u2019s petition, because there is \u201c \u2018no meaningful standard against which to review1 \u201d the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249 (5th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). The petition for review is thus DISMISSED, and Osabede\u2019s motion to stay removal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
