Delio-Quintero also contends that his 151-month sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">A. Denial of Reduction Based on Role in the Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">Delio-Quintero first argues that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a reduction based on his role in the offense because he was merely a mechanic, was hired at the last minute, had no decision-making authority, and was not part of any planning, organizing, or recruiting. He complains that the district court in a similar case granted a minor-role reduction to a defendant who was an off-loader, as well as the ship\u2019s cook, during a one-month voyage. He also argues that the district court appeared to apply the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion and placed too much emphasis on the amount of drugs involved. Delio-Quintero contends that he should not have received the same sentence as his more culpable codefendants, the captain of the vessel and the overseer of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. A \u201cminor participant\u201d is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>In determining whether a minor-role adjustment applies, the district court should consider the following two principles: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. As to the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we explained that \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Further, \u201cin the drug courier context, ... the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct ... [and] may be dispositive\u2014in and of itself\u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">With regard to the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we determined that a district court should look at other participants only to the extent that they (1) \u201care identifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and (2) \u201cwere involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. In order to satisfy the second prong, the defendant must show he is less culpable than most other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>We recognized, however, that the first prong set forth in <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>may, in many cases, be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 945. In some cases, even the least culpable participant in the conspiracy will not be entitled to a minor-role adjustment. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying a minor-role reduction because Delio-Quintero failed to meet his burden of showing that his role, as compared to the relevant conduct, was minor. The district court held Delio-Quintero accountable for the approximately 3,000 kilograms of cocaine on the boat. Delio-Quintero\u2019s argument, that he was less culpable because he was a mere mechanic who had no ownership interest in the drugs or the boat and was not involved in planning or recruiting, does not suggest that he played a minor role in the conduct for which he was held accountable but merely tends to show that Delio-Quintero was not involved in the larger drug conspiracy. That alone is insufficient to support a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">With regard to the second prong, all five crew members were involved in using a boat to move the drugs from Colombia and in dumping the drugs from the boat when they were apprehended. Moreover, even the least culpable participant may not be entitled to a minor-role reduction. In light of the amount of drugs involved, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Delio-Quintero failed to meet his burden of showing that he was a minor or minimal participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">B. Reasonableness of Delio-Quintero\u2019s 151-month Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Delio-Quintero next argues that the disparate sentencing among similar \u201cboat cases\u201d indicates that his \u201cdraconian\u201d 151-month sentence was greater than necessary, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He complains that the district court did not properly take into account that Delio-Quintero was subject to an immigration detainer and would receive more restrictive confinement in prison than other prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">As an initial matter, the parties agree that we should review Delio-Quintero\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, but the government adds that Delio-Quintero must show plain error because he did not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>serve his challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence below.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We find it unnecessary to determine whether Delio-Quintero must show plain error. As discussed below, Delio-Quintero\u2019s sentence was reasonable, and the district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise, in the way it imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">After the district court has accurately calculated the Guideline range, we review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and our reasonableness inquiry are guided by the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense ...; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. While a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not per se reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, the district court\u2019s statement that it has considered those factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Moreover, where the district court has considered permissible factors, we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors \u201cbecause our review is not <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Williams, 456 F.3d 1353, 1363 </em>(11th Cir.2006) (noting that the weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court), <em>cert. pet. filed, </em>No. 06-7352 (Oct. 19, 2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">In this case, the record demonstrates that the district court heard Delio-Quintero\u2019s arguments at sentencing, expressly noting that it had taken into account the \u00a7 3553 factors, \u201cespecially the seriousness of the offense and the matter of promotion of respect for the law and deterrence, both general and specific.\u201d The district court then found that the mid-range 151-month sentence was appropriate. Although a correctly calculated Guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, Delio-Quintero offers no arguments that his sentence is otherwise unreasonable, other than contending that the district court did not take into account his relatively minor role and that he would be subject to an immigration detainer. Accordingly, we conclude that Delio-Quintero\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Delio-Quintero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
