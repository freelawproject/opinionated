Wolk <em>v. </em>Wolk.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b730-6\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Maloney </em>(2000), 91 Ohio St.3d 1204.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b730-8\">(No. 00-AP-030</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A83\">Decided July 6, 2000.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b730-10\">Moyer, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agjp\">This affidavit of disqualification filed by Marshall D. Buck, counsel for defendant, Marcia S. Wolk, seeks the disqualification of Judge Timothy P. Maloney from further proceedings regarding the above-captioned cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The essence of affiant\u2019s claim of bias and prejudice is that counsel for plaintiff Joshua Wolk in the underlying case was an active participant in Judge Maloney\u2019s 1996 election campaign and served as Judge Maloney\u2019s campaign manager. Affiant contends that this matter should have been disclosed prior to trial and that this relationship has caused the judge to be biased against affiant\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">' Attorneys are the primary targets of requests for campaign contributions and to serve on judicial campaign committees, and the mere fact that an attorney served as chairman or a member of a judge\u2019s campaign committee does not, without more, mandate the judge\u2019s disqualification from cases in which that attorney appears as counsel of record. See <em>In re Disqualification of Ney </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1271, 1272, 657 N.E.2d 1367, 1368, and Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline Advisory Op. No. 92-9. Similarly, financial contributions and other forms of support during a judicial campaign do not raise a reasonable question regarding a judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>In re Disqualification of Jackson </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 1232, 704 N.E.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">In this case, the record does not support affiant\u2019s claim that opposing counsel served as Judge Maloney\u2019s campaign manager or otherwise took a leadership role in the election campaign. Even if those allegations were true, affiant has failed to establish the existence of bias or prejudice or the appearance of impropriety that would mandate Judge Maloney\u2019s disqualification from the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">The balance of affiant\u2019s allegations constitutes disagreement or dissatisfaction with the judge\u2019s legal rulings, which I have held do not constitute grounds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>disqualification. See <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
