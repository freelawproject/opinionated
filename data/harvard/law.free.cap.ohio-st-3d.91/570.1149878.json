Bradley, challenges the denial of his application to reopen his direct appeal under App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Bradley was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. The Court of Appeals for Scioto County affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(Sept. 22, 1987), Scioto App. No. 1583, unreported, 1987 WL 17303. We affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari. <em>Bradley v. Ohio </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">On February 1, 2000, Bradley filed an App.R. 26(B) application in the court of appeals. App.R. 26(B)(1) requires that an application to reopen be filed within ninety days from journalization of the judgment, absent good cause for filing later. The court of appeals found that Bradley had failed to show good cause for not filing his application until February 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">App.R. 26(B)(5) also requires that the applicant show \u201ca genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d The court of appeals found that Bradley\u2019s application failed to clear this hurdle as well, remarking that \u201ceven if the application was considered on its merits we would still find no \u2018genuine issues\u2019 as to whether [Bradley] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>deprived of effective assistance of appellate counsel.\u201d Accordingly, the court of appeals denied the application to reopen Bradley\u2019s direct appeal. From that denial, Bradley appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqFT\"><em>David H. Bodiker, </em>Ohio Public Defender, and <em>Angela Miller, </em>Assistant State Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b721-6\"><em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, sets forth the standard for judging ineffective-assistance claims: \u201cWhen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. See, also, <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201c[apply] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. Moreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test \u201cis the appropriate standard to assess a defense request for reopening under App.R. 26(B)(5).\u201d <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697. Applying the <em>Strickland </em>test, we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Bradley has failed to raise a genuine issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
