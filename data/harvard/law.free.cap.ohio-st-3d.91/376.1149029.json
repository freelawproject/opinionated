Jones, was convicted of aggravated murder with death specifications, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the court of-appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Jones </em>(Aug. 28, 1998), Hamilton App. No. C-970043, unreported, 1998 WL 542713. On direct appeal as of right, we also affirmed his convictions and sentence on December 27, 2000. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 739 N.E.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">On November 27, 1998, appellant filed an application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals relied on <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 457, 459, 700 N.E.2d 613, 615, and held that he had not properly alleged ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court further held that if it were to assume that appellant had properly raised ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims, he failed to state \u201c \u2018the manner in which the deficiency [in appellate counsel\u2019s performance] prejudicially affected the outcome of the appeal,\u2019 which is required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(d).\u201d (Bracketed material <em>sic.) </em>The cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Michael K. Allen, </em>Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Ronald W. Springman, Jr., </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqUY\"><em>David H. Bodiker, </em>Ohio Public Defender, <em>Gregory W. Meyers, </em>Senior Assistant Public Defender, and <em>Jennifer P. Hite, </em>Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">We agree with the court of appeals that appellant failed to state a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Jones has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">To justify reopening his appeal, Jones \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We have reviewed appellant\u2019s six propositions of law alleging deficient performance by appellate counsel. In none of the six instances has Jones raised \u201ca genuine issue as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
