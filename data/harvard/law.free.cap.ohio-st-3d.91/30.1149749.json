Collins was industrially injured on February 4, 1983. His workers\u2019 compensation claim was originally recognized for multiple conditions, including \u201cepididymitis, diffused disc bulging at L3-4 and L4-5 and grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 on SI, sprain[ed] right knee; patella chondromalacia; tibial plateau chondromalacia; torn medial meniscus right knee.\u201d Claimant received temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTD\u201d) based on these conditions until June 2, 1993, when it was terminated due to the maximum medical improvement of those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In 1997, the claim was additionally allowed for \u201cdepression.\u201d This prompted claimant to seek reinstatement of his TTD based on the depressive condition. A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) for the Industrial Commission of Ohio denied claimant\u2019s motion, and claimant appealed. At a hearing before a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d), there were several documents from claimant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Edward Kezur. A February 20, 1997 C-84 physician\u2019s report supplemental certified claimant as TTD through March 7, 1997, due to depression. An earlier February 22, 1993 letter from Kezur discussed claimant\u2019s condition in depth. It discussed claimant\u2019s work injury and stated that \u201c[sjince then he has been suffering from chronic pain and complications of depression.\u201d He also stated that claimant \u201cis depressed because he is in constant pain in his lower back and down his right leg.\u201d The final document consisted of nineteen pages of office notes covering claimant\u2019s visits from 1992 through 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The SHO denied the appeal, but modified the DHO\u2019s order, concluding that Dr. Kezur\u2019s office notes were not persuasive, as they showed that claimant\u2019s depression was due to his personal problems, not to his allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in denying his motion. The court of appeals disagreed, and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Claimant asserts that the documents from Dr. Kezur are \u201cuncontradicted evidence\u201d of TTD due to the allowed depressive condition, and that the commission\u2019s stated reason for rejecting them is an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The SHO concluded that any depression that existed was not due to claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. He based his conclusion on Dr. Kezur\u2019s office notes, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\u201c[T]he office notes of Dr. Kezur from 11-11-92 to 11-18-96 [sic, 11-8-96] are not persuasive. The notes deal mainly with claimant\u2019s court problems for nonsupport payment and criminal changes [sic] \u2014 these factors are the cause of claimant\u2019s depression. The allowed conditions concerning the low back are mentioned only two or three times in the 75 visits form [sic] 11-11-92 to 11 \u2014 [8]\u2014 96.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The SHO\u2019s statements are simply incorrect. While claimant\u2019s domestic problems are indeed discussed, the notes do not deal \u201cmainly\u201d with those issues to the exclusion of claimant\u2019s low-back problem. Contrary to the SHO\u2019s representation, we found at least fifty office visits where claimant\u2019s back pain was mentioned. For example, \u201cconstant\u201d back pain was expressed on at least fourteen occasions. Claimant was described as \u201cpain ridden\u201d on five visits. References to \u201cmuch\u201d pain, \u201cchronic and acute\u201d pain and \u201ckilling\u201d pain are seen repeatedly. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>complaints led Dr. Kezur to observe in 1996 that claimant was \u201cstill obsessed with his pain.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Am5\"><em>Butkovich, Schimpf, Schimpf &amp; Ginocchio Co., L.P.A., James A. Whittaker </em>and <em>Stephen P. Gast, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Dr. Kezur stated on February 22, 1993, that claimant was \u201cdepressed because he is in constant pain in his lower back and down his right leg,\u201d and had been depressed \u201csince\u201d his work injury. Dr. Kezur\u2019s notes support this conclusion, and, in the absence of contrary evidence, we find that claimant has met his burden of proof. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
