Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 36.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b186-7\">(No. 00-1310</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AH5\">Submitted December 12, 2000</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7\">Decided January 31, 2001.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">In 1983, appellant, Arthur Bealler, appeared in the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas and pled guilty to the first three counts of an indictment charging him, <em>inter alia, </em>with rape. Bealler was convicted and sentenced to an aggregate term of twenty-one to seventy-five years in prison. In 1991, 1992, 1997, and 1999, following hearings, the Ohio Parole Board denied Bealler parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In 1999, Bealler filed an \u201capplication for a writ of mandamus\u201d in the Court of Appeals for Columbiana County. Bealler claimed that appellee, Ohio Adult Parole Authority (\u201cAPA\u201d), had failed to reduce his maximum sentence in accordance with former R.C. 2967.19 and 2967.191 <em>et seq. </em>and that the APA had erroneously applied the 1998 parole guidelines to him. After the court transferred the case to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, Bealler amended his \u201capplication\u201d by additionally claiming that under former R.C. 5145.02, he was entitled to be released because he had already served his minimum term of incarceration, as reduced by the good time he had earned. In June 2000, the court of appeals denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In this cause now before us upon an appeal as of right, Bealler asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ because of the APA\u2019s refusal to comply with former R.C. 2967.19 and former R.C. 5145.02 and the APA\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>imposition of the 1998 parole guidelines. Bealler\u2019s assertions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">First, neither former R.C. 2967.19 nor former R.C. 5145.02 reduces the maximum term of Bealler\u2019s indeterminate sentence. These provisions also do not entitle Bealler to release from prison before he serves the maximum term provided in his sentence. See <em>State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 425, 427, 687 N.E.2d 283, 284-285, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Second, application of the challenged parole guidelines to Bealler does not constitute <em>ex post facto </em>imposition of punishment. <em>Douglas v. Money </em>(1999), 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Ohio St.3d 348, 349, 708 N.E.2d 697, 698; <em>State ex rel. Henderson v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 267, 268, 690 N.E.2d 887, 888.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWq\">\n<em>Arthur Bealler, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AYs\"><em>Betty D. Montgomery, </em>Attorney General, and <em>Philip A. King, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Third, to the extent that Bealler claims that he should be released from prison, habeas corpus is the appropriate action. <em>State ex rel. Carter v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 496, 733 N.E.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Finally, original actions for extraordinary relief like a writ of mandamus must be commenced by filing a complaint or petition, not by filing a \u201cmotion\u201d or an \u201capplication.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Brantley v. Ghee </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 521, 522, 700 N.E.2d 1258, 1259; <em>State ex rel. Graves v. Ney </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 234, 718 N.E.2d 1289, 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
