I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss this cause as improvidently allowed. As Judge John T. Patton noted in his dissenting opinion, the rule adopted by the court of appeals could create problems in future replevin cases, for it \u201cequates the [removal] of a disability with re-establishing an immediate right to possession or ownership of earlier confiscated property, * * * where such property has been legally confiscated.\u201d The court of appeals\u2019 decision to return the confiscated gun collection to Bernad might also conflict with R.C. 2933.41(C). That division provides, without qualification, that a person loses <em>any right </em>to possession of property that was the subject of an offense, the offense here being the undisputed possession by Bernad of the guns while under a disability.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHpz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number><em>Kevin M.
