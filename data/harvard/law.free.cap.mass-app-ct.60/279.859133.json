We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\"><em>The evidence. </em>The record, murky in some areas, supports the following recitation. Matthew Deignan, a special agent for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, was led to the defendant by an informant named Leo Lobello. Lobello had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>been a friend of the defendant, and used this relationship to facilitate drug transactions between the defendant and Deignan. On five separate occasions between May, 1996, and May, 1997, the defendant sold cocaine to Deignan. Two of these sales (the subjects of the present indictments), as well as some of the conversations leading to the sales, were recorded on video and audio tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant, substantially relying on a defense of entrapment, testified on his own behalf to the effect that he had a substance abuse problem, which he was addressing. He further indicated that he was called and contacted repeatedly by Deignan, who pressured him to sell cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The defendant also called his former friend, Lobello, who was serving a sentence in Federal prison on narcotics convictions. Lobello, who was treated as a hostile witness, was called for two reasons. First, it was hoped that Lobello would bolster the defense claim that the defendant was not predisposed to sell cocaine. Secondly, Lobello was painted as the instigator of the drug transactions, as well as a reprobate and liar, testifying to curry favor with the Federal authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>Facts underpinning the alleged conflict. </em>At different points in time, Attorney Bradford Keene represented both Lobello and the defendant. Keene came to represent Lobello first when, in or about April of 1998,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lobello\u2019s mother, Marie, paid him $2,000 to attempt to have Lobello transferred from a Federal prison in South Carolina to one closer to his family in Massachusetts. Keene never met, or spoke, with Lobello. The sum total of his work consisted of making a few telephone calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to the prison authorities in South Carolina, who never responded to his inquiries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Approximately one month later, in May, 1998, after the defendant had been arrested, charged, and arraigned on the matter at hand, Keene was privately retained to represent him. Keene worked on the case for a relatively short period of time when, in January, 1999, he received a call from Attorney John McBride. The crux of the call was that the defendant had terminated Keene and hired McBride. After sending the file to McBride\u2019s office, Keene did nothing. Although it was anticipated that Keene would withdraw his appearance as attorney for the defendant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he never did.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">On the morning of the third day of trial, the assistant attorney general who was prosecuting the case informed the judge that she had just learned (erroneously, as it turns out) that Keene had been retained by Lobello\u2019s family to file a \u201cRule 35 [motion] for relief from sentencing.\u201d In fact, Keene had been retained to attempt to have Lobello transferred from a Federal prison in South Carolina to one closer to his family in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Needless to say, the trial ground to a halt. The trial judge thoroughly aired the issue. Keene, perhaps indicative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>limited nature of his role, was not present in court at the time, arriving midway through the hearing. McBride repeatedly informed the judge that Keene had never told him of his relationship with Lobello and that he was shocked at the revelation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Keene, upon his late arrival, told the court that about one year prior to trial, he was asked by the Lobello family if it would be possible for Lobello to be transferred to a correctional facility closer to his family. Keene stated he made several telephone calls to a prison official at the South Carolina facility where Lobello was being held. Apparently, Keene never actually spoke with the prison official, and his messages went unanswered. According to Keene, \u201c[tjhat [was] the extent of my relationship. ... I have never spoken to Leo Lobello, I don\u2019t know the man; and that\u2019s the extent of my relationship.\u201d Keene stated that at the time of his activity on Lobello\u2019s behalf, he was representing the defendant. He was, however, unaware that Lobello had been an informant against the defendant, as \u201c[t]here was no disclosure to me at that point in time nor at any time during my tenure as official counsel to [the defendant].\u201d When pressed by the judge as to when he had learned of Lobello\u2019s status as an informant against the defendant, Keene stated it had been only \u201c[a]bout a week\u201d before trial. As for the failure to disclose his having represented Lobello, Keene again emphasized his limited involvement with Lobello: \u201cthe extent of my relationship with Leo Lobello was to see if I could get him moved. It had no bearing on anything but that. The family came to me .... I made several attempts to get him moved, but that was the extent of my relationship. ... I have never talked to Leo Lobello, I have never met the man. That was it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Both Keene and McBride told the judge they had not discussed any aspect of Keene\u2019s representation of Lobello. After reviewing Keene\u2019s copy of Lobello\u2019s case file, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>decided to \u201ctake Mr. Keene at his word that he . . . didn\u2019t know Mr. Lobello\u2019s name before last week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The judge also inquired of the defendant, who stated that he had initially been represented by Keene, but that McBride had taken over the case several months before. The defendant informed the judge that he was \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with McBride\u2019s representation, his connection to Keene notwithstanding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Actual conflict of interest. </em>\u201cAn actual or genuine conflict of interest arises where the independent professional judgment of trial counsel is impaired, either by his own interests, or by the interests of another client. An actual conflict requires reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights without the necessity of showing that the conflict resulted in any prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. 266, 272 (2000), <em>S.C., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 921-922 (2003) (citation and quotations omitted). See Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.9(a), 426 Mass. 1342 (1998) (Conflict of Interest: Former Client). The burden is on the defendant to establish the existence of a genuine or actual conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>419 Mass. 456, 459 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">If the defendant meets his burden, reversal is mandated, without a showing of actual prejudice or \u201cthat [the conflict] had an adverse effect on his counsel\u2019s performance,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>unless the defendant consents \u201cto continued representation by his attorney \u2018so long as his consent is voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, supra </em>at 272 n.2, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 392 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>386 Mass. 165, 170 (1982) (\u201chaving established a genuine conflict of interest, [the defendant] was required to prove neither actual prejudice nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>adverse effect on his trial counsel\u2019s performance to entitle him to a new trial under art. 12\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Here, the defendant has failed to establish such a conflict. The timeline, while not completely determinative, establishes that Keene\u2019s activities on behalf of Lobello occurred approximately one year prior to trial. We will assume that Keene was in fact engaged in the representation of Lobello, although there were never any conversations or direct contact between the two, at the time he was making telephone calls to the South Carolina prison at the behest of Lobello\u2019s family.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After several of these calls proved fruitless, Keene apparently did nothing further, and still never spoke with Lobello. His representation ended at that point. The record reflects that Keene repeatedly insisted that his several telephone calls were the extent of his activities on Lobello\u2019s behalf, and that Lobello was represented by different counsel in his motion pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In these circumstances, with Keene\u2019s representation of Lobello having ended long before trial, and long before learning of Lobello\u2019s status as an. informant against the defendant, the defendant has not met his burden of establishing an actual conflict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass. 767, 775 n.9 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. at 388-389 (\u201cWhen there has been some form of dual representation that would have posed a conflict, termination of the conflicting representation prior to the time of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>trial will ordinarily \u2018obviat[e] the risk of simultaneous representation\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It is true that Keene represented the defendant after the defendant\u2019s arrest, prior to the defendant\u2019s hiring of McBride several months before trial. This fact establishes that there could have been a period where Keene represented both Lobello and the defendant. But this could not have given rise to a conflict, because, as the judge found, Keene was not aware of Lobello\u2019s status as an informant against the defendant until one week before trial \u2014 a point by which his activities on Lobello\u2019s behalf had long since ended. Since a conflict occurs when the \u2018independent professional judgment\u2019 of trial counsel is impaired ... by the interests of another client,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. at 20, quoting from S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981), common sense dictates that Keene\u2019s judgment could not have been impaired when he was not aware of the potentially divergent interests of his two clients. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>404 Mass. 372, 376 (1989). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geraway, </em>364 Mass. 168, 175 (1973). Moreover, there is no indication that Keene somehow gained access to privileged information through his representation of both the defendant and Lobello that was used to the defendant\u2019s detriment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 437-438 (1979) (\u201cthe constitutional guaranty is intended to prevent a defendant\u2019s attorney from being hampered by contemporaneous divided loyalties or by having acquired privileged information which inhibits him in his representation of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Potential conflict of interest. </em>Should a defendant be unable to demonstrate an actual conflict, he may still gain a new trial if he can establish \u201ca potential or \u2018tenuous\u2019 \u201d conflict, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass. at 775, which caused him \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>419 Mass. at 459.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cActual prejudice is measured against the standard in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, 366 </em>Mass. 89, 96 (1974), as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>cases involving claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Passing over the question whether there existed a \u201ctenuous\u201d conflict, the defendant has not shown any prejudice. Keene\u2019s involvement with the trial was essentially nonexistent. His role, as expressed by McBride, was to \u201cjust sit in there and shut up, and I\u2019ll do everything, and maybe you can learn something.\u201d Moreover, both McBride and Keene insisted that Keene had not participated in the preparation of the case, and the judge so found.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even had Keene shared information concerning Lobello with McBride, which both attorneys deny, this could not have harmed the defense. It would have been to the defendant\u2019s benefit for McBride to know more about Lobello, a hostile witness. In sum, there is no basis for a finding of prejudice based on Keene\u2019s alleged potential conflict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>435 Mass. 274, 282-283 (2001). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>390 Mass. 103, 108-109 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">It is significant that when questioned by the judge about the alleged conflict, the defendant indicated he was \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"><em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>The defendant next urges that his trial counsel, McBride, was ineffective in several respects, including (1) failing to advise the defendant of the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>leged conflict with respect to Keene; (2) failing to file a motion to sever the indictments; (3) introducing evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged drug transactions; and (4) failing to present \u201cpromised\u201d testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">To determine whether counsel was ineffective, we employ the well-known two-step analysis: \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As to whether McBride was ineffective in failing to advise the defendant regarding Keene\u2019s alleged conflict, or in failing to ascertain whether Keene had such a conflict, we conclude he was not. Keene and McBride emphasized that Keene was essentially an observer; that Keene learned of Lobello\u2019s status as an informant only a week before trial; and that McBride found out about Keene\u2019s representation only on the third day of trial. Via affidavit, Keene represented that following McBride\u2019s taking the case from him, he \u201cplayed no further role in [the] defense\u201d until asked to join McBride at counsel table a few days prior to the start of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In any event, we discern no prejudice stenaming from McBride\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in this regard. It is difficult to see how better work by McBride \u2014 in this case, informing the defendant of Keene\u2019s prior representation of Lobello \u2014 would \u201chave accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). The defendant now insists that had he been so informed, he would not have elected to continue to be represented by McBride. This assertion is belied by the defendant\u2019s assertion to the judge that he was \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with McBride\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The defendant also suggests in his affidavit that he was pressured by McBride into \u201cproceed[ing] with the trial.\u201d This asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tian is likely intended to counter the suggestion that the defendant waived any objection to the conflict. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>403 Mass. 279, 287-288 (1988). The judge conducted a colloquy of the defendant with respect to the defendant\u2019s satisfaction with McBride\u2019s representation. It is disingenuous for the defendant now to suggest that had he been given the opportunity to consult with other counsel unrelated to the litigation, he would have insisted on not being represented by McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The defendant\u2019s next contention is that McBride was ineffective for failing to move to sever the indictments, or for failing to oppose the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to join the indictments. Joinder was appropriate in this case because each drug transaction was a \u201crelated offense,\u201d that is, they arose \u201cout of a. . . series of criminal episodes connected together.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(a), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). The amount of cocaine sold was approximately the same in each instance. In each case, Deignan was the purchaser, the transaction was initiated by a telephone call from Deignan, and the phone call and the sale took place the same day. The two sales took place within four months of each other. This is not a case where, for example, instances of misconduct against unrelated victims took place years apart, and there was no evidence of a pattern, a common scheme, or the like. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 39-43 (2001). Moreover, given the minimal dispute as to the circumstances and personnel involved in the transactions, the balance swings clearly in favor of judicial economy, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 231 (1986), and against severance based on prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 303-304 (1991). Finally, we note that the failure to move for severance may have been a strategic decision, designed to highlight Deignan\u2019s initiation of each transaction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273 (1991). Counsel was not ineffective in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The defendant next claims counsel was ineffective for introducing in evidence the defendant\u2019s uncharged drug transactions with Deignan. The trial judge, acting on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, reasoned that this evidence could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>buttressed the entrapment defense by showing that Deignan created the defendant\u2019s predisposition to sell cocaine. The judge noted that it was defense counsel who called Lobello as a hostile witness, and elicited from him evidence (as characterized by the judge) of \u201crepeated, persistent solicitation ... by Lobello and Deignan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The defendant counters that this evidence destroyed his entrapment defense because it portrayed the defendant as a \u201cbad person and a drug dealer.\u201d We disagree. Evidence of sales to <em>other </em>persons may have damaged the entrapment defense. Here, however, each sale was to Deignan. The coercion in which defense counsel sought to portray Deignan as having engaged was not minimized, and may have been heightened, by this evidence. Such may not have been the case had the evidence been of drug transactions with other persons, because were that the case, the defendant would have been faced with demonstrating that different people on different occasions under different circumstances all brought about a predisposition in the defendant toward criminal activity. In this case, where the evidence of guilt was powerful, and where the challenged evidence may well have helped in the defense, we cannot fairly conclude the defendant was deprived of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Finally, the defendant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to deliver \u201cpromised\u201d testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind. As a preliminary matter, defense counsel never promised the testimony of experts. Thus, the defendant\u2019s citation to <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>858 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir. 1988), is misplaced.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> What was promised was this: \u201cwhat I expect the evidence to show is . . . that the government preyed upon this individual, this man who had psychological problems at the time, who was under the influence of medication, and who was using and abusing drugs. He\u2019ll admit it \u2014 it was a problem he had.\u201d This case is more akin to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 111, 123 (1998), which distinguished <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>noting that the defense attorney\u2019s statement (that the defendant might testify) \u201cwas far from a dramatic promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">An additional problem for the defendant is that such evidence was introduced through the defendant himself. The defendant testified to his ongoing drug dependency, and his depression. While it may have been minimally helpful for defense counsel to seek to introduce the testimony of two of the defendant\u2019s treating psychiatrists to corroborate the defendant, it was not ineffective assistance of counsel not to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 223, further appellate review granted, 440 Mass. 1105 (2003) (\u201cIneffective assistance of counsel is not established simply by showing that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not call a witness. . . . The defendant must make a showing that the purported testimony would have been either relevant or helpful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Evidentiary hearing. </em>In this appeal, the defendant does not request a remand for an evidentiary hearing on his new trial motion. Nonetheless, we consider whether a remand is necessary, and conclude it is not. There is little that could be introduced at such a hearing that either was not addressed at trial, or could not have been introduced via affidavit in support of the motion. The trial judge conducted a thorough inquiry of McBride, Keene, and the defendant. While it would be tempting to speculate as to how any of the involved individuals might testify under oath, it seems quite unlikely they could offer any more than that which they have already stated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. at 276 (remand necessary as \u201c[tjhere are obvious and serious questions in this case that should have been addressed, but were not\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>58 Mass.

His appeal from that denial has been consolidated with his direct appeal. We are mindful that a motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, and the judge\u2019s disposition will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990).

Keene indicated that McBride, on the Friday prior to the Monday start of trial, called and asked him to \u201c \u2018second seat\u2019 [McBride] at the upcoming trial\u201d; McBride, in turn, indicated that Keene, who had never tried a case in Superior Court, asked to stay on, wishing to learn. What the parties do agree upon is that Keene did nothing other than observe. Indeed, when the case was called before the judge, the clerk indicated that the defendant was \u201crepresented by Attorney John McBride\u201d; before the venire, the clerk informed the potential jurors of the same; McBride told the jurors that \u201c [s]itting with me at counsel table is Attorney Bradford Keene, with offices in Lynnfield, who will be with me.\u201d When Keene was dismissed from the case, midtrial, nothing was said to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b319-5\"> \u201cKeene never told me \u2014 never, ever told me he worked for, received any money for or from Leo Lobello or his family, ever, judge.

The only reason that Brad Keene is in the courtroom today is because he said, \u2018John, look, can I sit with you in this jury trial? I want to learn something.\u2019 . . . But that\u2019s the extent. I said fine \u2014 you know, just sit in there and shut up, and I\u2019ll do everything, and maybe you can learn something.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> We will further assume that Keene was engaged in the representation of the defendant at trial, his apparent lack of involvement in the proceedings notwithstanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> The defendant attempts to broaden Keene\u2019s representation to include work on the motion pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).

He retained another attorney for all appellate work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"> The defendant makes much of the judge\u2019s statements during the hearing on the issue to the effect that an actual conflict existed.
