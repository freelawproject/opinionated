There was evidence that the defendant had assisted in modifying the children\u2019s bedroom door so that they could be locked in to prevent them from escaping when the defendant and mother found it inconvenient to attend to them. There was evidence that the defendant, although he was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>biological father of the children, was not married to their mother, and was not the children\u2019s legal guardian, nevertheless had assumed the role of their father and provided for their supervision and care, both when the mother was absent and when she was home.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The defendant was convicted of two counts of violating G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(6), fourth par., inserted by St. 1993, c. 340, \u00a7 2, which provides, in material part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cWhoever, having care and custody of a child, wantonly or recklessly permits substantial bodily injury to such child or wantonly or recklessly permits another to commit an assault and battery upon such child, which assault and battery causes substantial bodily injury, shall be punished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Section 13J further defines the phrase \u201cperson having care and custody\u201d of a child as \u201ca parent, guardian, employee of a home or institution or any other person with equivalent supervision or care of a child, whether the supervision is temporary or permanent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at subsection (a). The sole issue on appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this case is whether G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J, is impermissibly vague because it fails adequately to define those persons subject to its prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">a. Only if the words used in a statute are so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence would have to guess at their meaning are they considered to be unconstitutionally vague. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 373 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>433 Mass. 481, 487 (2001). In determining this constitutional question, we may consider the context of the entire statute in which the challenged words are used. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 59 (1997) (\u201c[wjhen examining a criminal statute for possible unconstitutional vagueness, we may go beyond the actual language of the statute to give meaning to the words and phrases according to their common law meaning or statutory history\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Here, the words used, in their statutory context, do not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>persons of ordinary intelligence to speculate as to their meaning. Persons having \u201ccare and custody\u201d are well understood to include not only biological parents, but any persons, regardless of formal familial relationship, who have assumed either permanent or temporary responsibility for a child\u2019s care. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>62 Cal. App. 4th 826, 832 (1998); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>State, </em>372 Md. 285, 293-297 (2002); <em>People </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>93 N.Y.2d 564, 569-570 (1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted <em>supra, </em>the Legislature incorporated this common understanding into section 13J by including within the statute\u2019s compass \u201cany other person with equivalent supervision or care of a child, whether the supervision is temporary or permanent.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(a), inserted by St. 1993, c. 340, \u00a7 2. Section 13J thus defines the offense and those subject to its penalties with sufficient specificity to prevent ad hoc or subjective enforcement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>433 Mass. at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">b. The defendant next argues, albeit not with great clarity, that he can not properly be considered a person having \u201ccare and custody\u201d of the deceased children within the meaning of \u00a7 13J. On the contrary, the evidence presented was more than ample. Specifically, at trial, evidence was presented that the defendant had lived in the home with the children and their mother for at least seven months, during which time he shared with their mother the caretaking responsibilities for the children. The defendant took care of the children like \u201ca father should do,\u201d and the children loved him. Moreover, the defendant testified that he \u201cwas one <em>of the </em>caretakers for the children\u201d and that he was their primary caretaker when their mother was at work or was sleeping. The defendant further admitted that he had assumed primary responsibility for feeding the children, that he changed their diapers, played with them, and intended to teach one of the children how to play baseball. The defendant also routinely brought the children over to his parents\u2019 house and supervised them while they played.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On such facts the jury properly could conclude that the defendant had \u201ccare and custody\u201d of the children, within the meaning of \u00a7 13J, when he participated as a joint venturer in the wanton or reckless acts that led to the children\u2019s unfortunate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>deaths.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>188 Ariz. 388, 393-394 (1997), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1054 (1998) (substantial evidence supported jury verdict that defendant had \u201ccare\u201d and \u201ccustody\u201d of child under State\u2019s child abuse statute when he \u201caccepted responsibility\u201d for the child; the mother and her three children moved into defendant\u2019s home three months before the child\u2019s death, \u201c[djefendant provided food and shelter for the family . . . acted as caregiver . . . and was, in essence, their stepfather\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Culuko, 78 </em>Cal. App. 4th 307, 335 (2000) (evidence was sufficient to support jury finding of \u201ccare and custody\u201d where the facts demonstrated, among many things, that defendant had said \u201che was taking full responsibility for caring for the baby\u201d); <em>Dowler </em>v. <em>State, </em>547 N.E.2d 1069, 1071-1072 (Ind. 1989) (sufficient evidence of \u201ccare\u201d where defendant assumed responsibility for child\u2019s care \u201csometimes alone and sometimes jointly\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Widdison, 4 </em>P.3d 100, 106-107 (Utah Ct. App. 2000), <em>S.C., </em>28 P.3d 1278 (Utah 2001) (finding live-in boyfriend to have \u201ccare and custody\u201d under child abuse statute where he lived in the household for four months and during the time of the child\u2019s injuries, assumed a parental role, acted as a baby sitter and helped care for the child when the mother was out of the house).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> There is no claim that the evidence was not sufficient, assuming the defendant was within the class of persons defined by \u00a7 13J, to permit the jury to find that he was a joint venturer, that his acts and omissions constituted wanton or reckless conduct, or that his acts were causally related to the injury and death of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> See also authorities discussed <em>infra </em>at part b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
