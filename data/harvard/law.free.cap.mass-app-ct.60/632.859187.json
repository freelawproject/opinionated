L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(5). Following the customary hearing, the commission agreed and issued an order requiring the sheriff, among other things, to bargain with the union before imposing a ban on pins, including union insignia pins, and to refrain from interfering with the employees\u2019 rights to wear any pins, including those containing the union\u2019s insignia. The sheriff appeals. On the record before us, considered in light of applicable statutes, we believe that the sheriff was required to bargain before banning union pins and insignia but not any other pins or accouterments. We, therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The following unchallenged facts underlie the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Worcester County house of correction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (the jail) is the workplace of approximately 350 correction officers who are assigned, in shifts, to watch over 1,200-1,300 inmates, about 167 percent of the number the jail was designed to hold. The inmates either are awaiting trial, often for serious crimes such as murder, rape, and armed robbery, or are serving sentences, generally of two and one-half years or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The correction officers, as one might imagine, often deal with serious security situations and with violent behavior. To do so effectively, they are organized according to a hierarchical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>paramilitary command structure headed by an elected sheriff and, in descending order, a \u201cdeputy superintendent, . . . three first assistant deputy superintendents, several assistant deputy superintendents, captains, lieutenants, sergeants, permanent correction officers, and temporary correction officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">All permanent correction officers wear a uniform consisting of a standardized shirt, pants, necktie, name plate, gold badge, shirt sleeve patch reading \u201csheriff\u2019s department, [W]orcester [Cjounty,\u201d and a pin indicating the officer\u2019s rank. Temporary correction officers have the same name plate and shirt, patch but wear a different color uniform, have no tie, and wear a silver badge instead of a gold one.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On March 14, 1997, MCOFU was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for all correction officers and sergeants working at the jail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, John Gabriel, the first assistant deputy superintendent, reported to Deputy Superintendent William E. Frisch that he had seen correction officers wearing MCOFU pins on their uniforms and that others had reported similar sightings to him. As a result, on April 18, 1997, an attorney representing the sheriff sent a letter to MCOFU\u2019s lawyer stating that it was \u201cagainst the policy of the Jail\u201d for officers to wear union pins while in uniform. The letter made no mention of other pins.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">On April 22, 1997, Frisch underscored the lawyer\u2019s April 18 letter in a memorandum he sent to all assistant deputy superintendents. In his memorandum, Frisch said that the sheriff\u2019s \u201cdress code\u201d prohibited officers from \u201cwearing . . . any pins or other accouterments, not specifically authorized ... on the prescribed uniform.\u201d Frisch ended with an instruction requiring the deputy superintendents to insure that their command staffs \u201cvigorously enforce this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The April letter and memorandum did not mark the first occasions on which the sheriff, acting through subordinates, had expressed his views on the subject of nonstandard pins and badges. In 1995, about two years earlier, a MCOFU vice-president had written the sheriff to ask whether he had issued an order banning officers from wearing union pins and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>whether that order applied to all union pins or only to those of MCOFU, which was then engaged in an organizing campaign. Frisch responded with a letter stating that the existing \u201cdress code\u201d and collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prohibited officers from wearing \u201cnonregulation clothing or insignia.\u201d The letter went on to say that the \u201cdress code\u201d had been in effect since 1987 and applied both to union and to nonunion pins and insignia.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Notwithstanding references to policies and \u201cdress codes\u201d in the writings just described, the commission found that, for at least fourteen years before Frisch\u2019s April 22, 1997, memorandum, \u201ccorrection officers, sergeants, lieutenants, and captains . . . regularly [adorned their uniforms with] a variety of pins, including [MCOFU] and IBCO pins . . . and [wore] a variety of tie clips on their ties.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During that fourteen-year period, \u201cno supervisor asked an officer to remove any pin or tie clip, including [u]nion pins.\u201d After Frisch sent his April 22 memorandum, however, supervisors did begin asking officers to remove some pins and clips. As a consequence, \u201ccorrection officers and sergeants stopped wearing [u]nion pins, but continued to wear guardian angel pins and other pins in most areas of the [jail], and in the presence of supervisory correction officers.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, the commission was unpersuaded by the evidence that any policy or practice prohibited pin wearing before April 22, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Finally, the commission noted in the course of its findings that one deputy superintendent had opined during his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>that jail inmates tended to exploit for their own purposes differences and divisions between and among correction officers, differences like those the presence or absence of pins might advertise. The commission correctly observed, however, that the record contained no evidence that display of union pins had actually threatened, or otherwise adversely affected, jail discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Those factual findings led the commission to conclude that the sheriff\u2019s April 22 directive violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(5), because the sheriff failed to bargain with the union before he issued the directive and because, by issuing the directive, he interfered with the employees\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The sheriff\u2019s appeal from the resulting order rests on three principal claims. First is his contention that the union\u2019s charges are barred by the statute of limitations because the policy the union challenges had been in effect for more than six months before the union filed its prohibited practice charge in July, 1997. Next, the sheriff contends that creation and promulgation of a policy regulating uniforms is a core management function exempt from the bargaining process. Finally, the sheriff asserts that, even if policies concerning uniforms ordinarily would be a subject for bargaining, special circumstances attend employment in the jail and empower him to adopt unilaterally a policy prohibiting pins or other nonstandard uniform adornments.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">As we analyze those contentions, two primary principles are of continuing importance. First, while G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(5), as inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, often travel in each other\u2019s company, the two provisions protect different interests. Section 10(a)(1) broadly prohibits an employer from \u201c[i]nterfer[ing with], restrain[ing], or coerc[ing] any employee in the exercise of any right guaranteed under\u201d c. 150E. More narrowly focused, \u00a7 10(a)(5) prohibits an employer from refusing to bargain in good faith. Violation of the latter provision is almost invariably a violation of the former, although the reverse is not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Second, our review of the commission\u2019s decision and assessment of the sheriff\u2019s claims is cabined by the provisions of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11. We therefore must accept the commission\u2019s factual findings as long as those find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, we must affirm the commission\u2019s decision unless the decision is based upon an error of law, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), or, in the words of the statute, is \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. Among other things, those standards require us to \u201caccord deference to the commission\u2019s specialized knowledge and expertise, and to its interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>438 Mass. 177, 180 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Turning from general principles to the sheriff\u2019s arguments, we first consider the sheriff\u2019s claim that the statute of limitations barred the commission from acting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Resolution of that claim turns upon whether a policy prohibiting pins, or other nonstandard uniform adornments was in place more than six months before the union filed its prohibited practice charge. See <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 926, 927 (1992); 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03 (1993). That question is one of fact, and the hearing officer resolved it against the sheriff when she issued her findings on April 19, 2000. Those findings were supported by substantial evidence, i.e., by \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), as inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">To be sure, Frisch\u2019s 1995 letter to the union described a \u201cdress code\u201d that prohibited nonstandard pins, and Frisch sent that letter to the union almost two years before the union filed the prohibited practice charge. But the commission found that, until Frisch issued his memorandum on April 22, 1997, officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and supervisors alike proceeded without exception as if pin-wearing were completely unregulated. An unenforced and openly ignored directive is no policy at all, or at least the commission so could find, for policies are an organization\u2019s living attributes, not artifacts or some manager\u2019s hope for future change. Cf. <em>Winchester Fire Fighters, Local 1654, I.A.F.F., </em>24 M.L.C. 44, 45 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We turn then to the questions of substance, the first of which is whether prescribing uniforms for employees at the jail, including prohibiting officers from wearing nonstandard badges and buttons, is a core management function exempt from collective bargaining requirements. See generally <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 714-715 (1978); <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>438 Mass. at 180-181; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 177-181 (1997). In addressing that question, we temporarily put to one side the subject of pins containing union insignia, for the right of employees to wear those pins is attended by special considerations we shall address shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The sheriff\u2019s claim that he need not bargain over uniform requirements is firmly rooted in G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 9A, the pertinent portion of which says that \u201c[ojfficers and employees of each county penal institution required to wear uniforms shall wear while on duty uniforms prescribed by the sheriff of the county.\u201d Moreover, even in the absence of a statute explicitly giving an employer the power to promulgate uniform standards, our decided cases, albeit in dicta, have said that issues regarding the uniforms of law enforcement officers are committed to the employer\u2019s sole discretion. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fedn., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1990); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 272 (1996).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Section 9A of G. L. c. 126 is not one of the statutes that must give way to conflicting terms of a collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>agreement. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(d). </em>See generally <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Dedham Police Assn., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 419-420 (1999). In addition, \u00a7 9A is the kind of \u201cspecific, narrow statutory mandate\u201d that exempts matters within its scope from the collective bargaining process. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 182. Indeed, given the statute\u2019s specific content, there is very little to bargain about, save whether the sheriff should or should not carry out his statutory obligation, see <em>ibid., </em>for, in a very real sense, either the correction officers wear \u201cuniforms\u201d or they do not. See <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy., </em>855 F.2d 1454, 1464 (9th Cir. 1988) (\u201cTo allow employees to adorn their uniforms with objects of their own choosing undermines the very purposes that uniforms serve\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">The union and the commission nevertheless argue that the commission\u2019s finding regarding the long period during which the sheriff had no policy regarding pins and other adornments supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the sheriff is now prohibited from promulgating an antipin policy without first bargaining about its content. That argument necessarily rests on one or both of two premises, neither of which is persuasive. The first premise is that, by failing for so long to require officers to wear a true \u201cuniform,\u201d the sheriff has effectively surrendered his power to do so without first engaging in the bargaining process. To accept that argument would require us to conclude that a public official who fails for an extended period to exercise powers the Legislature expressly conferred on him or her could thereby surrender or forfeit those powers. Such a conclusion would be tantamount to reasoning that failure to exercise a power can work an estoppel on the public official in whom the power resides. For good reasons, however, we have almost uniformly held that estoppel does not apply to a public official\u2019s performance of statutory obligations or responsibilities. See <em>Gamache </em>v. <em>Mayor of N. Adams, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 (1983); <em>Municipal Light Co. of Ashburnham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 34 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 162, 167, cert, denied, 510 U.S. 866 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The union\u2019s and the commission\u2019s second premise is that, by permitting officers to wear pins of their own choosing for an extended period of time, the sheriff created a practice under which the officers\u2019 \u201cuniform\u201d consisted of certain specified components \u2014 pants, shirts, ties, belts, etc. \u2014 plus other components, such as pins, that officers were free to select for themselves. Having created that practice, the premise continues, the sheriff is free to change it only by engaging in collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We doubt that the record will support a conclusion that the sheriff created a \u201cpractice\u201d under which the \u201cuniform\u201d included pins and buttons correction officers individually chose. See generally, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Correction Officers Federated Union </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 291 &amp; n.6 (2002). But even if it did, nothing in G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 9A, suggests that the resulting uniform could be changed only through the bargaining process. Few uniforms are timeless. The power to prescribe uniforms is, therefore, the power to prescribe changes in uniforms.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In sum, to the extent that the sheriff\u2019s directive prohibited nonunion buttons and other nonunion accouterments, the directive did not violate G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5), or, derivatively, \u00a7 10(a)(1), and the commission\u2019s order that the sheriff \u201ccease and desist\u201d from failing to bargain in good faith on the subject of those pins and accouterments amounted to an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The sheriff\u2019s unilateral prohibition of union pins, however, requires a different analysis. General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 2, as inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, provides most public employees, including correction officers, with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cthe right of self-organization and the right to form, join, or assist any employee organization for the purpose of bargaining collectively . . . and to engage in lawful, concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, free from interference, restraint, or coercion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Display of union buttons is a traditional ingredient of the \u201cconcerted activity\u201d the statute protects. See, e.g., <em>Republic Aviation Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>324 U.S. 793, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>802 n.7 (1945), quoting from <em>Republic Aviation Corp., </em>51 N.L. R.B. 1186, 1187-1188 (1943) (\u201cthe right of employees to wear union insignia at work has long been recognized as a reasonable and legitimate form of union activity\u201d); Teeter, Banning the Buttons: Employer Interference with the Right to Wear Union Insignia in the Workplace, 80 Ky. L.J. 377, 379 &amp; n.17 (1992) (same). Consequently, the commission has held that, \u201c[i]n the absence of special circumstances, an employer\u2019s rule prohibiting the wearing of union insignia violates [G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 ] 10(a)(1).\u201d <em>Dighton School Comm., </em>8 M.L.C. 1303, 1305 (1981). See <em>Asociaci\u00f3n Hosp. del Maestro, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>842 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir. 1988); Kheel, 3 Labor Law \u00a7 10.07(1), at 10-87 (1997) (\u201cEmployer restrictions on the display of union insignia are invalid absent a showing of special circumstances that justify the restrictions\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">We do not think the right to prescribe uniforms contained in G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 9A, supersedes the officers\u2019 G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2, right to wear union insignia absent a showing of special circumstances. The \u201cprinciples appli[ed] in construing the interrelation of different statutes\u201d require us to give \u201creasonable effect to both statutes and [to] create[] a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>392 Mass. 788, 792 (1984). There is no explicit indication that the Legislature, in passing c. 126, \u00a7 9A, intended to override the well-established right to wear union insignia, and the two provisions are not so inconsistent with one another that \u201cboth cannot stand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 125 (1983). Indeed, in <em>United States Dept. of Justice, Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy., </em>955 F.2d 998 (5th Cir. 1992) <em>(INS), </em>a case on which the sheriff heavily relies for his analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of special circumstances, an analysis we discuss below, the court held that the management rights provisions of the Federal Labor Relations Act,-5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(1) (1996), did not explicitly supersede the employee rights provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102 (1996), a statute similar to, but containing fewer employee rights than, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2. As a consequence, the court stated that uniformed INS employees were presumptively entitled to wear union badges and buttons notwithstanding the employer\u2019s right to prescribe uniforms. <em>INS, </em>955 F.2d at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We, too, think that the wearing of union insignia, unlike guardian angel buttons or tie clips, is a right protected by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2, which, notwithstanding G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 9A, cannot be denied, absent special circumstances or a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d indication that it was waived as a result of the bargaining process. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>73 F.3d 74, 79 (6th Cir. 1996), quoting from <em>Metropolitan Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>460 U.S. 693, 708 (1983).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Turning, then, to the issue of special circumstances, both the union and the commission argue that none exist in this case. The sheriff disagrees, urging that special circumstances do exist and, as noted, relies heavily on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s treatment of special circumstances in the <em>INS </em>case. There, the court\u2019s treatment of the issue resulted in the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201cThe INS\u2019s anti-adomment/uniform policy is critical to its mission, in that it promotes uniformity, esprit de corps and discipline, and creates an appearance of neutrality and impartiality. Thus, even though the border patrol is not military, we hold that its law-enforcement mission and the means of accomplishing that mission are comparable in significant ways. It follows that its anti-adomment/uniform policy is similarly entitled to deference. We further hold that, when a law enforcement agency enforces an antiadomment/uniform policy <em>in a consistent and nondiscrimi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>natory manner, a special circumstance exists, </em>as a matter of law, which justifies the banning of union buttons\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><em>INS, </em>955 F.2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201cSpecial circumstances\u201d rarely, if ever, are found in the absence of a comprehensive ban on all nonstandard adornments. See, e.g., <em>Dighton School Comm., </em>8 M.L.C. at 1305 (\u201cWe are further convinced that no special circumstances exist to prohibit [union] buttons by the fact that other buttons were worn. . . without . . . interference or comment by the school administration. A rule which is enforced only against union buttons demonstrates the lack of any truly legitimate purpose for the rule\u201d). See also <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Harrah\u2019s Club, </em>337 F.2d 177, 178 (9th Or. 1964); <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>725 F.2d 1053, 1055 (6th Cir. 1984); <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy., </em>855 F.2d at 1465. The record in this case, however, discloses nothing remotely resembling a comprehensive prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We agree with the sheriff that \u201cthe need for discipline, uniformity and an absolutely impartial appearance exists at the Jail.\u201d People with violent tendencies five at the jail. A paramilitary organization and command structure are essential for the safety of inmates and correction officers alike. But the long period before April 22, 1997, during which the sheriff had no policy prohibiting pins, and the fact that his April 22 edict appears to have fallen with particular force on union pins, supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that no special circumstances connected to the jail\u2019s mission, command structure, need for discipline or other functional requirement justified the sheriff\u2019s unilateral prohibition of the union buttons employees presumptively were entitled to wear. See <em>Boise Cascade Corp., </em>300 N.L.R.B. 80, 84 (1990) (evidence that pins were worn for six months without incident was \u201cmost important point\u201d in determining absence of special circumstances).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, the commission\u2019s conclusion that the April 22 directive, insofar as it affected union buttons, violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(5), was supported by substantial evidence and did not amount to an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In light of the foregoing, paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 2(a), and 2(b) of the commission\u2019s order are reversed insofar as they pertain to badges, pins, and any nonstandard uniform attire other than pins and badges containing union insignia. The commission shall modify the \u201cNotice to Employees\u201d referenced in paragraph 2(c) of its order so that it is consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> The commission designated this case as one in which it would issue a decision in the first instance. See 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.02(1) (1993). Compare 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.02(3) (1993). A hearing ofiicer produced recommended findings and conclusions, which both parties had the right to challenge before the commission considered them. See 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.02(2) (1993). Neither party challenged any of the hearing officer\u2019s recommended findings of fact, and the commission adopted them in their entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> With the abolition of Worcester County government, see St. 1997, c. 48, the facility\u2019s title now simply reflects its geographic location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> Before March 14, the officers and sergeants had been represented by the International Brotherhood of Correctional Officers (IBCO).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\"> The agreement was with IBCO, see note 4, <em>supra. </em>Although the agreement itself is not in the record, the commission found that it described the mandatory uniform but did \u201cnot address or identify any items that [were] prohibited from being worn, including pins on uniforms\u201d and, therefore, did not \u201cexpressly prohibit]] the wearing of pins.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b671-12\"> The dress code Frisch referenced was not offered in evidence at the hearing. Frisch himself did not testify at the hearing and no testimony supporting the existence or content of a dress code was offered. On the contrary, all of the officers who testified at the hearing said that they were unaware of any written or unwritten rule prohibiting pins. They also said that they had worn pins without reproach and had seen all levels of officers below the rank of deputy superintendent do likewise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\"> The commission found that the April 22 order had a broader impact on lieutenants and captains, a substantial majority of whom stopped wearing any of the pins they had worn before the order was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> Because, as we will discuss, all of the commission\u2019s critical findings are supported by substantial evidence, we need not determine the effect of the sheriff\u2019s election not to challenge any of those findings between the time the hearing officer made them and the time the commission adopted them. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>See generally <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> The relevant period of limitation is contained in a regulation, 456 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03 (1993), rather than in a statute. In colloquial fashion, however, the parties have referred to the issue as one involving a statute of limitations and we follow suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\"> The union argues that correction officers are not police officers and, as a result, the cited cases are irrelevant. Sheriffs, though, have a broad range of duties, many of which parallel those of police officers. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baez, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 569 n.6 (1997), with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98. Correction officers likewise have and require a paramilitary structure to carry out their responsibilities. Insofar as uniforms are concerned, we therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>see no meaningful distinction between police officers and uniformed employees of the sheriff\u2019s department, regardless of the labels applied to each.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b677-16\"> Issues involving the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights lie just beneath the surface of any case involving a restriction on an employee\u2019s right to communicate associational activity by means of union insignia. See <em>United States Dept. of Justice, Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>Federal Labor Relations Authy., </em>955 F.2d 998, 1005 (5th Cir. 1992); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Meyers, 191 </em>F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 1999). Cf. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>705 F.2d 1299 (11th Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 468 U.S. 1204 (1984) (American flag); <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>40 F.3d 287, 291-292 (8th Cir. 1994) (same). Because no party has raised constitutional claims, however, we do not address the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> We venture no opinion on whether a waiver of the statutory right to wear union insignia in a collective bargaining contract would be legally enforceable. See <em>Lodge 743, International Assn. of Machinists </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corp., </em>337 F.2d 5 (2d Cir. 1964), cert, denied, 380 U.S. 908 (1965) (distinguishing between enforceable and unenforceable waivers of statutory rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> We do not preclude the possibility that circumstances may change over time in a way that enables the sheriff to meet his burden at some point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>future. See, e.g., <em>Meijer, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>130 F.3d 1209, 1217 (6th Cir. 1997) (requiring \u201caffirmative showing\u201d of negative impact).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
