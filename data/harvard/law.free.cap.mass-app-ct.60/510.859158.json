On August 30 of that year, he was suspended, pending an internal investigation, due to suspicion that he had stolen Lottery \u201cscratch tickets\u201d discovered missing, and had redeemed winning tickets he found among them. On September 21, Wojcik was fired. On various occasions during its investigatian, Lottery officials issued press releases explaining that it had suspended certain employees (whom it did not name publicly) \u201cunder investigation\u201d for suspicion of stealing scratch tickets. It is undisputed that Wojcik was one of the suspended employees. At the time of Wojcik\u2019s termination, the Lottery ascribed his termination to \u201cfailure to meet standards and for violating Lottery policies and procedures.\u201d Wojcik\u2019s termination was subsequently upheld in arbitration, but solely on the ground that, contrary to Lottery policy prohibiting employees from playing any Lottery games, he had played Lottery tickets (not that he had stolen them). Wojcik denies any involvement in stealing scratch tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Beginning on September 3, 1999, and thereafter over the next several weeks, the defendant newspaper published a series of attention-getting news articles, written by the individual defendant reporters, regarding the alleged theft.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Wojcik sued the Lottery and various of its officials in United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>States District Court, claiming (inter alia) defamation and violations of civil rights. During discovery in that action, Wojcik deposed many Lottery officials, each of whom disclaimed knowledge of who had acted as sources for the stories published by the newspaper. Summary judgment entered against Wojcik on his Federal claims, and the case was remanded to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In September, 2001, Wojcik filed the present action against the defendant newspaper and reporters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wojcik requested, among other discovery, disclosure of the sources on whom the newspaper relied in publishing its allegations against Wojcik. In response, the defendants objected to the requests for production of documents insofar as they requested \u201cdocuments whose production would disclose the identities of confidential sources,\u201d and refused to answer interrogatories requesting such disclosure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wojcik moved to compel a more complete response, and a judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion, ordering the defendants to disclose the identities of their sources.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>defendants sought interlocutory review under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, and the single justice reported the question for plenary review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal from an interlocutory discovery order, we review for abuse of discretion. See <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 387 (1999). See also <em>Matter of Roche, </em>381 Mass. 624, 638 (1980). Cf. <em>Sinnott </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>402 Mass. 581, 585, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Sinnott </em>v. <em>Radin, </em>488 U.S. 980 (1988). Of course, the standard \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d admits of numerous meanings in different contexts, see <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 386 n.8 (2000); in the present case, the motion judge\u2019s discretion is bounded by important values under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>633 F.2d 583, 598 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In his order, the motion judge displayed his understanding of the need in the circumstances to balance \u201cthe public interest in every person\u2019s evidence and the public interest in protecting the free flow of information.\u201d <em>Petition for the Promulgation of Rules Regarding the Protection of Confidential News Sources &amp; Other Unpublished Information, </em>395 Mass. 164, 172 (1985).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 need for the requested discovery to carry the burden of proof on their claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>outweighed the potential harm to the newspaper\u2019s ability to gather information by reliance on confidential sources.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The motion judge described the identities of the defendant reporters\u2019 sources as \u201ccentral\u201d to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, explaining that \u201c[wjithout disclosure of the sources, the plaintiffs will have no way to investigate . . . whether the defendants were reasonable in crediting the accuracy of the information provided to them.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is at this juncture that we depart from the judge\u2019s analytical course: the relevance of the sources\u2019 identities to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not apparent to us on the present record, at least so far as the record is now developed. If the articles are libelous in the manner the plaintiffs claim, the libelous character of the articles does not appear to rest so much on the accuracy of what the reporters contend they were told by unnamed sources, but on what the reporters wrote.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Assuming (without deciding) that all of the articles asserted, in substance, that Wojcik had in fact engaged in a \u201cscam\u201d for the theft of scratch tickets,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the interrogatory responses that formed the basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel are decidedly unclear on the extent to which the reporters attribute such an accusation to any source. In response to Wojcik\u2019s interrogatory no. 2, which requested detailed information regarding each communication by the reporters concerning Wojcik and the Lot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tery\u2019s Fairhaven office, the defendant Silberman attributed to confidential sources the assertions that (i) two Lottery employees were suspended with pay pending investigation; (ii) the employees denied wrongdoing and that the Lottery had not determined whether any money was missing; (iii) a particular named Lottery supervisor \u201cwas not really involved but that two men who worked for him were involved\u201d; and (iv) after approximately two weeks, the supervisor had retired and the Lottery had found sufficient cause to terminate the other two employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">It is unclear at the present limited stage of discovery precisely what Silberman claims to have been told by her sources, and precisely how it relates to the essential elements of Wojcik\u2019s defamation claim. If by reference to the assertion described in clause (iii)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Silberman contends that one or more sources told her that Wojcik took and scratched lottery tickets (as she reported in her article), the plaintiffs are likely entitled to disclosure of the identities of the sources, both to explore whether the sources confirm or contest Silberman\u2019s version of their conversations and to determine whether Silberman exercised due care in verifying the information she received from the sources before publishing it. However, if the unnamed \u201cconfidential\u201d sources merely told Silberman that Wojcik was suspended pending an internal investigation (the truth of which is undisputed), the identities of the sources are largely irrelevant to Wojcik\u2019s defamation claim; if the articles are libelous, their libelous character results from deviations between what Silberman was told and what she wrote. Further discovery, including Silberman\u2019s deposition, will likely clarify what Silberman contends she was told by her unnamed sources and the extent to which the articles as written relied on that information, and will thereby illuminate whether the identities of her sources are in fact essential to Wojcik\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">That is not to say that the plaintiffs were not entitled to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>relief on their motion to compel. The defendants\u2019 responses to the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for answers to interrogatories were plainly inadequate. For example, Silberman refused to furnish any substantive response to interrogatory no. 3, which sought, in addition to the identity of each source referenced in the articles, the substance of her communications with them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Macero\u2019s responses were evasive and uninformative on the specific substance of his communications with his unnamed sources; whatever question there may be about the importance of the sources\u2019 identities, there is no question that the substance of the information they furnished to the reporters lies at the very center of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Furthermore, without disclosing the identities of the sources themselves it would be illuminating, for purposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, to determine whether the unnamed sources were employees or officers of the Lottery (or, alternatively, perhaps of an outside auditor), and whether they claimed to have direct personal knowledge of the information they provided. The discovery process is not a game of cat and mouse, and the defendants may not evade the plaintiffs\u2019 inquiries into relevant and discoverable material merely by invoking overbroad reference to the First Amendment. An order compelling more complete answers to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories, and awarding other sanctions (such as attorney\u2019s fees incurred in pursuing the motion to compel), however, would punish the defendants\u2019 inadequate discovery responses while still recognizing the First Amendment considerations bounding the exercise of the motion judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">As to the narrower question of the disclosure of the sources\u2019 identities, however, it is premature on the present record to conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of defamation depends in any demonstrated manner on the identities of the sources for the defendants\u2019 published stories. See <em>Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>633 F.2d at 598-599.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Without a demonstrated essential relationship between the identities of the reporters\u2019 sources and the elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the motion judge\u2019s order compelling disclosure of the identities of the sources exceeded the bounds of his discretion in the circumstances, and was in error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We accordingly vacate so much of the Superior Court order as compels disclosure of the identities of the reporters\u2019 sources, and remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\"> The first such article appeared atop the front page of the September 3, 1999, edition, under a headline that read \u201cLottery duo allegedly cashed in for scratch.\u201d Authored by defendants Ellen Silberman and Cosmo Macero, the second and third paragraphs of the article read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">\u201cSources told the [Boston] Herald yesterday that Ed Wojcik and Greg Buckley were suspended Monday from their jobs at the Lottery\u2019s Fairhaven regional office after the latest explosive evidence of new Lottery plundering began to emerge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">\u201cIn the scam \u2014 sources said \u2014 books of instant tickets would be scratched soon after delivery from the Lottery supplier, but before they were \u2018scanned in\u2019 or activated.

Compare <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Strayer, </em>392 Mass. 525, 528-530 (1984) (order compelling discovery is not appealable prior to adjudication of contempt). The election to refer the present interlocutory appeal for plenary review was within the authority of the single justice. See <em>Mancuso </em>v. <em>Mancuso, </em>10 Mass.

The motion judge assumed that the plaintiff was not a public figure, for whom the third element would require an intentional or reckless disregard for the truth. See <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964). In the present case, the differing burden of proof between public and private claimants does not bear on the relevance of the identities of the sources to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> The defendants argue that the articles published on September 3, 4, 16, and 17 asserted merely that Wojcik was suspended, pending investigation into whether he had engaged in the alleged theft. It is at least arguable that the articles, read in their entire context, suggested much more. In any event, the September 22 article includes an assertion that Wojcik actually stole Lottery tickets for personal gain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Of the remaining assertions attributed to sources in Silberman\u2019s response, the parties do not appear to contest the truth of the assertions described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iv).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> Macero\u2019s response to interrogatory no. 2 is similarly unclear. He states that an unnamed source (whom he describes as \u201cSource 2\u201d) \u201cprovided the names of the state employees suspected of wrongdoing and provided clarity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>other basic facts and information obtained from confidential sources or sources identified in articles, including Source 1. Source 2 may also have discussed the type of action that would possibly be taken in response to the situation, including the potential penalties against the employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> To the extent that the substance of such communications is embraced entirely within Silberman\u2019s response to interrogatory no. 2, she should say so; to the extent there were any additional communications or any other matters of substance discussed, she should provide that information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> It is in that respect that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>364 Mass. 317 (1973), on which the dissent relies. In that case, the article forming the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s libel claim quoted an unnamed town official as stating that the plaintiff \u201cwas a \u2018bad word\u2019 in Stoneham and . . . was in fact using the law to \u2018blackmail\u2019 the town officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318.

See <em>post </em>at 518. Instead, we conclude simply that disclosure ordinarily should not be required absent demonstration of an essential relationship between the identities of the sources and the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to establish an element of their claim.

I dissent because, in my view, the motion judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the defendants to disclose the identities of confidential sources. See <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>364 Mass. 317, 322 (1973) (discovery order in libel action reversible only for abuse of discretion); <em>Matter of Roche, </em>381 Mass. 624, 638 (1980) (discovery order entitled to broad measure of discretion). The decision-making process was conducted within the established framework of relevant legal standards and took into account \u201call the proper factors identified by relevant case law as necessary to inform the discretionary exercise.\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 386 n.8 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The judge\u2019s memorandum of decision demonstrates careful attention to the competing interests when the public interest in the free flow of information butts against \u201cthe equally compelling public interest in securing all evidence necessary to fair and accurate adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 640. See <em>Petition for the Promulgation of Rules Regarding the Protection of Confidential News Sources &amp; Other Unpublished Information, </em>395 Mass. 164, 170-172 (1985) <em>(Petition for Promulgation of Rules). </em>The judge considered the factual context, the issues in dispute, the measures already taken by the plaintiffs, the need for the information sought, and the alternatives to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Regrettably, the majority substitutes its assessment for that of the motion judge. More troubling still, the majority holds that the judge abused his discretion because he ordered disclosure of confidential sources when the discovery record was inadequate to determine whether the defendants had relied on confidential sources. The underpinning for this holding is an overly exacting parsing of discovery material that subtly transforms the balancing test set forth in <em>Petition for Promulgation of Rules, supra, </em>by shifting the burden at the second stage of the analysis from the party seeking to avoid disclosure (the defendants) to the party seeking disclosure (the plaintiffs). The majority\u2019s approach establishes a sequencing of discovery that will undoubtedly become the rule of thumb in defamation cases agairist newspapers: before a motion to compel disclosure may lie, a plaintiff must first move to compel further answers to interrogatories and then depose the defendants \u2014 notwithstanding the need for disclosure; pointed interrogatories and document production requests; and unequivocal refusal to disclose the identities of sources essential to the plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">To date, the Supreme Judicial Court has rejected an exhaustion requirement prior to ordering disclosure of confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sources. See <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>364 Mass. at 320 (rejecting postponement of discovery order until plaintiff has completed discovery, exhausted alternative means, and demonstrated that he will succeed only if identity of confidential source is revealed). Nothing in <em>Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>633 F.2d 583, 598 (1st Cir. 1980), on whose authority the majority relies heavily and which predates the carefully developed balancing test of <em>Petition for Promulgation of Rules, supra, </em>requires such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">1. <em>Factual context. </em>After reviewing various Boston Herald articles, the motion judge concluded that the articles were arguably defamatory because they accused Wojcik of a crime. With this assessment, the majority does not seriously disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>ante </em>at 514. Nor does it dispute that the judge properly took note of Wojcik\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to determine the identities of the confidential sources by deposing many Lottery officials in a related Federal action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">2. <em>Application of the balancing test. </em>At <em>stage </em>one of the balancing test, the majority and I agree, the motion judge did not err in concluding that the defendants met their burden of demonstrating that the risk that disclosure posed to the free flow of information was more than speculative or theoretical. See <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, </em>410 Mass. 596, 600 (1991); <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 389-390 (1999) (forced disclosure of investigative news reporters\u2019 confidential sources carries inherent threat to free flow of information).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It is at stage two, the majority contends, where the judge went off track. The judge reasoned that the identities of confidential sources was relevant, material, and essential to Wojcik\u2019s defamation action because certain of the articles accused Wojcik of criminality and did so based on information provided by confidential sources: \u201cThe only support for the charges of \u2018theft\u2019 and \u2018plundering\u2019 printed by the [Boston] Herald are the supposed statements made by confidential sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>to whom only the [Boston] Herald has access.\u201d The sources\u2019 identities were central to Wojcik\u2019s claim because without knowledge of their identities, Wojcik could not demonstrate that the defendants were negligent in verifying the truth or falsity of the material published, a necessary component of his defamation claim. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 361 </em>Mass. 849, 858-859 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In my view, the record fully supports the motion judge\u2019s determination that the balance of considerations did not tip toward the defendants, the parties seeking to avoid disclosure. See <em>Petition for Promulgation of Rules, </em>395 Mass. at 172; <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, supra </em>at 600 n.l (at step two balancing, burden on party opposing disclosure). The judge\u2019s assessment of the relative weight of the competing public interests cannot be said, as matter of law, to be incorrect, especially in a defamation action where the identities of confidential sources are integral to the plaintiffs\u2019 proof that the defendants acted negligently in relying on the information supplied. Compare <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>364 Mass. at 319-320 (identity of confidential source central to libel action), with <em>Sinnott </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>402 Mass. 581, 584 n.3, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Sinnott </em>v. <em>Radin, </em>488 U.S. 980 (1988) (identities of sources not at heart of action for invasion of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I disagree with the majority that \u201c[i]f the articles are libelous in the manner the plaintiffs claim, the libelous character of the articles does not appear to rest so much on the accuracy of what the reporters contend they were told by unnamed sources, but on what the reporters wrote.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 514. It is not enough to say, as the majority does, that the defendants may be liable for what they wrote, apart from what they were told by confidential sources. There are a number of bases on which the defendants may be liable. They may be liable for reporting inaccurately what was related by a source (either confidential or nonconfidential); they may be liable for publishing a defamatory article that references a fictional confidential source; or they may be liable for publishing a defamatory article that negligently relies on an unreliable confidential source. Especially to prove the latter, the plaintiffs must know the identity of each confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>source. The plaintiffs\u2019 proof cannot be limited by the defendants\u2019 unwillingness to provide the identities of confidential sources that the defendants acknowledge exist and on whom their articles purport to rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">To reach its conclusion that the defendants may not have relied on confidential sources, the majority engages in a curious reading of the defendants\u2019 answers to discovery requests that essentially shifts the burden of proof at stage two from the party opposing discovery to the party seeking it. See <em>Petition for Promulgation of Rules, </em>395 Mass. at 172; <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, supra </em>at 600 n.l. To demonstrate that disclosure of the identities of confidential sources is necessary, the majority would require the plaintiffs to depose the defendants to prove reliance on confidential sources. However, the defendants\u2019 discovery responses make no suggestion whatsoever that confidential sources were not relied on. To the contrary, the articles themselves unequivocally assert that confidential sources were used. If the defendants did not rely on confidential sources for the defamatory assertions, requiring them to say so in answers to interrogatories and document production requests imposes no burden on First Amendment values. Because the defendants made no such disclaimer, the more reasonable inference is that they did rely on confidential sources and that disclosure of the sources is required because the propriety of that reliance is central to the plaintiffs\u2019 case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion, that it is unclear whether confidential sources were relied on, rests on a strained interpretation of the defendants\u2019 answers to interrogatories that reads the answers in isolation from each other<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and ignores the context supplied by accusations in the challenged articles. Most notable is a September 22 article that states, in pertinent part: \u201cSources said . . . Wojcik, a field service manager responsible for providing and fixing equipment such as Lottery sales terminals, would allegedly take \u2014 and scratch \u2014 books of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>instant tickets soon after they were delivered from the Lottery supplier, but before they were \u2018scanned in\u2019 or activated.\u201d The article clearly accuses Wojcik of a crime and is unambiguous in its attribution to confidential sources of the assertion of criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">If there is any lack of clarity regarding the extent of the defendants\u2019 reliance on confidential sources, what the confidential sources said, and \u201cprecisely\u201d how the confidential sources relate to Wojcik\u2019s defamation claim, the obscurity lies in the calculated nature of the responses, not in Wojcik\u2019s failure to pose the questions (or to make the proper document requests). The answers are crafted to provide limited detail and to prevent deduction of the sources of the information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">3. <em>Alternatives to forced disclosure. </em>The defendants suggested three alternative to disclosure: (1) precluding the defendants from relying on the identities of the confidential sources; (2) postponing disclosure until completion of further discovery and defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment; and (3) requiring Wojcik to exhaust nonconfidential sources. The motion judge considered, and properly rejected, each suggested alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">First, because Wojcik bears the burden of proving that the defendants were unreasonable in relying on the confidential sources, the <em>identities </em>of the sources are an essential component of the reliability assessment; preventing the defendants from relying on the identities of confidential sources ignores the plaintiffs\u2019 burden. Second, without knowledge of the sources\u2019 identities, Wojcik could not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendants\u2019 negligence in order to defeat the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions. Finally, given Wojcik\u2019s unsuccessful discovery efforts in the Federal litigation, other than disclosure by the defendants, no feasible alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>exists to discover the identities of the sources.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge concluded: \u201cIt is inherent in the nature of the confidential relationship between the paper and its sources that no other party has knowledge of the sources\u2019 identities.\u201d The judge\u2019s determination was not error, much less an abuse of discretion. See <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>364 Mass. at 320; <em>Sinnott </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>402 Mass. at 586-587.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The majority, however, maintains that forced disclosure is premature absent further discovery, in particular, the depositions of Silberman and Macero. The majority goes so far as to suggest that the judge should have granted relief that was neither sought by the plaintiffs nor suggested as an alternative by the defendants \u2014 compelling further answers to discovery responses. I believe that the majority\u2019s approach is incorrect in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The issue before the motion judge was narrowly focused: whether disclosure must be made. The plaintiffs moved to compel disclosure of confidential sources, not to compel further answers; the defendants opposed disclosure and sought protective orders. However reasonable ordering further answers to interrogatories might have been if requested as an initial matter, there was no such request. Moreover, even had such a request been made, it was within the motion judge\u2019s discretion to conclude that further answers to interrogatories were not a viable alternative to disclosure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ira I., </em>439 Mass. 805, 809 (2003) (on appellate review for abuse of discretion, question is not whether we should have made opposite decision, but whether no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken view expressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Neither side is likely to blink in the future. The plaintiffs will continue to seek disclosure of the identities of the confidential sources. The defendants will continue to assert that the sources\u2019 identities are privileged against disclosure. There is no basis for believing that deposing defendants Silberman, Macero, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Crummy, and posing questions designed to elicit the identities of the confidential sources, will be met with a different response. There is also no basis for concluding that deposition questions will enable Wojcik to determine whether the defendants relied on confidential sources; whether they did so reasonably; or even whether they reported accurately what the confidential sources related, without accepting on faith the truthfulness of the deponents\u2019 answers. The sources themselves must be disclosed if discovery is to have its truth-seeking effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Such preconditions to compelled disclosure as the majority requires will impose significant burdens, financial and otherwise, on an individual such as Wojcik who alleges defamation by a newspaper. I am not unmindful that the stakes are high for the defendants as well. An order requiring disclosure of the confidential sources\u2019 identities will, if not met, result in a request for sanctions, including awarding plaintiffs judgment as to liability on their defamation claim. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C), as amended, 390 Mass. 1208 (1984). Cf. <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 16 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>439 Mass. 223 (2003). These issues, however, are not before us and, absent enactment of a newspaper reporter\u2019s privilege against disclosure of confidential sources, will continue to be part of the legal landscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Appendix to the Court\u2019s Majority and Dissenting Opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Interrogatories <em>Interrogatory No. 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u201cPlease identify each communication that you had from August 1, 1999 to date concerning Edward Wojcik and/or the Lottery\u2019s Fairhaven office.

I also sought to determine what, if any, steps would be taken by the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver General of the Commonwealth. Source 1 explained the nature of the irregularities that had been discovered.
