L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, and disorderly conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, following a jury trial. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the disorderly conduct charge and that his motion for a required finding of not guilty should not have been denied. He also argues that the judge\u2019s instructions as to the disorderly charge were deficient and that the prosecutor made improper argument with respect to the assault and battery charge, entitling him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">The jury could have found that in the early morning hours of February 12, 2002, at 1:45 a.m., as State police Trooper Steven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>O\u2019Connor drove in his police cruiser by the Best Western Motel parking lot in Haverhill he observed, in a parked vehicle near the front lobby, a male in the front passenger seat and a female in the driver\u2019s seat. The male, later identified as the defendant, had his left hand on the female\u2019s hair and was \u201cshaking her head, jerking her head back and forth.\u201d He also was \u201cpointing at the female, and it <em>[sic] </em>appeared to be shaking his finger, and appeared to be yelling and screaming at the female operator.\u201d O\u2019Connor turned his cruiser around and returned to the parked car. He exited his cruiser and, as he approached the parked car, O\u2019Connor saw the male continuing to point at and shake the woman\u2019s head. He could hear \u201cyelling\u201d through the closed windows, but he could not make out the words. He saw the woman\u2019s face and, in his opinion, the woman, who did not appear to be saying anything, looked afraid. He approached the driver\u2019s side of the car, illuminating the interior with his light; the defendant released the woman and O\u2019Connor \u201cremoved her from the vehicle.\u201d She was trembling and appeared to be frightened and on the verge of tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">At some point, Mark Garrett, a Haverhill police officer, also arrived on the scene. The woman identified herself to the officers as Susan Carins. She said that she and the defendant knew each other and had come to the motel from another bar to have drinks, and that she did not want the officers to arrest the defendant. Garrett asked the defendant to exit the vehicle. As the defendant was getting out of the car, he \u201ckept saying no problem here, no problem here, everything is all set, no problem.\u201d The police advised the defendant that he would be summonsed to court for assault and battery, that he was not to be arrested at Carins\u2019s request, and that he had to leave the motel parking lot. He began to walk away. O\u2019Connor testified: \u201cHe took a few steps from me, ten steps, turned around, began flailing his arms, yelling that I was violating his civil rights.\u201d He was advised a second time to leave, and the defendant was \u201cyelling at me, you\u2019re violating my civil rights, then he began yelling at Ms. Carins, why are you doing this to me, you\u2019ll never go through with this.\u201d At that time, he was placed under arrest. It is not disputed that only the defendant\u2019s conduct after he left the car forms the basis of the disorderly conduct charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u201cThe statute authorizing prosecutions for disorderly conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, has been saved from constitutional infirmity by incorporating the definition of \u2018disorderly\u2019 contained in \u00a7 250.2(1)\u201d of the Model Penal Code (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 582 (2003). \u201cWhat now remains of the definition of \u2018disorderly\u2019 conduct is subsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 728 (2000), cert, denied, 532 U.S. 980 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish either that the area was public or that his conduct was tumultuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We reject his contention that the evidence \u2014 the events took place in a motel parking lot \u201cright off the highway,\u201d twenty to twenty-five feet from \u201cthe front lobby office area\u201d of a \u201ccrowded\u201d and \u201cbusy\u201d motel, \u201cnear a \u201cDenny\u2019s type restaurant,\u201d shopping mall, and movie theater \u2014 fails \u201cto establish that people could have seen or heard the defendant from any place of public access, such as a nearby sidewalk, publicly used path or road, shopping area or other neighborhood facility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We agree, however, that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant had engaged in \u201cviolent or tumultuous behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2003). See note 1, <em>supra. </em>\u201cTo be disorderly, within the sense of the statute, the conduct must disturb through acts other than speech; neither a provocative nor a foul mouth transgresses the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546 (1996). The Commonwealth <em>argues </em>that the defendant engaged in \u201c \u2018tumultuous behavior\u2019 because he cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ated a public nuisance by flailing his arms\u201d and shouting. There is no claim that the defendant\u2019s loud protestations directed either at police<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or at Carins constituted a threat of violence and no evidence that the defendant\u2019s \u201cflailing arms\u201d were anything but a physical manifestation of his agitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tumultuous behavior is conduct which may be \u201ccharacterized as involving riotous commotion and excessively unreasonable noise so as to constitute a public nuisance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. at 729, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 597 (1975). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zettel, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 472 (1999). Here, the evidence does not support a reasonable inference that the \u201cnoise and commotion caused by [the defendant\u2019s] behavior was . . . extreme.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, supra </em>at 729.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">With respect to the assault and battery charge, the defendant claims that the statement by the prosecutor that Carins told the officer the defendant was \u201cpulling at her neck\u201d was not based on the evidence. Carins testified that the defendant had grabbed her hair and her head, and agreed that he had jerked her head back and forth. To the extent it may reasonably be argued that grabbing Carins\u2019s hair and jerking her head is significantly different from pulling at her neck, this misstatement did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bregnoli, </em>431 Mass. 265, 277 (2000). With respect to both charges, the defendant\u2019s remaining claims, that statements by the prosecutor had no basis in the evidence, are likewise unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The judgment of conviction on the charge of disorderly conduct is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and that portion of the complaint is dismissed. The judgment of conviction on the charge of assault and battery is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> The relevant provision of that section reads as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior .... \u2018Public\u2019 means affecting or likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access; among the places included are highways, transport facilities, schools, prisons, apartment houses, places of business or amusement, or any neighborhood.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2, at 324-325 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\"> The trial judge\u2019s instruction that the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant \u201cengaged in violent or tumultuous behavior\u201d was consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, which did not rely on \u201cfighting or threatening\u201d conduct to prove its case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> Although comments provoked solely in response to police conduct arguably fall in a different category, see Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2 comment 7, at 349-353, and cases cited, here the comments were also directed at Carins. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 584 (\u201cpolice presence in and of itself does not turn an otherwise purely private outburst into disorderly conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 963, 965 (1995), to support its position that the defendant\u2019s loud comments and flailing arms combined to form a sufficient basis to convict, is misplaced. In that case, we declined to consider the defendant\u2019s attack of the disorderly conduct conviction because it had been placed on file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> We reject the defendant\u2019s claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the judge should have been required to instruct the jury as to the meaning of the word \u201ctumultuous,\u201d as used in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
