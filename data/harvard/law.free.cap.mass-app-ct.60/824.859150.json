The vehicles collided, causing personal injury to Wynn. The ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>cident occurred in proximity to 83 Lakeshore Drive where Spina resided with his wife, Peyton Power. Wynn commenced an action alleging negligence by Spina and negligent entrastment by Power and her father, James Power, the coowners of 83 Lake-shore Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">At the time of the accident, a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to Peyton Power by Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (insurer) covered the Lakeshore Drive premises, where Spina garaged his ATV. The insurer agreed to defend Spina and the Powers against Wynn\u2019s claims under a reservation of rights. The insurer then commenced an action seeking a declaration that the homeowner\u2019s policy did not obligate it to defend or indemnify the action brought by Wynn.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">A judge of the Superior Court denied Wynn\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer, declaring that the homeowner\u2019s policy did not afford defense or indemnity coverage. Wynn now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The issue before us is narrow. Does the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy provide liability and medical coverage for personal injuries allegedly sustained by Wynn in the collision with Spina\u2019s vehicle, where Spina is a member of the insured\u2019s household, his ATV is garaged on the insured premises, and the collision occurred not on 83 Lakeshore Drive, but at a nearby beach that was regularly used by the insured?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Resolution of this question depends, ultimately, on the meaning of the language \u201c[ojwned by an \u2018insured\u2019 and on an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d in an <em>exception </em>to an <em>exclusion </em>from coverage in the policy. We conclude that the judge did not err in declaring that the policy did not require the insurer to defend and indemnify against Wynn\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">1. <em>The homeowner\u2019s policy. </em>To understand what the homeowner\u2019s policy covers, excludes, and excepts from exclusion requires a brief primer on policy provisions. Section II of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>policy sets forth \u201cLiability Coverages,\u201d including \u201cPersonal Liability\u201d (Coverage E) and \u201cMedical Payments to Others\u201d (Coverage F) (liability coverages). The liability coverages are subject to various \u201cExclusions\u201d and, in turn, to various exceptions to the exclusions. Whether the policy provides the liability coverages here depends on the applicability of an exception to an exclusion from coverage. In layman\u2019s terms, if the exception to the exclusion applies, there is coverage. If not, then there is no coverage. Wynn has the burden of proving the applicability of the exception to the exclusion. See <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox Inc., </em>424 Mass. 226, 230-231 (1997) (insured bears burden of proving loss within description of covered risks).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Pertinent to this case is an exclusion from the liability coverages for accidents arising out of the use of motor vehicles or motorized land conveyances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Excepted from this exclusion is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">\u201cThis exclusion does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201c(2) A motorized land conveyance designed for recreational use off public roads, not subject to motor vehicle registration and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">\u201c(a) Not owned by an \u2018insured\u2019; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">\u201c(b) Owned by an \u2018insured\u2019 and on an \u2018insured location.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">For purposes of summary judgment, the parties do not dispute that, as a spouse and resident member of Peyton Power\u2019s household, Spina is an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The parties also do not dispute that the ATV in question is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d but \u201c[a] motorized land conveyance designed for recreational use off public roads, not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>motor vehicle registration.\u201d See <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 870, 872-873 (2001). Lastly, the parties do not dispute that the ATV was owned by Spina. Accordingly, resolution of whether the liability coverages apply turns on the meaning of the term \u201con an \u2018insured location\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">2. <em>\u201cOn an \u2018insured, </em>location.\u2019 \u201d Wynn maintains that the exception language \u201c[o]wned by an \u2018insured\u2019 and on an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d is ambiguous and must be interpreted in the way most favorable to the insured. See <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998); <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct., at 874-875 nn.4,5. He contends that such language may reasonably be interpreted to mean that the recreational vehicle owned by the insured need only be <em>garaged </em>on the insured location. Under this view, the liability coverages would apply regardless of where the accident occurs, so long as the ATV was owned by the insured and garaged on the insured premises. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">While reading and understanding an insurance policy\u2019s provisions as to coverages, exclusions, and exceptions is often a formidable task, difficulty in comprehension does not equate with ambiguity. Nor is ambiguity created \u201csimply because a controversy exists between the parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. at 381, quoting from <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 466 (1995). Contrary to holdings in <em>Meister </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>573 So. 2d 128, 130 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991), and <em>United Servs. Auto. Assn. </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>733 So. 2d 401, 404 (Ala. Civ. App. 1998), cited by Wynn, we discern no ambiguity in the policy. The reasonable interpretation of the exception simply is not in accordance with Wynn\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">The court\u2019s focus should be on determining the intent of the parties by examining the language of the policy, read as a whole. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>359 Mass. 46, 50 (1971). The objective is to \u201cconstrue the contract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\u201d <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>America, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 115, 119 (1999), quoting from <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989). Here, an integrated reading of the liability coverages, exclusions, and exceptions manifests an intent to exclude ordinary motor vehicles and motorized land conveyances from liability coverage entirely<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> except for a limited type of motorized land conveyance (such as the ATV here) and only when (1) the ATV is <em>not </em>owned by the insured; or (2) the ATV is owned by the insured and the accident <em>occurs </em>on an insured location. An objectively reasonable insured reading the policy language would not expect to be covered. See <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Niagara Fire Ins. Co., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 504 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The rationale for limiting the exception to the general rule of exclusion to such circumstances rests on the common sense understanding that, if a vehicle is owned by the insured, the likelihood and frequency of use, and the risk of accident, is greater.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The intent of the exception is to require an insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy to obtain specific liability insurance for all motor vehicles and for all owned recreational vehicles, except for the limited circumstance when an ATV owned by the insured is involved in an accident on the insured location, a confined area of risk. See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shofner, </em>573 So. 2d 47, 50 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990). In sum, the term \u201cowned by an \u2018insured\u2019 and on an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d in the exception to the motor vehicle exclusion requires that the accident <em>occur </em>on an \u201cinsured location,\u201d not that the involved vehicle merely be garaged there.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">3. <em>The Wynn accident. </em>Wynn contends that, even if the policy requires the accident to have occurred \u201con an \u2018insured location,\u2019 \u201d the accident here <em>did </em>occur \u201con an \u2018insured location.\u2019 \u201d The policy defines \u201cinsured location\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>\u201ca. The \u2018residence premises\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\u201cb. The part of other premises, other structures and grounds used. . . as a residence . . . ; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201cc. Any premises <em>used... in connection with a premises in 4.a and 4.b above\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">For purposes of the summary judgment record, we adopt the view of the facts most favorable to Wynn and assume that the accident occurred on the beach rather than on the neighboring pond.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>President &amp; Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, </em>388 Mass. 16, 17 (1983). It is uncontroverted that the beach does not adjoin the Powers\u2019 property, but is some distance away<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and requires crossing a stream to the property of the Rock Pond Association (association), and then to the beach. Wynn maintains that, since the definition of \u201cinsured location\u201d encompasses not only the residence, but also \u201c[a]ny premises used ... in connection with [the residence premises],\u201d the beach is an \u201cinsured location\u201d because it is used regularly in connection with his nearby residence. The insurer maintains that the beach, which is owned by the association and is separated from 83 Lakeshore Drive by a parking lot and a stream, is not part of the \u201cinsured premises\u201d even if used regularly by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">We think that Wynn\u2019s proffered interpretation proves too much and, if adopted, would render the definition of \u201cinsured location\u201d meaningless and provide no discernible geographical limit to coverage. The term \u201cinsured location\u201d and its accompanying reference to \u201c[a]ny premises used... in connection with\u201d the residence premises is circumscribed by an obvious and necessary geographic limitation. The definition is not meant to encompass adjacent, nonowned land on which an ATV might be used any more than it is intended to include parks or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>recreational facilities in proximity to the residence that the insured may enjoy and use regularly. Such locations are neither intended nor reasonably understood to be \u201cinsured locations\u201d under a homeowner\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">It is not reasonable that the meaning of the language \u201cused in connection with [the residence],\u201d and hence the ambit of the \u201cinsured location,\u201d should vary depending on the fortuity of an insured\u2019s regular use of a field, trail, or recreational area, public or private, in the neighborhood of his residence. See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shofner, </em>573 So. 2d at 48, 49-50 (operation of vehicle on public street one block away from residence constitutes \u201cbeing used away from an insured premises\u201d); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gutenkauf, </em>103 Ill. App. 3d 889, 892-893 (1981) (declining, as arbitrary and not susceptible to limitation, construction of \u201cinsured premises\u201d to include area of lake ten to fifteen feet from shore); <em>Illinois Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coppa, </em>494 N.W.2d 503, 506 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993). Such a construction would require knowledge by an insurer of not only the insured\u2019s property but also of neighboring property and the insured\u2019s hobbies and interests. Rather, the term \u201cinsured location\u201d is intended and appropriately understood to be limited to the residence and premises integral to its use as a residence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The beach is not integral to the use of 83 Lakeshore Drive as a residence. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\"> The beach is the property of Rock Pond Association (association), whose membership is comprised of approximately 242 homeowners who share rights to the beach and pond. The record is unclear as to the requirements for membership and the holder of the title to the association\u2019s property. Nor does the record indicate whether the association has liability coverage on its property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\"> Exclusion 1 of the homeowner\u2019s policy provides, in pertinent part, that the liability coverages do not apply to bodily injury or property damage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">\u201cf.

The affidavit of Donald Cudmore, an investigating police officer, opines that based on physical evidence, including oil or gas stains and extensive gouging and scraping of the ice, the impact occurred in the middle of the frozen pond rather than on the beach. Wynn does not argue that the pond is \u201can insured location\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\"> In the light most favorable to Wynn, the beach is less than 500 feet from Spina\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\"> Wynn presented no evidence that, under the deed to 83 Lakeshore Drive, the Powers hold property or easement rights in the beach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\"> We express no opinion whether a particular location, such as an offsite pathway or approach to the residence, is so integral to the use of the residence as to be an \u201cinsured location.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
