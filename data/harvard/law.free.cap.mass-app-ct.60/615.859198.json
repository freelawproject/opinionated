L. c. 121A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The BRA held a public hearing to consider the developer\u2019s c. 121A application and issued a \u201cReport and Decision\u201d approving the application. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2; G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 6. The BRA determined that \u201c[t]he Project Area is a \u2018blighted open area[\u2019] within the meaning of Section 1 of Chapter 121A,\u201d a necessary finding to confer c. 121A status and its tax and financing benefits. The BRA also granted zoning relief as authorized by St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2, from various dimensional requirements of art. 44 of the Boston Zoning Code, covering the special overlay zoning district for the Leather District.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">By an action in the nature of certiorari, the plaintiff challenged the BRA\u2019s decision in Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2. See also <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37 (1977); <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 551, 552 (1976). The plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the defendants opposed. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and allowed the defendants\u2019 request that judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ment enter in their favor. Final judgment entered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and the plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that there was not substantial evidence to support (1) the BRA\u2019s finding of \u201cblight\u201d; and (2) the BRA\u2019s grant of deviations from art. 44 of the Boston Zoning Code. For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that the BRA\u2019s determinations were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Background. </em>The planned location for Two Financial Center is a vacant parcel of land at the corner of Essex and South Streets in Boston that is currently used as a surface parking lot for up to eighty-three vehicles. The irregularly shaped, trapezoidal parcel is approximately .44 acres and has been vacant since 1958, when existing buildings were demolished. It is located across from the forty-six story One Financial Center building and adjacent to the eleven-story Hotel Essex building. The parcel is at the northern edge of the zoning district known as the Leather District.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The original project design, consisting of a twenty-story, 277-foot high building, with 360,000 square feet of gross floor area, required \u201cLarge Project Review\u201d under art. 80 of the Boston Zoning Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The developer filed a Project Notification Form (PNF) with the BRA under art. 80. The BRA issued a \u201cScoping Determination\u201d on July 9, 1999, in response to the PNF, which required the developer to issue a more comprehensive \u201cDraft Project Impact Report\u201d (DPIR).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Following an extensive public process, the developer filed the required DPIR on March 3, 2000. The DPIR assessed the project\u2019s impact on transportation, wind, shadow, daylight, air quality, noise, solid and hazardous wastes, water quality, storm-water management, geotechnical conditions, groundwater, historical resources and infrastructure, and proposed mitigation measures. Notably, the DPIR proposed a reduction in the size of the project to fifteen stories (205 feet) with 252,500 square feet of gross floor area.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Following further discussions with the BRA and interested parties, the developer agreed to reduce the size of the project contingent on its approval as a G. L. c. 121A project. The developer contended that the loss of three more stories and the cost of the proposed building made it financially infeasible absent c. 121A relief. The developer submitted confidential pro forma development and operating budgets to that effect to the BRA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The developer filed an \u201cApplication for Approval of a Project under Chapter 121A\u201d on March 30, 2000. A \u201cNotice of Project Change\u201d was then filed on April 11, 2000, and reflected the adjustments to scale. The final plan describes a twelve-story office building, with some retail space, as well as a five-level subterranean parking garage for up to 250 vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The BRA held a public hearing on April 25, 2000, to consider the G. L. c. 121A application for Two Financial Center. The BRA issued its \u201cReport and Decision,\u201d also dated April 25, 2000, that approved all material aspects of the application. The BRA determined that the project \u201cwill permanently and comprehensively overcome the blighting conditions existing in the Project Area, but can only do so with the aids provided by Chapter 121 A.\u201d The report stated that \u201cthe subsurface conditions; the high water table; the need to protect [an abutting building] with expensive slurry wall construction; the encumbrance of the Project Area by [a] storm drain and sewer easement; the small lot area; the disproportionately expensive construction cost[;] and windowless walls [] combine to make redevelopment of the Project Area unduly costly and for more than twenty years have prevented the elimination of the blighting influence of the surface parking lot through the ordinary operations of private enterprise alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The BRA further determined that the \u201ccreation of a lively mixed-use development removes the blighting influence of the surface parking lot, and fills a hole in the urban fabric with an attractive building on the northern end of the Leather District.\u201d It also determined that the project provided commercial office space \u201csorely needed\u201d in the city at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The BRA addressed the zoning deviations, including that the</p>\n<p id=\"AKnz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>permitted height for the building as of right was 100 feet with a floor to area ratio (FAR) of 8, while the proposed building was approximately 162 feet high with a FAR of approximately 11.3. The BRA concluded that the twelve-story project \u201cserves to mediate between the high office buildings of the Downtown, and the smaller-scaled historic buildings of the Leather District and Chinatown.\u201d The BRA found that the project incorporated \u201cmany significant architectural elements of the Leather District including a strong base [and street wall],<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> cornice lines which reinforce the heights of adjacent properties,<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> comer entries,<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> and materials which are similar to the brick and stone of the district.\u201d<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> The BRA determined that the deviations may be granted \u201cwithout substantially derogating from the intent and purposes of the [zoning code].\u201d The BRA also found the project consistent with the city\u2019s master plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>General Laws c. 121A determination. </em>\u201cChapter 121A was enacted in response to a legislative determination that the continued existence of blight and decay posed a threat to the health and safety of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 45 (1977). We have held that \u201cthe clear intent of the statutes is to permit the appropriate redevelopment agency, within the broad and comprehensive guidelines delineated, to approve (or disapprove) proposed projects for any area, provided that area is found to be a \u2018blighted open,\u2019 \u2018decadent,\u2019 or \u2018substandard\u2019 area, and provided also that the proposed project meets the \u2018public use\u2019 requirement of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 551, 556 (1976). The BRA\u2019s determination that a project site is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>blighted must be supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., supra </em>at 50. \u201cAlthough we must examine the entire record... we may not substitute our judgment for\u201d the BRA\u2019s. <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>387 Mass. 879, 885 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">General Laws c. 121A, \u00a7 1, provides a broad and comprehensive definition of \u201cblighted open area.\u201d It defines a blighted open area as \u201ca predominantly open area which is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, welfare <em>or </em>sound growth of a community <em>because </em>it is unduly costly to develop it soundly through the ordinary operations of private enterprise <em>by reason of </em>the existence of. . . physical conditions, <em>or by reason </em>of the necessity for unduly expensive excavation, fill <em>or </em>grading, <em>or. . . </em>unduly expensive foundations, retaining walls or unduly expensive measures for waterproofing <em>... or.. . </em>draining <em>... or </em>for the prevention of. . . flooding <em>... or </em>for the protection of adjacent properties ...\u201d (emphases added). G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 1. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2. See also <em>Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Lawrence, </em>403 Mass. 531, 540 (1988) (interpreting similar language of c. 121B, \u00a7 2, court stated that statute presents \u201calternative definitions of a \u2018blighted open area,\u2019 \u201d but \u201carea need satisfy only one of these definitions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The BRA conducted a careful review of the area to determine whether it was blighted, tracking the statutory requirements. The BRA found that the existing parking lot was \u201ca predominantly open area which is detrimental to the . . . sound growth of the community because it is unduly costly to develop it soundly through the ordinary operations of private enterprise.\u201d G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 1. The BRA relied on the small and irregular size of the lot<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the fact that it had not been developed for decades. The existing buildings were demolished in the 1950\u2019s. See <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>Authy., supra </em>at 556-557 (focusing on small, irregular site, unused for many years). The BRA also analyzed the different site conditions, all set out in the statute, to support why the lot was unduly costly to develop. It discussed (1) the \u201cexistence of. . . unsuitable soil. . . conditions,\u201d including that the existing fill material would not support a building and would have to be removed in its entirety; and (2) \u201cthe need for unduly expensive foundations, retaining walls or unduly expensive measures for waterproofing structures or for draining the area,\u201d because groundwater levels (eleven to fifteen feet below the surface) would require any building excavation to create a groundwater cut-off using expensive slurry walls.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The BRA determined that the size of the building and the site conditions made it financially infeasible to develop without c. 121A assistance. We agree with the judge below that there is substantial evidence supporting the BRA\u2019s blight determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The plaintiff suggests the BRA\u2019s articulated findings on blight are inadequate because they simply restate the language provided in the developer\u2019s project application. This is not, however, a case in which the BRA rubber stamped the developer\u2019s submissions or parroted statutory language. Here, \u201cthe findings . . . clearly go beyond a bare repetition of statutory language, and specific reasons underlying the [BRA\u2019s] conclusions have been set forth.\u201d <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., supra </em>at 558. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions, the BRA\u2019s report, and the approximately 2,000 pages of supporting documents included in the appendix, provide detailed and ample support for the BRA\u2019s determination that the project area is a blighted open area. Although the report substantially adopted the language of the developer\u2019s final application, this application was the end result, and in certain respects the work product, of an interactive public process led by the BRA that carefully analyzed and significantly refined the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We also reject the argument that the BRA simply concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that all parking lots are blighted areas without conducting an individualized inquiry. See generally <em>Housing &amp; Redev. Authy. of the City of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Coleman\u2019s Serv., Inc., </em>281 Minn. 63, 69 (1968) (surface parking lots \u201crepresent a highly inefficient use of downtown real estate\u201d); <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Planned Industrial Expansion Authy. of Kansas City, </em>742 S.W.2d 146, 151 (Mo. 1987), appeal dismissed, 486 U.S. 1040 (1988) (proper for redevelopment authority to find that \u201c[s]urface parking constitutes a two-dimensional use which inhibits other, more economically intense, uses . . . [and] contribute^] to a condition of blight\u201d). It is apparent from our review of the record that the BRA combined its general concerns and expertise regarding the urban planning problems presented by surface parking lots with a particular review of the location and lot at issue, which had remained undeveloped for decades and was plagued by site conditions requiring expensive engineering solutions. The required individualized review was undertaken here.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Similarly unavailing is the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the parcel in its present condition as a parking lot cannot be detrimental to the sound growth of the community because the Leather District as a whole is already a \u201cvital, vibrant and prosperous\u201d neighborhood. Although the conditions of the district as a whole are relevant, the statute is directed at the project area itself. See G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 1. Nothing in the statute suggests that blighted open areas cannot exist in or near otherwise vibrant neighborhoods. See generally St. 1960, c. 652 (statute not only designed for eliminating blighted conditions but also \u201cpreventing the recurrence or redevelopment of such conditions\u201d); <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>343 Mass. 375, 384 (1961) (undeveloped project area, which would be used for Prudential Center, \u201clies in the path of, and interferes with, the sound growth of the city\u201d). Also, courts \u201cwill not \u2018sit in review on the size of a particular project area.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 556, quoting from <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26, 35 (1954).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We are also satisfied that the record supports the BRA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>determination that the proposed project represents a public use and benefit. \u201c[T]he determination whether a particular project constitutes a public use and benefit should include an evaluation of both the elimination of blight through construction and the nature of the purposes to be served by the proposed project.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. at 61. The \u201cmere building of a new structure in an area that has been determined to be [blighted], with the resultant elimination of the . . . [blight] conditions, is insufficient to constitute such building a public use and benefit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The building must also be \u201cuseful and beneficial to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62. Here, the BRA has given careful consideration to the public benefit that the proposed project represents. The record supports the BRA\u2019s determination that the proposed project would create an attractive mixed-use development that would provide office space \u201csorely needed\u201d at the time. The record .also supports the BRA\u2019s finding that the project would provide employment during construction and permanent jobs, street-level retail opportunities, underground parking available for neighborhood use to replace the lost surface parking, and completion of the urban streetscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">2. <em>Zoning relief. </em>The plaintiff argues that the BRA lacked substantial evidence to find that the zoning deviations it granted would not substantially derogate from the intent and purpose of the Boston Zoning Code or conflict with the master plan for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The BRA is authorized by St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 859, \u00a7 2, to grant a deviation, should the proposed project contravene \u201cany zoning, building, health or fire law, code, ordinance or regulation.\u201d \u201cThe standard for granting [such] a zoning variance . . . , that the deviation will not substantially derogate from the intent and purposes of the zoning code, is very similar to. . . the standards for the grant of a variance from the zoning code under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. However, the power of the BRA to grant variances is less circumscribed than that of the permit granting authority under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, since the exercise of the BRA\u2019s authority is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>conditioned on fulfillment of only this one criterion.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., supra </em>at 64 (footnote omitted). See <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., supra </em>at 559 (\u201c[T]he standards for granting deviations under [the redevelopment statute] are less restrictive than those governing the granting of variances under the zoning laws\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Article 44 of the Boston Zoning Code \u201cestablish[es] the zoning regulations for the comprehensive plan for the Leather District.\u201d Boston Zoning Code, art. 44, \u00a7 44-1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As provided in \u00a7 44-1 of art. 44, \u201c[t]he goals and objectives of this article and the Leather District Plan are to preserve the historic and architectural character of the Leather District; to promote the mixed residential, office, studio, retail and service uses of the Leather District; and to ensure that new development is compatible with existing buildings in scale, design, and choice of building and decorative materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Here the proposed development was for commercial office space, a permissible use. Retail opportunities were also planned. The BRA determined that the project incorporated \u201cmany significant architectural elements of the Leather District,\u201d creating a building that was \u201csympathetic\u201d to the district. The Massachusetts Historical Commission determined that the project would have \u201cno adverse effect\u201d on the historic, architectural and cultural resources of the district. The primary deviation, and the one that is the focus of the appeal, is the scale of the building.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Instead of a 100-foot building with a FAR of 8, the BRA approved a 162-foot building with a FAR of 11.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">As emphasized by the BRA, the Two Financial Center project underwent intensive and comprehensive review and substantial reduction in height. The BRA determined that the building size and shape ultimately approved did not provide enough rentable space to be financially viable without c. 121A assistance. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>importantly, the BRA also emphasized the location of the building in its finding of no substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of the zoning code or the Leather District Plan. The project area is on the northern edge of the Leather District. The proposed twelve-story building would be \u201ccompatible\u201d in height with its neighbors as it would be located across from the forty-six-story One Financial Center building, and adjacent to the eleven-story Hotel Essex building. As determined by the BRA, Two Financial Center would provide a good transition between the relatively low buildings of the Chinatown District and the high rise buildings of the South Station Area. The Leather District Plan itself states that the \u201cLeather District creates a natural transition\u201d between these two areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">\u201cIn sum, we think that the experience of the BRA in matters involving redevelopment in the city of Boston [including the preparation and implementation of art. 44 and the Leather District Plan], coupled with the evidence before it in this case, permitted the BRA to find that the granting of these deviations would not substantially derogate from the intent and purposes of the zoning code\u201d or conflict with the master plan for the Leather District and city. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev.
