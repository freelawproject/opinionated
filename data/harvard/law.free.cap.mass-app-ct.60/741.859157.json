L. c. 92, \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 107A (as in effect prior to July 1, 2003, the effective date of St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 289 and 290, which repealed the act and inserted the Watershed Management Act, G. L. c. 92AV2. See St. 2003, c. 26, \u00a7 715).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Upon the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint that Clealand B. Blair and Nancy J. Blair (the Blairs) had violated the act by altering the beach and lawn of their waterfront property, the Blairs defended, in part, by claiming that the act was invalid under the Federal and State Constitutions. On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge ruled the act constitutional, facially and as applied to the Blairs\u2019 property, and determined that no taking had occurred. He ordered the Blairs to restore the altered shorefront.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>In 1977, the Blairs purchased the property at issue, a lot on Demond Pond (locus), in the town of Rutland. When they purchased it, the only improvements were a \u201ccamp house,\u201d some lawn, and a beach area. For approximately seventeen years the Blairs used the property for recreational purposes. In September, 1994, they applied to the town for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>permits to demolish the camp house and build a new house. The permits issued, and the new house was built. In June, 1995, desiring to expand the existing lawn and beach areas, they filed a notice of intent with the Rutland Conservation Commission (RCC), seeking an order of conditions authorizing the work. See G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. On July 18, 1995, the RCC issued an order authorizing the expansion work on the existing lawn and beach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Between July, 1995, and July, 1997, the Blairs performed work on their property, including enlarging the lawn; enlarging the shoreline opening of the beach from approximately sixty feet to 120 feet; clearing trees and other vegetation from the shorefront area; excavating, filling, and grading sand and soil, including the removal of twelve inches of topsoil from the beach area; placing twelve additional inches of sand on the beach; building a retaining wall seventy-five to eighty-five feet long and at least thirty inches in height; and placing a three-foot wide, eighty-foot long brick walkway through the lawn area. The Blairs never sought a variance from the requirements of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The water from Demond Pond flows into the Ware River and, through the river, into the Quabbin Reservoir, a major source of drinking water for the greater Boston area. We shall note other facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">2. <em>Statutory and regulatory framework. </em>The act prohibits \u201ca!teration[s]\u201d within 200 feet of the bank of a \u201csurface water[]\u201d in designated \u201cwatersheds.\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 107A(a). The act defines alterations to include \u201cexcavating, filling or grading\u201d or \u201cchanging of run-off characteristics.\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 104. The act exempts construction of a single family dwelling on a pre-existing lot, but provides that \u201c[wjherever possible there shall be no alterations within the area regulated.\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 <em>107A(h). </em>The act also exempts extensions to structures lawfully existing in 1992, provided those extensions do not substantially change or enlarge the structure or \u201cdegrade the quality of the water in the watershed.\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 107A(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The act contains provisions by which the landowner can request, and the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC or agency) can issue, a variance \u201cfrom the provisions of [\u00a7 107A].\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 107A(Z).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agency is directed to enforce the provisions of the act (see G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 110) and, after consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, to issue regulations, which appear at 350 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.00 et seq. (1994) (regulations). G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">3. <em>The enforcement action, defenses, and counterclaims. </em>In a relatively simple complaint, the Commonwealth alleged that the Blairs violated the act by making alterations within the watershed, and requested a restoration order. As relevant to this appeal, the Blairs, by answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaim, asserted that: (1) the alteration of the locus was exempt under the statute; (2) the Commonwealth\u2019s action was barred by loches; and (3) the act and regulations were void for vagueness and were unconstitutional under both Federal and State Constitutions because they effected a taking of private property without just compensation. The Blairs sought damages and a declaration as to the unconstitutionality of the act, or, at a minimum, the exemption of the locus from the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Commonwealth moved for summary judgment on its claim that the Blairs had violated the act and on the exemption and constitutionality issues raised in the Blairs\u2019 counterclaim. The Blairs moved for summary judgment on the Commonwealth\u2019s statutory claim and on their counterclaims. On the statutory claims, the judge determined that the Blairs\u2019 alterations amounted to a violation of the act and that the exemptions in the act did not apply to the alterations. The judge found the Blairs\u2019 constitutional challenges to the act ripe for adjudication and determined that the act was not facially invalid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the Blairs\u2019 as-applied takings claims, the judge concluded that no taking under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurred because there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>was no categorical taking<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the act survived the three-prong test of <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104 (1978) <em>(Penn </em>Central)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; no taking occurred under art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as the State constitutional analysis parallels the Federal; and art. 49 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution provided no independent basis for relief. The judge further determined that the action was not barred by the doctrine of loches and that the act and regulations were not void for vagueness or arbitrariness. Concluding further that the Blairs had not offered any evidence to support their argument that the MDC had applied the act and its exemptions inconsistently or outside the legislative mandate, the judge ordered the Blairs to restore the locus to its pre-alteration condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">On appeal the Blairs argue that the act is invalid under the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions; that the Commonwealth\u2019s action is barred by loches; and that the act and regulations are void for vagueness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">4. <em>Analysis, </em>(a) <em>Ripeness of the Federal takings claim..</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As we have discussed, see notes 6 &amp; 7, <em>supra, </em>the Blairs have waived their claim that the act effects a categorical taking of the locus under the Federal Constitution. Unlike the motion judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>we conclude that, because the Blairs failed to utilize the variance provision of the act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> their taking claim under the <em>Penn Central </em>test, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>was not ripe. Generally, a regulatory taking claim is not ripe until \u201cthe government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\u201d <em>Daddario </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Commn., </em>425 Mass. 411, 414, cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1036 (1997), appeal after remand, <em>Daddario </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Commn., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 764, 768-770 (2002), cert, denied, 540 U.S. 1005 (2003), quoting from <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commn. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 186 (1985). See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>413 Mass. 352, 356 (1992); <em>FIC Homes of Blackstone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Blackstone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 690 n.13 (1996). The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cit is impossible to determine the extent of the loss or interference until the [government entity] has decided whether it will grant a variance from the application of the regulations.\u201d <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commn. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. at 191 n.12. A final decision is an essential element of a regulatory taking claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">\u201cIt follows from the nature of a regulatory takings claim that an essential prerequisite to its assertion is a final and authoritative determination .... A court cannot determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>whether a regulation has gone \u2018too far\u2019 unless it knows how far the regulation goes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"><em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>County of Yolo, 477 </em>U.S. 340, 348 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In <em>Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 620-621 (2001), the Supreme Court recently affirmed the Federal requirements for ripeness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cUnder our ripeness rules a takings claim based on a law or regulation which is alleged to go too far in burdening property depends upon the landowner\u2019s first having followed reasonable and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to exercise their full discretion in considering development plans for the property, including the opportunity to grant any variances or waivers allowed by law. As a general rule, until these ordinary processes have been followed the extent of the restriction on property is not known and a regulatory taking has not yet been established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In essence, a claim is not ripe until the landowner has exhausted available administrative remedies and the agency has made a final decision. Because the agency has not made a final determination, on a variance application, of the extent of allowed alteration, the Blairs\u2019 as-applied taking claim was not ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The motion judge equated enforcement with a permit denial, ruling that the Commonwealth\u2019s enforcement action constituted a final determination of the act\u2019s requirements. While this might be true in some circumstances, see, e.g., the \u201cfutility exception\u201d to the exhaustion requirement, <em>Daddario </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Commn., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. at 770, and cases cited, it is not the case here. The enforcement action at issue here did not necessarily indicate what the agency\u2019s final determination would be after considering a variance application and applying the variance regulations to the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">As provided for in G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 107A(Z), the variance process gives landowners an opportunity to rebut the statutory presumption that alterations in the waterfront area would be harmful to drinking water quality. Before granting or denying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>variance allowing some or all of the proposed alterations, the agency is to consider several factors, including possible mitigating measures. This kind of factual development is not possible where the defendant has simply gone forward without first applying for a variance. Thus, the taking claim is premature. A decision on a variance application, not an enforcement action, would show with finality the extent of the restrictions applied to the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">(b) <em>The art. 10 takings claim. </em>As the Blairs acknowledge, the Supreme Judicial Court, to date, has evaluated takings claims under the Federal analysis. See <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 19-20 (1979); <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Envtl. Mgmt., </em>384 Mass. 530, 533 (1981); <em>Steinbergh </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>413 Mass. 736, 741-744 (1992), cert, denied, 508 U.S. 909 (1993); <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>417 Mass. 299, 304 (1994); <em>Daddario </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Commn., </em>425 Mass. at 415-418. The Blairs also correctly note that the Supreme Judicial Court has mentioned, without decision, the question whether art. 10 grants a property owner greater protection than the owner has under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. See <em>Lopes, supra </em>at 300 n.2. That said, the Blairs argue that, under an art. 10 analysis, the act effected a categorical taking of the locus notwithstanding their concession (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>that no such taking occurred under the United States Constitution. The crux of the Blairs\u2019 argument rests on the text of art. 10.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Blairs urge that we construe the phrase \u201cno part of the property\u201d in art. 10 to mean that, in examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the extent of their economic loss, we should consider only that portion of the locus restricted by the act, rather than the locus as a whole. Contrast, e.g., <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Envtl. Mgmt., </em>384 Mass. at 533.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the Blairs argue, there has been a categorical taking of the portion of the locus that was the subject of the enforcement action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\u201cEach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing laws. He is obliged, consequently, to contribute his share to the expense of this protection . . . : <em>but no part of the property </em>of any individual can, with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the representative body of the people. In fine, the people of this commonwealth are not controllable by any other laws than those to which their constitutional representative body have given their consent. And whenever the public exigencies require that the property of any individual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>While this may be an interesting theory,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Blairs\u2019 argument is prematurely asserted on the facts of this case. The matter was no more ripe than the Federal taking claim discussed <em>supra, </em>due to the Blairs\u2019 failure to utilize the variance provision in the act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>(c) <em>The art. 49 claim. </em>The Blairs argue that the act fails expressly under art. 49 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 97 of the Amendments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the Commonwealth has the constitutional authority, in furtherance of the people\u2019s right to a clean environment, to provide for the taking of land (and payment of \u201cjust compensation\u201d), the Blairs argue that: (1) the authorization extends to easements; (2) the act specifically authorizes the MDC to expend funds to acquire interests in land; (3) the restrictions of the act upon their land are, effectively, in the \u201cnature of easement\u201d; and (4) they should be compensated therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The judge correctly rejected the argument that the Commonwealth is duty-bound to acquire interests related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>protection of drinking water. The Blairs essentially argue that, because art. 49 authorizes the Commonwealth to acquire \u201clands and easements\u201d to protect environmental quality, the Commonwealth now may only seek to protect the public interest in environmental quality by means of acquiring property interests, rather than through regulation that stops short of a taking under the Fifth Amendment or art. 10. The Blairs do not cite to authorities supporting their interpretation of art. 49 and, like the Superior Court judge, we find none and refuse to adopt the Blairs\u2019 interpretation in the absence of more compelling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">(d) <em>Laches. </em>The Blairs argue that the Commonwealth\u2019s enforcement action should be barred by the equitable doctrine of loches. Their support for this argument is the undisputed fact that John Scannell, a member of the RCC at times relevant to the issuance of its order of conditions under the Wetlands Protection Act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, was at the same time a full-time employee of the MDC. The Blairs argue, in essence, that the MDC had constructive notice of their proposed project and did nothing until a substantial portion of the beach work was done, to their prejudice. We agree with the motion judge, who found no merit to the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">First, as matter of law, loches will generally not serve as a bar where a public right is to be enforced. See <em>Wang </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>405 Mass. 15, 20 (1989), citing <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of N. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 675 (1968); and <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>317 Mass. 185, 187 (1944). Second, it is undisputed that most of the land alterations at issue here were performed in the summer of 1997. At the end of July, 1997, the MDC gave verbal notice to the Blairs that the work that was being performed was not in compliance with the act. A writing to the same effect followed on August 27, 1997. The judge was correct in ruling that the Blairs have not met their burden of demonstrating that they were unduly prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s timing in bringing this action. An agency must have a reasonable time in which to respond to an apparent statutory violation. The Blairs conducted the work on the locus at their own peril, with prior knowledge that the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>applied to the locus as the result of notice letters sent by the MDC.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment shall be modified to dismiss the Blairs\u2019 counterclaim insofar as it alleged an as-applied taking under the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions and to declare that the Blairs are not entitled to the relief they seek as to the exemption of the locus from the act and the facial validity of the act and regulations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> The substantive provisions of the act at issue here remain unchanged in G. L. c. 92AV2. Only the administrative structure has been changed: rather than being administered by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC or agency), the Watershed Management Act is now to be administered by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. See St. 2003, c. 41, \u00a7 1(7), transferring the functions of the division of watershed management in the MDC to the division of water supply protection in the Department of Conservation and Recreation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\"> See part 2, <em>infra. </em>The act defines the protected watersheds as \u201cthe natural basin from within which water drains or in natural course would drain into the Quabbin reservoir, the Wachusett reservoir, or the Ware river upstream of the Ware river intake,\u201d G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 104, and, inter alla, prohibits \u201c[a]ny alteration . . . within those portions of the watersheds that lie within two hundred feet of the bank of a tributary or surface waters or within four hundred feet of the bank of a reservoir.\u201d G.

The substance of their facial challenge thus reduces to the question whether the act, by its \u201cmere enactment,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>has effected a \u201ccategorical\u201d taking. See note 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> A categorical taking may occur when a statute or regulation deprives a landowner of \u201call economically beneficial use\u201d of her property. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>417 Mass. 299, 304 n.9 (1994), quoting from <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003 (1992). At oral argument, the Blairs conceded that there was no categorical taking under Federal jurisprudence. However, because of their reading of art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the Blairs continue to maintain that there was a categorical taking as defined by Massachusetts law.
