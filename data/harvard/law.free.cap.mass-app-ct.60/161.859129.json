See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Because we cannot say with any degree of assuranee that the witness\u2019s testimony would not have changed the outcome of the trial, we reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">1. <em>The evidence. </em>We set out in detail the evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s third trial. In the fall of 1998, the defendant shared an apartment in the Dorchester section of Boston with his fianc\u00e9e Martha and her teenaged daughter Diane.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Martha and the defendant had been engaged to marry since 1992,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and she, Diane, and the defendant had lived together in the apartment as a family for more than six years. Although the lease for the apartment identified only Martha and Diane as tenants, the defendant had keys to the apartment, received his mail at that address, and considered it his home. While Martha paid most of the monthly bills, which were in her name and directed to her, the defendant contributed some money toward the household expenses. He also made those payments necessary to maintain and to insure his automobile, which served as the family\u2019s primary mode of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-25\">In late September of 1998, the defendant entered into a clandestine sexual relationship with Diane. As put by the defendant, he and Martha had become \u201cdistant\u201d from each other, and he wanted to end their relationship. At this time, he was thirty-nine years of age to Diane\u2019s seventeen years. The defendant testified that, between September and mid-November of 1998, and while Martha was at work, he and Diane had consensual sexual intercourse in their home three times. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>related that, as their affair progressed, Diane began demanding that he pay her bills and ran errands for her. She caused friction in their relationship and tension in the household by threatening to tell Martha about their relationship if he did not do as she asked. The defendant felt as if he were \u201cwalking on eggshells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Soon after Martha left for work on the morning of December 6, 1998, Diane invited the defendant into her bedroom and expressed her desire to engage in sexual intercourse. The defendant described how he attempted intercourse with Diane for a few minutes but then stopped. He told Diane that he was reluctant to continue the sexual nature of their relationship, that he could no longer endure the tension in the household, and that, when Martha came home from work, he was going to tell her \u201ceverything.\u201d He testified that Diane told him that she did not want her mother to know about their relationship, that \u201cif anything, I\u2019d rather tell her that you raped me.\u201d Diane then telephoned her mother at work and asked her to come home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the defendant was leaving the building, Martha drove up in the \u201cfamily\u201d car. When she asked why Diane had called her to come home, the defendant told her that Diane wanted to talk to her and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Martha testified that, when she encountered the defendant and asked what was happening, he told her that he was sorry and walked away. Diane, visibly upset, met her mother at the back door to the building and told her that the defendant had put his penis in her vagina. They went to their apartment, and Diane showered. Martha and Diane next went to the home of the defendant\u2019s parents and then to a hospital for a \u201crape kit examination.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That afternoon, the police obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. In the meantime, the defendant had admitted himself to the psychiatric ward of a local hospital without notifying anyone of his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Martha told the jury that on the following day, December 7, she changed the lock on the door to the apartment, packed up the defendant\u2019s belongings, and brought them to his parents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>residence at the rest home that they owned and managed. According to Martha, she was greeted at the door by Jacqueline Greer, who resided and worked at the rest home. Martha related that Greer helped her carry the defendant\u2019s belongings to a second-floor bedroom. A few days later, Martha left the defendant\u2019s car with his parents and purchased one of her own. Because the defendant was \u201cnowhere to be found,\u201d she could not tell the defendant about any of the steps she had taken to remove him and his property from the apartment. Four days later, December 11, the defendant was arrested at the hospital and charged with raping Diane. He was taken to a police station and released the next day. When he went to his parents\u2019 home, he saw his car. He had \u201cno idea\u201d how it got there.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We come to the events of Sunday, December 13, 1998. Martha testified that, at about 10:00 a.m., she and Diane were leaving their apartment to go Christmas shopping. When she opened the front door to the apartment, she found a suit which she had previously purchased for the defendant \u201cripped to shreds\u201d and the duffel bag that she had brought to his parents\u2019 home on December 7. She also found a note on the windshield of her new car. The note read as follows: \u201c[Martha], the truth is I love only you. Now I know that. . . anything else is a waste of time and effort and mistake. You\u2019ll realize the truth about [Diane], I tried to tell you. I still love you.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Martha retrieved the suit and duffel bag and dropped them off at the police station. She and Diane then went shopping and arrived home at about 6:00 p.m. After unloading the bundles, Martha left Diane in the apartment, returned to her car, drove to her parking space behind the building, re-entered the building through the rear door, and walked up one flight of stairs to her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Martha told the jury that, as she put her key in the door to her apartment, she heard a noise behind her. She turned and saw the defendant. He was wearing a dark-blue baseball hat and carrying a knife which she recognized as one frequently used at his parents\u2019 home. The defendant put his foot between the door and its threshold and said, \u201cI got you now, bitch.\u201d He pushed her inside the apartment, shut and locked the door, and pulled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>telephone from its socket. Still wielding the knife, the defendant grabbed Martha by her arm, dragged her into a bedroom, and pushed her into a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">According to Martha, the defendant acted \u201cderanged.\u201d An argument ensued. The defendant told Martha that, although he had had sex with Diane, he had not raped her. Martha insisted that Diane\u2019s willingness made no difference to her, he had \u201churt an innocent kid.\u201d He told Martha that his parents had paid a large amount of money to \u201cget him out of this mess\u201d and that his life would be ruined if the charges were not dropped.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As he was talking, the defendant jabbed with his knife, hitting a dresser as well as Martha\u2019s knees. He sliced open Martha\u2019s hat and a pillow sham. When he sliced Martha\u2019s finger while wildly waving the knife, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do this .... I was only trying to scare you.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He insisted upon driving her, in her car, to a health center for medical assistance. Upon their arrival and while in the defendant\u2019s presence, Martha explained that she had cut her hand while cooking. Once alone with a nurse, Martha changed her explanation for her injury and said that the defendant had cut her. She also called the police and her family. By the time she had received medical attention, the defendant had left the health center. The police drove Martha home. Her car was parked behind her apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Upon cross-examination, Martha readily admitted that she had been angry with the defendant from the time of Diane\u2019s allegation of rape. She was of the view that the relationship between the defendant and Diane, consensual or not, was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The defendant\u2019s version of the events of December 13 is quite different. He related that he arrived at his parents\u2019 house that morning and accompanied his mother to church, a fact corroborated by his mother. When they arrived home from church, about 3:00 p.m., Greer told him that Martha had called for him while he was at church. The defendant testified that, about two hours later, while still at his parents\u2019 home, he received a telephone call from Martha. Greer answered the phone and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>handed it to him. Although the defendant was not allowed to relate their conversation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he was permitted to state that he and she agreed to meet and talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We digress. Martha testified that she never made a telephone call to the Pittmans\u2019 home on December 13, and her sister testified that it was she, and not Martha, who placed the call and spoke with Greer.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">According to the defendant, he met with Martha, as agreed, in the parking lot behind her apartment building. Having once worked as a mechanic, he inspected her newly purchased car. Because he and Martha did not want their conversation to be overheard, they went to her apartment. The defendant acknowledged Diane, who was watching television in the living room, and followed Martha into a bedroom. There they talked about where he had been and why, as well as the criminal charge he was facing as a result of Diane\u2019s accusation of rape. After about fifteen minutes, he and Martha left the bedroom and went into the kitchen so that Martha could begin preparing dinner for herself and Diane. When Martha stuck a knife into frozen hamburger to check whether it had defrosted, she sliced her thumb. The defendant explained that he and Martha decided that she should seek medical attention in case the knife had been contaminated by raw meat.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The defendant testified that upon arrival at the medical center, he assisted Martha in requesting medical attention. When he was told to wait in the reception area of the center while Martha was being treated, he left. He dropped off Martha\u2019s car at her apartment, went to a friend\u2019s house, and called his parents. When his parents told him that the police were looking for him, he drove to their home. Upon his arrival, he called the police. He was soon taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In the course of his testimony, the defendant explained that he first learned that Martha had changed the lock on the door to her apartment when he and she were in the bedroom talking. He denied that he went to her apartment with a knife; that he threatened, grabbed, or yelled at her; or that he had shredded the suit she had purchased for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>2. <em>Greer\u2019s prior recorded testimony. </em>At the defendant\u2019s second trial, which ended with a hung jury on the charges now before us, Greer testified that she never saw Martha deliver any bags of clothing to the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 home in December of 1998, nor did she ever receive such items from Martha. She did, however, see the defendant at his parents\u2019 home on Sunday, December 13, at about 9:30 a.m., when he was preparing to attend church with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Greer also related that, on December 13, she received two telephone calls from Martha. Although Greer was uncertain about the time of Martha\u2019s first call, she stated that the conversation concerned Martha\u2019s inquiry whether the defendant was then at his parents\u2019 home. No matter the exact time of Martha\u2019s call, Greer told Martha that the defendant was not at his parents\u2019 home. Greer took a second call from Martha a little after 2:00 p.m., soon after the defendant returned from church. Martha asked to speak with the defendant, and Greer handed him the phone. Greer stated that, shortly thereafter, the defendant left the premises. Before he did so, Greer told him, \u201cRodney, don\u2019t go out.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll be back. Everything is okay; she just wanted to talk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">When, during her testimony, Greer was shown a knife, she stated that she was familiar with the cutlery used at the rest home and that she had never seen anything like that knife there. She also testified that when the defendant left his parents\u2019 home, he was not carrying anything in his hands. She was also insistent about the fact that the two telephone calls that she received on December 13 were from Martha and not one of Martha\u2019s sisters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Greer did not testify at the third trial. She was in Virginia attending her grandmother\u2019s funeral. The primary issue on appeal is whether the judge was correct in rejecting defense counsel\u2019s requests either to continue the trial until Greer\u2019s return from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Virginia or to be allowed to read Greer\u2019s prior recorded testimony to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Because we conclude that the judge was in error in ruling that defense counsel had failed to show that Greer was an unavailable witness, and, consequently, in excluding her prior testimony, we do not consider the denial of defense counsel\u2019s request for a continuance. Instead, we focus on the judge\u2019s ruling that defense counsel had failed to make a sufficient showing of Greer\u2019s unavailability. \u201cWe accept as a basis of unavailability the principles expressed in Rule 804(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Evidence [1987]. Rule 804(a)(5) provides that a witness is unavailable if the witness \u2018is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance ... by process or other reasonable means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. 672, 678 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 619 (2003), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">It appears on the record before us that, on the morning of June 30, 2000, a Friday and the fourth day of trial, defense counsel advised the judge that Greer was in Virginia but due to return in time to be present in court on July 6. He requested a continuance until that date. The judge deferred his ruling on the request until later that day, after the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. At that time, defense counsel gave the judge a copy of the subpoena ordering Greer to appear at trial and represented that it had been served in hand upon Greer at her last and usual place of abode the day before, just as she was about to leave for Virginia.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defense counsel also made an offer of proof showing the necessity of Greer\u2019s testimony to contradict that given by Martha. The judge refused to continue the trial. The following Monday, July 3, defense counsel renewed his request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-34\">In pressing his request for a continuance, defense counsel represented to the judge that he had been in contact with Greer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>on Friday, June 30, and that she told him that she would be present in court to testify the following Monday, July 3. Defense counsel went on to represent that, notwithstanding Greer\u2019s assurances to him, the defendant\u2019s family notified him over the weekend that Greer had made four or five unsuccessful attempts to secure passage on a flight back to Boston in time to appear in court on Monday. Defense counsel renewed his offer of proof and again requested a continuance until Thursday, or, as put by him, \u201can extra day and a half [to] two days,\u201d taking the Fourth of July holiday into account. Citing concern for the jurors\u2019 convenience, the judge again denied the request for a continuance. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyne, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 40 (1993) (in view of circumstances presented, refusal to grant continuance deemed a \u201cshort-sighted insistence on expedition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Faced with Greer\u2019s absence and the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance, defense counsel next asked that he be allowed to read Greer\u2019s prior recorded testimony from the second trial to the jury. Although the judge neither questioned nor otherwise expressed doubt about defense counsel\u2019s representations concerning his efforts to secure Greer\u2019s attendance, he (the judge) found that he had no way of knowing whether Greer had or had not made reasonable effort to make a timely return from Virginia.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, he refused to allow defense counsel to read Greer\u2019s prior recorded testimony to the jury, stating that defense counsel had failed to make a sufficient showing of Greer\u2019s unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It was error for the judge to base his ruling upon a lack of proof of Greer\u2019s actual attempts to be present at trial, rather than upon defense counsel\u2019s unchallenged representations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>concerning all his reasonable efforts to secure her presence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. at 678; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 619. The Commonwealth makes no argument to the contrary. The undisputed facts establish that defense counsel made timely service of a subpoena upon Greer which she ignored in favor of attending a family funeral; he spoke with her in Virginia; he secured her assurance that she would be in court on July 3; and he subsequently spoke with her family concerning her inability to return to Massachusetts by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Because the judge concluded that the defendant had failed to show that Greer was an unavailable witness, he did not reach the question of the reliability of Greer\u2019s prior statements. The Commonwealth commendably concedes the issue, and we accept the concession. A review of the transcript of Greer\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s second trial establishes the reliability of her prior recorded statements. \u201cPrior recorded testimony is admissible \u2018in a proceeding addressed to substantially the same issues as in the current proceeding, with reasonable opportunity and similar motivation on the prior occasion for cross-examination of the declarant by the party against whom the testimony is now being offered.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, </em>397 Mass. 633, 637-638 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meech, </em>380 Mass. 490, 494 (1980).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 135 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Having concluded that the judge erred in excluding evidence of Greer\u2019s prior recorded statements, we now consider whether the error requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions. On this issue the Commonwealth argues that, because Greer did not witness any of the events which allegedly took place at Martha\u2019s apartment on December 13, her testimony was, at best, \u201cmerely corroborative\u201d of the defendant\u2019s claim that Martha had called him twice on the date in question. Accordingly, the Commonwealth argues, the erroneous exclusion of her prior recorded testimony does not require reversal of the convictions. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u201cAn error is not prejudicial only if the Commonwealth can show \u2018with fair assurance . . . that the judgment was not substantially swayed\u2019 by it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>428 Mass. 76, 79 (1998). This trial was a credibility contest in which the Commonwealth\u2019s case turned on the testimony of Martha and Diane.</p>\n<p id=\"Aus\">We think it apparent from the evidence and the defendant\u2019s acquittal on the charge of rape (see note 1, supra) that the jury could not have accepted all of Diane\u2019s testimony. As for the remaining charges, they had to have relied on Martha\u2019s testimony, testimony corroborated by her sister and Diane. They did not, however, have Greer\u2019s testimony. Greer\u2019s prior testimony, see part 2 of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>did much more than corroborate the defendant\u2019s insistence that Martha had called him twice on December 13, a claim adamantly denied by Martha. It had a direct bearing on the defendant\u2019s purpose in going to Martha\u2019s apartment that day. Moreover, Greer contradicted Martha\u2019s testimony concerning the return of the defendant\u2019s possessions on December 7, as well as her claim that the knife in question came from the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"AWl\">When the jury at the defendant\u2019s second trial had Greer\u2019s testimony to consider on the indictments before us, they were unable to reach a verdict. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Based upon the procedural history of the case and the evidence presented at the trial now under review, we cannot say that Greer\u2019s prior recorded testimony \u201ccould not have affected the . . . verdicts that are challenged on appeal,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>426 Mass. 555, 560 (1998), especially the verdict returned on the indictment charging him with armed home invasion. The error was prejudicial and requires yet another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Azl\">3. <em>Scope of the retrial. </em>Our conclusion that the defendant must be put to trial for the fourth time requires that we consider his argument that he was entitled to required findings of not guilty on the indictments charging him with armed home invasion and intimidation of a witness. His argument on both claims fails to take into account Martha\u2019s testimony which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowans, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 815 (2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and cases therein cited.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">4. <em>Issues likely to recur. </em>Having concluded that the defendant is entitled to a new trial, we briefly discussed those issues likely to recur. First, there is the matter of the admissibility of the restraining order obtained by Martha pursuant to G. L. c. 209A several days after Diane\u2019s allegations that the defendant had raped her and served upon the defendant on December 14, the date after the crimes in issue. Whether at retrial the order should be admitted in or excluded from evidence turns on whether the Commonwealth first shows that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the order (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 589-593 [1997], cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1058 [1998]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 306-308 [1998]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crimmins, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491-494 [1999]), and, should such a showing be made, whether the trial judge determines, as matter of discretion, that the probative value of the order outweighs its potential for prejudice. We do not consider whether the defendant\u2019s credibility is subject to impeachment by his prior convictions. That question will be a matter within the trial judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Rather than discuss the defendant\u2019s complaints about the jury instructions, we direct the attention of the judge on remand to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>422 Mass. 305, 315 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANb\"> This appeal comes before us after the defendant\u2019s third trial.

To the extent the judge noted that the return failed to indicate where service had been made upon Greer, neither the judge nor the Commonwealth disputed defense counsel\u2019s representation that Greer had been served at her last and usual place of abode.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> The judge stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201cThis witness \u2014 you indicate to me that this witness made efforts to get here. ... I have no way of knowing whether she did or not or what efforts she, in fact, did make to get here. I have no means of knowing whether or not \u2022\u2014 I assume she did go to a funeral. But whether or not she can\u2019t get back here or there\u2019s no flights absolutely anywhere in the world getting her back here, I don\u2019t know. But I intend to proceed with the trial. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\"> We see nothing in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>422 Mass. 305, 314-315 (1996), that supports the defendant\u2019s claim of an entitlement to a required finding of not guilty on the armed home invasion indictment as opposed to appropriate jury instructions on the question of an armed home invasion by a \u201cformer cohabitant who had never been formally evicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314. We also conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support its burden of proof on the defendant\u2019s conviction for intimidating a witness. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B. A jury reasonably could infer that Martha was a person \u201cfurnishing information\u201d to the police concerning Diane\u2019s allegation of rape. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the Commonwealth presented evidence to show \u201cexpress or implied\u201d threats of force by the defendant in order to influence or to intimidate Martha with respect to her furnishing information about the alleged rape to the police. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>40 Mass.
