Kelleher did not see who hit him. Police attention soon focused on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On June 16, 1997, a Superior Court jury convicted the defendant on charges of mayhem and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant moved for a new trial; on August 11, 1997, the judge (who had presided over his trial) denied the motion. Shortly thereafter, the defendant obtained a stay of execution of the remainder of his sentence; the case is now before us on the defendant\u2019s consolidated appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The defendant maintains that the Commonwealth prosecuted the wrong person. On appeal the defendant argues, consistently with that theory, that (i) hearsay testimony identifying him as the assailant was improperly admitted over objection; and (ii) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to interview, and call at trial, a witness who would have testified that he (and not the defendant) fought with Kelleher. The defendant also asserts that his convictions on both mayhem and assault and battery by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>means of a dangerous weapon are duplicative (which the Commonwealth concedes, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 722 [1997]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and that, since the evidence was insufficient as matter of law to support conviction on a charge of mayhem, he should be retried solely on the lesser of the two charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">1. <em>Hearsay identification. </em>At trial, a single eyewitness, Ginny DePalo, testified that she saw the defendant strike Kelleher. It was late at night, DePalo had consumed alcohol earlier in the evening, and the nightclub was crowded, strobe-lit, and smoky. Sergeant Arthur Stratford was allowed to testily, over objection, that following the altercation \u201cnumerous people,\u201d \u201c[a]t least three,\u201d pointed to the defendant as Kelleher\u2019s assailant. Later during his direct examination, Sergeant Stratford was allowed to testify, again over objection, that several persons other than De-Palo had identified the defendant as Kelleher\u2019s assailant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Q: \u201cDid anyone else notice the person who had struck Mr. Kelleher with the bottle?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Q: \u201cAbout how many people?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">A: \u201cA white male, whose name I don\u2019t happen to know right now. And I think he is on a police report. Ginny [De-Palo], the manager, Ted Alice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The defendant\u2019s motion to strike Sergeant Stratford\u2019s testimony, quoted above, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The Commonwealth suggests that the officer\u2019s testimony was properly admitted to explain how the attention of the police came to center on the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 508 (1999). The officer\u2019s first reference to others implicating the defendant likely went beyond the scope allowed under Rosario;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in any event, the officer\u2019s later statements were clearly inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parkes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>53 Mass. App. Ct. 815, 819-820 (2002). We consider whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The officer\u2019s improperly admitted testimony served to corrob\u00f3rate DePalo\u2019s identification of the defendant as Kelleher\u2019s assailant. The defendant contended that he was misidentified, and there were reasons as noted above to question the identificatian made by the one eyewitness who testified at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the circumstances we cannot say with assurance that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; indeed the effect of the improperly admitted testimony is comparable to that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parkes, supra, in </em>which similar testimony led to reversal even though the error in that case was not properly preserved. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>We consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of mayhem, for the purpose of determining the scope of the charge on which he may be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">Mayhem is a crime of specific intent, requiring proof that the defendant intended to maim or disfigure the victim. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14. Though direct evidence frequently, as in the present case, will be inadequate to establish the requisite intent, intent may be inferred from the nature of the injuries inflicted on the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 217 (1996). <em>In Cleary, </em>the defendant struck the victim with a blade-less axe handle, causing severe and permanent injury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>victim\u2019s eye and face. We held that, despite the severity of the victim\u2019s injuries, the circumstances of the attack did not support a conviction of mayhem. In so doing, we noted that mayhem typically involves a sustained assault, supporting an inference of intent to administer an injury sufficient to support the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 217-218. In the present case, despite the severity of the injuries inflicted, we conclude as in <em>Cleary </em>that the circumstances of the attack do not support an inference that the attacker specifically intended to maim or disfigure the victim. The entire attack lasted no more than one and one-half minutes, and the injuries resulted from a single strike with a beer bottle that was intact before it struck Kelleher\u2019s head. Any time a dangerous weapon is used in an assault and battery there is the potential that its use will result in serious injury. To find the requisite specific intent to support mayhem in the circumstances of the present case, based on a single strike with a beer bottle in the midst of a brief bar fight and without any other evidence of the attacker\u2019s intent, would collapse the distinction between the offenses of mayhem and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The evidence in the defendant\u2019s first trial accordingly was insufficient as matter of law to support his conviction on the charge of mayhem, and his retrial shall solely concern the lesser charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">3. <em>Testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s silence. </em>Sergeant Stratford\u2019s direct testimony included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Q: \u201cDid you make any observations of [the defendant] about his person?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">A: \u201cWell, just that he didn\u2019t say anything to me. He was completely stone faced. He didn\u2019t say anything, he didn\u2019t make any body movements. He didn\u2019t resist, he didn\u2019t talk, he didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">Q: \u201cDid he say anything to you when you placed him under arrest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">A: \u201cNothing. Nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">At retrial the Commonwealth and the officer should avoid such inquiry into, or comment upon, the defendant\u2019s silence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial on the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> It bears comment that the defendant\u2019s appeal did not enter on our docket until October 22, 2002, more than five years after his new trial motion was denied. The first docket entry reflects receipt of four volumes of trial transcript on that date. Two volumes of the trial transcript, covering the testimony, opening and closing arguments, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, total almost 400 pages and were completed, according to the court reporter\u2019s certificate, eight days after the defendant\u2019s conviction. The remaining two transcript volumes relate, respectively, to the verdict and sentencing (fifteen pages) and the defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution of his sentence (thirty-four pages). Neither court reporter\u2019s certificate for those two volumes (different court reporters covered each proceeding) reflects the date she completed her portion of the transcript. The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel candidly acknowledged at oral argument that, once the defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed, he made one inquiry to the clerk\u2019s office about the status of the record (about one year after filing the notice of appeal) but otherwise felt little inducement to press the appeal. The Commonwealth did not monitor the status of the appeal. It is unclear how much of the lengthy delay in entering the appeal on our docket resulted from the court reporters\u2019 failure to transcribe the forty-nine pages of proceedings following jury deliberations, and how much is attributable to the lower court clerk\u2019s office. The delay is, however, plainly unacceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\"> The Superior Court judge did not have the benefit of the holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>at the time she ruled on the defendant\u2019s new trial motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-13\"> The defendant also claims that testimony regarding his pre- and post-arrest silence was improperly admitted, claims we address briefly below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-14\"> Such testimony \u201cmust be limited to the facts required to establish the officer\u2019s state of knowledge,\u201d and should ordinarily be limited to \u201ca statement that the officer acted \u2018upon information received,\u2019 or \u2018as a consequence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>conversation,\u2019 or words to that effect \u2014 without further detail.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 509-510, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 555 (1989). Since DePalo told the officer that the defendant was Kelleher\u2019s assailant, reference to others was wholly unnecessary to explain the officer\u2019s pursuit of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-34\"> Because we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial by reason of the improperly admitted hearsay testimony identifying the defendant as Kelleher\u2019s assailant, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by reason of trial counsel\u2019s failure to call as a witness the defendant\u2019s companion, who he asserts was the person who fought with Kelleher. However, the affidavit of Alex Gureckis, submitted in support of the defendant\u2019s new trial motion and claiming that he (Gureckis) was Kelleher\u2019s assailant, tends likewise to cast doubt on DePalo\u2019s identificatian of the defendant, and therefore to support the defendant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the improperly admitted identification testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
