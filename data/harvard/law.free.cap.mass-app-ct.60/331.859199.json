L. c. 209A. His case was continued without a finding, and he was placed on unsupervised probation. He was subsequently arrested and charged with two crimes involving assaultive behavior. At a probation surrender hearing he was found to be in violation of the terms of his probation based on these incidents. A guilty finding was entered on the continued case, and he was sentenced to a house of correction for two and one-half years with ninety days to be served, the balance suspended for a period of three years, during which time he was placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">The only live issue remaining in this case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the lawfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of the order of the trial judge imposing as a condition of probation that the defendant not \u201cconsume or possess any alcohol\u201d during the term of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The record does not disclose any evidence of the use of alcohol in connection with the charge for which the defendant was on probation. Nor was there any such evidence relating to his assaultive conduct on the two occasions that led to criminal complaints and formed the basis of the revocation of his probation. The record does contain evidence, however, that all offenses involved volatile and impulsive conduct on the part of the defendant. All of these offenses occurred within a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A judge has broad discretion to impose conditions of probation which are reasonably calculated to control the conduct of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 402 (1998) (\u201cJudges are permitted \u2018great latitude\u2019 in imposing conditions of probation\u201d). See also G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, as amended through St. 1974, c. 614 (\u201cany district court. . . may place on probation . . . any person before it charged with an offense or a crime for such time and upon such conditions as it deems proper\u201d). Furthermore, \u201c[a] probation condition is enforceable, even if it infringes on a defendant\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights, so long as the condition is \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to the goals of sentencing and probation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>435 Mass. 455, 459 (2001). Those goals include the deterrence of unlawful conduct, the protection of the public, and rehabilitation of the probationer as well as punishment and retribution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 414-415 (1995), cert, denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">At the hearing leading to the revocation of the defendant\u2019s probation and the imposition of further conditions relating to the possession or consumption of alcohol, both the defendant\u2019s attorney and the assistant district attorney agreed that the defendant should enter an anger management program. It was a small step for the judge to add alcohol abstention where anger management counseling was indicated. The judge could reasonably conclude that the consumption of alcohol would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>improve the defendant\u2019s chances of dealing successfully with his problems with anger and violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The connection between anger, violence, and alcohol consumption in a person who has demonstrated a violent disposition that is hard for him to control is not speculative or unreasonable. It is a circumstance that most any trial judge in a busy District Court will undoubtedly encounter with some frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Although the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages is lawful for an adult, a judge may impose conditions on otherwise lawful conduct in order to further the many purposes of helping the probationer to adjust his conduct \u2014 not just to avoid breaking the law but to improve his ability to control his anger and violent behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>435 Mass. at 459-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The special condition of the defendant\u2019s probation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-20\"> We take judicial notice that defendant has been convicted on the two substantive criminal offenses which formed the basis of the judge\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to revoke his probation, and thus his appeal of the claimed procedural misstep of the judge (failure to make written findings) is moot. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 475 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> We note that it would he helpful for the judge to articulate his reasons for imposing this type of condition. We also note that defendant\u2019s counsel did not voice any objection to the condition when it was imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
