Proulx, purchased two pieces of property in Boxford (shown as lots 4 and 4.1 on the attached plan). A right of way (shown as the \u201cwood road\u201d on the plan) had been established by deeds in the chain of title for the benefit of easterly adjoining lot 3. Proulx thereafter fenced off the wood road and rendered it impassible from the public way outlet, Lily Pond Road. He improved and used as his access from the public way a \u201cgravel driveway\u201d located east of and roughly parallel to the wood road. By the time the appellant, Steven J. D\u2019Urso, acquired lot 3 in 1990, the wood road was inaccessible to his lot by virtue of the fencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Proulx had erected. D\u2019Urso, too, thereafter used and improved the gravel driveway to enter and exit his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The eventual development of contention between these neighbors led Proulx in 1999 to seek a declaration from the Land Court, pursuant to G. L. cc. 240 and 231 A, of the parties\u2019 respective rights in the wood road and the gravel driveway. D\u2019Urso answered, claiming the wood road as his rightful easement and counterclaiming for damages on account of Proulx\u2019s having \u201cwrongfully deprive[d]\u201d him of his rights thereto and on account of Proulx\u2019s allegedly unfair and deceptive conduct in blocking his access to the wood road and \u201cspreading debris [thereon] ... to camouflage its existence.\u201d A trial resulted in the dismissal of those counterclaims and a declaration that D\u2019Urso had abandoned the easement over the wood road or, alternatively, had effectively agreed to the relocation of his easement to the gravel driveway. We agree with the judge\u2019s alternative holding and his dismissal of the counterclaims and, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">1. <em>Material background. </em>The following factual findings by the judge are supported by the record and have not been challenged as clearly erroneous. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). Across Proulx\u2019s lots 4 and 4.1, together constituting 14 Lily Pond Road, there existed at the time of his 1972 purchase a right of way on the surface of the earth called the wood road, which provided access to and from Lily Pond Road for both Proulx\u2019s property and lot 3, known as 22 Lily Pond Road. An easement in the wood road had been granted by deed to D\u2019Urso\u2019s predecessors in title.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The wood road was little more than an ungraded series of car tracks. At various places in the wood road Proulx dumped leaves, obscuring the tracks by covering low-lying and washed-out areas. Utility poles serving the properties had earlier been erected along the wood road.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">By the time D\u2019Urso acquired 22 Lily Pond Road \u2014 having been informed by his grantor that his access was over the wood road \u2014 Proulx had erected a fence over almost the entire front<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>age of his property bordering Lily Pond Road. The fence blocked entrance to or exit from the wood road and left as the sole means of access to D\u2019Urso\u2019s property from the public way a hard-packed path east of the wood road called the gravel driveway, which Proulx had not fenced off and which he used as his access. Over the years Proulx had improved the gravel driveway by clearing it of vegetation, adding fill, and grading it. Just after D\u2019Urso acquired lot 3, Proulx installed another fence along the boundary fine of their two neighboring properties, lots 4.1 and 3, thereby cutting off D\u2019Urso\u2019s access to the wood road from any part of his lot. D\u2019Urso never objected to either the fence that blocked his access to the wood road from the public way or the placement of the fence at the border of the two properties. Nor did he ever express to Proulx any concern over his inability to use the wood road to reach his property from the public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Indeed, subsequent to his purchase of 22 Lily Pond Road, D\u2019Urso not only further rendered the wood road inaccessible by placing a large bush in its center where it crossed from Proulx\u2019s lot to his and by planting trees across it where it passed from his lot to lot 2, east of lot 3, but also made substantial improvements to the gravel driveway\u2019s condition on his own behalf by adding as many as ten truckloads of fill material, grading it, widening it, and making it more passable. He conceded that he considered the gravel driveway to be his \u201cprincipal\u201d access to his property (although the judge found that D\u2019Urso did not in fact use and had never used the wood road or any other way for such access). D\u2019Urso had desired to improve the gravel driveway even further by \u201chot-topping\u201d it, but his proposal to do so was opposed by Proulx, who wanted it to remain a hard-packed \u201ccountry road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The judge noted that D\u2019Urso\u2019s neighbor on the easterly side of his property, one Madden, had never seen D\u2019Urso use the wood road except for one occasion, when he saw D\u2019Urso venture onto it to take photographs shortly after the commencement of this litigation. Madden also testified that, as noted above, D\u2019Urso had planted a row of hemlocks across the boundary of their adjoining lots so as to prevent any travel along the wood road at the point where it crossed into Madden\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Sometime in the 1990\u2019s, the utility poles along the wood road were condemned and had to be relocated. Proulx removed them and had the new ones placed alongside the gravel driveway, paying $800 to have a pole that had not been condemned replaced there as well. Proulx also removed a utility pole from D\u2019Urso\u2019s property during this time, at D\u2019Urso\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In 1996, the parties discussed the possibility of D\u2019Urso purchasing part of Proulx\u2019s property adjoining his lot 3. When it appeared to D\u2019Urso to be \u201ca done deal,\u201d he temporarily took down the fence blocking entrance onto the wood road at the common boundary of the properties. The deal was never consummated, however, because D\u2019Urso did not want to allow Madden to use the wood road, a condition of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Without deciding whether D\u2019Urso is correct in asserting that the judge\u2019s unchallenged subsidiary findings do not support the ultimate finding of D\u2019Urso\u2019s abandonment of the wood road easement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we nevertheless agree with Proulx that the findings in any event support the judge\u2019s alternative basis for the judgment; namely, that D\u2019Urso \u201cby his actions acquiesced in the change in location,\u201d and by his conduct \u201caccepted\u201d \u2014 i.e., implicitly agreed to \u2014 the easement\u2019s relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The owner of a servient estate in Massachusetts may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>unilaterally alter or move a dominant owner\u2019s easement actually located on the ground. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>DeVries, </em>326 Mass. 127, 132 (1950), and cases cited. However, the original easement may be deemed relocated when the conduct of the parties is such as to permit a conclusion that a different easement had \u201cbeen substituted for the way mentioned in the deeds\u201d because the evidence reflects \u201ca tacit understanding or an implied agreement,\u201d manifested by the dominant owner\u2019s \u201cacquiescence\u201d in the use of the different easement in lieu of the original for a number of years. <em>Id. </em>at 132-133. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Sikes, </em>254 Mass. 540, 546-547 (1926); <em>Desotell </em>v. <em>Szczygiel, </em>338 Mass. 153, 158 (1958) (involving acquiescence in and use of relocated way for only six years).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The present case appears an even stronger one than in previous situations for upholding the finding of an implicitly agreed relocation of the easement. The facts found by the judge reveal not merely passive acquiescence on the part of the dominant owner (D\u2019Urso) in the acts of the servient owner (Proulx) in blockading and degrading to a state of impassability the original easement (the wood road), despite the dominant owner\u2019s knowledge (and explicit notice from his predecessor in title) of his right to pass and repass over the wood road; more significantly, they demonstrate the dominant owner\u2019s affirmative and willing participation in the relocation process by further obstructing the original easement, actively improving the alternative right of way for his own benefit, and using that way as his exclusive access to and from his property for a decade. On this record and the authorities just cited, the trial judge did not err in finding that D\u2019Urso had by his actions \u201cacquiesced in\u201d and \u201caccepted\u201d the change of location of the easement to the gravel driveway. Because D\u2019Urso thereby suffered no wrongful deprivation of any rights, the judge correctly dismissed his claim for damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> The parties did not contest that an easement burdened Proulx\u2019s property for the benefit of the owner of lot 3; rather, they disputed its location and, alternatively, whether the easement had been abandoned or moved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> We note, however, that, while the burden on the owner of a servient estate to establish an intent to abandon an easement by the owner of the dominant estate is heavy \u2014 mere nonuse is insufficient and the latter\u2019s acts must clearly manifest such an intention, <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>253 Mass. 555, 561-562 (1925) \u2014 that rigorous standard is not insurmountable. Any deliberate conduct on the part of the dominant owner inconsistent with the continued existence of the easement may operate as abandonment, which has been found in a number of cases not substantially dissimilar to this one. See, e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>140 Mass. 254, 255-256 (1885); <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>281 Mass. 484, 492 (1933); <em>Sindler </em>v. <em>William M. Bailey Co., </em>348 Mass. 589, 592-593 (1965); <em>Lasell College </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 390-391 (1992). Cf. <em>Yagjian </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 735-736 (1985) (servient owner\u2019s erection of fence preventing passage over easement is actionable unprivileged interference with dominant owner\u2019s rights that can lead to extinguishment of easement unless facts indicate latter\u2019s permission). Contrast <em>Lemieux </em>v. <em>Rex Leather Finishing Corp., 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 417, 421 (1979) (dominant owner prevented inference of intent to abandon easement, blocked by gates installed by servient owner except during business hours for commercial purposes, by symbolic act of driving vehicle over way at least once each year).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> At oral argument, D\u2019Urso withdrew his challenge to the correct ruling by the judge (who had been designated a Superior Court judge for the purpose of deciding the count alleging unfair and deceptive practices) that no violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, could have occurred because Proulx was not engaged in the conduct of any \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
