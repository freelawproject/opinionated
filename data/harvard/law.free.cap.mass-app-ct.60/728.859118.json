L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14. After a bench trial on the petition, a Superior Court judge found that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person who would likely engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility. The defendant argues on appeal that his trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>was ineffective in failing to keep evidence that he claims was inadmissible from the judge who, in turn, relied upon it in reaching his decision. He also argues that the judge erroneously relied upon grand jury minutes that he had previously excluded from evidence. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims, even if correct, do not entitle him to a new trial, and we affirm the judgment committing him to the treatment center.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">1. <em>The evidence. </em>In finding and concluding that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person, the trial judge had before him the testimony of four qualified examiners as well as their reports, a 1992 report prepared by the Department of Social Services (DSS) concerning its investigation into allegations of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of John, and police reports setting out the results of their investigations into the rapes of Jane and John. The DSS and police reports, as well as disciplinary reports from the Department of Correction (DOC), were also made available to the examiners, who referred to the contents of those reports in both their testimony and reports. Also, at least two of the examiners had been provided with minutes of the grand jury proceedings that gave rise to the indictments upon which the defendant had been convicted and sentenced in 1992 and 1996. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(\u00bf&gt;). Although the grand jury minutes were excluded from evidence, they were marked for identification and made part of the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">2. <em>The claims. </em>The defendant makes two arguments. First, he claims his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination of his expert witness concerning the contents of the DSS report, for withdrawing his objection to the admission of the DSS report, and for failing to seek redaction of references to the DSS report contained in the examiners\u2019 reports. The defendant\u2019s second argument is that the judge, in reaching his decision, relied upon information set out in the grand jury minutes which he had excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">More specifically, the defendant challenges the following evidence put before the trial judge: (1) statements, set out in the DSS report, made by John\u2019s mother and relating the maternal grandmother\u2019s observations that the defendant would have an erection after holding John in his lap and that she had seen the defendant sit closely with other boys; (2) statements set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the DSS report relating that hospital records noted that John was \u201cpreoccupied with penises\u201d; (3) statements made by the mother to the DSS investigator in which she related that John had violent nightmares and told her that the defendant had touched John\u2019s penis while he was showering; and (4) a police officer\u2019s grand jury testimony in which he related John\u2019s statements to him describing how the defendant had \u201csucked\u201d John\u2019s penis while they were in the shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In his memorandum of decision, the judge described in some detail the \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that had been available to him at the trial and the basis for his conclusion that the defendant would \u201clikely . . . engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d That evidence included information gleaned from the grand jury minutes and the DSS report.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">3. <em>The applicable law. </em>Based upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666 (2003) (parole reports are directly admissible pursuant to the \u201ccatch-all\u201d phrase set out in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14[c]), we have no doubt that DSS reports and grand jury minutes containing information about victims of sexual offenses committed against them by a defendant convicted of those offenses are directly admissible in evidence at trials on petitions brought under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 336-339 (2002) (absent a conviction or adjudication, the complainant is not a victim and police reports and witness statements concerning nol pressed complaints not directly admissible under \u00a7 14[c]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">This conclusion, that DSS reports and grand jury minutes such as those at issue in the instant case are directly admissible in evidence, brings us to the question whether the hearsay statements set out in the DSS report and grand jury minutes that were cited by the judge in reaching his decision were properly considered. We are, again, guided by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 666-667:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u201cWhile \u00a7 14(c) trumps a hearsay objection to the admission of the report, still remaining is the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>hearsay within the report. Traditional rules of evidence apply. When there is hearsay within hearsay it is commonly referred to as totem pole hearsay. ... If there is not an exception for each statement, the hearsay is not admissible substantively, so long as an objection is lodged. However, it may be admissible if used for an alternative purpose, i.e., by an expert in forming his opinion. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 <em>13(b); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 339 (2002).\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">None of the statements contained within the DSS report or the grand jury minutes and challenged on appeal, see part 2 of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. Nor should the reports of the four examiners have been put before the judge without redaction of the facts and data therein contained but neither presented in evidence nor elicited during cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. at 339. Additionally, it appears from the transcript that the Commonwealth\u2019s examiners based their opinions, at least in part and without challenge by the defendant, on the inadmissible facts set out in the DSS report and the grand jury minutes. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531-532 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. at 338-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>We accept the defendant\u2019s claim that it was error for the trial judge to consider the excluded grand jury minutes for any purpose, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>423 Mass. 841, 848 (1996), and we assume without deciding that his trial counsel was ineffective in allowing inadmissible hearsay in the DSS report to be put before the trial judge for his consideration. That is not to say, however, that reversal of the judgment is required. Rather, in considering prejudicial effect we look to see whether the improperly considered grand jury minutes and inadmissible hearsay was cumulative of other significant and admissible evidence considered by the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 172-173, cert, denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 224, 228-229 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Although the trial judge did note in his memorandum of decision that John\u2019s mother told a DSS investigator that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>been told by her mother both that her mother had seen the defendant have an erection after having held John and had seen the defendant sitting closely with other boys, it does not appear from the trial judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that he attached any great significance or weight to that circumstance. Instead, the trial judge heavily relied on the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and information set out in two DOC incident reports made while the defendant was in custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Next, the trial judge considered the defendant\u2019s version of the rapes and the incidents set out in the DOC reports, all as set out by the examiners in their reports and tracked in their testimony at trial. The defendant\u2019s statements to the examiners were made following the warnings given to him pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265, 270 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Having reviewed the trial judge\u2019s memorandum of decision in its entirety and matched it with the admissible evidence presented at trial, we conclude that any reliance by him on inadmissible evidence that might be found in his memorandum of decision was corroborative of the overwhelming and admissible evidence and thus does not require reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from we have said that any reliance by the trial judge on the grand jury minutes was harmless, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 395-396, further appellate review granted, 440 Mass. 1106 (2003), and that any shortcomings on the part of trial counsel did not deprive the defendant of an available and substantial ground of defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-14\"> Jane and John are pseudonyms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> The judge\u2019s decision here was handed down prior to the decisions in <em>Markvart, Boyer, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Given, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 390, further appellate review granted, 440 Mass. 1106 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\"> The defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history involved acts of violence, the use and sale of drugs, and theft, as well as the rapes of Jane and John.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> According to one report, correctional officers prevented the defendant from smuggling five bags of heroin into the institution where he was then confined. The second report involved the defendant\u2019s act of \u201cprohibited\u201d contact with a child who w.as visiting with him at a correctional facility. It appears from that report that the defendant held the twelve year old daughter of his visitor on his lap and massaged her head, shoulders, and back. When the defendant refused to heed warnings that his conduct was \u201cprohibited,\u201d the visit was terminated. Claiming he had done nothing wrong, the defendant protested the end to the visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
