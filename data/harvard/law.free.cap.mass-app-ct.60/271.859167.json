(SOP), alleged that the seller, the defendant Cape South-port Associates, LLC (CSA), had improperly withheld information necessary to calculate the purchase price, and SOP demanded arbitration pursuant to a provision of the purchase and sale agreement. The arbitration was conducted, and an arbitrator concluded that the defendant had accurately calculated the purchase price and that SOP had breached the purchase and sale agreement by failing to tender the purchase price in a timely fashion. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Raymond Bourque, frustrated by the above events in his expectation that he would lend SOP the amount necessary to acquire the property, commenced this action against CSA, asserting both intentional interference with contractual or advantageous relations and violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. A judge of the Superior Court entered summary judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in favor of the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were precluded by the result of the arbitration. The plaintiff appeals, arguing that he should not be bound by the decision in an arbitration in which he was not a party, and that there are genuine issues of material fact that make summary judgment improper. We agree that the arbitration decision does not have preclusive effect on the plaintiff\u2019s claims. However, we conclude that the plaintiff has not offered evidence sufficient to make out either a case of tortious interference or a violation of G. L. c. 93A, and therefore affirm the judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">1. <em>Material facts. </em>Except where otherwise indicated, the following facts gleaned from the record on summary judgment are undisputed. On December 23, 1997, SOP executed an agreement with the defendant, whereby SOP received an option to purchase all of the defendant\u2019s right, title, and interest in a real estate development project on land located in Mashpee. SOP could exercise its option on or before December 31, 1999, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>executing a purchase and sale agreement attached to the option agreement and delivering it, along with a deposit of $1.5 million, to the defendant. On December 30, 1999, Robert Bradley, the principal of SOP, entered into a written agreement with the plaintiff in which the plaintiff agreed to lend SOP and Bradley the $1.5 million deposit required in order to exercise the option. In exchange, SOP agreed to pay the plaintiff interest on the loan and to provide the plaintiff with an opportunity, if he desired, to finance SOP\u2019s purchase of the entire project. On the following day, SOP exercised the option by signing the purchase and sale agreement and delivering it to CSA with a deposit of $1.5 million. The purchase and sale agreement established a closing date of January 31, 2000, and contained a formula for calculating the price SOP would pay for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Following its exercise of the option, SOP asserted that the defendant failed to provide it with sufficient information to determine whether the proposed purchase price was properly calculated according to the formula contained in the purchase and sale agreement. Because of this, Bradley informed the plaintiff that he did not agree with the purchase price, and directed the plaintiff not to advance the closing funds. In addition, SOP demanded arbitration on the subject.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 31, 2000, SOP appeared at the closing without funds; as a result, the defendant retained and claimed the $1.5 million deposit. The plaintiff thereafter commenced this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">2. <em>Issue preclusion. </em>\u201c \u2018Issue preclusion\u2019 . . . prevents relitigation of an issue determined in an earlier action where the same issue arises in a later action, based on a different claim, between the same parties or their privies.\u201d <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23 n.2 (1988). See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). It differs from \u201cclaim preclusion,\u201d which \u201cprohibits the maintenance of an action based on the same claim that was the subject of an earlier action between the same parties or their privies.\u201d <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, supra. </em>Here, the judge treated the defense as one of \u201cclaim preclusion,\u201d apparently determining that the result of the arbitration, favorable to the defendant, banned all subsequent claims by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>SOP or its privies that turned on an allegation that the defendant had breached the purchase and sale agreement or any implied covenant thereof. It may be that the doctrine of \u201cissue preclusion\u201d is more applicable, given that the plaintiff\u2019s claims for tortious interference and violation of G. L. c. 93A are conceptually different from the claims for breach of contract, including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, asserted by SOP in the arbitration. The distinction, however, is not determinative in the present case. By whatever avenue, the judge ruled that the arbitrator\u2019s decision in favor of CSA on SOP\u2019s contract claims was binding on the plaintiff as privy of SOP, and it is that decision that we review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Preclusive effect is not limited to court proceedings; it arises in the same manner from arbitrations. See <em>TLT Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>A. Anthony Tappe &amp; Assocs., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4-10 (1999); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 84. One who is not a party to the arbitration may use the arbitration award to bind his adversary in a later proceeding if, inter alla, that adversary or his privy was a party to the arbitration and had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 37 (1987). The question in the present case is whether the result of an arbitration may have preclusive effect against, as well as in favor of, a nonparty to the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">For preclusive effect to flow from a prior judgment, the party against whom preclusive effect is asserted must have been either a party in the prior case or in privity with a party. See <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>428 Mass. 138, 142 (1998) (issue preclusion, where the party against whom preclusion is asserted was a party, or in privity with a party, to the prior adjudication); <em>Gloucester Marine Rys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Charles Parisi, Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 390 (1994) (claim preclusion, in which there must be \u201cidentity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions\u201d). The examination essentially reduces itself to an inquiry whether the party against whom preclusion is asserted participated in the prior proceeding, either himself or by a representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">There may be a finding of privity between SOP and the plaintiff if the plaintiff, the party in the present action, exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201csubstantial control\u201d over SOP in the prior action. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 39. While there exists \u201cno bright-line test for gouging substantial control,\u201d the evidence must show that the party to the present action \u201cpossessed effective control over a party\u2019s conduct of the earlier litigation as measured from a practical, as opposed to a purely theoretical, standpoint.\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Banco Central Corp., </em>27 F.3d 751, 759 (1st Cir. 1994) (plaintiffs in a later litigation did not exert substantial control over the plaintiffs in an earlier litigation despite the fact that the two proceedings involved overlapping claims arising out of the same acts of the defendant, the two sets of plaintiffs had the same legal representation, and the two sets of plaintiffs intentionally used some of the same discovered materials in the respective proceedings). In this case, the defendant has offered no evidence that suggests that the plaintiff exercised any control over SOP in the arbitration proceedings. It follows that no privity for purposes of issue preclusion can be based, in this case, on the substantial control doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The fact that the plaintiff and SOP shared an interest in proving or disproving some of the same facts does not establish that privity existed between them for purposes of issue preclusion. See <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn. </em>v. <em>Norrington, </em>395 Mass. 751, 754 (1985) (finding in a criminal case that the insured intended to cause the victim\u2019s death did not preclude a nonparty\u2019s right to prove in a later coverage action that the insured did not intend the victim\u2019s death). Nor is the contractual relationship that existed between the plaintiff and SOP enough by itself to create privity between them for issue preclusion purposes. <em>Mongeau </em>v. <em>Boutelle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 249-250 (1980) (real estate purchaser\u2019s prior action against the sellers did not preclude the purchaser\u2019s later action against the broker, despite the fact that a contractual relationship existed between the sellers and the broker).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The defendant argues that the plaintiff is precluded from bringing the action at issue because he was \u201cvirtually represented\u201d by SOP in the arbitration proceedings. While the judge did not base his decision in the defendant\u2019s favor on this theory, the defendant asserts the principle as an alternative basis on which to uphold the decision below. Massachusetts courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>have indeed applied the doctrine of virtual representation in various contexts. See, e.g., <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 724, 735 n.8 (1994); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 158-159 (1979). This case, however, lacks those features that have been present in cases where virtual representation has been applied. See <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jamaica Plain Co-op. Bank, supra, </em>in which one group of mortgagor plaintiffs was determined to have \u201cvirtually represented\u201d another group of mortgagor plaintiffs, where the latter group allowed their case to be subsumed in the former plaintiffs\u2019 prior \u201cpilot\u201d case, thus casting their lot with the former plaintiffs as to litigation of all liability issues presented, finally determined, and essential to judgment in the pilot case. See also Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 41. The burden of proving that SOP virtually represented the plaintiff in the arbitration proceeding lies with the defendant. See <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Banco Central Corp., supra </em>at 761. Even were the defendant to establish that the plaintiff and SOP had a business relationship; that they shared an interest in showing that it was the defendant who breached the purchase and sale agreement with SOP; and that the plaintiff had notice of the arbitration proceeding, such showings are insufficient to demonstrate that virtual representation took place in the arbitration. Nor did the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s presence at some of the arbitration proceedings bind the plaintiff to the arbitration decision. See <em>Pioneer Insulation &amp; Modernizing Corp. </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>331 Mass. 560, 563 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The contexts in which virtual representation has been recognized differ considerably from the circumstances in the present case. See, e.g., <em>Morganelli </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Canton, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 475, 481-485 (1979). There we concluded that the town building inspector had virtually represented the town citizens\u2019 interests in an earlier action brought to enforce zoning by-laws where the applicable statute dictated that the building inspector enforce the zoning by-laws for the town and that the town citizens first apply to the building inspector to enforce the zoning by-laws on their behalf. Clearly SOP cannot be said to have represented the plaintiff\u2019s interests in the arbitration proceeding in such a fashion; it follows that privity between the plaintiff and SOP cannot be established by virtual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cIt is a violation of due process for a judgment to be binding on a litigant who was not a party or a privy and therefore has never had an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 327 n.7 (1979). Without privity between the party to the prior action and the party to the present action against whom issue preclusion is being sought, issue preclusion is not possible. See <em>Gloucester Marine Rys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Charles Parisi, Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 390. Because no privity between the plaintiff and SOP existed here, either by reason of virtual representation or otherwise, issue preclusion cannot bar the plaintiff\u2019s claims. It is therefore unnecessary to address the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s issues were decided by the arbitrator or were necessary to his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">3. <em>Tortious interference. </em>While we have concluded that the plaintiff is not barred by the result of the arbitration from asserting his tortious interference and G. L. c. 93A claims, it remains to be determined whether the summary judgment record contains sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of either claim to a fact finder. Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 711 (1991); Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). A party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not rest on the allegations contained in his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment where \u201cthe party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra </em>at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">To survive summary judgment on his claim of intentional interference with contractual or advantageous relations, the plaintiff must proffer admissible evidence sufficient to warrant findings that establish \u201c(1) the existence of a contract or a business relationship which contemplated economic benefit; (2) the [defendant\u2019s] knowledge of the contract or business relationship; (3) the [defendant\u2019s] intentional interference with the contract or business relationship for an improper purpose or by improper means; and (4) damages.\u201d <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 397 (1996). See <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 812, 815-817 (1990). See also <em>Melo-Tone Vending, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherry, Inc., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 315, 316 (1995) (emphasizing that improper motive or improper means is a necessary element of tortious interference). Something more than intentional interference is required. See <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, supra </em>at 815-816.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Examining the plaintiff\u2019s showings in opposition to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, we conclude that the plaintiff has no reasonable expectation of proving the essential elements of the tort of intentional interference with contractual or advantageous relations. What the plaintiff seeks to litigate is largely the question whether CSA breached its obligations to SOP under the purchase and sale agreement. In this regard, the plaintiff offers the deposition testimony of SOP\u2019s Robert Bradley that the defendant failed to provide SOP with sufficient information to determine whether the purchase price was accurate, thus bringing about SOP\u2019s failure to close and frustrating the plaintiff\u2019s contractual right to finance SOP\u2019s acquisition. Likewise, Bradley\u2019s testimony that he was \u201cstonewalled\u201d in trying to gain information to determine the accuracy of the purchase price bears on the contention that the defendant breached its contract with SOP. However, the plaintiff has set forth no evidence that the defendant acted as it did for reasons related to the plaintiff\u2019s opportunity to finance SOP\u2019s acquisition if it were consummated. There is no indication that the defendant acted for any purpose other than the protection of its own business interests in its dealings with SOP. That the plaintiff\u2019s business opportunity may have been affected indirectly does not render the defendant\u2019s actions tortious. Accordingly, we are left with no genuine issue of material fact with regard to the claims of intentional interference with contractual or advantageous relations, and summary judgment for the defendant on those claims was appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> rThe defendant had filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> As indicated above, the arbitrator ultimately found in favor of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Because the plaintiffs claim under G.
