DcGoria, and for which they failed to take proper steps to secure the payment from DeGoria whereby the purchase price was wholly lost. The duties of the agents were clearly set forth in a written contract. It was the duty of the jury, under proper instructions to find, first, whether the agents made the sale, and if so, whether they did or did not perform their duty in substantial accordance with their contract, for it alone measured and determined their duties, and whether they exceeded or fell short of ordinary care and caution was not material. As the court below in the instructions as to the agents\u2019 liability made it depend upon whether they used ordinary care, the case is reversed.</summary><p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_50\" pgmap=\"652\">Judge below, J.
