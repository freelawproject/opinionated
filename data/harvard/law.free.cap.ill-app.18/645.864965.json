It does not appear from the certificate of the clerk, that the transcript is a perfect and complete copy of the record. There appears indorsed upon the writ of error, a statement by the clerk that, as his return to said writ, he attached thereto a certified copy of the record and proceedings in the cause, but on examining the clerk\u2019s certificate to the document attached, the court finds that it entirely fails to c.-rtify that the papers to which it refers, constitute the whole or any part of the record in this cause. The court is not informed and can not judicially know from such certificate that there may not have been a proper replication on file at the date of the trial, and that such replication may not be now among the files. In the absence of anything in the record conclusively showing the contrary, the recital in the j udgmont order that the issues were then joined must prevail, and it must accordingly be assumed as a fact affirmatively shown by the record, that a replication had been filed.</summary><p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"Ay2\" pgmap=\"642\">Judge below, Elliott Anthony.</p><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AtQ\" pgmap=\"642\">Attorneys, for plaintiff in error, Hr.
