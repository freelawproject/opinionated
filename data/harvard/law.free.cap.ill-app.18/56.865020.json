The jurisdiction of the whole subject is in the County Court of Sangamon county. The whole matter is so fully and clearly discussed in the cases of Freydendall v. Baldwin, 103 Ill. 325, and Hanchett v. Waterbury, Legal News of August 15, 1885, that for us to do more than call attention to those cases would be a work of supererogation. See also Mersinger v. Yager, 16 Bradwell, 260.</p> <p id=\"b53-5\" pgmap=\"53\">We are therefore of opinion that the circuit court committed no error in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill.</p> <p id=\"b53-6\" pgmap=\"53\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
