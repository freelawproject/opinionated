On Dec. 12, 1884, defendant Mewark Lax filed a plea of non est faatvmb sworn to, and upon trial a verdict was found for the defendants, and judgment rendered against plaintiff for costs.. From all the evidence in relation to the genuineness of the signature of \u00a1Newark Lax upon the note, the court is of opinion the jury were fully justified in finding his signature thereto a forgery, and it follows as a necessary consequence that the whole case fails, and errors in other branches of the case are immaterial.</summary><disposition data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ACG\" pgmap=\"651\">Judgment affirmed.</disposition><p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A-_6\" pgmap=\"651\">Judge below, Cyrus Epler.</p><attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Apx\" pgmap=\"651\">Attorneys, for appellant, \u00a1Messrs.
