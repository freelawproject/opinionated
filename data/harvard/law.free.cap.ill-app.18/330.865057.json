Henry M. Shepard, Judge, presiding.</summary><decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Af2\" pgmap=\"327\">Opinion filed February 17, 1886.</decisiondate><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">This was a bill in chancery, filed by appellee, the wife, against appellant, January 24, 1885, for a divorce upon the grounds of extreme and repeated cruelty and adultery on the part of defendant, the husband. The bill was not supported by the oath of the complainant and expressly waived the oath of defendant to the answer. The defendant filed his answer January 31, 1885, specifically denying the several charges in the bill, to which replication was filed February 26, 1885. The court, upon application of the complainant and notice to defendant, made an order that defendant forthwith pay to complainant as temporary alimony for her and her minor daughter, up to March 2, 1885, the sum of $300, and also that he pay her until the further order of the court, the sum of $200 per month for the support of complainant and said daughter, payable on the second and seventeenth days of each month in advance, commencing on the 2d day of March, 1885, and that lie pay to her solicitors the sum of $250 on account of solicitors\u2019 fees. July 2, 1885, on motion of complainant\u2019s solicitor, the court ordered that defendant pay to complainant the sum of $200 as special alimony, within ten days from that date. July 22, 1885, on motion of complainant\u2019s solicitors, the court entered an order to the effect that said order of July 2, 1885, requiring defendant to pay $200 within ten days of that date, be amended so as to provide that the said allowance shall be taken into consideration by the court on account of any allowance that may hereafter be applied for and allowed for solicitors\u2019 fees and otherwise. From said two last mentioned orders the defendant appealed to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327(34) 328(25)\">It does not appear from the record that the court below made any inquiry into the cause or circumstances of the separation of the parties, or that there was any proof tending to show \u00e1 probable cause for the suit; and it appears that the defendant denied under oath the several charges set out in the bill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\" pgmap=\"328\">Messrs.

The legislature has left the allowance of both to the sound discretion of the court before which the suit is instituted.</p> <p id=\"b328-9\" pgmap=\"328(87) 329(67)\">\u2022We are of opinion that a sound legal discretion was not exercised in making the several orders in question. The charges in the bill were specifically denied by the defendant upon his oath, and the court instituted no inquiry into the circumstances or causes of the separation of the parties, or required any proof whatever that there was probable cause for bringing the suit. Worden v. Worden, 3 Edw. Ch. 408 ; Jones v. Jones, 2 Barb. Ch. 146; Carpenter v. Carpenter, 19 How. Pr. R. 539. In Jenkins v. Jenkins, 91 Ill. 167, a general rule was announced as follows: \u201c Where a bill is pending for divorce and the wife is without means to prosecute her suit, and it appears to the court that complainant has a probable ground for divorce, it has always been regarded proper for the court to enter [an order requiring the defendant to pay solicitors\u2019 fees.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b329-4\" pgmap=\"329\">As to the temporary alimony, the condition upon which the statute authorizes it to be allowed is, that it is just and equitable that it should be allowed. To hold that the mere filing by the wife of a bill for a divorce, and a showing of facilities or pecuniary means of the husband sufficient to justify large and frequent allowances, as in this case, is all that is required, would be to give the most direct encouragement to vain and extravagant wives of husbands possessed of means, to resort to bills of divorce without any just or probable cause, and thus rupture family relations which might otherwise have been preserved unbroken.</p> <p id=\"b329-5\" pgmap=\"329\">The total absence of any evidence of probable cause for this suit, the large amounts applied for, the frequency of the applications, as well as the objects for which they were made, tend to raise a strong suspicion of want of good faith in bringing the suit. The appellee invoked the summary power of the court to raise money for the purpose of paying a special assessment upon her own separate property, to defend herself in a slander suit, with which her husband was in no wise connected, and to carry out plans for visiting the White mountains and seashore, under the pretense that it was necessary to the health of the daughter. We say pretense because it was conclusively shown that the daughter, being afflicted with heart, and spinal affections, both the White mountains and seashore resorts were the very places she should avoid; that quiet places in the rural districts of this and the State of Wisconsin, where she could live at a comparatively moderate expense, W\u2019ould be far more beneficial for the invalid daughter, if not for the mother.</p> <p id=\"b329-6\" pgmap=\"329\">For the reasons stated the two orders appealed from will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329\">Orders reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
