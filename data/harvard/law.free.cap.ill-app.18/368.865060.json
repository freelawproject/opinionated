Sherman and George 0. Sherman were nominated in said will as executors. Hov. 15,1870, said will was admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued to said executors. Joshua L. Marsh, who was named in the will as the trustee of the Sherman House property, accepted the trust; and said Sherman House having been destroyed by the great fire of October 8, 1871, he proceeded to borrow money on the real estate and rebuild the house. But July 23, 1875, said Marsh having resigned his trust, one George Taylor was, by the decree of the County Court of Cook county, appointed trustee in place of said Marsh; accepted, entered upon and continued in the performance of the duties of said trust, until August 15, 1881, when he deceased, leaving a wife and infant-children. Electa, the widow of testator, and said George C. Sherman both died, the latter leaving no widow or issue. Francis T. Sherman and Martha S. Marsh aforesaid, were the only surviving children of said testator. But said Martha S. Marsh had two children living, viz., Ida Sherman and Edwin Sherman, and said Francis T. Sherman had four children living, to wit, Frances Ella, who was the wife of *Eben J. \u25a0Marsh, Lulu M., the wife of F. J. Aldrich, Francis C. Sherman and Eaton G. Sherman.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">After the decease of said Taylor, and September 2, 1881, the said Martha S. Marsh filed a petition in the nature of a bill in chancery, in said county court mentioned in said will, setting out said will, the resignation of said Joshua L. Marsh as trustee, the appointment of said George Taylor as his successor, the death of the latter, the situation of 'the trust estate, etc., and with prayer for summons, specific relief, and for general relief. All the beneficiaries were named as defendants, several being infants. A summons in the usual form in chancery was issued, directed' to the sheriff, and by him served on the infants and all defendants found who had not appeared. Guardian ad lAtem, was appointed by the court for the infant defendants, and such proceedings were had in the cause, that the court, finding all the material facts in the petition to he true, caused a decree to be entered appointing Henry W. Le-man as trustee, upon condition that he execute and .file a bond with the clerk of said court in the penal sum of $50,000, and as successor to said George Taylor, deceased, to take charge of, manage and control said Sherman House property, with all the powers given by said will to said original trustee, Joshua L. Marsh; and that the title to said property be vested in said Leman as such successor in trust.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\" pgmap=\"369\">Said Leman qualified by giving tlie required bond, and entered upon the duties of the trust.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">The service of said chancery summons was the only notice to the infant beneficiaries. There was no conveyance by Joshua L. Marsh, the trustee named in the will, to said George Taylor, who was appointed as his successor by said county court as aforesaid, July 5,1883; the above named Edwin Sherman, son of said Francis T. Sherman, a grandson of the testator and one of the beneficiaries under the will, and who was a minor at the time of said appointment of said Leman, brought this bill in the Cook County Circuit Court, setting forth the foregoing and other facts, making all the other beneficiaries under said will parties defendant, as well as certain creditors who had loaned money to the trust estate, also said Joshua L. Marsh and the heirs of said George Taylor-, deceased, for the purpose of having said circuit court determine whether or not the power purporting to have been given to the County Court of Cook county to appoint a new trustee was valid, the latter court having no chancery jurisdiction or authority given by law to act in such a case; whether, if valid, the power was well executed by the proceedings had in that behalf; also for the removal of said Henry W. Leman as such trustee, for reasons stated, and the appointment of another, and for general relief. U pon a hearing upon pleadings and proofs, the court below found that the said power of appointment of a new trustee, purporting to have been given by said will' to said county court, was invalid for the reason that said court was vested with no authority given by the law to act in such a ease; that therefore the supposed appointment of said Henry W. Leman was void, wherefore the court appointed a new trustee in place of said Leman, Hugh A. White, Esq., who duly qualified. Leman appealed from said decree to this court, and is the only party who has assigned error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">Mr. James S.

The question, therefore, arises and is directly involved in this case, whether the supposed power in question was a valid power, or in other words, whether it is competent for a private individual to confer any power upon a court as such, over any subject-matter, as to which the law has conferred no power or jurisdiction. It is a familiar rule, and one as to which all the authorities agree, that consent can never give to a court jurisdiction of the subject-matter. That must be given by the law, or it does not exist. So, it must follow, that it is not in the power of a testator to confer upon a judicial tribunal a jurisdiction which is not conferred by law. Shaw v. Paine, 12 Allen, 296. In that ease the power was given to an individual described as the judge of probate for the time being, like the case of Pool v. Potter, 63 Ill. 533.</p> <p id=\"b371-5\" pgmap=\"371(201) 372(25)\">In Morrison v. Kelly, 32 Ill. 610, the deed of trust gave the power of appointing a new trustee to the court of chancery, as a court. That court having full jurisdiction over the subject-matter, the power was held to be valid. Mr. Justice Walker, in delivering the opinion of the court, used this language : a It will not be contested that a grantor conveying to a trastee, may confer a power upon an officer, as the chief executive of the State, a circuit judge, a probate judge, or upon any court of record, the power to appoint a trustee, in the event of the death of the trustee named in the deed.\u201d That expression \u201c any court of record,\u201d is invoked by appellant\u2019s counsel as authority for holding the power as properly conferred by the testator upon the county court in this case. The case in which the learned judge used the expression, was one wdiere the court, in which the power was conferred, had jurisdiction of the subject-matter given it by the law. The observation was wholly impertinent and unnecessary as regarded that ease, and is, for that reason, not of binding authority. With all deference to the learning and ability of the judge who made it, we think, upon principle, it can not be the law.</p> <p id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Every question of this nature ought to be susceptible of solution, upon some elementary grounds. The very great pressure of business to which we are subject, and the necessity for a speedy decision by this court, have prevented us from making the thorough investigation which the importance of the question demands, and, if this were a court of last resort, it ought to receive at our hands.</p> <p id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372\">It is apparent from the early discussions as to who may properly be the donee of a power, and when the power was valid, that such donee, was regarded in the same light asan attorney in fact, or an agent. Thus in Hearle v. Greenback, 3 Atk. 675, the question was in what cases, if any, a valid power of appointment could be conferred upon an infant. The arguments of counsel are very instructive. Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, as was usual with him, brought the case down to elementary principles, and held, that an infant could not exercise a power which involved prudence or discretion, before he arrived at years of discretion; that where a testator, by will, provided for the execution of a power by an infant and the power was coupled with an interest, it was void, because no private person could give to such infant a capacity which the law denied. S. C. 1 Ves. Sen. 298; Co. Litt. 52 a.</p> <p id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">It is, however, the settled law, that a mere naked or collateral power may be conferred upon an infant, because the law recognizes in him after arriving at years of discretion, a natural competency. But an idiot, lunatic or other person otherwise non compos mentis, can not do any act as an agent or attorney binding upon the principal; because they have not any legal discretion or understanding to bestow on the affairs of others, any more than upon their own. Story on Ag. \u00a7 7.</p> <p id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372(59) 373(33)\">Kent, Vol. 4, p. 325, says : \u201cEvery person capable of disposing of an estate actually vested in himself, may exercise a power, or direct a conveyance of the land. The rule goes farther, and even allows an infant to execute a power simply collateral, and that only.\u201d In the execution of a naked, or collateral power, the law recognizes no want of legal capacity. But when he undertakes to exercise a power coupled with an interest, there being a want of legal capacity, the power is void.</p> <p id=\"b373-4\" pgmap=\"373\">The appointment of a new trustee in a case like that in hand, necessarily involves the exercise of prudence and legal discretion.</p> <p id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">The reason why a person non compos mentis can not exercise a power is, that not possessing a natural and therefore not a legal capacity, he is incapable of exercising a legal discretion. The reason why an infant can not exercise a power coupled with an interest is the want of legal capacity to do the particular thing, and the law denying him such capacity it is not in the power of a testator to confer it by any words he may write in his will.</p> <p id=\"AXK\" pgmap=\"373\">We can readily comprehend the reason why a court of chancery can exercise a power created by a deed or will. The law has conferred upon such court full and complete jurisdiction over the subject-matter. It is thereby endowed with a faculty or capacity for the exercise of a legal discretion as respects that subject-matter. But we can -not understand how, upon any known elementary principles, a court which is clothed by the law with no power, authority or jurisdiction, with reference to or over the subject-matter of a power, can be said to possess any faculty or capacity for the exercise of a legal discretion in respect to that subject-matter; because a court is purely the creature of law. It is an institution of the law. It possesses no natural faculties, and its legal capacity is such only as the law has given to it. If, therefore, the law had not conferred upon the county court a legal faculty or capacity for the exercise of a legal discretion in such a case as this was, it is entirely clear that it had none because the testator could confer none by his will. That the law had given the county court no jurisdiction or authority in such a case is not only not questioned but expressly conceded by appellant\u2019s counsel.</p> <p id=\"b373-7\" pgmap=\"373(22) 374(76)\">It follows from these views that we agree with the chancellor who decided the case below, that the county court having no jurisdiction by law, of the proceedings to appoint appellant, those proceedings were void and the appointment not valid. The nature of the trusts, the great value of the property, the circumstances, all conspire to render it eminently proper to resort to a court of chancery to make a new appointment, establish title and secure the complete execution of the trusts. Hill on Trustees, 4 Am. Ed. 298, 302, *190 et seq.</p> <p id=\"b374-5\" pgmap=\"374\">But aside from the position that the decree below was wrong, appellant\u2019s counsel insist that' the chancellor should have appointed appellant as trustee. The decree operates as a vindication of the motives and conduct of appellant, while acting as trustee under the proceedings of the county court; but we can discover nothing in the circumstances which clothed him with any superior, equitable right to appointment by the chancellor. The trusts were created for the benefit of those named as beneficiaries, and not for the benefit of any person as trustee. Besides, the law has confided the matter of choosing and appointing trustees- in such cases to the sound discretion of the chancellor. Unless there is a palpable abuse of such discretion, an appellate court can not interfere. We perceive no evidence of abuse. The person appointed is a reputable member of the bar, possessed of excellent business- qualifications-lie was acceptable to all-the adult beneficiaries save one only, and appellant was acceptable to none but that one. We think the decree below should be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b374-6\" pgmap=\"374\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
