Lieb v. Abraham Lichtenstein.</parties><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASX\" pgmap=\"643\">An action on two promissory notes executed in the State of Indiana by a husband and wife. The plaintiff originally brought suit against the husband and wife, but dismissed as to the husband. The plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment against the wife for the amount appearing to be due on said notes. The principal controversy was upon the question whether the stock of goods 'for which the notes were given was purchased by the wife as her separate personal estate, and to be employed by her in carrying on her separate trade and business, or- whether the sale was really and in fact to her husband. On this question the evidence was conflicting. The jury have given credence to the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and the court can not say that their verdict is not sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. Judgment affirmed.</summary><p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AIfi\" pgmap=\"643\">Judge below, Sidney Smith.</p><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AjYf\" pgmap=\"643\">Attorneys, for plaintiff in error, Messrs.
