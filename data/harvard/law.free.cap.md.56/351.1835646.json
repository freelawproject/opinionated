In cases of such surrender, the Ordinance provides for the sale by the Street Commissioners of so much of the surrendered lot as may not be required for the bed of the street. Under proceedings under this Ordinance for opening a street, the portions of certain surrendered lots, not required for the bed of the street, were sold at public auction by the Street Commissioners. By the terms of sale, the purchaser was to pay the price to be bid at the sale for the lots sold, and <em>so much as should thereafter be assessed upon them for benefits. </em>A purchaser at the sale, having paid the amount assessed for benefits upon the lots purchased by him, sued the city in an action of assumpsit to recover back the money so paid by him, on the ground of defects existing in the title to the lots sold to him. The alleged defect in the title to one of the lots, was that some of the joint owners thereof were infants, and could not assent to the surrender, and that their guardian had no power to make such surrender; and as to one other lot the alleged defect was that the owner did not in fact make the required surrender. Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b365-6\">1st. That as the surrender contemplated by the Ordinance was equivalent to a sale, or at least a contract for a sale, no one who was not <em>sui </em>juris, could in law be capable of making it; and there was no power conferred by law upon the guardian of an infant, to ' act for or bind his ward in making such a disposition of his estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>2nd. That as some of the joint owners were under legal disability to consent or agree to the surrender of their estate, and there was no one capable in law to act for or bind them, the ju\u2019oceeding was invalid to authorize the sale of the property in which they had an interest, by the city.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-5\">8rd.

That the purchaser took a defective title as to all of the lots so bought by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-7\">5th. That the money paid by the purchaser for benefits, was not to be regarded as an {assessment or tax, the voluntary payment of which would preclude the right to recover it back, but under the facts and circumstances of the case stood on the footing of purchase money; it being paid because the purchaser stipulated to pay as a part of the contract price, in addition to the sum bid at the sale, the amount which should thereafter be assessed as benefits.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-8\">6th. That the payment being on account of a purchase of real estate, the title to which failed, owing to the want of power in the vendor to make good its contract, and to convey a perfect title, and the consideration consequently failing, the right to recover back the money so paid was well settled upon principle and authority.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-9\">7th.

If more land is taken in any case than is required for the bed of the street, it is always done with the consent of the owner, to whom the option is given of retaining the fragment of a lot, when part is taken hy the city, or of claiming compensation for the whole, and allowing the part not taken, to be sold for the benefit of the parties charged with the cost of the improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Here then, we see the validity of the proceeding is made to depend upon the consent of, and surrender by the owner. As we find, therefore, in the case before us, that some of the owners of the Carroll property were under legal disability to consent or agree to the surrender, (which was equivalent to a sale) of their estate, and that there was no one capable in law to act for or bind them, we must hold that the proceeding was invalid to authorize the sale of that property by the city. In like manner, as to the Murray lot, the owner not having in fact made the surrender which was a condition precedent to the exercise of the power to take and sell the property, it is also clear that the proceeding was also without due authority and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The purchaser, therefore, took a defective title as to all the lots so bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The only question then is, can the appellant recover back the amount paid by him for the assessment of benefits made upon the said lots so bought by him <em>?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">If the money so paid is to be treated as an assessment or tax, the voluntary payment would, it is well settled, preclude the right to recover it back. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. vs. Lefferman, 4 G., </em>436; <em>Morris vs. Mayor, &amp;c., </em>5 <em>G., </em>244; <em>Lester vs. Mayor, &amp;c., </em>29 <em>Md., </em>415; <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>566.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">But we do not think this payment stands on such ground. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we consider the money so paid as standing clearly on the footing of purchase money. In the advertisement of sale, it was stated that the purchaser should pay the price to be bid at the sale for the lots sold, <em>and such sum \u00e1s should thereafter be assessed upon them for benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The amount is paid because the purchaser stipulated to pay, as a part of the contract price, in addition to the sum bid at the sale, the amount which should thereafter be assessed as benefits, and hence it must be considered as a part of the purchase money agreed .to be paid for the lots, just as fully as the amount specifically bid a.t the sale. It does not matter that this additional sum was not known at the time of purchase. It was an amount to be definitely fixed, by a certain and defined course of procedure, and according to the maxim, <em>\u201c id certum est quod oertum reddi potest,\u201d </em>there could be no uncertainty about the contract, which thus rendered the purchase money an entirety, though made up of one fixed sum, and another to be thereafter ascertained in a certain and defined mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The payment therefore being on account of the purchase of real estate, the title to which fails owing to the want of power in the vendor to make good its contract, and to convey a perfect title, and the consideration consequently failing, the right to recover back' the money so paid, is well settled upon principle and authority. 2 <em>Addison on Contracts, (3rd Am. Ed.,) sec. </em>533; 1 <em>Suyden on Vendors, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>(Perkins\u2019 Ed.,) </em>251, <em>n. (x.;) Share vs. Webb, </em>1 <em>T.

For the reasons we have given as to the right- of the plaintiff to recover, this ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The second exception embraces the prayers. The plaintiff offered six prayers, all of which were rejected, and the defendant offered one prayer which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer, and his sixth prayer, (except as to the <em>requirement </em>of the allowance of interest, which was a matter of <em>discretion,) </em>correctly and substantially presented the law of the case, according to the principles we have laid down, and ought to have been granted ; and that the prayer of the defendant, which denied the plaintiff\u2019s right to .recover, should have been rejected ; and finding these errors in the rulings of the Court below, it follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
