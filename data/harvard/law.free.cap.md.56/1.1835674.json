improvement, to indicate that those who passed it, judged that the improvement was for the public convenience exclusively, and not for the benefit of the particular district, the presumption is-that they determined that those who were specially assessed, would be specially benefited.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b15-6\">Whether an improvement authorized by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore will benefit the property along the line of such improvement, is a question left exclusively to their judgment, and their determination in the premises is <em>final and conclusive. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Courts have no power to review such determination at the instance of the property owners specially taxed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-5\">If a local assessment imposed for an improvement, directed to be made, should so far transcend the limits of equality and reason, that its execution would cease to be a tax, or contribution to a common burden, and become extortion and confiscation, it would be the duty of the Court in such case to interfere .to protect the citizen.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-6\">An ordinance imposing an assessment upon the owners of adjacent property for the repaving of a street already opened and condemned, is not rendered invalid by failing to make provision for notice of the proceedings under it to such property owners, and to give them an opportunity of being heard before the charges are fully established against them, the imposition of such assessment being an exercise of the taxing power, and not of the right of eminent domain.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-7\">The power to determine when a special assessment shall be made, on what basis it shall be apportioned, over what district it shall extend, and whether the particular improvement will confer a benefit upon property in the immediate locality beyond that which will accrue therefrom to property more remote, or the public generally, is a power confided to the legislative department, to be exercised, subject to such provisions, and under such restrictions only as the law makers may see fit, in each case to prescribe.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-8\">The Oity Commissioner in executing Ordinance No. 68 of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, approved June 26th, 1878, authorizing the repaving of Pratt street between Jones\u2019 Palls and Howard street, applied the correct rule of apportionment by assessing two-thirds of the cost of the improvement upon the property binding on Pratt street, according to the front-foot.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-9\">The Ordinance (No. 68, of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, &amp;c.,) authorized

to a ministerial agent, did not delegate to such officer any power they were not authorized to confer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Appeal from the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">Under Ordinance Ho. 68, of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, approved June 26th, 18*78, authorizing and directing the City Commissioner, to have Pratt street, between Jones\u2019 Falls and Howard street repaved in a specified manner, the City Commissioner proceeded to have the work done. When the expense of the work was ascertained, and it became necessary to provide for it, the City Commissioner charged one-third, under the direction contained in the Ordinance, to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and assessed the remaining two-thirds upon those persons only who were owners of property on Pratt street between the prescribed limits, among whom were the appellees. The City Commissioner in determining the amount which the appellees as such owners, should respectively pay, \u00e1dopted the rule of assessment by the front foot, of property binding on the line of the improvement. The bill in this case was filed by the appellees, who subsequently filed an amended bill. The object of the bill was to restrain by injunction the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and Charles Webb, collector of taxes, from collecting the assessments imposed upon the complainants. A <em>pro forma </em>decree was passed annulling the assessments imposed, and perpetually enjoining the collection of the same. From this decree the respond\u2022ents appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b17-6\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C. J., Miller, .Alvey, Robinson and Irving, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-7\"><em>Thomas W. Hall, City Solicitor, </em>and <em>James L. McLane, \u2022City Counsellor, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">It is conceded that the Act of 18*74, ch. 218, which repeals all former Acts upon the subject, and from which all present powers of the Mayor and City Council, in Regard to the paving, &amp;o., of streets, and the collection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of paving assessments, are derived \u2014 makes absolutely no-provision whatever, for notice of any kind. It' is said, however, that this omission of the Legislature, does not dispense with the necessity of notice in order to warrant the exercise of the powers conferred by this Act, and it is intimated that the omission may be supplied by <em>municipal </em>legislation. The analogy relied upon, however, as being furnished by the requirement <em>(by Act of Legislature) of' </em>previous notice, in order to warrant the passage of Ordinances <em>to open and condemn streets, </em>wholly fails in its application to Ordinances to pave or repave streets-, already opened and condemned, and ip. use as public-highways.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\">The subject-matter of the two classes of Ordinances is. wholly distinct. An Ordinance to condemn private property for the purposes of a street or highway, is an exercise of the power of eminent domain delegated <em>pro hac vice, </em>by the Legislature to the municipality. It is subject, to all constitutional restrictions in regard to the \u201ctaking-of private property for public uses,\u201d which can only be-done by \u201c due process of law.\u201d It involves a necessary cooperation or concurrence of the legislative and judicial functions \u2014 the legislative, to decide upon the .necessity- and extent of the \u201ctaking\u201d \u2014 the \u201cjudicial\u201d to <em>legalize </em>the taking, and to determine the measure of compensation. Every such \u201c taking \u201d is, or may become \u201c a case in Court,\u201d and require the intervention of a jury; hence notice may well be deemed essential, to give jurisdiction, and to initiate proceedings in such cases. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Baltimore vs. Ritchie, </em>51 <em>Md., </em>233; <em>Kohl vs. U. S., </em>91 <em>U. S. S. C., </em>367-376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-6\">On the other hand, an Ordinance to pave or repave a. public highway, and to impose a tax for the purpose, <em>is a purely legislative measure. </em>The power of the Legislature to legislate for such purposes is not dependent upon notice-to the parties to be affected by its exercise \u2014 otherwise all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>road-laws and all State and county taxes levied for the repairs of bridges and highways, passed without notice, would be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">The imposition of a paving-tax or assessment, is an exorcise of the taxing-power, and not of the power of eminent domain. <em>The Greenmount Cemetery Co\u2019s Case, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>517; <em>Cooley on Cons. Lim., </em>620; <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>429-430; <em>Dill, on Mun. Cor., secs. </em>589 and 590; 2 <em>Dill, on Mun. Cor., secs. </em>589 and 596.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">The supposed analogy fails in another particular. The \u2022statutory provision referred to, requiring previous notice \u25a0of any Ordinance to open and condemn streets, is that <em>before </em>any such Ordinance shall be passed, \u201c at least sixty days' notice shall he given <em>of any application for the passage of such Ordinance,\u201d </em>&amp;c. <em>Public Local Laws, Art. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>838.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">There is a distinction between proceedings to open and \u25a0condemn, and proceedings to pave, &amp;c., and the fact <em>that notice is not required </em>in the latter class of proceedings has been decided by this Court in <em>Dashiell's Case, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>616, 625-6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">The analogy also relied upon as being furnished by the Act of 1870, ch. 322, is equally at fault. That Act undoubtedly required notice, both by publication and by personal service, (in certain cases,) to authorize the grading, paying, &amp;c., of streets, and assessments upon the property holders therefor. It was notice, however, <em>not of \u25a0the assessment, </em>but of <em>\u201cthe determination\u201d </em>to grade, pave, \u25a0&amp;c.; and a right of appeal to the Baltimore City Court, and a jury was given by the Act to any person \u201c <em>aggrieved by such determination.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">In the case of an Ordinance to grade, pave, &amp;c., under the Act of 1874, ch. 218, sec. 2, the Ordinance itself is the \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it is made final, and no right of appeal to any Court is given. The reason for notice which existed in the one case, wholly fails in the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The necessity of notice is insisted upon as a fundamental constitutional maxim. If so, it must apply as well to laws passed by the Legislature as to Ordinances of the Mayor and City Council. What then shall be said of the laws passed at every session, without notice by the Legislature, authorizing local improvements, the cost whereof is required to be defrayed by local assessments, and the validity of which laws and asessments has been repeatedly sustained by this Court? In principle, it is. not easy to distinguish between an Act of the Legislature,, passed without <em>\u201cnotice,\u201d </em>authorizing the construction of a bridge, and assessing the cost upon the taxable property on opposite sides of the stream, and an Ordinance for paving a highway and assessing the cost upon the .property holders on opposite sides of the street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">The\u2019 claim now advanced .would also seem to make <em>notice-essential to the validity of the assessment, </em>independently of any question of the validity of the Ordinance. And the cases of <em>Stuart vs. Palmer, </em>14 <em>N. Y., </em>183, and <em>Davidson vs. New Orleans, </em>6 <em>Olto, </em>104, are relied upon to support this position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">These cases of notice relied upon to sustain the position of the appellees, are not in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">The proceedings before the Commissioners for Opening-Streets, are quasi-judicial. They have for their object the <em>\u201c </em>taking of private property for public uses,\u201d and ascertaining its value. The Legislature has coupled with this, inquiry the further duty of estimating the benefits which may accrue to other property from such \u201ctaking\u201d and public use. The proceedings are in the nature of an inquisition into benefits and damages \u2014 subject to an appeal to a jury and to review by a Court. The assessment of' benefits in such case is referred to the sound discretion and judgment of the assessors. It is a judicial act. This was the mode of assessment provided for in the New York case above referred to, (page 186.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Both <em>Stuart vs. Palmer, </em>and <em>Davidson vs. New Orleans, </em>were cases of \u201cassessment made by assessors or Commissioners appointed for the purpose under legislative authority, and who are <em>to vieio the estates </em>and to levy the expense in proportion to the benefits, which, <em>in their opinion, </em>the estates respectively will receive from the work proved.\u201d <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>448. While this is the case of \u201c an assessment by some definite standard fixed upon by the Legislature itself, and which is applied to estates by <em>measurement of length, quantity or value.\" Cooley on Taxation, </em>448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">It was upon the very ground that the assessment was arbitrary and discretionary with the assessors, that the New York Court of Appeals held that notice was necessary. It was the right of the party assessed, to he heard, and to offer evidence, if necessary, upon the question of benefits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">\u201c On the other hand, and on like reasoning, it has been held equally competent <em>to make a street a taxing district, </em>and assess the expense of the improvement upon the lots in proportion to the frontage. Here also is apportionment by a rule which approximates to what is just, hut which, like any other rule that can he applied, is only an approximation to absolute equality. But if, in the opinion of the Legislature, it is the proper rule to apply to any particular case, <em>the Courts must enforce it.\u201d Cooley on Con. Lim., </em>631, 632.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">Ho such question can possibly arise in any case of assessment for paving or repaving in the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-8\">The assessment is not upon the property believed to he benefited in \u201cthe judgment of\u201d the City Commissioner. The Act of Assembly is specific in its directions. The tax is to be assessed upon the property <em>binding on the street </em>which is paved or repaved, as the case may he. It is to he assessed, it is true, <em>\u201cpro rata\u201d </em>upon such prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>erty, but there never has been any doubt as to how that <em>pro rata </em>should he ascertained. There is but one rule or method of assessment for paving or repaving authorized or followed in Baltimore City since its first incorporation by the General Assembly, and that is <em>the rule of assessment by the front foot. </em>There is nothing, therefore, arbitrary or discretionary about the assessment. It is not a judicial, but a ministerial act. It is a matter of simple arithmetic. The Mayor and City Council determine as they are authorized to do \u2014 by Ordinance \u2014 and as they did determine in the present case \u2014 the proportion of cost to be assessed upon the property holders \u2014 fixing it, in' the case of the Pratt street improvement, at two-thirds. When the improvement is completed, and the cost ascertained, which cannot be done before, the assessment of each individual property holder is fixed by the number of front feet owned by him. So many lineal feet of street paved or repaved, at the cost of so many dollars and cents, is at the rate of so much per foot. The cost per foot, multiplied by the number of front feet of any given lot or property, gives the <em>\u201cpro rata \u201d </em>of that lot. No notice or hearing can change or affect this result. To provide for an appeal in such case would be like appealing from the multiplication table. So far from the Ordinance No, 68, of 1878, for the repaving of Pratt street, being liable to the objection of delegating to the City Commissioner a judicial discretion in regard to the <em>mode </em>of assessment\u2014 the rule of assessment by the front foot is so fixed, not only by custom, <em>but by law and </em>Ordinance, that the Commissioner could not lawfully proceed to assess in any other manner, and in making the assessment under the Ordinance he performed a simple ministerial duty, like that of making tape-line measurements and superintending the mechanical execution of the work. That such duty may be lawfully delegated, and that \u00e1 municipal corporation in such matters can only act through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>agency of its officers and servants, will not be questioned. <em>Northern Central Railway vs. Mayor, &amp;c., of Baltimore, </em>21 <em>Md., </em>93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">It is true that the Ordinance No. 68 of 1878, does not in terms, upon its face, prescribe the mode in which the two-thirds of the cost to be charged to the property holders shall be assessed. But it contains a reference to the provisions of general Ordinance No. 44 of 1874, and it is conceded that if that Ordinance, or any other general Ordinance upon the subject, prescribes the mode of assessment, the objection falls to the ground. A careful examination and comparison of the several provisions of said Ordinance No. 44 of June 4th, 1874, and particularly of secs. 4, 8 and 17, it is believed, will remove all doubt from the mind of the Court upon this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">Both Ordinances \u2014 the special Ordinance No. 68 of 1878 \u2022and the general Ordinance No. 44 of 1874 \u2014 having been passed in pursuance of the provisions of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, should be properly considered and construed in \u2022connection with said Act. The language of the several sections of the Act should also be compared for the same purpose, and according to the maxim that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>may be compared together, the Act itself should be considered in connection with the chain of legislation, \u2022covering a period of nearly a century, of which it forms a part. Baltimore City has never been without a paving law. It has never been without Ordinances upon the subject. These laws and Ordinances have been homogeneous. Whatever changes both laws and Ordinances have undergone in the lapse of time, in one point they will be found never to vary.. They recognize and authorize no other system of assessing for paving and repaving <em>\u25a0than by front foot.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">It will be found that the language of the latest Act and Ordinance does not vary substantially from that of the earliest. The language which is now supposed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>fatally ambiguous, bas never been misunderstood or found ambiguous before, although numerous cases have been before this Court, involving the validity of assessments imposed under these Ordinances, and the assessments which were in every instance recognized by the Court. <em>to have been imposed by the front foot, </em>have been sustained. <em>Dashiell vs. M. &amp; C. C., </em>45 <em>Md., </em>615; <em>Howard vs. First Church, </em>18 <em>Md., </em>451; <em>Clements vs. M. &amp; C. C., </em>16 <em>Md., </em>208; <em>Henderson vs. M. &amp; C.

In other States such acts of acquiescence have been held fatal to any such claim for relief as has been set up by these appellees ; and it has been expressly decided that an owner of real estate who stands by and sees a street improved in front of his property, under a contract made under an order of the City Council, cannot, <em>after the worh is completed, </em>refuse to pay for it. <em>La Fayette vs. Fowler, </em>34 <em>Ind., </em>140; <em>Sleeper vs. Bullen, </em>16 <em>Kans., </em>300; <em>Weber vs. San Francisco, </em>1 <em>Calif, </em>455.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>Edward Otis Hinhley </em>and <em>Gharles J.

The provisions in the Code of Public Local Laws, Article 4, sub-title \u201c City of Baltimore,\u201d codified in 1860, embraced all laws relating to the future administration of the corporate powers of the city, which remained in force on January 12tb, 1860. <em>See chapter </em>1 <em>of Acts of </em>1860. All prior legislation, conferring similar or different corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>rate powers, was superseded by the provisions of Article 4 of the Code of Public Local Laws, according to the rule-in <em>Appeal Tax Court vs. Western Md.

The Mayor and City Council were directed to assess upon the <em>owners </em>of property on the street or alley so repaved, their proportional part of such expense, and to collect it from them as other taxes were collected. <em>Ibid, sec. </em>847. Except for the local provision in sec. 845, the assessment must have been, under Art. 81, sec. 1, on the basis of the assessments, of properties on such street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>There was no provision made for imposing any part of the cost of paving or repaving any street, except upon \u2022such application, because, under the law, as it then stood, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore had no power to direct such work of paving. or repaving to be done \u2022except upon such application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">By the Act of 1870, chapter 282, section 861, of Article 4 of the Public Local Laws, relating to the paving of streets previously unpaved, was modified ; and by the Act of 1870, chapter 322, notice was required to be given of the proposed exercise of the power by the city, and a right of \u25a0appeal was given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">The whole system was changed by the Act of 1874, chapter 218, sub-sections 2 and 3. Sections 844, 845, 846, 847, 848, 849 and 850, of Article 4 of the Code of Public Local Laws, and the Acts of 1870, chapter 282, and 1870, chapter 322, were repealed. 50 <em>Md., </em>296; 48 <em>Md., </em>297; 43 <em>Md., </em>181; 39 <em>Md., </em>164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">The Mayor and City Council were empowered by this Act, to direct such work to be done on any street by \u25a0special Ordinance, without any prior application by the owners of property ; and to assess the cost of the work <em>in \u25a0whole or in part, </em>as they might deem proper, <em>pro rata </em>upon the <em>property </em>binding on such street or part thereof. <em>Sub-section </em>2. They were not required to pay for paving \u25a0any cross street. No legislative rule was prescribed, which should govern the apportionment of any assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">They were authorized to provide by general Ordinance, for the repaving or 'recurbing of any street or part thereof, upon the application of the owners of a <em>majority </em>of the front feet of property binding on such street or part thereof, so proposed to be improved, upon terms and conditions to be prescribed in the general Ordinance; and were \u25a0empowered to assess the cost of the work in whole or in part, as they might deem proper, <em>pro ra\u00eda </em>upon the <em>prop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>erty </em>binding on such street or part thereof. \u2022 <em>Sub-section </em>3. They were not required to pay the cost of paving any cross street. Ko legislative rule for apportioning such tax was prescribed by the section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">It will be seen that the new system was wholly inconsistent with the former system. The two sub-sections of' the Act.of 1874, ch. 218, referred to, superseded all prior legislation conferring similar powers, and regulating the modes of their exercise, operated as a repeal of such prior' legislation, and nullified all unexecuted City Ordinances which were based upon such prior legislation. The General Assembly especially manifested its intent to confine the legislative powers of the city to the limits, which it had in terms prescribed, when it repealed section 850 of Article -4 of the Code of Public Local Laws. This section gave the Mayor and City Council power to pass <em>any </em>Ordinances necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers vested in them in relation to repaving streets. The General Assembly, when it repealed this' section, obviously declared its purpose by this decisive action, to confine the exercise of the powers given over this particular subject of repaving streets to the methods prescribed by <em>law. </em>It made clear the limit which it intended to place upon its grant. <em>Gooley on Taxation, </em>209.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">The second sub-section of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, was apparently defective, because of its omission to provide any sufficient rule of ascertaining the <em>pro rata </em>proportion of the expense of the particular improvement which it authorized to be apportioned among the <em>properties </em>binding on the street or part of street, intended to be improved. For it will be observed that the second sub-section of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, neither prescribed the basis, which should be adopted in mating such apportionment, nor authorized the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to prescribe such basis. In authorizing the Mayor and City Council to assess such cost, <em>pro rata, </em>upon the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\"binding on such street, it assumed the existence of a defined basis upon which such apportionment could be \u25a0computed. The Act of 1814, ch. 218, repealed sections 845 and 841, of Article 4 of the Code of Public Local Laws relating to the City of Baltimore, which established or recognized the prior establishment of the front foot basis, thus manifesting a definite purpose to do away with <em>that </em>basis, but it did not, by its own terms, substitute another basis for making the particular apportionment; though the fixing the basis was a legislative power. <em>Cooley on </em>Taxation, 175, 177, 180, 448, 451.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">The reason for the omission, and for the assumption that a provision of law already existed, sufficient to ascertain this basis was well founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">The second sub-section of the Act of 1814, ch. 218, conferred upon the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore the power of imposing a special tax upon <em>property </em>binding on a street, or part thereof, which it might direct to be paved or repaved. The right to direct the imposition-of such special tax upon such property rests upon the theory of the special benefit accruing to the particular property from the proposed improvement. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore vs. Greenmount </em>Cemetery, 7 <em>Md., </em>536; <em>Schenley vs. comm., </em>36 <em>Penn. St., </em>29, 57; <em>Washington Av. Case, </em>69 <em>Penn. St., </em>360. It is manifest that different methods might be employed for apportioning the burden. The proportion, chargeable upon each piece of property benefited by the improvement, might be made to depend upon the areas of the respective lots, or upon the number of front feet in each' lot, upon some mixed rule made up of both elements of calculation, or upon the value of the respective properties as they stood, whether improved or unimproved, as ascertained by the standard of the valuation made for purposes of State and municipal taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-8\">The front foot rule had been abrogated, Did any other existing statute establish the rule applicable to such a case?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>It must be apparent to the Court that tbe value of the repective properties, as ascertained by the standard of the existing valuation made of them for the purposes of State and municipal taxation, was the standard which the common judgment would prescribe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">Parcels of property binding on a particular street, may be improved, or unimproved, or improved by buildings of very different values. Such parcels of ground, however, and the buildings upon them, constitute, as they-stand, <em>properties, </em>which are, to a large degree, affected in value by the condition of the highways, which they adjoin. If any such highway becomes out of repair, the properties binding upon it must, in general suffer nearly an equal <em>percentage </em>of loss of value. When that highway is improved, they must, in general, derive an equal percentage of benefit in increase of value. It is not apparent that, when such parcels of ground are made chargeable with \u2022any part of the cost of improving a highway, on which they front, the only proper rule for the apportionment among them of such part of the cost, is a percentage upon the value of such respective properties as they exist ? That value is sufficiently ascertained by the valuations made of such properties for the purposes of taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">It cannot be denied that the charge, imposed upon property binding on a street for the paving, or repaving of such street, is a tax. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore vs. Greenmount Cemetery Co., </em>7 <em>Md., </em>533; <em>People vs. Brooklyn, </em>4 <em>New York, </em>419; <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>148, 149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">It may be true that the Legislature was not obliged to make the valuations for purposes of State and municipal taxation of properties binding on a particular street, the basis which the Mayor and City Council should adopt for the special taxation intended for the improvement of such street. It might have adopted some other more arbitrary rule for ascertaining the basis of the particular tax; hut it certainly was at liberty to adopt the equitable rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the assessment of such properties according to their taxable values, if it saw proper to do so. It was silent as to the basis and rule of such taxation, and abstained from the granting to the Mayor and Oity Council of Baltimore any power to prescribe such basis, because there existed a sufficient general provision of law defining that basis and rule. It had been provided in 1860, by Art. 81, sec. 1, of the Code, that <em>all </em>State and county taxes, and <em>aU taxes in the Oity of Baltimore, </em>should he levied upon the assessment previously made, and upon such further assessments as might he made in conformity with law. This provision was in force when the Act of 1874, ch. 218, was enacted. It was re-enacted by the first sub-section of the Act of 1874, ch. 483, a law passed by the same General Assembly, which had enacted the Act of 1874, ch. 218. It was this basis which became operative when the front foot rule, established by sec. 845, of Art. 4, of the Code of Public Local Laws, was abrogated by the repeal of that section by the Act of 1874, ch. 218. It was this basis, which sub-section 2, of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, silently indicated as the basis of special taxation to be adopted in any Ordinance, passed in pursuance of its provisions. It was this basis, which the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, when they enacted Ordinance No. 68, of 1878, ought in the exercise of their given power, to have made by general Ordinance, or by special Ordinance, the basis of 'the special tax which they sought to impose' by that special Ordinance. The Mayor and City Council had no existing power to authorize the City Commissioner to select any other basis, than that which was prescribed by the Act of 1874, ch. 483, sub-section 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">The legislative history of the city demonstrates that the basis of special taxation, for the paving or repaving of streets, has always been prescribed by Acts of the General Assembly. The front foot rule was adopted by the Act of November Session, 1782, ch. 17. It was also. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>adopted in the Act of 1817, ch. 148, sec. .18. It was prescribed in the Acts of 1832, ch. 57, and 1833, ch. 40, and in the Code of Public Local Laws, Art. 4, secs. 845 and 847. When the basis prescribed in such cases was repealed by the Act of 1874, ch. 218, unless the basis referred to in Art. 81, sec. 1, of the Code, as re-enacted by the Act of 1874, ch. 483, sub-section 1, became the new legislative basis, no adequate provision existed for making the Act of 1874, ch. 218, sub-section 2, effectual, and it became an inadequate grant of power to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">It may certainly be concluded, therefore, that the second sub-section of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, considered by itself, or in connection with other existing laws, did not authorize the City Commissioner to adopt the <em>front foot rule </em>in determining the amount of tax to be imposed for the repaving of Pratt street, between Jones\u2019 Ealls and Howard street, which was charged upon the respective appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">II.

For \u201cthe Legislature must, in every instance, prescribe the rule under which taxation may he laid; \u201d \u201c to refer the making of the rule to another \u25a0authority would be in excess of legislative power.\u201d <em>Cooley on </em>Taxation, 50; <em>People vs. Mayor of Brooklyn, </em>4 <em>Comst., </em>426; <em>McBean vs. Chandler, </em>9 <em>Haskell, </em>(Tenn.,) 366\u2014 368. There was only one existing legislative rule, which the Ordinance could have pi\u2019escribed, or to which it could have referred, or on which it could have been based. This was the rule, which had been prescribed by Art. 81, sec. 1, of the Code of Public G-eneral Laws, which had been re-enacted by sub-section 1 of the Act of 1874, ch. 483. \u201cAll State and county taxes and all taxes in the City of Baltimore shall he levied upon the assessment heretofore made, and such further assessments as may he. made agreeably to law.\u201d This rule superseded the prior front-foot rule of apportionment, existing in the cases to which it applied, under secs. 845 and 847 of Art. 4 of the Code of Public Local Laws, title \u201cCity of Baltimore.\u201d It was the only existing legislative rule relating to municipal taxation imposed upon a property basis in the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">The Ordinance Ho. 68 of 1878, instead of prescribing or referring to this correct rule, required the repaving to be done according to the provisions of Ordinance Ho. 44 of 1874, as far as the said Ordinance was applicable. The Ordinance thus referred to, supplied no rule applicable to the work intended to he done under Ordinance Ho. 68 of 1878.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">The Ordinance Ho. 44 of 1874, was applicable only to the different case of improvements made by the City Commissioner, at the formal request of persons owning property to a prescribed amount on the street, Or part of a street, in reference to which the application was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">It is necessary to observe, moreover, that Ordinance Ho. 68 of 1878, and Ordinance Ho. 44 of 1874, were both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>ultra vires, </em>because they both authorized the particular-special taxes to which they related, to be imposed upon the <em>owners </em>of property in contravention of the express, provisions of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, sub-sections 2 and 3,, which directed the particular taxes to which they referred,, to be imposed only oh the <em>properties </em>made subject to such tax. <em>Ordinance No. </em>44 <em>of </em>1874, <em>sections </em>8 and 17. <em>Ordinance No. </em>68 of 1878.

The City Commissioner had no authority to exercise, under the second sub-section of the Act of 1874,. ch. 218, the discretionary powers, which had been vested in the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore only. He-had no right to disregard the statutory rule, prescribed\u2019 by Art. 81, sec. 1, of the Code of Public General Laws.for ascertaining the basis of the. tax imposed by Ordinance No. 68 of 1878, and to adopt, in lieu of it a basis, and rule supplied by the inapplicable provisions of Ordinance No. 44 of 1874. He would have had, indeed, no-power to observe even the statutory rule prescribed by-sec. 1 of Art. 81 of the Code of Public General Laws,, because that rule had not been prescribed for his government, in the particular case, by any general, or special Ordinance; and it would not have been competent for him to have used this rule, prescribed for the government of' the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the exercise-of its particular legislative power,-unless the said Mayor and City Council, in obedience to the requirement of law,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>had made such statutory rule, hy proper Ordinance, the rule for the government of the City Commissioner in the discharge of his particular duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">No usage, or habit of proceeding, founded upon the \u25a0repealed secs. 845 and 841 of the Public Local Code, or upon the provisions of an inapplicable general Ordinance, \u25a0can countervail the true meaning of the statutory provision, contained in Art. 81. sec. 1, of the Code as re-enacted in the Act of 1814, ch. 483, sub-section 1, which made the assessed value of particular properties the sole standard for the imposition of all city taxes, or supply the lack of \u2022a legislative rule if the first sub-section of the Act of 1814, ch. 483, has not made this rule operative. No usage \u25a0could confer upon the City Commissioner authority to prescribe a rule for the apportionment of taxes on any basis not ascertained by law, or according to any rule not sanctioned by law. <em>Hood vs. Lynn, </em>1 <em>Allen, (Mass.,) </em>107; <em>Foley &amp; Woodside vs. Mason, </em>6 <em>Md., </em>49; <em>Chesapeake Bank vs. Abell, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>500. No usage certainly could \u25a0confer such power in contravention of the express terms \u25a0of positive law. <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>93, note 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">It cannot be doubted that, under the Act of 1814, ch. '218, sub-section 2, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore had the power to provide, by Ordinance for apportioning the cost of repaving Pratt street, between particular limits, among <em>all </em>properties situated along the entire length of Pratt street. There was a reason, not only for the grant of this power of extended apportionment, but for its exercise. All properties, touching upon any part \u25a0of a great thoroughfare, are interested in the good condition of that thoroughfare in all its parts. They are benefited, or injured, in unequal degrees, it is true, when it is kept in good order, or becomes deteriorated ; but they are all, nevertheless chargeable in the discretion of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, with such share of the \u25a0cost of the repair of the highway, as it may consider pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>portioned to the benefits derived by such properties from its improved condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">Prom whence did the City Commissioner derive his power to confine the assessment, made, under Ordinance-No. 68 for the expense of repaving Pratt street, between Jones\u2019 Palls and Howard street, to the owners of property situated between Jones\u2019 Falls and Howard street? He certainly had no power to restrict the scope of the' language of an Ordinance, which it was his duty to-execute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">Finally. It will he observed that The Johns Hopkins Hospital, by which the proceedings for the \u25a0 injunction in the case were mainly initiated, and many others of' the appellees, did not make any application for the repaving of Pratt street. The work was directed to be done by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore upon such representations, as they saw proper to listen to, and in the exercise of an authority, which they claimed to possess.. Neither the Mayor and City Council, nor the particular appellees, were estopped from setting up that the Ordinance under which the work was done was <em>ultra vires. </em>1 <em>Dillon on Munic. Corp., (2nd Edf sec.' </em>381: The particular appellees were certainly not estopped from showing the invalidity of the Ordinance. <em>Starr vs. City of Burlington, </em>45 <em>Iowa, </em>90; <em>Rood vs. Board of Supervisor's of Mitchell County, </em>39 <em>Iowa, </em>446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the appellees, who made no application to the Mayor and City Council for the repaving of Pratt street, certainly did not, by word or conduct, bring about the passage of the particular Ordinance. They did not represent, or conceal, any circumstance upon which the action of the city was based, or in any way influence such action. <em>Homer vs. Grosholz, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>526. It does not even appear that any one of this class of appellees had any knowledge of the enactment, of the particular-Ordinance, or that anything had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>done by the -Mayor and City Council, under that Ordinance, or of the assessments made under such Ordinance, until bills were presented to them after the completion of the work. Upon no possible theory can it be claimed that such appellees are estopped from setting up the invalidity of the particular Ordinance. . <em>Pickard vs. Sears, </em>6 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell., </em>469, 33 <em>E.

The <em>onus </em>of any such proof, if it existed, rests of course upon the appellants, who set up the estoppel, and no such evidence appears in the record, or exists. <em>Reynolds vs. Mutual Fire Ins. Co. of Cecil County, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>289.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">Nor are such of the appellees as joined in petitions to the Mayor and City Council that Pratt street might be repaved with the Belgian block pavement, in any worse position. They asked, in effect, that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore should proceed to repave that street by the rightful exercise of proper corporate legislative power. They are certainly not estopped, because they asked that-existing corporate powers might be rightly exercised, from showing that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore exceeded such corporate powers, or executed them in a manner not sanctioned by law. <em>Mayor &amp; C.

The doctrine of estoppel <em>in pais </em>has no application to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">Though it is, in general, true that when one stands by, and sees another laying out money upon property, to which he has some claim or title, and does not give notice of it, he cannot afterwards, in good conscience, set up such claim, or title, yet it is equally true that such person is not debarred from afterwards setting up such claim, or title, when such claim, or title, was equally well known, or equally open to the notice of both parties, when the money was thus laid out. <em>Browne vs. Trustees M.

The citizen is not hound, in order to protect his rights, to remonstrate with municipal authorities against the passage of improper Ordinances, which affect those rights. When such improper Ordinances are passed, and their execution would endanger his interests, he is not required to give notice to those, appointed to execute them, that he will resist their enforcement. He is not obliged to go into a Court of equity to restrain such enforcement until this measure of protection is necessary to the safety of his interests. If he acts in time, to protect his rights, either hy injunction, or hy resisting direct proceedings, taken against him, or against his property, he has acted in due season. Avoid Ordinance can derive no sanction from the silence of those whom it affects, if they avail themselves in time of the proper means to prevent its enforcement against themselves. The case of <em>Mayor and City Council vs. Grand Lodge, </em>44 <em>Md., </em>446, 447, completely supports these conclusions, as do also the cases of <em>Horn vs. Mayor and City Council, </em>30 Md., 223; <em>Mayor and City Council vs. Porter, </em>18 <em>Md., </em>301, and <em>Mayor and City Council vs. Hughes, Adm\u2019r, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>491.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">Miller, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Much importance has very properly been attributed to the questions presented by this appeal, and they have been twice argued. They not only involve important legal principles, but property owners in the City of Baltimore, and the city itself, are deeply interested in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>solution; for it is conceded that the collection or non-collection of taxes to a very large amount, levied under Ordinances of the same character and for like improvements already made, depends upon the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The appeal is from a <em>pro forma </em>decree of the Circuit Court, annulling the assessments upon abutting property, for a portion of the cost of repaving part of Pratt street, and perpetually enjoining the collection of the same. The main questions are the same that were discussed in the case of <em>The Mayor and C. C. of Balt. vs. Scharf, et al., </em>54 <em>Md., </em>499. After the opinion in that case, declaring the Ordinance and the assessments under it to be void, was filed, a motion for a re-hearing was rpade at the same term and granted. The argument in this case has therefore been received and taken as a re-argument of that. Upon this argument, and further consideration of the subject, a majority of the Judges participating in this decision, have reached a different conclusion from that expressed in the former opinion, and we shall now proceed to state the grounds upon which we hold the assessments to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">By Ordinance Ho. 68, approved June 26th, 1878, (under which the assessments in the present case were made,) entitled \u201cAn Ordinance to provide for the repaving of Pratt street, between Jones\u2019 Palls and Howard street,\u201d it was enacted and ordained by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \u201c that the City Commissioner he and he is hereby authorized and directed to have Pratt street, between Jones\u2019 Palls and Howard street repaved, in pursuance of the Act of the General Assembly of Maryland, chapter 218, of April, 1874, and according to the provisions of Ordinance Ho. 44, of the Mayor and \u2019City Council of Baltimore, approved the 4th of June, 1874, providing for the grading, gravelling, shelling, curbing and paving of the streets, lanes and alleys of the \u2019City of Baltimore, <em>so far as the same may be applicable; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>said repaving to be done with Camp\u2019s process of Belgian block pavement; the expense thereof to be paid in the following manner, that is to say, one-third by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, <em>and two-thirds by the oioners of property binding on said street; </em>and the same shall be laid with Maryland Granite, provided it can be purchased at as low a price as that furnished by parties outside of' the State; and provided the cost of said pavement shall not exceed $2.85 per square yard; the city\u2019s portion of the expense to be provided for in the levy of 1879.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">This special Ordinance, and the general Ordinance, No. 44 of 1874, therein referred to, were hoth passed in pursuance of the powers granted by the Act of 1874, ch. 218. That Act made several important changes in the system of laws which had previously existed upon this subject. It gave the Mayor and City Council power, in the first place, to provide by <em>\u201c </em>general Ordinance,\u201d for paving or repaving any street, or any part thereof, \u201c without the passage of a special Ordinance in the particular case,\u201d whenever the owners of a majority of front feet of property binding on such street, or part thereof, shall apply for the same, upon terms and conditions to be prescribed in such general Ordinance, and for the assessment in any such case, of the cost of such work, in whole or in part, <em>pro rata </em>upon all the property binding upon such street or part thereof, and for the collection of such assessments as other city taxes are collected ; and, in the second place, it gave them in like terms full power and authority, <em>without any application of owners, </em>to provide by special Ordinance for paving or repaving any street, or part of a street, and for assessing the cost of the work, in whole or in part, <em>pro rata </em>upon the property binding on such street or part thereof, and for collecting such assessments as other city taxes are collected. The construction of this, statute was determined, and its validity sustained, by the decision of this Court in <em>Burns\u2019 Case, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>198. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>was there decided it was not the purpose of this law to grant power to pass special Ordinances, making improvements of this character for the <em>public convenience generally, </em>without any motive or purpose of special benefit to property in the immediate locality, and then to assess the cost of the work upon the owners of such property; and as the Ordinance in that case, showed by its preamble, that in the judgment of the Mayor and City Council, the improvement was required by, and that their motive in passing it, was to promote, <em>\u201c Hie public convenience,\u201d </em>it was declared void, so far as it attempted to enforce special assessments upon the owners of adjacent property. But it was also there held, in accordance with previous adjudications of this Court, that if no such expression had been found on the face of the Ordinance, the presumption would have been that in the judgment of those who passed it, the paving directed to be done, would be for the benefit of the particular district, and in that event this presumption would have been conclusive, and the Ordinance free from objection on that ground. \u201c The legality,\u201d say the Court in <em>Hughes\u2019 Case, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 492, \u201cof levying the tax, does not depend upon whether the paving does or does not <em>in fact </em>benefit the particular district that is taxed, but upon the object, the motive of the corporation in causing the paving to be done. And in .an Ordinance providing for such paving, and the imposition of such a special tax, it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated to be for the benefit of the particular district; but if nothing appears to the contrary, such an exercise of the special taxing power, will be taken to have been in pursuance of the authority given by the charter. It will be presumed that the corporation did not exceed its powers, but imposed the tax for the purpose only for which the charter authorizes it to be imposed, and that the paving appeared to the City Council to be for the benefit of the particular district.\u201d To the same effect are the decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>in <em>Moore &amp; Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>375, and <em>Howard\u2019s tJase, </em>Ibid, 383, where the power of taxing particular districts for local benefits was first considered hy the \u25a0Courts of Maryland. It follows from these decisions, that the question whether the improvement will benefit the particular district, is left to the judgment of the Mayor and City Council, and their determination in the premises is final and conclusive. The law has provided \u25a0 no appeal from that determination, and the Courts have no power to review it at the instance of property owners who are specially taxed. Whether some mode of review ought to he provided, is a matter for the Legislature alone to consider. The Courts, as the law now stands, can determine simply the naked question of power, and as to this, the validity of special assessments, founded upon the theory of special benefits, has been so often and uniformly \u25a0sustained hy the Courts of this and other States, as to be no longer an open question. There is nothing upon the face of the Ordinance now before us, indicating that those who passed it, judged that the improvement was for the public convenience exclusively, and not for the benefit of the particular district. It provides for special assessments, and the presumption is, that they determined that those who were specially assessed would he specially benefited. Its validity therefore cannot be assailed in the Courts, upon the ground that the improvement was in fact for the benefit of the public at large, and conferred no special benefit upon the owners of adjacent property. Such is undoubtedly the general rule, hut some Courts have held, and perhaps justly, that a local assessment may so far transcend the limits of equality and reason, that its execution would cease to be a tax, or contribution to a common burden, and become extortion and confiscation. <em>Gooley on Taxation, </em>428, <em>note </em>3. We do not mean to say a case may not ^.rise of such abuse of this power hy the legislative body, as to make it \u201c the duty of the Court to protect the citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>zen from robbery under color of a better name,\u201d but it must be a clear case of such abuse, to justify the interference of the Court, and plainly no such case has been made by the present complainants in their bill, nor established by the proof in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">But it is said no notice was given to the property owners of the purpose to enact this Ordinance, nor is any provision made by the Ordinance itself, giving notice of the proceedings under it, and affording those to be affected by it, an opportunity of being heard before the charges are fully established against them; and this, it is argued, is taking their property without due process of law, and in violation of their constitutional rights. It is conceded the Act of Assembly requires no such notice, and, in our opinion, this objection is founded upon a misapprehension of the nature of the power here granted and exercised. This is not an Ordinance to open and condemn a street or highway, where private property is taken for public use, by the right of eminent domain, but an Ordinance imposing a\u2019tax or assessment for the repaving of' a street already opened and condemned. That the imposition of such a tax or assessment, upon the owners of adjacent property, is an exercise of the <em>taxing power, </em>and not of the right of eminent domain, has been so frequently decided, not only by this Court, but by the Courts of other States, that the controversy which may once have existed upon the subject, must be regarded as closed. <em>Greenmount Cemetery Case, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>517; <em>Cooley on </em>Taxation, 430; 2 <em>Dillon on Mun. Corp., sec. </em>596. What is said by Judge Cooley on pages 265 and 266, of his valuable book on <em>Taxation, </em>as to the importance to persons assessed, that they should have some opportunity to be heard before the charge is fully established against them, has-reference to general assessment laws, under which the property of the citizens of the State is assessed or <em>valued </em>for the purpose, and as the basis, of taxation generally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>In all \u2022 the States, and certainly in Maryland, provision has always been made in such laws, for a hearing and for a review of the action of the assessors or valuers, before a hoard of review and on appeal to the Courts. But when the valuation has been thus settled, the rate and amount to he raised by taxation, as well as the necessity and propriety of the particular tax, are matters left entirely to the discretion of the Legislature. To hold that notice to the tax payers, is essential to the validity of a law imposing a tax upon the basis of such valuation, \u25a0and that the Courts can intervene and set it aside, and \u25a0stay the collection of the tax, because no such notice was given or provided, would he as much an anomaly in jurisprudence as in legislation. In this part of his work, the learned author was not considering special assessments, which are hut taxes; for local improvements, and the ob\u25a0servations there made, do not, in our judgment, apply to such cases. A careful examination of the case of <em>Stuart vs. Palmer, </em>14 <em>N. Y., </em>183, and the statutes under which that case arose, has convinced us that it is materially different from this. Much of the opinion in that case \u2022applies with great force to statutes and proceedings under which property is taken by the right of eminent domain, hut we cannot accept what is there said as conclusive of the question of notice now before us in this case. Much more to the point, is the decision of the same Court in the <em>Matter of Trustees of Pub. School, </em>31 <em>N. Y., </em>514, in which the opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Denio, where it was held, that raising money for a local improvement, is an exercise of \u2022 the taxing power inherent in the Legislature ; that this power of taxation implies a power to \u2022apportion the tax territorially, as the Legislature may see fit, and that the constitutional inhibition against depriving a person of his property without due process of law, \u2022and forbidding private property from being taken for public use, without just compensation, has no application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the case; that in executing the taxing power in such cases, the Legislature provides such agencies and safeguards against surprise, mistake or injustice, as is thought fit, and while it is manifestly proper that the tax payers should have notice of the imposition proposed to he laid upon them, and an opportunity for making suggestions and explanations to the proper administrative hoard or officer, yet, as there is no constitutional provision bearing on the subject, it is for the Legislature to determine and prescribe in every case what shall be sufficient. We hold it then to be clear, both upon reason and authority, that provisions for notice, or giving the right of hearing, or \u2022an appeal to the Courts and a jury trial, however wise and proper they may be in point of policy, are not <em>essential </em>to a valid exercise of this branch of the taxing power. In the present case, no such provisions were required by the Act of Assembly, nor embodied in the Ordinance, and these complainants were left to their right to petition the Mayor and City Council against its passage, if they \u25a0deemed it prejudicial to their interests, and to such hearing before the committee having the matter in charge, as is usually accorded by legislative bodies. If they failed to avail themselves of this privilege, or were unsuccessful in their efforts, the Courts cannot interfere, for the <em>power </em>to determine when a special assessment shall he made, on what basis it shall he apportioned, over what district it shall extend, and whether the particular improvement will confer a benefit upon property in the immediate locality beyond that which will accrue therefrom to property more remote, or the public generally, is a power confided to the legislative department, to be exercised, subject to such provisions, and under such restrictions only as the law makers may see fit, in each case, to prescribe. With the wisdom or unwisdom of such assessments when ordered in cases in which they are admissible \u2022at all, the Courts have no concern, unless (according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>some authorities,) there is plainly and manifestly such an abuse of power, as takes the case beyond the just limits of legislative discretion. <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>429. The record before us discloses no such abuse of power, and this objection to the validity of the Ordinance cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">But in executing the Ordinance the City Commissioner proceeded to assess the two-thirds of the cost upon the adjacent property according to <em>frontage, </em>and it is contended that this front foot rule was repealed by the Act of 1874, is not contained in, or re-enacted by the Ordinance, and has now no legal existence; and the assessments according to that rule, were, therefore, made without lawful authority. It is conceded, on all sides, to he the province of the Legislature to prescribe, in such cases, how the apportionment shall be \u25a0 made, and this may he either by the <em>front foot, </em>by the <em>area </em>of the fronting lots, or by their <em>value, </em>including or excluding the buildings upon them. Occasional hardships may result from the adoption of either mode, hut the authorities are united in the conclusion that either may lawfully be made the basis of' apportionment. In street improvements, especially such as paving and repaving, the frontage rule has been very generally adopted as the most practicable and reasonable measure of probable benefits, and, certainly it cannot with propriety he denounced as inherently unreasonable or unjust. In speaking of this rule, Judge Cooley observes, that \u201c such a measure of apportionment seems at first blush to he perfectly arbitrary, and likely to operate in some cases with great injustice, hut it cannot be denied that in the case of some improvements, frontage is a very reasonable measure of benefits, much more just than value would be, and perhaps approaching equality, as nearly as any estimate of benefits made by the judgment of men.\u201d <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>451. In Baltimore the rule has prevailed, been acted upon, and acquiesced in without ques-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>lion or complaint, from the foundation of the city to the present time, but not always under an express provision of an Act of the G-eneral Assembly to that effect. Prior to the incorporation of the city, taxes were imposed upon the inhabitants of the town, directly by the Legislature, \u25a0and by the Act of 1782, ch. 17, among other taxes for paving, cleansing, and keeping the streets in repair, a tax \u2022of twelve shillings and six pence, was levied <em>\u201c </em>on every front foot of improved and unimproved lots, in those parts \u2022of the streets fixed on to be paved, or that may have been -already paved by the Special Commissioners.\u201d Afterwards, upon representation by the Commissioners that this tax \u25a0operated unequally and oppressively, because one and the same rate was fixed <em>\u201cfor streets of different widths,\u201d </em>the 0 Legislature, by the Act of 1791, ch. 59, changed it as \u25a0desired, and prescribed different rates per front foot, according to the width of the street. \"When the city was incorporated by the Act of 1796, ch. 68, the system of direct taxation by the Legislature ceased, and power was \u25a0conferred upon the corporation <em>et </em>to lay and collect taxes not exceeding two dollars in the hundred pounds in any one year,\u201d and in the following year, by the Act of 1797, ch. 54, \u201cfull power and authority,\u201d was given to the corporation \u201c to enact and pass all Ordinances necessary for paving and keeping in repair the streets, lanes and alleys of. the city, and to tax any particular part or district of the city for paving the streets, lanes and alleys therein, which may appear for the benefit of such particular part \u2022or district.\u201d Neither this, nor the preceding Act, made any reference to the front foot rule, but under the broad power contained in the last Act, numerous paving Ordinances were passed, and in all cases, so far as we are \u25a0 aware, this rule of assessment was adopted, and without dissent on the part of the property owners so taxed. The Act of 1817, ch. 148, sec. 18, has been referred to by the \u25a0appellees\u2019 counsel, as prescribing the rule, but that sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tion simply provides tliat no nnpaved street shall he paved <em>\u201c </em>without the assent in writing of the proprietors, of a majority of the ground <em>binding and fronting on </em>such street or the part thereof to he paved,\u201d and if this language is sufficient to prescribe the front foot rule, then similar terms in the Act of 1874 must have the same effect. The. Act of 1832, ch. 57, does not, in our judgment, apply to public streets. The Act of 1833, ch. 40, clearly prescribes the rule, hut it deals solely with <em>repaving. </em>All antecedent laws on the subject were repealed by the adoption of the Local Code in 1860, and in that we-find no provision applying the rule to cases of original paving. Sections 845 and 847 of Article 4 are derived from the Act of 1833, and refer only to <em>repaving. </em>After-the Code, the Act of 1870, ch. 282, (which was repealed by the Act of 1874,) simply declared that the owners of property on the street shall he ' assessed \u201c their proportional part of the expenses \u201d for the paving or repaving. In short we have found no statute from the incorporation of the city in 1796 to the present, in which with reference-to the <em>paving </em>of unpaved public streets, this rule has been prescribed in express terms, and if its adoption could he-made out by implication, the language of the Act of 1874 is quite as strong for that purpose, as that used in any previous law. It is, however, undeniably true that during this long period this rule has been constantly recognized in paving Ordinances, adopted in practice, accepted by property owners and tax payers without demur, and has stood without objection until the present cases arose. It is also equally true that during the same period many paving tax cases have been brought to this Court and argued by eminent counsel, in which the validity of the taxes has been vigorously assailed on various grounds,, and yet this objection is now raised for the first time. These facts may not suffice to establish the legal existence-of the rule, hut they certainly afford material aid in the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>construction of the Ordinance now before \u2019US, which will be presently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The argument on the part of the appellees, is to the effect that the Act of 1814, has expressly repealed all previous legislation on the subject, including those sections of the Local Code in which the front foot rule is prescribed, and has substituted its own provisions as the sole and only law relative to the paving and repaving of streets, and as this Act is <em>silent </em>as to the rule of assessment in such cases, the result is, either that <em>no rule </em>on the subject exists, and the city is left without a paving law which can be executed, or, as the only alternative, the assessments must be made upon the basis of the valuation of property for the purpose of ordinary taxation, fixed and ascertained under and by virtue of the general revenue and assessment laws of the State. But conceding the Act fails to prescribe, in express terms, any rule of assessment, it nevertheless vests the Mayor and City Council with \u201c full power and authority to provide by <em>Ordinance </em>for assessing the cost of any such work, in whole or in part, <em>pro rata </em>upon the property binding on such street or part thereof.\" Under this broad and general power, it is very clear, we think, that an Ordinance may be passed adopting the front foot rule as the mode of apportionment, and if so adopted that the rule will be lawfully established. <em>Howard\u2019s Case, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>389. And such, in our opinion, upon fair and just construction, is the effect of the special Ordinance in question, and the provisions of the general Ordinance which it refers to and adopts. The special Ordinance' not only declares that two-thirds of the cost of the work shall be paid \u201cby the owners of property binding on said street,\u201d but it adopts <em>all </em>the provisions of general Ordinance ETo. 44, \u201c so far as the same may be applicable \u201d to the repaving which it directs to be done. Among the provisions of the latter Ordinance, which are unquestionbly so appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>cable, are sections <em>eight </em>and <em>seventeen. </em>By section <em>eight, </em>which relates to <em>paving, </em>the City Commissioner is required to impose a tax upon the owner or owners of property binding upon the street, or part'thereof to be paved, <em>equal in amount </em>to the whole cost of the work, and he is further directed \u201cto assess and lay the tax upon the <em>owner </em>or <em>owners </em>of property on each side of said street, of one-half <em>of so much of said street as may he in front of such property,\u201d </em>and by section <em>seventeen, </em>which relates to <em>repaving, </em>it is provided that, the \u201c same modes of procedure shall be adopted,\u201d except that two-thirds only of the cost \u201cshall be paid by the owners of property binding \u201d upon the street, or part thereof to be repaved; By other provisions of both Ordinances the work was required to be done under contract, to be given to the lowest bidder, and at a cost not exceeding a certain sum per square yard, which of necessity made the cost of each and every square yard of pavement or repavement uniform. After the contract was entered into, the ascertainment of the entire cost was merely a matter of measurement and calculation. Now, in view of this consideration, the only reading and interpretation we can give to this <em>eighth </em>section, is that it requires each frontage owner to pay one-half the cost, so ascertained, of paving so much of the street as lies in front of his property, and this is nothing more nor less than the front foot or frontage rule. Eor these reasons, we hold that the frontage rule has a legal existence, and it is, therefore, no objection to the validity of these assessments that they were made according, to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Some minor questions have been discussed which do not require an extended notice. We think it plain the Ordinance authorized assessments only on property fronting on that part of the street which was directed to be repaved, and not on property throughout the entire length of Pratt street. The duties of the City Commissioner are clearly defined and prescribed by the Ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>nances. The ascertainment of the cost of the work, and the apportionment under the rule to the property owners, are, as we have said, matters of measurement and arithmetical calculation, which must of necessity he entrusted to a ministerial agent. Neither in this, nor in any other respect, do we find any unauthorized delegation of power to this officer.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b51-7\">(Decided 17th March, 1881.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Finding then no valid objection to these assessments, the <em>pro forma </em>decree appealed from must be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b51-8\">Alvey and Irvine, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">dissented, and the former filed the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">By the opinion of a bare majority of the Court in this case, the opinion of the majority in the case of the <em>Gity of Baltimore vs. Scharf and others, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>499, has been overruled. I concurred in the opinion of the Court in <em>Scharf's Case, </em>and can perceive no sufficient reason whatever why it should have been overruled or receded from by the Court. I must therefore dissent from the opinion of the majority of the Court filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In that opinion there are three propositions asserted and made the basis of the judgment, which, in my opinion, with all due respect to the opinions of others,' cannot be supported in reason or by authority. These propositions are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">1st. That the question, whether the property along the-line of improvement is really benefited, is left <em>exclusively </em>to the judgment of the Mayor and City Council, and that their determination is <em>final and conclusive, </em>whether founded in fact or otherwise ; and that the property owners have no right to question, nor the Courts power to inquire into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the facts of the case, and to relieve against any injustice of the special assessments, though they may be made when, <em>in point of fact, </em>no benefits will he conferred whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">2nd. That bec\u00e1use the special assessments upon the property of the complainants were made under the taxing power, as distinguished from the power of eminent domain, therefore no notice of any kind was required to he given to the parties of such assessments; and that it is not essential that the property owners should have an opportunity to he heard, either as to the propriety of the proposed improvement, the manner of its execution, or of the special assessments and collection thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">3rd. That the front foot rule of assessment or apportionment of the cost of the improvement, notwithstanding the repeal of those provisions of the law which expressly authorized it, still subsists, and that it was properly applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">I shall state briefly the reasons of my dissent from each of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">1. If it be true that the Ordinance, under which the present assessments were made, should .he taken as a final judgment, and so preclude all inquiry into the facts upon which it is supposed to be founded, there can he no good reason why all Ordinances of municipal corporations, dependent upon facts for their support, should not be equally conclusive. Whether a particular state of case actually exists, and whether that state of case constitutes a nuisance, or something else falling within the scope of municipal authority, in all such cases the Ordinances passed in reference to them must he taken as conclusive of the facts <em>that would justify their adoption. </em>The real state of facts becomes quite immaterial, and the Ordinance is the only thing that can he appealed to to determine the question of fact, and that must he by conclusive presumption if the Ordinance happen to he silent upon the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ject. I must confess that I have not so understood the legal import of mere municipal Ordinances, when passed to affect the private rights of property of the citizen. All municipal authority is derived by delegation only, and the municipal agents must act within the limits of that authority ; and whenever the authority is transcended or \u2022abused, or exercised in an unreasonable and therefore an unauthorized manner, the citizen has his remedy for relief \u2022against the unwarranted action of the municipality or its agents. This proposition would seem to have the support of all authority entitled to respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In the case of <em>Burns vs. City of </em>Baltimore, 48 <em>Md., </em>198, this Court declared Ordinance No. 79, of 1874, passed under the Act of 1874, ch. 218, for regrading, repaving, &amp;c., \u25a0 of Light street, utterly void, so far as it provided for special assessments, merely because it recited in the preamble that <em>public convenience </em>required the street to he improved. This was certainly going very far in the way of protection of private right as against the action \u25a0of the city authorities ; for I suppose there is no case of paving or repaving of the public streets of a\u2019 city that it is not done primarily and principally with a view to the public convenience, \u2014 certainly never with a view to mere private benefit. Indeed, there would he no authority at \u25a0all for making the improvement except for public purposes. The declaration in the preamble did not say that it was for the public convenience <em>alone, </em>that the improvement was authorized to he made. A fair presumption, perhaps, in that case, could have been indulged, that while the public convenience was the primary and leading motive to the passage of the Ordinance, yet, such private benefits and advantages would accrue to the abutting property, as to justify the special assessments attempted to he made. But this Court held, and I am far from saying it did not rightly hold, that the Ordinance was void as to the special assessments, because it was supposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>be of doubtful construction, and, in such case, the presumption should be in favor of the right of the citizen. I am, however, clear in saying, that if the same indulgent construction had been extended to that Ordinance that has been extended to the one involved in this case, there-could have heen no difficulty in supporting the special' assessments, which were there declared void. A strong-presumption in favor of the rightfulness of the action of\" the Mayor and Oity Council would certainly have saved the Ordinance in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It is supposed that the cases of the <em>City of Baltimore vs. Johnson &amp; </em>Moore, 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>375, <em>The City vs. Howard,. Ib. </em>386, and <em>The City vs. Hughes, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>480, afford warrant for the conclusive effect attributed to the Ordinance in this case. But I do not so read those cases. Doubtless, Ordinances should be supported by all fairintendment, and they are certainly <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts upon which they profess to be founded. But in the cases referred to the question was not the same as that presented in this case. In those cases, the question was, whether there was authority given to the corporation to tax particular parts or districts of the city for-paving streets, in the absence of affirmative proof that, such pavement was specially beneficial to -that particular-part or district of the city in which it was made. The-improvements in those cases were required and made for public use and convenience, and the question was whether the city at large or the particular districts or parts of the-city in which the streets were located, should bear the tax. It was not a question of <em>special benefits </em>to abutting- property. The Court held, and it was all that was decided bearing upon this particular question, that the corporation could not tax any particular part or district of the city for paving, unless such paving appeared to be for the-benefit of that particular part or district. But that, in any Ordinance directing a street to be paved, and impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ing a tax on the district for that purposes, it was not necessary to he stated in the Ordinance that it was for the benefit of such district; hut that it would he so taken,, if nothing appeared to the contrary. And the Court further held, that the paving of streets is <em>prima facie </em>for the benefit of the parts or districts of the city through which they pass, and more especially when applied for by a majority of the immediate inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">That a municipal Ordinance affecting a private right of property cannot, in its nature, be so conclusive as to preclude all inquiry into the facts upon which it professes; to be founded, would seem to be well established by express decision of this Court. In the case of <em>Glenn </em>vs. <em>City of Baltimore, </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>424, in passing upon the-question as to how far an Ordinance in respect to a particular erection, supposed to be a nuisance, was to be taken as establishing the fact, the Court held, that, while all-fair intendment should be made in favor of the validity of the Ordinance, yet it was liable to be questioned on proof. They said: \u201cIt is true the corporation have power to pass all laws which are necessary or proper to-carry into effect any given power, and the degree of its necessity or propriety would not be minutely or critically scrutinized; but the Court ought to see that it may be the means of accomplishing the object of the grant. The degree of necessity would indeed be properly, perhaps,, the subject for the judgment of the corporation, but that it contributes in any degree, would be for the determination of the Court.\u201d And in the case of <em>Alexander &amp; Wilson vs. City of Baltimore, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>383, 398, involving the same principle, and nearly the identical question that is presented in this case, by the reasoning, and whole tenor of the opinion of the Court, it was conceded that if the proper averments had been made in the bill, the question as to the fact of special benefits would have been open to the plaintiffs on the proof; and that, too, in a case-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>where the judgment of the Mayor and City Council had been passed, as to the right of exemption of a certain locality from the special assessments. Indeed, upon no \u2022other principle would there be proper protection of private property within the limits of municipal corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The principles and right of these special assessments are just in themselves when properly applied. It is only, however, when the property assessed receives from the improvement benefits in addition to those received by the community at large, that the principle can properly apply. This, says Judge Dillon, as the result of all the author-ties, is the true and only solid foundation upon which local assessments can rest. (2 <em>Mun. Oorp., 3rd Ed., sec. </em>761.) And this is the precise ground upon which it is said by this Court that they can be supported, and none other. <em>Alexander &amp; Wilson vs. Baltimore, supra. </em>The same principle is fully affirmed in <em>Burns\u2019 Case, </em>48 <em>Md., </em>208. The special benefit, therefore, is the essential condition of the assessment. Without it, there is no power to make the assessment; and any attempt to enforce an assessment where there is no special benefit conferred is a wrong, and, if consummated, is nothing more nor less than the confiscation of private property for public use, without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Now, it is quite certain, I suppose, that it was not designed by the Act of 1874, ch. 218, to confer upon the \u2022city an arbitrary power to pass Ordinances requiring the whole or any part of the cost of the improvement of the \u25a0streets, to be assessed upon the property binding thereon, without respect to any special benefit to such property. If such was the design of the Act, I should have no hesitation in declaring it void, as transcending legislative power. That such was not the design of the Act, however, I suppose to have been decided by the case of Burns, to which I have referred. Special benefits then must be in the contemplation of the Ordinance to make it valid, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>far as the special assessments are authorized ; and the question then is, whether any such special benefits are to accrue, or whether it be merely an assumption without any foundation whatever in fact. The complainants deny that there will be any special benefits to their property whatever, and allege that the improvement is solely and exclusively for the common benefit of the public generally; and thus bring their application within the principle applied in <em>Burns\u2019 Case, </em>If, then, the principle, as a limitation upon legislative or municipal power, be worth anything, or has anything of substance in it, as a shield or protection against the invasion of the rights of private property, why not allow these complainants the benefit of it, notwithstanding the mere form of the Ordinance? To refuse their application upon such ground, would seem to be sacrificing that which is valuable and sacred to the merest form \u2014 not to say device that may, upon any occasion, be resorted to to make presumable justification for an Ordinance, when it would have none in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In the kindred and closely analagous case of taking private property for public use, by authority of the State, the opinion of the legislatj*i^ or of the municipal corporation entrusted with the exercise of the power, is never conclusive upon the question, whether the use be public for which the property is sought to be taken. The Legislature cannot make the use public by simply declaring it so; and while the necessity or expediency of the exercise of the power in all cases rests with the Legislature, either mediately or immediately, the question whether the particular use be of such public nature as will justify the exercise of the power, is purely a judicial one; and no terms can be employed in a statute or an \u25a0Ordinance sufficiently strong to conclude the question, or to exclude the Courts. No proposition is better established than this, and it has been expressly affirmed by this Court. <em>N. C. Coal Co. vs. G. C. Coal Co., </em>37 <em>Md., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>560; 2 <em>Kent Com., </em>340; <em>Deansville Cemetery Asso., </em>66 <em>N. Y., </em>569; <em>Ryerson vs. Brown, </em>35 <em>Mich., </em>333; <em>Tyler vs. Beacher, </em>44 <em>Vt., </em>648. Upon no other principle would the constitutional inhibition he of any value or protection to-the rights of private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Now, I take it to be clear, that, for the same reason that the Courts cannot he concluded upon the question of what, is a public use, the Legislature could not arbitrarily, and wholly irrespective of the fact, conclude the question here-involved, by simply declaring that special benefits to, abutting property would accrue from the particular improvement authorized, whether it he street, railway., turnpike road, or other highway, and therefore direct either the whole or a part of the cost of the improvement to he-assessed upon such property, and thus appropriate private-property to public use. And if the Legislature could not thus conclude the question, I know of no principle upon which a municipal corporation can do so by Ordinance. To say that either the Legislature or a municipal corporation can so proceed, is at once to break down all limitation or restriction as to the right, and to leave the whole matter entirely at the mercy of those who may he clothed with power to authorize the assessments. And the only answer that can be offered to the objection made to such unlimited power is, that we must not suppose that those-entrusted with its exercise will ever abuse it. But that, as we may easily perceive, is no answer at all, for it is-simply begging the whole question.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">2. The next question is\u00bf was notice of the proceedings, essential, in order either to hind the property owners personally, or to fix the assessment as a charge upon the property assessed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Neither the Act of 18V4 nor the Ordinance under which the repaving was authorized to he done, made any provision in regard to notice; and, in fact, none was given. The Ordinance, passed without notice, at once became a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>conclusively binding decree, both <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam, </em>according to present contention and decision, from which no appeal or relief can be had, however arbitrary or erroneous it may be. It is to bind not only the property \u25a0authorized to be assessed, but the owners personally, and by that means all the property that they may own. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>383; 45 <em>Md., </em>621. And such being the case, the question is, whether such results can be effected by proceedings without warning or notice to those concerned, and yet be by due process of law, or by the law of the land, as those terms are now understood and applied ?</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Of course, I am not to be understood as maintaining that taxes of any kind can only be assessed and collected by judicial proceeding. On the contrary, all taxes, under \u25a0our system, are assessed and collected by proceeding <em>in pais, </em>and those proceedings are of necessity summary in their nature. But by the term summary, as said by the Supreme Court, in <em>McMillan vs. Anderson, </em>95 <em>U. S., </em>41, is \u25a0not meant arbitrary, or unequal, or illegal. The assessment must, under both Federal and State Constitutions, be lawfully made. And in regard to notice, we know of no system of taxation in this country in which the parties affected by the assessments are not allowed, at some stage of the proceeding, an opportunity to be heard. Indeed, upon fundamental principles of right and justice, and as a guaranty of the rights of the \u2022citizen against arbitrary exactions, notice is deemed, by the Courts of the highest authority, an essential element in the legality of all assessments, whether of ordinary taxes or for special benefits ; and any mode of assessment by which it has been attempted to deny to the parties affected the right and opportunity to be heard in their defence, has been denounced as essentially vicious, and therefore inoperative and void. Without notice, therefore, no valid assessment can be made. And it is no \u2022answer to the objection of the want of notice that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>injustice has heen done in the particular case, or that the assessment has been fairly and- justly made; for the legality of the Ordinance must be tested, not by what has been done in the particular instance, but by what may be done under its sanction. And for the plain proposition that notice, in all such cases as the present, is essential to the legality of the assessment, I need only refer to the cases of <em>Overing vs. Foote, </em>65 <em>N. Y., </em>263; <em>In matter of Trustees of Public Schools, </em>31 <em>N. Y., </em>574; <em>Stuart vs. Palmer, </em>74 <em>N. Y., </em>183; <em>Philadelphia vs. </em>Miller, 49 <em>Penn St., </em>440; <em>Butler vs. Saginaw, </em>26 <em>Mich., </em>22; <em>Thomas vs. Gain, </em>35 <em>Mich., </em>155; <em>Patten vs. Green, </em>13 <em>Cal., </em>325; and to <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>265, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Due process of law, say the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Murray vs. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co., </em>18 <em>How., </em>272, is not confined to judicial proceedings, but extends to all proceedings which may affect the citizen in his rights of liberty or property. \u201c It is manifest,\u201d say that Court, \u201c that it was not left to the legislative power to enact' any process which might be devised. The Article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government, and cannot be so construed as to leave the Legislature free to make any process <em>\u2018 </em>due process of' law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d And in the cases of <em>McMillan vs. Anderson, </em>95 <em>U. S., </em>37, and <em>Davison vs. New Orleans, </em>96 <em>U. S., </em>97, the principle that the citizen is entitled to the-protection afforded by requiring \u201c due process of law,\u201d in imposing assessments upon his property, is fully recognized. But in those cases, the Court held it to be \u201c due process of law,\u201d when the statute, under which the assessments were made, gave the parties affected the right to apply to a Court of justice to determine the validity of the assessments ;\u25a0 \u2014 a privilege not accorded to the parties affected by the Ordinance involved in this case. Supposing therefore notice to be-essential to constitute \u201cdue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>process of law,\u201d in cases of assessment like the present, it is quite clear that the requirements of hoth the State- and Federal Constitutions have been wholly disregarded, in making the assessments in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In the case of <em>Thomas vs. Gain, </em>85 <em>Mich., </em>155, the question was as to the validity of an assessment authorized hy statute upon lots within a certain district, \u201cin proportion to the number of superficial feet therein,\u201d for the making of sewers. No notice to or hearing of the owners of the lots was provided for by the statute, and Judge Cooley, in delivering the opinion of the Court, declared that the parties whose property was to he taken under summary tax proceedings were entitled, as of right, to he heard at some stage in the proceedings, before the tax could become an established charge against them or their property. He said: \u201cThe principle was recognized hy this Court in <em>Butler vs. Supervisors of Saginaw, </em>26 <em>Mich., </em>22. In England, until appeals were given from sewer assessments, it was held that the party taxed might sue the officer in trespass or replevin for a levy on his property, and in that suit might defeat the assessment if he could show that he was not benefited as the Commissioners had adjudged. See <em>Dove vs. Gray, </em>2 <em>T. R., </em>358; <em>Masters vs. Scroggs, </em>3 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>447; <em>Netherton vs. Ward, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; Ald., </em>21; <em>Stafford vs. Hamston, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; B., </em>691; <em>Soady vs. Wilson, </em>3 <em>Ad. &amp; El., </em>248; <em>Emmerson vs. Saltmarsh, </em>7 <em>Id., </em>226; <em>Board of Works vs. Bridge Co., </em>1 <em>El. &amp; Bl., </em>964. In this country we do not allow the justice of the assessment to be inquired into in a suit to charge the officers with a personal liability ; hut it follows legitimately from this that parties taxed must have an opportunity to he heard regularly at some stage in the proceedings. Their rights are not to he concluded hy proceedings which are wholly <em>ex parte.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This question was very fully considered hy the Court of Appeals of New York, in the case of <em>Stuart vs. Palmer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>74 <em>N. Y., </em>183, and it was there held, that a statute imposing -an assessment for local improvement, without providing for notice to the owners of the property to he assessed, and an opportunity for them to be heard, was unconstitutional and void, as not being by \u201c due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">It is said that notice would he of no practical value or protection to the property owners, and hence it was not \u25a0necessary to be given. But that is no reason whatever, in a legal and constitutional point of view, why they \u25a0should not have notice, or why they should be denied the right to be heard before their property was actually charged \u25a0and themselves made personally liable for the amount of \u25a0the assessment. Such argument, however, has no real foundation either in reason or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The second section of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, manifestly contemplates the exercise of discretion and judgment \u25a0on the part of the Mayor and City Council, on each particular project of improvement, as to the right and propriety of assessing the cost of such improvement, in whole \u25a0or in part, <em>pro rata, </em>upon the property binding on the \u25a0street, lane, or alley, designed to be improved. Indeed, upon no other principle could the statute for a moment be sustained. The question, therefore, not only as to the propriety and need of the improvement itself, but the \u2022question of the cost, the proportion and mode of assessment-^-whether the property abutting the improvement would really be <em>specially </em>benefited thereby, and to what extent; and whether it would be more just to assess the property according to its value, its area, or its front\u25a0age, \u2014 were all questions in which the property owners were vitally interested, and in respect to which they \u25a0should have been heard. And it is only since the passage \u2022of the Act of 1874 that this extreme and severe, and as I think dangerous, experiment, of denying the right of the citizen to be heard in these cases, has ever been \u25a0attempted in the government of the City of Baltimore. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In my judgment the experiment should not he sanctioned hy this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">3rd. As to the third proposition from which I dissent, I deem it necessary to say but little.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The Legislature, by the express terms of the Act of 1874, ch. 218, repealed secs. 845, 846, 847, 848, 849 and 850, of Article 4'of the Local Code, relating to the repaving and recurbing of streets in the City of Baltimore, and providing for the assessment of a portion of the cost thereof on the abutting, property, <em>in proportion to its front </em>feet\u201e Why this rule of assessment was entirely repealed, and in no form re-enacted, if it was not intended by the Legislature to get rid of it altogether, it is difficult to conjecture. The Legislature manifestly had a design in the repeal of the rule, and I think it is not difficult to perceivv the reason upon which they acted. By the repealing Act of 1874, the system which had previously prevailed up to that time, of only providing for repaving and recurbing the streets upon the application of two-thirds of the property owners along the street proposed to be improved, was abolished. The consent or application of the property owners was, by that Act, dispensed with, in those cases contemplated by the second section of the Act; and with that change it was but reasonable and proper that the arbitrary and unreasonable rule of assessment in proportion to the number of front feet should be abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">What reason or justice is there in imposing the same amount of assessment on a given number of front feet of a lot only ten feet deep, with small or no improvement on it, as upon one two hundred feet deep, with large and valuable improvements thereon? And the same inequality, and consequent injustice, exist in the different localities of lots along the same street. The fundamental principle of taxation, that of equality according to value, is grossly violated in the application of this front foot rule; and it can therefore be no matter of surprise, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ought it to he of regret, that the Legislature saw reason for abolishing it altogether. And this I take to be their declared meaning in the express repeal of section 845 Of Article 4 of the Local Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">For the reasons I have stated, I am of opinion that the decree of the Court below, declaring the assessments void, ought to he affirmed by this- Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
