This raises the question of the sufficiency of the averments of the bill to enable the complainant to have the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Without dwelling upon other objections raised to the bill, it is sufficient for the purposes of the question presented by the demurrer to say, that even if there is no such corporation as the Turnpike Company named, and if there has not been constructed a road bed sixteen feet wide, for three miles in length, as required by the charter as a pre-requisite to the right to charge and collect tolls, and if there was in fact no such corporation as the Frederick and Woodsborough Turnpike Company, the rate of whose tolls was to be the measure of the charges of the defendant company, as prescribed by its charter, and no right to charge tolls therefore existed, and if the road in question is a public road or highway over which the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>plainant has a right to travel without obstruction, then the complainant has simply made out a case of a public nuisance by the erection of the toll-gate ; and not having shown that he has suffered from it some special and. particular damage, different in kind and degree from that experienced in common with other citizens, or that he has suffered, or is likely to suffer any irreparable injury or damage, he has not presented such a case as would entitle him even to a civil action for damages, much less to the protective interposition of a Court of equity. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. vs. Marriott, </em>9 <em>Md., </em>160; <em>Houck vs. Wachter, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>266; <em>Kerb\u2019s Inj. in Eq., (2nd Ed.,) </em>167; <em>Wood on Law of Nuis. passim; Del. &amp; Md.
