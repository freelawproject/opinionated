Entering the shop the plaintiff walked by a \u201clong vegetable counter\u201d on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>right. Reaching the end of the counter she proceeded to turn and \u201cwalk past the end of the counter.\u201d On the end of this counter were displayed \u201cboxes of squash\u201d which were \u201c.raised on some other boxes or bags and which were tilted in a slanting direction backward.\u201d Turning at the end of this counter the plaintiff \u201cfelt . . . [her] heel get caught in something hard . . . \u2018stiff like,\u2019\u201d and she \u201cskidded right down, falling on . . . [her] back in a twisting way . . . [she] could feel .. . . [her] foot skid in something that was underneath . . . [her] right foot.\u201d There was a \u201cbig skid\u201d mark where the plaintiff fell. When she arose she saw that what she slid on was \u201csquash seeds . . . like shavings and seeds too, all the center of the squash . . . and it was all dirty and grimy looking.\u201d It was about a foot in area. Some of the seeds that were on the floor were very dirty and black, some of the seeds were still sticking into the \u201cmass\u201d that remained on the floor; others, dislodged by the plaintiff\u2019s foot, were of a yellow color and lighter than those that were left. Some of the seeds that adhered to the' plaintiff\u2019s shoe were \u201cvery dirty looking . . . very black looking.\u201d The \u201cmass\u201d that remained on the floor not affected by the \u201cskid mark,\u201d the \u201cinside of the squash,\u201d was \u201cdark and stringy looking.\u201d The distance from the boxes of squashes to the place where the plaintiff fell was about \u201cone . . . foot or a little more.\u201d In these boxes there were some whole squashes and different sized pieces of cut squash, and \u201cas you looked at the boxes you could see the seeds and all the other insides of the squash.\u201d There were \u201cshells or seeds from\u2018squash [on the floor] . . . the stringy section and the spongy section.\u201d It was \u201cdirty, kind of gritty, just as if it had been stepped on or walked on. It was located just about where . . . [the plaintiff] fell.\u201d The \u201csubstance on the floor took up an area of about a foot. ... It was like a mound . . . dirty, black and sooty, gritty and just black.\u201d The mound was about one half inch in thickness, \u201csomething like a pancake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">The jury found for the plaintiff in each case, but under reserved leave the judge entered a verdict in each case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the defendant, to which action the plaintiffs duly excepted. We are of opinion that this action of the judge was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">The principles governing the duty of the defendant to those entering its store for the purpose of purchasing goods are firmly established to the effect that the defendant was bound to use due care to keep that portion of the premises provided for the use of its patrons in a reasonably safe condition, and to warn them of any dangers that might arise from such use by reason of a condition of the premises, which were not likely to be known to its patrons and of which the defendant knew or ought to have known. <em>Heina </em>v. <em>Broadway Fruit Market, Inc. </em>304 Mass. 608, 610, and cases cited. <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Park Enterprises, Inc. </em>313 Mass. 454, 457-458.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The defendant argues, however, that the evidence would not warrant the jury in finding that any agent or servant of the defendant caused the squash, upon which the plaintiff slipped, to be upon the floor, or that any employee of the defendant was in a position to see the foreign substance upon the floor, or that it had been there \u201csufficiently long to charge the defendant with knowledge of its presence and reasonable opportunity to remove it.\u201d In support of these contentions the defendant argues that there was no evidence to show that any employee of the defendant was \u201canywhere in the vicinity\u201d where the plaintiff fell, directing attention to the fact that the accident occurred in a \u201cStop and Shop\u201d market where \u201cthe customers waited upon themselves,\u201d and urging that the condition of the squash upon which the plaintiff fell, as described by the plaintiff and other witnesses, was not sufficient to warrant a finding that it had been on the floor long enough to enable the defendant to discover and remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The evidence, however, would have warranted the jury in finding that customers of the defendant\u2019s market did not wait upon thernselves in purchasing squash, that they did not pick out the squash, but that it would be measured for them and weighed by an employee of the defendant at the vegetable counter and delivered to the customer. The jury could also have found that the boxes of squash were placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by servants or agents of the defendant upon the counter for those purposes, and could have inferred that it was necessary therefor that some employee of the defendant be present at or near the vegetable counter at the time of the accident, referred to by the defendant in its brief as a \"busy evening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the jury would haye been warranted in finding on the evidence that the piece of squash involved was dropped on the floor by one of the defendant\u2019s employees in placing the boxes containing squash split into different sections on the vegetable counter, or was caused to fall upon the floor by the tilted position of the boxes on the counter, since we are of opinion that, at least, the jury could have found that the mound of squash \"about a foot\u201d in area, lying upon the floor about a foot from the place on the vegetable counter where the boxes of squash were resting, had been on the floor long enough to have been removed before the accident, and that it had remained on the floor until the time of the injury because of negligence of the defendant. The character of the substance, its consistency, its sticky mass, its grimy, dirty color, its size and general appearance, would have warranted the jury in making the findings just referred to. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>293 Mass. 232, 234. <em>Connair </em>v. <em>J. H. Beattie Co. </em>298 Mass. 550, 551. <em>Bavosi </em>v. <em>Interstate Theatres Cory. </em>307 Mass. 124, 125, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In each case the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the entry of a verdict for the defendant under the reserved leave is sustained and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
