G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 8. The single member\u2019s decision contains the following findings of fact: On July 21, 1937, while in the employ of the Compo Shoe Machinery Corporation and engaged in his work of assembling machines, the employee scratched the middle finger of his right hand. Two days later he was admitted to a hospital on account of an infection in that finger, and on July 25, 1937, he was operated upon for an abscess overlying the \u201cdistal phalange\u201d of the finger. On August 13, two \u201cphalanges\u201d of the finger were amputated. On August 27, 1937, he was discharged from the hospital though \u201cstill running a slight septic temperature.\u201d He was readmitted to the hospital on August 30 and remained there until October 16, 1937, for care of this condition of his finger and an \u201cabscess of his left buttock and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>a phlebitis of the left leg.\u201d Later, an extensive swelling of the left leg developed and extended \"from the toes up to the groin.\u201d There was \"pitting edema present over the tibia,\u201d and at that time \u201chis case was diagnosed as \u2018 a deep phlebitis\u2019 or a \u2018lymphangitis with blocking of lymphatic.\u2019\u201d Prior to his injury he had enjoyed good health but since his injury \"he has never been entirely free from symptoms.\u201d He was paid compensation under approved agreements \u201cup to January 3, 1938, when he signed an agreement to discontinuance of compensation and returned to work.\u201d Since July 15, 1940, he has been unable to work or even to walk properly. On July 24, 1940, he was admitted to the Baker Memorial Hospital for study because of inability to get about actively and because of weakness in his left leg and left arm. On March 28, 1941, he was admitted to the Boston City Hospital for study by an impartial neurosurgeon, Dr. Munro, and on February 18, 1942, was examined by Dr. Allen, designated as an impartial physician, who was a specialist in vascular diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Following these findings the single member summarized the testimony of Dr. Sziklas, a general surgeon who had been called as witness by the employee, to the effect that in his opinion \u201cthe employee had a blood stream infection, the germs of which entered the system originally through the infected finger; that this blood stream infection has produced a neuritis and inflammation of the spinal cord which was the cause of the employee\u2019s disability\u201d; that \u201cthere must be something wrong with the spinal cord, which he calls inflammation\u201d; that he did \"not know whether there was anything that would point out the presence of specific bacteria that would have effect on the spinal cord\u201d; that he \u201cjust argues \u2018that there must be some such agent there,\u2019\u201d but had \"not heard of a case like this or read about one in literature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The single member then contrasted the testimony of that doctor with that of the impartial neurosurgeon, Dr. Munro, to the effect that the employee was then suffering from a chronic degenerative disease of the spinal cord (and possibly of the cerebellum) which may be either \u201cmultiple sclerosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d; t-hat neither of these conditions is industrial and in the light of the employee\u2019s history \u201cneither can be ascribed to such an antecedent cause as is present in this patient\u201d; that in his opinion his present condition \u201chas no significant relationship with the injury that he sustained in July, 1937\u201d; that it is \u201cdebatable as to whether or not his present disability is contributed to in a small way by the residual phlebitis and the associated impaired circulation in the left leg\u201d; that although \u201ccertainly present . . . [he] believe[s] that it is of little significance in relation to his activity and his ability to work,\u201d but that such as it is \u201cthis part of his symptoms may be and should be traced to the infection in his finger in July, 1937.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The single member then referred to the testimony of Dr. Allen, the impartial vascular expert, to the effect that the employee has a little residual swelling from the phlebitis which followed his injury, but that all people who have had phlebitis have some residual swelling and that this, although annoying, does not handicap them from the usual occupations, and would not handicap the employee \u201cif he had not had an intercurrent condition develop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The single member after contrasting the testimony of Dr. Munro and Dr. Sziklas, in terms tending to indicate that he placed more reliance upon the opinions expressed by Dr. Munro, concluded his decision thus: \u201cIn view of the foregoing evidence and inferences therefrom, I find and rule that this employee has failed to sustain his burden of proving that any disability which he had subsequent to July 15, 1940, was related to his injury of July 21, 1937. His claim for further compensation is therefore and hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">After the proceedings before the single member and the filing of an impartial report by Dr. Allen, the employee filed certain documents which \u201che styled as follows: \u2018William F. Amon Motion to Strike Out Medical Report and Claim an Exception if not Struck Out,\u2019 and \u2018William A. Amon Claim of Exceptions.\u2019 These documents [the single member stated] apparently raise an objection to all of Dr. Allen\u2019s report generally, together with the questions put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>to him by the board member and to certain parts of Dr. Allen\u2019s reports specifically. No reasons are set forth in either one for the objection raised and said objections are overruled and said motions, if they mean motions, are denied.\u201d This action of the single member was not erroneous. See <em>Indrisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In their findings and decision upon review, the board recited that the employee presented several papers to the board \u201ctitled\u201d as follows: \u201c(1) William F. Amon\u2019s motion to dismiss this action for lack of jurisdiction. (2) Employee\u2019s bill of exceptions. (3) William F. Amon\u2019s motion to strike the following evidence from the single member\u2019s report. (4) William F. Amon request for rulings of law. (5) Plaintiff\u2019s brief on the law. All such papers are made part of this record by reference.\u201d The board denied his motion to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction, and his motion to strike out certain evidence; and declined to act with reference to his bill of exceptions and to act upon his requests for rulings, having stated that the \u201creport and decision of the single member and this decision\u201d of the board \u201ccontain all the evidence and constitute the record in the case.\u201d The board on consideration of all the evidence affirmed and adopted th\u00e9 findings and decision of the single member, and denied the employee\u2019s claim for further compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is settled that the decision of the board \u201cis to stand unless it is unsupported by the evidence, including all rational inferences that the testimony permitted.\u201d <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, ante, </em>75, 76, and cases cited. An examination of the evidence discloses that, with respect to whether the disability for which claim is now made was a consequence of the original injury sustained by the employee, the testimony was conflicting. The testimony of Dr. Sziklas would warrant a finding that the present disability did arise out of the original injury, which arose out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment. On the other hand, there was evidence that would warrant a finding that it was not causally related to the original injury. The burden of prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ing by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the disability for which claim is now made was due to an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment rested upon the employee. <em>Rozek\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 205, 207-208. <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 155. <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, ante, </em>75, 76. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony were for the determination of the single member and the board. <em>Mallory\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 225, 227. <em>Griffin\u2019s Case, ante, </em>71, 73. The question for determination in the present case was one of fact, the answer to which largely, if not wholly, depended upon the testimony of persons skilled in such matters. The board adopted the findings and decision of the single member, upon \u201call the evidence,\u201d which, except as to parts not in controversy, consisted of the testimony of the physicians which the single member summarized in his decision, and of other physicians, which is reproduced in great detail. We are of opinion that on all the evidence it cannot be rightly said that the board were not justified in concluding, as did the single member, that they were not satisfied that the employee had sustained the burden of establishing his claim. They were not required to believe the testimony of Dr. Sziklas, and the conclusion reached by the board was tantamount in effect and result to a finding that the disability for which claim is now made did not result from an injury arising out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment. See <em>Judkins\u2019s Case, post, </em>226. Such a finding would be warranted on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">There was no error in the denial by the board of the employee\u2019s requests for rulings, for the reasons that are fully stated in <em>Belezarian\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">There was no error in the action of the board in declining to consider the employee\u2019s so called bill of exceptions. The exceptions to the admission or exclusion of evidence in the proceedings before the single member could not avail the employee. Questions of evidence are not brought to the Superior Court unless shown to have been raised before the reviewing board, and bills of exceptions are unknown in workmen\u2019s compensation cases. The rules governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>practice relative to perfecting exceptions before the reviewing board in such cases are fully set forth in <em>Indrisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520, with citation of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The board did not err in denying the employee\u2019s motion to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. In this regard the employee contends that he erred in bringing his claim to the Industrial Accident Board, arguing that the proceeding is one in truth to enforce the original agreement, a proceeding of which only the Superior Court has jurisdiction under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended. This contention is untenable. The present proceeding is not one to enforce the original agreement for compensation, but is one for further compensation under the right reserved in the agreement for discontinuance. The agreement for compensation is a final determination of the facts of liability, employment and injury arising out of and in the course of employment. But it is not a final determination of the extent of the injury or the payment to be made (except as to payments for the period covered, see <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 153), and the mere filing of such an agreement does not, once it has been ended as in the present case under \u00a7\u00a7 12, 29, deprive the Industrial Accident Board forever of jurisdiction to entertain a claim for further compensation arising out of the same occurrence. <em>MacKinnon\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 37, 38-39, and cases cited. <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 153, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The attack made by the employee upon the qualifications of the impartial physicians and upon their examinations, because they were based in part on hospital records made by others, is without merit. There is nothing in the record to show that their testimony was not based in the last analysis upon their own study of the employee, and nothing to show any disqualification or lack of qualification on their part. See <em>Mattison\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">There was no error in the action of the board in refusing to recommit the record to the single member for certification of twenty-nine papers of one character or another which had been presented to the single member, nor in the action of the board in refusing to certify them because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201ccertifying all papers which . . . [Vere] properly part of the evidence\u201d and would certify no others. An examination of the list of papers, some of which are in fact set out in the record, discloses no error. It is \u201cthe duty of the board so to deal with cases before it that when a certified copy of the record is presented to the Superior Court, that court can determine with reasonable certainty whether or not correct rules of law have been applied to facts which could properly be found.\u201d <em>Di Clavio\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 259, 261-262. <em>Belezarian\u2019s </em>Case, 307 Mass. 557, 560. The record discloses no failure on the part of the board in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Other contentions of the employee need not be considered. They are all disposed of by what we have said above.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
