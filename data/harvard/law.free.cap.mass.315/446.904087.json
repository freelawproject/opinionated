The plaintiff, who was fifty-three years old, came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>defendant\u2019s building one evening to attend a banquet of the County Fermanagh Association, hereinafter to be referred to as the association. The banquet was to be served by a caterer employed by the association, in halls on the first floor of the defendant\u2019s building. The plaintiff had purchased a ticket from the association which entitled her to attend the banquet. She seeks to recover damages from the defendant for injuries received by her when a group of boys running through the lobby on the first floor of the defendant\u2019s building struck and injured her.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">At the close of the evidence introduced by the plaintiff the trial judge directed a verdict for the defendant and reported the case to this court on the agreement of the parties that if the direction of the verdict was correct it should stand, but if the judge erred a finding should be entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Pertinent evidence is here summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">1. The defendant, for a consideration, licensed the association to use, on the evening when the plaintiff was injufed, two banquet halls on the first floor of the defendant\u2019s building, and also to use, in common with other persons rightfully there, the lobby on the first floor. Control of the lobby was retained by the defendant. Findings were warranted that at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury the lobby was being used for a public or semipublic purpose; that the plaintiff was within the class of persons whose presence there was contemplated by the defendant; and that the plaintiff was a business visitor with respect to the defendant since she was there in the right of the association for a purpose for which the defendant was paid. The defendant on these findings owed to the plaintiff the duty to use reasonable care to put and keep the lobby of the building in a reasonably safe condition for the purpose for which it was to be used. <em>Shrigley </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony </em>Orchestra, <em>Inc. </em>287 Mass. 300, 302. <em>Colbert </em>v. Ricker, 314 Mass. 138, 140, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">2. The plaintiff arrived at the defendant\u2019s building on the evening of her injury shortly after seven o\u2019clock. While waiting in the vestibule for a friend for ten or fifteen minutes, she saw a group of boys \u2014 who later injured her \u2014 twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>run out of the building and twice run back again. They appeared to be fourteen or fifteen y\u00e9ars old. They were dressed in overalls. Two of them had newspapers under their arms. They were \u201crunning wild . . . like wild Indians, pushing each other.\u201d They were \u201cpushing people upstairs and down.\u201d Later, when the plaintiff entered the lobby, she saw the same boys \u201ccoming down the stairs [from the second floor] again.\u201d She saw them \u201cpushing and trying to get out and going by the other people that were standing; they were running at all times.\u201d Still later at about eight-thirty o\u2019clock, while waiting in the lobby with others for the banquet hall doors to be opened, she saw the same boys come \u201crunning out\u201d of one of the banquet halls. Although there was room for them to pass her safely they struck her, throwing her to the marble floor of the lobby and injuring her.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">A man named Armstrong, a member of the banquet committee of the Fermanagh Association, arrived at the defendant\u2019s building on the evening in question between seven-thirty and eight o\u2019clock. A few minutes after he arrived he saw a group of boys come \u201crushing in around the doors\u201d and upstairs toward the superintendent\u2019s office on the second floor and then go down to the basement. Later he saw the same boys in the lobby, \u201ccoming along jostling against everybody, knocking anything that was in people\u2019s hands out of their hands.\u201d They went by him and tried to get into the banquet hall but he stopped them. The boys were on the premises going up and down stairs for thirty-five or forty minutes before he saw the plaintiff injured by them at about eight-thirty o\u2019clock. Twenty minutes before the plaintiff was hurt, Armstrong made an effort to get someone to eject the boys. There was an electric bell, with a button outside the door of the superintendent\u2019s office on the second floor, which, when rung, could be heard anywhere in the entire building. Armstrong went to the bell and rang it. He waited awhile and rang it again. He rang it a third time but no one responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The defendant\u2019s superintendent testified that on the evening in question there were about two hundred persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>attending the banquet on the first floor and twelve hundred to fourteen hundred persons in the dance halls on the second, third and fourth floors of the building. It did not appear that any employee of the defendant, other than the superintendent, was in the building on the night when the plaintiff was injured. He testified that he was in the building from seven o\u2019clock until after the plaintiff was hurt, but he did not \u201crecall hearing the bell\u201d when Armstrong rang it; that at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury he was in his office on the second floor; and that for half an hour prior to that time he was making \u201ca routine survey of the building.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor Armstrong, both of whom knew the superintendent, saw him that evening until after the plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">The superintendent had held that position for about eighteen months before the evening when the plaintiff was injured and prior thereto was for three years assistant to a former superintendent. He testified that he saw no boys in the building on the night of the plaintiff\u2019s injury and that \u201che never saw any gangs\u201d of boys there and \u201cnever had to put out any gangs of boys.\u201d But the witness Armstrong testified that for many years he was at the building about five nights a week, and that within a year preceding the night of the plaintiff\u2019s injury he had seen boys running around the building and acting as did the boys who were there on the night the plaintiff was injured. He had in the past made complaints as to this condition in the building and, upon receiving such complaints, the superintendent put such boys out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The plaintiff testified that she had attended many banquets at the defendant\u2019s building in the two years next preceding the night when she was injured. On such occasions she had always seen boys there, dressed in old clothes or overalls. At times they would be very rough. They- would run up and down stairs and push their way through people who were standing in the lobby awaiting the opening of the doors to the banquet halls. They would try to get into the banquet halls, and at times they would gain entrance and would come running out with ice cream, cake and other edibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>A witness who had been superintendent of the building up to eighteen months before the plaintiff\u2019s injury testified that, during his employment, boys in working clothes would enter the building, run through the corridors and disturb caterers and members of organizations hiring halls for banquets. Constant supervision was necessary to prevent such disturbances. Sometimes such boys would strike the witness and sometimes he would take them into court. Since the witness had ceased to be superintendent he had been at the building and observed no changes so far as the conduct of such boys on the defendant\u2019s premises was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">3. The defendant was not an insurer of the plaintiff\u2019s safety while she was in its building. It, however, owed her the duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for her use while she was there. If a dangerous condition arose on the premises while the plaintiff was there, the law allowed a reasonable opportunity to the defendant\u2019s superintendent to learn of the danger and to take measures to remedy it. <em>White </em>v. <em>Mugar, </em>280 Mass. 73, 75. <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>E. M. Loew's, Inc. </em>302 Mass. 309, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">But, for an hour at least before the plaintiff was injured, the group of boys who finally caused her harm were running in and around the lobby on the first floor of the building and so conducting themselves as to constitute a potential danger to the plaintiff and other persons who were rightfully in the lobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The superintendent by looking from the hallways on any of the three upper stories of the building could see the entire lobby, and the ringing of the bell on the second floor could be heard by him if he was anywhere in the building. He did not hear the bell when it was rung nor did he, so far as appears, take advantage of the opportunity to view conditions in the lobby from any of the three upper floors of the building. A jury would not be obliged to accept his testimony that he made a \u201croutine survey\u201d of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The defendant contends that the turbulent conduct of the boys in the lobby during the hour preceding the injury to the plaintiff was a \u201csporadic act\u201d which could not reasonably have been foreseen by the superintendent. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>there was evidence that during the eighteen months when he was superintendent, and earlier, when he was for three years assistant superintendent, whenever there were banquets held in the building groups of boys would enter the lobby and run in and out of the building and act much the same as did the boys who injured the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The evidence warranted a finding by a jury that the superintendent did not use reasonable care to keep the lobby of the defendant\u2019s building in a safe condition for the purpose for which it was used by the plaintiff. <em>Shrigley </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony </em>Orchestra, <em>Inc. </em>287 Mass. 300, 302, and cases cited. <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Bancroft Hotel Corp. </em>313 Mass. 56, 59, 60. <em>Colbert </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>314 Mass. 138, 139-140.
