The petition was filed on October 21, 1942, and the case was referred to a master. The master found that the parties were married in-Worcester on January 22, 1907, and had lived continuously in that city since that date. On the day when the first hearing was held before the master, the parties were living in the same house, together with a daughter Donna. The master also found that the respondent, \u201cby his conduct and accur sations, by the use of vile and intemperate language and the laying of hands upon his wife and his daughter in the wife\u2019s presence, was guilty of cruel and abusive treatment toward the petitioner,\u201d that she is fearful of her husband and for the past two years has slept in her room under lock and key; and further reported that, if it was \u201cwithin . . . [his] province to make any recommendation as to a reasonable amount for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>allowance in case separate support is decreed,\u201d a reasonable amount would be $10 a week. These ultimate findings were amply supported by the subsidiary findings of the master and were expressly stated to be based upon the subsidiary findings of the master. See <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Anna Jaques Hospital, </em>301 Mass. 431. The report of the master was filed on January 20, 1943. On February 8, 1943, the petitioner filed a supplementary or second petition reciting that \"during the hearing\u201d the respondent had left the home and that they had been separated since; and praying that she be allowed to give further evidence before the master \u201cfor the purpose of determining this fact,\u201d and that the \"evidence already submitted be taken de bene\u201d in connection with the supplementary petition. An order of reference to the same master was made by the judge as follows: \"In the matter of the supplementary separate support petition of Petronella Stoskus of said Worcester, against Adam P. Stoskus, of Worcester, in said county of Worcester, it is ordered that Emil Zaeder of said Worcester, be, and hereby he is, appointed special master in the above mentioned matter, to hear the parties interested, examine vouchers and evidence., find the facts since the filing of the first petition for separate support. He shall consider all evidence already received on the first petition and reported by him, as taken de bene on the second petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">On April 23,1943, the master filed his report on the second petition, in which he adopted the findings made by him in his first report and made '' them part of this report. \u2019 \u2019 He further found that the respondent left the home which he had occupied with his family on January 4, 1943; that this was the date of the first - hearing before him (the master) on the original reference; that since that date the parties had been living apart; and that the petitioner was living apart from the respondent for justifiable cause. It does not appear that any objections were filed to the master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On May 20,1943, the judge allowed the motion of the petitioner that the master\u2019s report be confirmed except as to his recommendation \"for $10 a week to . . . [the] petitioner.\u201d On the same day the judge entered a final decree in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>found that the petitioner was living apart from the respondent for justifiable cause, and ordered him to pay to the petitioner for the support of herself \u201cand said minor child\u201d $16 forthwith and the same sum weekly until the further order of the court. The reference in the decree to the support of the minor child is apparently due to clerical error in filling out the printed form of decree since all the children of the parties are of full age. The respondent appealed from the interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report (with the reservation before noted) and from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The respondent\u2019s contentions are that the petitioner is not entitled to a decree of separate support on any ground other than failure to support, an alleged ground waived by the petitioner at the hearing before the master, unless she was actually living apart from the respondent when the proceeding was commenced; that the \u201csupplementary\u201d petition constituted nothing more than an amendment of the original petition; and that \u201csince it failed to assert that the parties were living apart on October 21, 1942, the date when the original petition was filed,\u201d it added nothing to her case. The respondent further contends, in the alternative, that if the \u201csupplementary\u201d petition be regarded as a new petition, he was entitled to try out all the issues anew, and that \u201cthe consideration of evidence or findings in the earlier case was improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">It is unnecessary to decide whether, as matter of law, a wife can maintain a petition such as the present one except for the cause of failure to provide suitable support (a cause waived by the petitioner in the present case) while living in the same dwelling as her husband, since we are of opinion that the so called supplementary petition, while so denominated, is in essence a new petition, alleging that the respondent had left the abode in which he had last lived with the petitioner, where she remains, and incorporating in its allegations by reference those contained in the first petition, and that it is not in the nature of an amendment to the original petition which would not suffice td create a cause of action if none existed when the original petition was brought. See <em>Childs </em>v. Childs, 293 Mass. 67, 72. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>pare <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>293 Mass. 495, 499. The character of a pleading or other paper filed in a cause is to be determined from its essential substance rather than from its descriptive title or name. <em>E. S. Parks Shellac Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>265 Mass. 108, 110. <em>Universal Adjustment Corp. </em>v. <em>Midland Bank, Ltd. </em>281 Mass. 303, 328. <em>Beaman-Marvell Co. </em>v. <em>Marvell, </em>305 Mass. 246, 247. Thus considered, as before noted, we treat the so called supplementary petition, as did the parties and the judge, as a new petition brought when the parties were actually living apart in separate places of abode:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We proceed to the consideration of the respondent\u2019s alternative contention, that in the disposition of the second petition the judge was not authorized to consider the evidence which was the basis of the findings of the master in his report upon the first petition, which findings he incorporated in his report upon the new petition. We are of opinion that this contention cannot be sustained. We have already recited the terms of the order of the judge in referring the new petition to the master. No appeal was taken by the respondent from that order. In the absence of such an appeal it cannot be said that the' findings of the master in his report on the first petition, incorporated by reference in his report upon the new-petition, were not properly considered by the judge. The case of <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>294 Mass. 507, 509-510, relied upon by the respondent, is not in point. There is no question of res judicata in the present case as there was in the <em>Olsen </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u2022The final decree entered in the court below is to be modified by striking from the last paragraph thereof the words \u201cand said minor child,\u201d and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
