The trial judge found for the plaintiff. The Appellate Division ordered the report dismissed, and the defendant appealed. There are no findings of fact apart from the general finding for the plaintiff and findings that were made in connection with the judge\u2019s disposition of some of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">There was evidence that on June 24, 1941, a check of the plaintiff for $900 was \u201cadvanced\u201d to one Irving and used by him in the purchase of the automobile in question. On June 27, the plaintiff\u2019s assistant treasurer went with Irving to a bank where a loan was arranged from the bank to Irving, the note being indorsed by the plaintiff through its assistant treasurer. \u201cAt the same time\u201d Irving executed a note secured by a mortgage of the automobile in the sum of $1,500, \u201cwhich mortgage was to secure the plaintiff . . . against any liability on its endorsement on the note to the . . . Bank and such further indebtedness as might accrue from the transactions between the plaintiff . . . and Irving.\u201d The automobile was registered in Irving\u2019s name, his residence being given as Boston, and the mortgage was recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of that city. Subsequently to the giving of the mortgage Irving received \u201cfurther advances\u201d from the plaintiff and made some payments, so that at the time of the alleged conversion the balance due the plaintiff was $1,427.17. Irving testified that he paid to the plaintiff\u2019s assistant treasurer the $900 that he borrowed at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The mortgage contains the following recitals: \u201cin consideration of Fifteen Hundred . . . dollars paid by . . . [the plaintiff] . . . the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged . . . ,\u201d and \u201cThis mortgage is given as security for present indebtedness, on open account and to secure for any future debts or advances which may be made while this mortgage is in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendant requested sixteen rulings of law. The report states that the defendant claimed to be aggrieved by the judge\u2019s refusal to rule as requested with respect to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>quests numbered 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The defendant in its brief expressly waives its appeal in so far as it relates to requests numbered 12, 13 and 15.. It has not argued requests numbered 6 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">The fourth request, which was denied, is: \u201cIn the case at bar, as a matter of law, there was 'no present indebtedness on an open account owed by the mortgagor to the mortgagee,\u2019 as alleged in said mortgage as part of the consideration.\u201d Whether there was any present indebtedness or an open account owed by the mortgagor at the time the mortgage was given was a question of fact. Irving testified that he paid the plaintiff the $900 that he borrowed at the bank. We are of opinion that it was open on the evidence for the judge to find, as we think he did, that the mortgage had been executed before the $900 was paid to the plaintiff. This being so, it is unnecessary to consider whether the judge\u2019s refusal to give the fourth request might well be based upon the fact that it embodies merely a fragment of the issues involved. Moreover, it is unnecessary to do more than cite cases in which mortgages given as security for a present indebtedness or for future advances, or as indemnity for indorsing notes, have been considered. See <em>Badlam </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>1 Pick. 389, 398; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>10 Pick. 199, 202; <em>Commercial Bank </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>24 Pick. 270, 274; <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>9 Allen, 78, 79; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>128 Mass. 102, 103; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tay, </em>131 Mass. 192, 194-195; <em>Ettridge </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>136 Mass. 314, 317; <em>Banca Italiana Di Sconto </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>260 Mass. 151, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">There was no error in the denial of the fifth request, which is to the effect that the provision of the mortgage relative to security for future debts or advances is insufficient \u201cto support a valid consideration to the execution of the said mortgage.\u201d We think it sufficiently appears, as already indicated, that the judge found that there was a present indebtedness which constituted a part of the consideration for the mortgage. It may be observed again that it is unnecessary to consider whether this request comes within the fragment rule so called.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The defendant has argued that the finding for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tiff is inconsistent with rulings that the judge made, substantially to the effect that the loan and advances to Irving were ultra vires. But this point is not presented by the report. <em>Langdoc </em>v. <em>Gevaert Co. of America, Inc., ante, </em>8.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
