The case was tried before a judge and a jury. Upon motion of the defendant a verdict was directed for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted. The verdict was directed rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">There was evidence that the defendant conducted a store for the sale of various kinds of merchandise, having a market department for the sale of meats, vegetables and groceries, and that when the plaintiff was in the market department for the purpose of making a purchase she slipped and fell and thereby sustained personal injuries. The evidence of the circumstances attending the plaintiff\u2019s slipping and falling was as follows: The floor of the market \u201cwas made of smooth, hard wood.\u201d The plaintiff \u201cwas walking to the vegetable counter to get some soup vegetables.\u201d At \u201ca point at the vegetable counter in the aisle between the meat and vegetable counters,\u201d the plaintiff \u201cstepped on a peapod which was lying on the floor and slipped and fell.\u201d The peapod was \u201ccrushed.\u201d The plaintiff testified that \u201cthe floor looked clean,\u201d that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything on the floor\u201d but she \u201cdidn\u2019t pay no particular attention to it, there was so many people coming in you couldn\u2019t tell,\u201d that there were \u201ca lot of people going in and out all the time,\u201d and that they \u201cwere all over the store, going back and up.\u201d She further testified that the peapod was \u201cflat, ragged and dark\u201d and that it was \u201ccrushed,\u201d that she knew that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\"slipped on it\u201d and she \"guess[ed] it had been crushed before . . . [she] got hurt,\u201d but that she did not know that. Another witness testified that there was \"a peapod, that it was dark and crushed and dirty, and . . . there were no peas inside it.\u201d It was agreed that another witness, if present at the trial, would have testified that the peapod \u201chad the appearance of being raggedy, crushed, and dirty, and that there were no peas in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">There was no evidence of the presence or absence of employees of the defendant at any place in the store. There was no evidence tending to show where the peapod came from or how it came to be upon the floor of the store, unless, from the evidence that the defendant sold \"vegetables\u201d and that the peapod was near the vegetable counter, it could be inferred, as we need not decide, that the peapod came from that counter. Apart from such an inference there was nothing in the evidence to show that the defendant sold peas, or that there were any peas or peapods in the store other than the peapod upon which the plaintiff slipped. But even if it could be found that the peapod came from the vegetable counter, there was no evidence that it fell from that counter to the floor, or came to the floor in any other way by means of any act or negligence of an employee of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention, however, is that the evidence warranted a finding that the peapod was on the floor \"long enough so that the defendant, in the exercise of reasonable diligence and care, ought to have discovered it and removed it from the floor\u201d and consequently that the defendant was negligent. The reliance of the plaintiff for support of such a finding is and must be upon the evidence of the appearance of the peapod. There was no other evidence tending to support such a finding and this evidence is not enough, particularly in view of the testimony of the plaintiff that there were many people in the store. The appearance of the pea-pod as described in the evidence might have been created in a very short time \u2014 so short a time that the defendant in the exercise of its duty of care was not bound to discover the presence of the peapod on the floor. A contrary finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was not warranted. The case in this respect falls within the class of cases of which <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>296 Mass. 489, is an example. The evidence in the present case falls short of the evidence in the case of <em>Connair </em>v. <em>J. H. Beattie Co. </em>298 Mass. 550, relied on by the plaintiff, which was held sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
