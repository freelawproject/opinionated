The object of the action is to recover the sum of $300 which came into the hands of the defendant in the manner hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">There is little or no genuine dispute about what we regard as the decisive facts. The plaintiff insured Francis D. Campion against damage to his automobile by collision. Campion\u2019s automobile was in collision with an automobile owned by one Cohen and driven by one Sigel, and was damaged. The plaintiff paid Campion $450 under the terms of its policy and took from him so called \u201csubrogation agreements\u201d by which, as therein stated, he \u201csubrogates\u201d the plaintiff \u201cto all rights and causes of action\u201d he has \u201cagainst any person, persons or Corporations whomsoever\u201d for damage to his automobile and empowers the plaintiff \u201cto sue, compromise or settle\u201d in his name or otherwise. But Campion also sustained personal injury by the collision, and through the defendant as his attorney, he brought actions against Cohen and Sigel for personal injury, with a separate count in each case for property damage. The plaintiff, through its attorney, notified the defendant and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, which carried Cohen\u2019s liability insurance, that the plaintiff had been subrogated to Campion\u2019s claim for property damage, and notified the defendant that any recovery for such damage should be accounted for to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney also entered his appearance for Campion in Campion\u2019s action against Cohen. Thereafter the defendant, as Campion\u2019s attorney, settled his actions against Cohen and Sigel with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, Cohen\u2019s insurer, for the total sum of $2,500, which was paid in the form of two drafts, one for $2,200 and one for $300, both payable to Campion and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>as \u201cAttorney.\u201d On the smaller draft the sum \u201c$300.00\u201d was inserted in a blank space after the printed words \u201cproperty damage.\u201d This draft stated on its face that it was \u201cin full and final payment of a claim for loss or damage in consequence of an accident which occurred on or about Dec. 3rd 1933. ...\u201d The face of this draft contained no mention of personal injury, although a form of release printed or stamped upon its reverse side referred to \u201call liability . . . because of personal injuries or damage to property.\u201d The draft for $2,200 described the claim in payment of which it was given as simply \u201cAuto Liability.\u201d That draft likewise stated that it was \u201cin full payment.\u201d Campion gave to the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company a general release, including claims \u201con account of all injuries both to person or property.\u201d Both drafts were indorsed by Campion and by the defendant as \u201cAttorney\u201d and were deposited to the defendant\u2019s bank account for collection and were paid. The defendant has practised law for about thirty years and knows the meaning and effect of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\">Subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, the defendant testified that out of the $2,500, he retained $55.60 for \u201ccosts and disbursements \u201d and $500 for his fee and paid Campion $1,941.40. The defendant further testified that in his discussion or correspondence with the attorney for the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company with whom he made the settlement there was no mention of the subject of property damage, and that after he received notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim he disregarded property damage entirely in representing Campion, \u201cother than to answer interrogatories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The judge ruled, as requested by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff became subrogated to the rights of Campion against Cohen \u201cfor damage to Campion\u2019s automobile alleged to have been caused by Cohen\u2019s negligence,\u201d but refused to rule that the $300 was in equity and good conscience the money of the plaintiff. In so refusing he made this statement: \u201cI do not find that the defendant received the three hundred dollars ($300.) but that he was merely acting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>attorney for Francis D. Campion and as such did not receive the money in a manner that would entitle the plaintiff to recover in this action.\u201d It is not clear what this means. We cannot construe it as a finding of fact that the $300 never came into the defendant\u2019s hands. If the judge had intended to make that finding, he would not have added the statement that \u201cmerely\u201d as attorney for Campion the defendant \u201cdid not receive the money in a manner that would entitle the plaintiff to recover in this action.\u201d Moreover, the documentary evidence supplied by the draft and its indorsement and the testimony of the defendant himself were such that a finding that the $300 did not pass through the defendant\u2019s own bank account would not be warranted. We think that the judge\u2019s statement must be construed as a ruling of law that even if the defendant deposited and collected the draft, he is not liable to the plaintiff in this action for the reason that in what he did he was \u201cmerely acting as attorney for Francis D. Campion\u201d and kept for himself no more than fees and expenses. The plaintiff excepted to this ruling. The principal question in the case is whether it was correct. We think that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">No doubt Campion\u2019s causes of action against Cohen and against Sigel as the operator of Cohen\u2019s automobile were each single entities embracing all the damages sustained by Campion, both that for personal injury and that for injury to Campion\u2019s automobile. Campion could not have maintained separate actions for personal injury and for property damage. <em>Dearden </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659. But although at law a cause of action is regarded as indivisible, in equity the reasons for this rule become of so little force that partial assignments are recognized and made effectual, not only between the parties to them but as to third persons. <em>James </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>142 Mass. 366. <em>Security Bank of New York </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>220 Mass. 84. <em>Andrews Electric, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Alphonse Catholic Total Abstinence Society, </em>233 Mass. 20, and cases cited. <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Wattendorf &amp; Co. Inc. </em>294 Mass. 588, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">A claim for personal injury cannot be assigned, <em>Rice </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Stone, </em>1 Allen, 566; <em>White Sewing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>232 Mass. 387, 388; <em>Dearden </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659, 663, but a claim for damage to specific property can be assigned. <em>Delval </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>213 Mass. 203, 206. <em>Bethlehem Fabricators, Inc. </em>v. <em>H. D. Watts Co. </em>286 Mass. 556, 566. <em>Dearden </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659, 663. There appears to be no reason why there may not be a partial assignment, valid in equity, of so much of a chose in action for a tort as is in its nature capable of assignment. The \u201csubrogation agreements\u201d fixed the plaintiff\u2019s rights and constituted in .substance and effect a partial assignment to the plaintiff of so much of Campion\u2019s causes of action as related to the property damage to his automobile. See <em>Wolverine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Klomparens, </em>273 Mich. 493; <em>Camden Fire Ins. Association </em>v. <em>Bleem, </em>132 Misc. (N. Y.) 22. They gave the plaintiff the right to receive the proceeds of such causes of action in so far as such proceeds should arise from and be traceable to the damage to Campion\u2019s automobile. They created in the plaintiff an equitable property right in any recovery traceable to property damage as distinct from personal injury \u2014 a property right which was more than a personal claim against Campion. Scott on Trusts, \u00a7 16. Whether, if there had been no \u201csubrogation agreements,\u201d the equitable doctrine of subrogation of an insurer who is an indemnitor would have produced substantially the same result we need not consider. See <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Western Rail Road, </em>13 Met. 99; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corp. </em>223 Mass. 44, 46; <em>Monmouth County Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>6 C. E. Green, 107; <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corp. </em>v. <em>Hooker Electro-chemical Co. </em>240 N. Y. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">Before the defendant paid over to Campion the net proceeds of the actions that the defendant had brought in Campion\u2019s behalf against Cohen and Sigel the defendant had ample notice that the plaintiff had been subrogated to Campion\u2019s rights against both, and that so much of the settlement money as was attributable to property damage belonged to the plaintiff. The sum of $300 had been segregated in a separate draft and earmarked as property damage and must be deemed to have been paid by Cohen\u2019s insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and accepted by the defendant as such. There was nothing in the defendant\u2019s status as attorney for Campion which made it his duty to pay to his client money which he knew, or must be charged with having known, belonged to the plaintiff. <em>Crohon &amp; Roden Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>232 Mass. 555. <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>271 Mass. 570, 573, and cases cited. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>285 Mass. 161. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Shain, </em>288 Mass. 458. See <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>179 Mass. 360, 365; <em>Millett </em>v. <em>Omaha National Bank, </em>30 Fed. (2d) 665; Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 339, 341, 343, 349, Restitution, \u00a7\u00a7 74, Comment h, 160, 165; Mechem on Agency (2d ed.), \u00a7 1442. The defendant had complete control over the money. It was his duty to hold for the plaintiff so much of the proceeds of the cause of action as represented the plaintiff\u2019s known interest in it. By bringing this action to recover the proceeds of the settlement that came into the defendant\u2019s hands the plaintiff has ratified the settlement with Cohen\u2019s insurer, and no question arises as to the defendant\u2019s authority to make the settlement. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Call, </em>5 Met. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">Although the rights of the plaintiff are equitable in their origin and nature, nevertheless this action can be maintained for money had and received. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>17 Mass. 575. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>8 Cush. 89. The defendant received the entire sum in the first instance and thereupon became accountable to the plaintiff for part of it as money received. <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>19 Pick. 370. He could not reheve himself of that accountability by making an unauthorized payment of the whole sum to Campion. It is immaterial that in the end he retained for himself nothing except fees and expenses. In general, an action for money had and received will he where the defendant has received money or its equivalent which in equity and good conscience belongs to the plaintiff. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>186 Mass. 584, 586. <em>Dennett </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>214 Mass. 449. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Werby, </em>280 Mass. 157, 160. <em>C. E. Lothrop Theatres Co. </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co. of Boston, </em>290 Mass. 189. No elaborate accounting is required to ascertain the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">It does not necessarily follow from what has been said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that the plaintiff can recover exactly $300. The sum in equity and good conscience due to the plaintiff may well be less than that amount because of necessary and reasonable expenses and perhaps also attorney\u2019s fees, all of which it may be proper to allocate in just proportion to the sum recovered for property damage. The present record does not supply the basis of fact required for such an allocation. There will be a further proportionate reduction due to the fact that $50 of Campion\u2019s claim for property damage was not covered by the collision insurance, and rights in the net recovery proportioned to this sum were preserved to him by the \u201csubrogation agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We have not thought it necessary to deal separately with the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings. This opinion and the rescript will furnish sufficient guidance for the final disposition of the case. Questions of evidence have become unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are sustained. If the parties do not agree between themselves, the case is to be further heard in the Superior Court to ascertain the exact amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
