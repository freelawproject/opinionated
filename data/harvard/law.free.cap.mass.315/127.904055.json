Such evidence as was taken is reported. The trial judge made a \u201cstatement of findings, RULINGS AND ORDER FOR A DECREE,\u201d in which, however, he stated that he made \u201cno order for a decree, interlocutory or final, for two reasons, first because at the hearing the parties agreed that the question of damages should be left open, if there was liability, to be further heard by the court or referred to a master and second because the question is not free from doubt and the parties may prefer to have the liability passed upon by the Supreme Judicial Court before any hearing uppn damages is had, in which case . . . \u00a1Tie was] prepared to report the question under the statute.\u201d The judge also stated: \u201cI think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the plaintiff is entitled to relief\u201d by way of assignment of patent rights and injunction and also to an accounting. The record contains a statement entitled \u201creport\u201d which is signed by the judge and in which this appears: \u201cThis cause came on to be heard and after hearing and argument I made certain findings of fact and rulings but made no order for decree for reasons stated and I now report the case for the consideration of the Supreme Judicial Court upon the pleadings, the evidence and my findings of' fact and rulings of law, such decree to be entered as justice and equity may require.\u201d Apart from orders as to the use of the exhibits, nothing else appears in the \u201creport.\u201d The record contains nothing that relates to the matter of an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 30, provides for the report, by a judge of this court or the Superior Court, of an interlocutory decree or order to this court in certain circumstances. But no decree or order was here made, and it is apparent that this failure was intentional. It is apparent that the \u201creport\u201d was not made in pursuance of the power conferred by \u00a7 30. Section 31 of said c. 214 provides that a justice of either court by whom a case is heard \u201cfor final decree\u201d may reserve and report the evidence and \u201call questions of law therein\u201d for the consideration of the full court; and thereupon like proceedings shall be had \u201cas upon appeals from final decrees.\u201d Apart from these statutory provisions, suits in equity can come to this court from the Superior Court only by way of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The case of <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Claussen, </em>313 Mass. 715, was brought to this court on a so called reservation and report under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 13, a statute closely similar to \u00a7 31 of said c. 214, but which relates only to Probate Courts. It was there said, at page 716, that \u201c \u00a7 13 \u2014 the sole source of the power to report \u2014 is limited to two classes of cases: (a) cases in which interlocutory decrees or orders have been made, and (b) cases that have been \u2018heard for final determination,\u2019 in which cases the judge may \u2018reserve and report the evidence and all questions of law therein for consideration of the full court, and thereupon like proceedings shall be had as upon appeal.\u2019 \u201d It was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>that the case did not come within the first of these classes and that the report did not conform to the requirements for a report in the second class of cases. It was said with respect to the second class at pages 716-717: \u201cIn such a case there must be a report of the entire case and not merely a part thereof. <em>Agoos </em>v. <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>241 Mass. 103, 106. ... A probate judge has no power to report a part of a case \u2014 unless after an interlocutory decree or order \u2014 merely by reason of the possibility that a decision of that part of the case might finally dispose of the entire case.\u201d What was there said is applicable to the suit at bar. <em>Taft </em>v. Stoddard, 141 Mass. 150. <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>Thibodeau, </em>186 Mass. 83, 85. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>209 Mass. 470, 473-474.
