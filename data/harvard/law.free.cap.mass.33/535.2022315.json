The plaintiffs introduced Jeremy Drake as a witness, who testified, that he was cashier of the Franklin Bank on the day of the date of these checks, and continued to be such cashier; that he also performed the duty of a teller of that bank ; that be had given a bond in the usual form, for the faithful performance of his duties as an officer of the bank, and was accountable for the money of the bank, it being all under his control ; that he received these checks of Charles Brown on the day of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>date, and let him have bills of the bank to the amount of $\u00a13000 ; that Brown paid him two dollars, and agreed that the bills should not be returned to the bank till the checks had become due ; that they were not in fact returned till after the 7th day of October then next ensuing, when it was generally kiiityn that Brown had absconded ; that, in accounting for the moaey in his custody with the directors of the bank, these checks weie treated either as so much money, or as checks on hand ; that he considered them as memorandum checks ; that there had been no vote of the directors authorizing a loan of money upon such paper, or approving of this transaction, but that it had been made known to the president of the bank and to the other directors, and no objection 'field to his knowledge been made thereto ; that he considered Y- within his authority as cashier ; and that he had always lent money on memorandum checks, with the knowledge of the direct01\u20198! and they had never objected to it.

This objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-9\">The witness further testified, that after these checks had become due, he told the defendant that they ought to be paid ; that the defendant said, that they should be paid ; that on the morning after Brown absconded, the defendant requested the witness to keep it a secret, and said that he would see them paid soon; but that afterwards he told the witness, that as the bank had sued him, he should keep them out of their money as long as he could that there was no entry of the checks on the books of the bank ; and that no interest was paid after the exchange of the bills for the checks. The plaintiffs then proposed to prove, that it was not usual for such checks to be presented to the bank on which they were drawn, for payment, or to notify the non-payment thereof to the drawer. The defendant objected to the admission of such evidence; bul the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Charles Sprague, the cashier of the Globe Bank in Boston, Eliphalet Williams, cashier of the City Bank, and Drake, testified that the checks were not in the usual form of \u201c memorandum \u201d checks ; that they should have felt authorized to pay such checks ; but that memorandum checks are never presented to the bank on which they may be drawn, for payment</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\">Gurdon Steele, cashier of the North Bank in Boston, tes tilled that he should not have paid such checks as those in question, if they had been presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">Henry A.

Was Drake a competent witness ? It seems to us, that he was not interested in the event of this suit. If the plaintiffs si ould recover, it will be for their own use. If the plaintiffs should fail, and if they should sue the witness upon his bond for misconduct in his office of cashier, this verdict could not be given in evidence for or against him. The plaintiffs would be required to support their action, and the defence would ae. sustained, by other evidence. The witness, from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>connexion with the plaintiffs, may have strong wishes that they should recover, which might be a proper subject of remark to the jury, in regard to the credit which they should give to his testimony ; but we are satisfied, that his competency is not affected by any supposed liability upon his bond to the plaintiffs in another action. 1 Phil. Evid. (Dunlap\u2019s ed. 1829,) 36, and notes, where this subject is examined, and many cases collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Then the question is, whether the defendant is liable upon the checks produced by the plaintiffs. If they are what are called memorandum checks, the defendant is liable, notwithstanding they were never presented to the bank upon which they were drawn, for payment, and notwithstanding the plaintiffs have not made a demand of payment before the action was commenced. That this is the meaning of <em>memorandum checks </em>is proved by all the evidence in the case. It is a rule of business perfectly understood in this commercial community ; too well established to be questioned. A memorandum check is a contract by which the maker engages to pay the <em>bona fide </em>holder absolutely, and not upon condition to pay if the bank upon which it be drawn should not pay upon presentation at maturity, and if due notice of the presentation and non-payment should be given. The word \u201c memorandum \u201d written or printed upon the check describes the nature of the contract with precision. It is an express waiver, on the part of the maker of the check, of any objection against the claim of a <em>bond fide </em>holder, that it had not been presented for payment, or if it were presented and not paid, that he had had no notice of the nonpayment by the bank therein named.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Then it is to be considered whether these are memoran- \u2022 dum checks. It is proved, that they are now in the same form and condition as they were in when they were signed by the defendant. Whatever may be the legal effect of the paper, it was written and prepared by the defendant himself. The erasure of the word \u201c North,\u201d and the insertion of the word \u201c Market,\u201d before the word \u201c Bank,\u201d were made by the defendant before he signed the papers. And it is of no consequence, that there was an erasure in the paper, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>were made without fraud, and before signing. It is argued for the defendant, that the erasure of the word \u201cNorth,\u201d and the insertion of the word \u201c Market,\u201d indicates clearly the intent of the maker, that the checks were to be presented to the Market Bank for payment, and therefore that the defendant may legally and rightfully avail himself of the neglect of the plaintiffs (who were holders) in not presenting the same accordingly ; especially as it is proved in the case, that Freeman\u2019s checks, for the amounts for which these are drawn, would have been paid by the Market Bank, if they had been presented when they became due. Why (it is asked by the defendant\u2019s connsel) did the defendant strike out \u201c North \u201d and insert \u201c Market \u201d before the word \u201c Bank \u201d ? We think this question may be answered by another, viz. why did the defendant write the word \u201c memorandum,\u201d or \u201c Memo.\u201d upon the face of the check, unless he intended to characterize the check accordingly ? The construction of the paper, as it was signed, is for the Court. We are to give a meaning and effect to all the words employed ; and we cannot think that any other meaning can be ascribed to that word, than that which we have suggested. We are not at liberty to suppose, that it was written there without meaning. On the contrary, we are satisfied, that it was placed there as an admission or declaration on the part of the maker, that he would pay the checks absolutely and unconditionally, distinguishing them, as memorandum checks, from other checks which were to be presented for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">Under this view of the subject, we place no reliance upon the promises which the defendant made after the checks became due. If the undertaking of the defendant had been conditional, and not absolute, his promises under an ignorance of the facts (if such were the truth of the case,) would fall within the case of <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Salem Bank, </em>9 Mass. R. 408. If the case were put upon that ground, the cause should be submitted to the jury, to find whether or</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">no the defendant made those promises under an ignorance of the fact, that the checks had not been presented, &amp;c. His conduct and promises after the checks became due, would be perfectly consistent with his liability, if the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>taking were absolute and not conditional. We think, for the reasons before suggested, that taking the papers as they were written and prepared, they are to be construed as memorandum checks, and subject the defendant to all the liabilities created by such paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It is not suggested, that the plaintiffs are not <em>bond fide </em>holders of the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is therefore the clear opinion of the- whole Court, that the defendant is liable to this action, notwithstanding the checks were not presented to the Market Bank, and notwithstanding no demand was made upon the defendant before the action was brought; and that judgment shall be entered accordingly for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
