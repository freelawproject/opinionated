The Board awarded the claimant-employee Strong unemployment benefits on the ground that the claimant was discharged by his employer but not for misconduct connected with his work. 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 1344(a) (1) (A). The Board\u2019s decision affirmed the findings of the appeals referee, who had reversed a decision of the claims examiner denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Claimant was employed by Blue Ox from September, 1981, until May 21, 1982, as a laborer on a house construction project. On May 19, 1982, claimant\u2019s supervisor told him to report for work the next morning at the employer\u2019s sawmill. Rather than reporting for work at the mill on May 20, however, the claimant returned to work at the construction site. When confronted by his supervisor, claimant asserted there was still work for him to complete on the house project. A heated exchange occurred causing the supervisor to leave the job site. On May 21, claimant\u2019s employer came to the house site and asked claimant why he had disobeyed the supervisor\u2019s order. The claimant replied that he thought the supervisor had been \u201ckidding.\u201d The employer discharged claimant for disobeying his supervisor\u2019s work order.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The Board found that the claimant\u2019s failure to report for work at the mill on May 20 was the result of a misunderstanding on claimant\u2019s part. Although the Board characterized the claimant\u2019s behavior as demonstrating poor judgment, it concluded that his conduct did not amount to an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s business interests. <em>Schaffner </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, </em>140 Vt. 89, 93, 436 A.2d 743, 745 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">This Court cannot disturb the findings of the Board if there is credible evidence to support them even if there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>substantial evidence to the contrary. <em>In re Wheelock, </em>130 Vt. 136, 141, 287 A.2d 569, 572 (1972). When misconduct is asserted as the basis for an employee\u2019s discharge, the burden of proof is on the employer. <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, </em>138 Vt. 211, 212, 414 A.2d 1154, 1155 (1980). For the employee\u2019s misconduct to disqualify him for benefits there must be evidence of substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, </em>139 Vt. 405, 410, 430 A.2d 450, 453 (1981). This disregard must be either wilful or culpably negligent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Although the record is not weighted heavily in favor of the claimant, there is evidence lending credence to his assertion that there was cause for his misinterpretation of the supervisor\u2019s order. Testimony at the hearing suggested that over the course of the claimant\u2019s employment his supervisor had occasionally suggested, in a facetious manner, that claimant was going to work at the mill. At no time, however, had claimant actually been required to work at the mill. As the Board noted, the May 19 incident was the only instance in the claimant\u2019s eight-month work record that the employer characterized as misconduct. While such behavior may provide the basis for an employment discharge, it does not reach the level required under the unemployment statutes to disqualify the claimant for benefits. <em>Schaffner </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, supra, </em>140 Vt. at 93, 436 A.2d at 746; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, supra, </em>139 Vt. at 411, 430 A.2d at 454; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, </em>138 Vt. 554, 556, 420 A.2d 106, 107 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
