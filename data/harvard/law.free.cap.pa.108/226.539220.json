Junhin) </em>for the plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATy\">While it is true that the condition of the bond was that if the obligor paid the principal sum \u201c at and immediately after the decease of Emily B. De Silver, widow of Robert P. De Silver, together with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum payable half yearly,.....then the above obligation to be void,\u201d and although Emily B.De Silver is still alive \u2014 yet we contend that the tender of the full amount of principal and interest due on the bond, before suit brought, and its refusal, was a bar to this action for interest. The condition of the bond was for the protection of' the obligor, not the obligee. The obligor could not be compelled to pay the principal until Mrs. De Silver\u2019s death, but he was not bound to await that event. .There is no <em>covenant </em>in the bond, or the mortgage, to pay interest, and no suit could be maintained against the obligor for interest alone. A fortiori there can be no action against Mrs. Dreer on an implied assumpsit for interest alone, for as between her and' the obligee there is neither privity of estate nor of contract. This is not like the case of a suit by A. against C. to recover money paid by B. to C. for the benefit of A. If any promise arises on the part of Mrs. Dreer by accepting the bequest, it is for the protection of the testator\u2019s estate, and the action for breach must be by his executors. She cannot be liable to two actions, one by the executors, another by a stranger, for the same thing, at the same time: Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, 6 Watts 182; Kountz <em>v. </em>Holthouse, 4 Nor. 235; Guthrie <em>v. </em>Kerr, 4 Nor. 303; Wynn <em>v. </em>Wood, 1 Out. 216; Torrens <em>v. </em>Campbell, 24 P. F. S. 470. Nor does this case come within the principle of Etter <em>v. </em>Greenawalt, 2 Out. 422, and prior similar cases, that where a testator\u2019s direction to a devisee to pay a sum to a third party is the <em>consideration </em>of the devise, a personal liability attaches to the devisee accepting the devise. The devise to Mrs. Dreer in this case is absolute, not on condition or in consideration of her paying anything; the provisions of the will as to the application of the money being simply directory. If she did not apply it as testator directed, and the estate suffered, the estate might hold her, but not the parties to whom she was directed to pay it. The language of the will is: \u201c She supporting and maintaining our unmarried daughters until their marriage, and also paying thereout the interest on the incumbrances on my real estate, and the principal of the incumbrances, i-f there be surplus income unexpended.\u201d Did the testator mean to subject his wife to a suit by any incumbrancer in the event of the latter claiming that the \u201c surplus income unexpended \u201d received by her was sufficient to pay him .his interest or his principal? How much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ought to have been expended by her for her out of her provision for her daughters\u2019 support? Was this a bequest to the incumbrancer of the interest as it accrued? This bequest was very different from a charge of the interest on the land devised, in favor of the incumbrancer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-5\"><em>John Gr. Johnson (Prank P. Prichard </em>with him), for defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATa\">A suit may be brought for interest alone on a bond, before the principal falls due: Montgomery Agricultural Society <em>v. </em>Francis, 7 Out. 378. Where one person receives assets out of which to pay a third person, the latter mav sue on the assumpsit: Commercial Bank <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 W. &amp; S. 89; Torrens <em>v. </em>Campbell, 24 P. F. S. 470. The language here is \u201cshe.paying thereout,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The opinion of the court was filed January 26th, 1885.</p>\n<author id=\"b246-8\">Per, Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">Under the special verdict, this case is clearly right. It shows the plaintiff in error assumed the obligation to pay the debt in question out of property put into her hands for that purpose, at the time she received the property, and that from the proceeds thereof, she had actually received a sum of money more than sufficient to pay the debt or interest which she had agreed to pay. The right of the party to sue who was entitled to receive the money, is affirmed by numerous authorities: Torrens <em>v. </em>Campbell, 24 P. F. S. 470; Justice <em>v. </em>Tallman, 5 Norris 147; Kountz <em>v. </em>Holthouse, 4 Id. 235; Wynn\u2019s Administrator <em>v. </em>Wood, 1 Out. 216. She assumed to pay that which became her own debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
