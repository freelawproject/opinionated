Gibson, from a decree of said court dismissing exceptions filed by her to the adjudication of the auditing judge, in the matter of the distribution of the estate of John Y. Clark, deceased..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">Upon the audit it appeared that the testator by his will devised and bequeathed his r\u00e9siduary estate to trustees, in' trust to pay over the net income thereof, one third to his wife for her life, in lieu of dower, one third to his son Henry E. Clark for his life, and one third to his daughter Florence I. Clark, for her life. No disposition was made of the estate in remainder. Testator\u2019s widow declined to take under the will, and her share of said residuary estate under the intestate law was distributed and set apart to her, and the rest continued in the hands of the trustees. Testator\u2019s son, Henry E. Clark, died August 9th, 1870, intestate, unmarried, and without issue, and letters of administration were granted upon his estate. Testator\u2019s widow died July 25th, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-10\">Upon the filing by the trustee, in April, 1882, of an annual account, which contained also a schedule of the property comprising the corpus of the estate, testator\u2019s daughter, Mrs. Florence I. Gibson (her husband concurring), elected and requested to terminate said trust, which the court decreed and directed distribution of so much of the corpus as consisted of personalty between her and the administrator of her deceased brother, in equal shares, according to a schedule of distribution agreed on by their respective counsel: (See 39 Leg. Int., 272).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-11\">A full account of the principal of the trust estate was after-wards filed, upon the audit of which the auditing judge, by consent of all parties, ignored the distribution of the personalty previously made, as above stated, and made another distribution of it on the same principles, namely, one half to Mrs. Florence I. Gibson, and the other half\u2019 to the administrator of her deceased brother, Henry E. Clark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-12\">Mrs. Florence I. Gibson filed exceptions to this adjudication, on the ground that the court erred in awarding any part of the estate to the administrator of Henry E. Clark, and in Dot awarding the entire corpus of the personal estate to her,' absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the adjudication, Ashman, J., saying in an opinion filed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">\u201c The testator made no disposition of his residuary estate, but his intestacy as to this portion, it is contended, must be held to date only from the death of the son, in which event the daughter, who by reason of the widow\u2019s death is the sole survivor, will take the entire personalty. The only merit of this position is its originality. No principle of law and no adjudged case were cited to support it, and none could be. The testator left the residue of his estate to the operation of the intestate laws, and under those laws the rights of his next of kin attached at the moment of his death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The exceptant, Mrs. Florence I. Gibson, took this appeal, assigning for error the decree 'dismissing her exceptions and confirming the adjudication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">At the argument the appellee moved to quash the appeal, on the ground that immediately after the entering of the final decree appealed from, the appellant, acting by her attorney in fact (her husband), appointed by letter of attorney duly acknowledged and recorded, accepted and received from the executors of said trustee (he having died), the full share of said estate awarded to her by said decree; and further that said executors had at the same time paid over, in accordance with said decree, to the administrator of Henry E. Clark deceased, the full amount and share of estate awarded to him, and that no part of said estate remained in the hands of said executors. An affidavit was produced to the court, setting forth the above facts, to which was appended the receipts for the payments referred to therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-8\"><em>Geo. </em>Bull, for the appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ats\">The trust became voidable upon the death of Henry E. Clark, at the option of the remaining right heir of the testator; in other words, the Act of June 14th, 1836, \u00a7 30, gave her the right to invoke the dis-cretion of the court to vacate the trust, she being the only person in interest. Practically this was what the court did in a former distribution, and awarded the whole of the <em>income </em>to' Florence I. Gibson. When it came to a division of the corpus a different rule was applied, and one third of the personalty was sent where the testator never intended it should go, to the administrator (or in plain terms to the creditors), of Henry E. Clark.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\">What did John Y. Clark mean in this will? His will is as absolute a conveyance of his estate to his trustees as though it had been a deed in fee simple duly recorded. No one will deny that where words of inheritance are used the right would vest at the death of the testator, or any limitation that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>carry the corpus of the trust estate to some certain point beyond the strict terms and uses of the trust. Bht here there' is nothing of the kind to be found. Neither Henry E. Clark nor his heirs acquired any interest in or right to the corpus of the estate, real or personal. He could acquire no interest until the estate became intestate. This could not take place until the trust is formally vacated according to law: McMullin <em>v. </em>McMullin, 8 Watts 236; Bowditch <em>v. </em>Andrew, 8 Allen 340; Smith <em>v. </em>Harrington, 4 Id. 566; Culbertson\u2019s Appeal, 26 P. F. S. 148; Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 Id. 355; Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 920, par. 2.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-6\"><em>Rudolph M. Schiele, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The opinion of the court was filed January 26th, 1885.</p>\n<author id=\"b263-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Akf\">We think the remainder was vested in the heirs. The decree is therefore right <em>on </em>the merits. Inasmuch, however, as the appellant accepted the sum awarded to her she waived her right to appeal: Marten\u2019s Appeal, 13 W. N. C. 289. Rightfully assuming that she was satisfied with the decree, the executors paid over the residue to the persons to whom it was decreed. Therefore, having no right to appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
