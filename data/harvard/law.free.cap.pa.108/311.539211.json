Afterwards, upon A.\u2019s death B.\u2019s estate was claimed by C.\u2019s administrators for those who were her next of kin at her death, and also by those who were her next of kin at A.\u2019s death.

St., 111; Holloway <em>v. </em>Holloway, 5 Vesey, 399; Pearce <em>v. </em>Vincent, 1 Cr. &amp; M., 598; Elmsley <em>v. </em>Young, 8 Eng. Ch. R., 227; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 35 Id., 269. The word \u201c then.\u201d as used in this deed does not indicate any period of time whatever, it is simply a conjunction: Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. St. Rep. (11 P. F.

We will not review the numerous authorities cited in the able argument of the counsel for the appellant. It is not necessary to question their force or the facts upon which they rest. In the present case, the clear intention of the settlor must control. That is the governing rule of construction. It is not sufficient to change the manifest intention of the whole instrument by creating a doubt whether the word \u201c then \u201d is not sometimes used as a conjunction, and not always as an adverb of time. Looking at the whole deed we think the reasonable presumption is that she did not intend the fund to pass to any person who was not of her blood. By holding as we do that the next of her kin was to be determined at the death of the life tenant, we give due effect to her intention as shown by the language used, to pass the property to those of her blood: Wharton <em>v. </em>Barker, 4 <em>K. </em>&amp; J., 483; Long <em>v. </em>Blackall, 3 Vesey, 486; Jones <em>v. </em>Colbeck, 8 Vesey, Jr., 38; Phillip\u2019s Appeal, 12 Norris, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
