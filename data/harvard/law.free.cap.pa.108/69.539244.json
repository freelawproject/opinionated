J., the following facts appeared: On April 25th, 1871, Bown executed and delivered to Morange a bond in the penal sum of $24,000 conditioned for the payment of a debt of $12,000. This bond was secured by a mortgage of the same date on certain property in Allegheny City and both bond and mortgage were assigned, in May following, to Hall. An amicable judgment in scire facias on the mortgage was entered in June, 1876, for $12,420,' and by virtue of a writ of levari facias issued on this judgment the premises were sold, by the sheriff, to Hall, for $1,150. On October 19th, 1876, Bown filed exceptions to the confirmation of the sheriff\u2019s sale and on the same day an action of debt on the bond accompanying the mortgage was brought by Morange to use of Hall;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-11\">Prior to these proceedings, to wit, on January 4th, 1875r Bown filed his voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court, and was duly declared a bankrupt; but he did not obtain his final discharge in bankruptcy until June 12th, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-12\">On December 7th, 1876, pending the bankrupt proceedings, Bown confessed judgment, in the suit on his bond, in favor of Hall, for $6,646.09, and made the following entry on the record at the time :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-13\">\u201cDecember 7th, 1876, this case compromised on the following conditions: First.

At the trial Bown\u2019s counsel made the following offers of evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">(1) \u201c Counsel for defendant proposes to prove that at the time the judgment in controversy was confessed, it was agreed by and between the-use plaintiff, L. W. Hall, and the defendant, that the confession of judgment should not prejudice the defendant in obtaining his discharge in bankruptcy then pending. That if defendant would obtain his discharge then this judgment was not to be enforced against him; but that plaintiff should stand upon an equality with his other creditors. That this was the inducement, held out by the plaintiff, L. W. Hall, which influenced the defendant to confess the judgment. And that it was on these representations that defendant confessed the judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">(2) \u201c That the agreement was signed in pursuance of the compromise it expresses, but upon the verbal agreement and understanding that it was to have no effect if defendant got his discharge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">(3) \u201cThat the judgment plaintiff seeks to revive by this action was founded upon a bond dated the 25th of April, 1871; that on the 4th day of January, 1875, the obligor in the bond and defendant in this suit filed his voluntary petition in bankruptcy, and that on the 7th day of December, 1876, when the judgment now sought to be revived was confessed, proceedings in bankruptcy were still pending; that subsequently, on the 12th day of June, 1878, the defendant was discharged regularly according to the provisions of the bankrupt law; that at the time that judgment was confessed the parties, had in view the final discharge in bankruptcy of the defendant; that not then knowing whether the defendant would obtain his final discharge, it was represented by the plaintiff, L. W. Hall, to the defendant, that if he would confess the judgment it would be a mere matter of form. That it would not prejudice his right to obtain a final discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>against it. That if lie did obtain a final discharge the plaintiff would not enforce the judgment against the defendant, but that it should be satisfied by defendant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy as in case of his other creditors. That upon these representations the judgment was confessed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">(4) \u201c That at the time the writing, upon which the judgment was confessed, was signed, and-before it was signed the plaintiff, Mr. Hall, went to the store of the defendant, Mr. Bown,'and asked him to confess a judgment; that Mr. Bown refused to do so, inasmuch as his proceedings in bankruptcy were pending and it might prejudice him, and that the plaintiff represented to him that it would not prejudice him, that it was a mere matter of form; that if he would get his discharge in bankruptcy it would discharge the debt, notwithstanding the confession of judgment. That Mr. Bown, the defendant, refused to do so; that Mr. Hall repeated these representations to him, and the defendant relying upon the-correctness of the statement, confessed the judgment, being assured that the plaintiff would not attempt to enforce it if he (the defendant) got his final discharge as stated in the third'offer. That it was upon these .representations.that he did so confess the judgment or-authorize the paper to be signed, on which the judgment was confessed. That Mr. Bown directed Mr. Hall to go from his store to his (Mr. Bown\u2019s counsel), and make the agreement accordingly. That the parties met in Mr. Dickey\u2019s office, and the paper was drawn up and signed by the counsel, Mr. Dickey, upon the one side and Mr. Bown\u2019s counsel on the other, as shown by the paper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">Plaintiffs counsel objected to these offers as irrelevant, and incompetent to contradict the agreement in writing, set out. on the record, upon which judgment was confessed.

N. C. 313. Parol evidence is admissible to show that at the execution of a written instrument, a stipulation was entered into, a condition annexed, or a verbal promise made, upon the faith of which the writing was executed, though it may vary or materially change the terms of the contract: Greenawalt <em>v. </em>Kohne, 85 Pa.

How long afterwards does not appear. A written instrument under seal and free from ambiguity, eannot be affected by a conversation of the parties thereto held prior to its execution: Caley <em>v. </em>Hoopes, 5 Norris 493; McClure <em>v. </em>Railway Co., 9 Norris, 269; Stine <em>v. </em>Sherk, 1 W. &amp; S. 202. A defendant cannot be permitted to impeach a judgment, in a <em>sei. fa. </em>thereon, by alleging prior matter: Dowling <em>v. </em>McGregor, 10 Norris 411.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b89-8\">Mr. Justice Stebkett</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">delivered the opinion of the court January 5th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The question involved in the first .four specifications of error is whether the offers of evidence therein recited were rightly rejected. In substance, the offers were to prove that at the time the judgment, which forms the basis of this action, was confessed, it was understood and agreed by and between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>plaintiff and defendant that the confession or judgment should not prejudice the latter in obtaining his discharge in bankruptcy, for which an application was then pending in the proper court; that if, in due course, he procured his discharge, plaintiff should stand upon the same footing as defendant\u2019s other creditors, and the judgment should not be enforced against him, or, as it is expressed in the' third offer, the discharge should operate as a satisfaction of the judgment; and that it was upon the faith of the agreement, of which the foregoing is the substance, that the judgment was confessed. In addition thereto, other matters of fact, more or less intimately connected with the compromise and confession of judgment, are embraced in the respective offers, but special reference to them is unnecessary. The judgment was confessed after defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt .and before he obtained his discharge, for a provable debt contracted befo're commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy. The mortgage' given to secure the debt had been foreclosed and the property sold to the equitable plaintiff for $1,150, but exceptions to the sheriff\u2019s sale were pending when suit for residue of the debt was brought on the bond. Shortly afterwards a compromise was effected, signed by attorneys of the parties respectively and filed of record in the case, as follows, to wit: \u201cDecember 7th, 1876, per writing filed this case compromised on the following conditions: 1st. That plaintiff allows a credit on the bond sued on, of $6,045.45, and defendant confesses judgment to plaintiff for the sum of six thousand six hundred and forty-six dollars and nine cents, ($6,646.09) and defendant in consideration of the above credit, (said credit being in excess of plaintiff\u2019s bid at sheriff\u2019s sale of the property of defendant sold to plaintiff on levari facias, No. 260, July Term, 1876) hereby withdraws all objections to said sheriff\u2019s sale, and furthermore hereby ratifies and confirms said sheriff\u2019s sale, and the title thus by said plaintiff acquired to the property bought by plaintiff at said sheriff\u2019s sale.\u201d By this compromise defendant obtained a concession or credit of over $6,000, in addition to the amount realized by sale of the mortgaged premises, and in consideration thereof he withdrew his exceptions -to the sheriff\u2019s sale and confessed judgment absolutely and unconditionally for the residue, $6,646.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">There is nothing on the record restricting in any way the right of plaintiff to revive the judgment or have execution thereof. This is conceded by defendant; but he alleges the judgment was confessed on the faith of plaintiff\u2019s assurance and verbal agreement that in the event of his obtaining, in due form, his discharge as a bankrupt, the judgment should not be enforced against him. In view of the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>conditions of the compromise and confession of judgment were reduced to writing and made matter of record, it is very remarkable that a provision so important to the defendant should have been omitted from the writing prepared and signed by counsel; but, unreasonable and incredible as defendant\u2019s allegations as to the verbal agreement in question may appear, he is entitled under our decisions to establish them if he can by competent and satisfactory evidence. No principle has been better settled by a long line of decisions than that parol evidence is admissible to show a verbal contemporaneous agreement which induced the execution of a written obligation, though it may have the effect of varying or changing the terms of the written contract: Miller <em>v. </em>Henderson, 10 S. &amp; R. 290; Greenawalt <em>v. </em>Kohne, 4 Norris 369; Barclay <em>v. </em>Wainwright, 5 Id. 191; Whitney <em>v. </em>Shippen, 8 Id. 22; Hoopes <em>v. </em>Beale, 9 Id. 82; Keough <em>v. </em>Leslie, 11 Id. 424; Hartley\u2019s Appeal, 7 Out. 23; Juniata Building Association <em>v. </em>Hetzel, Id. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The purpose of the offers under consideration was not to assail the validity of the judgment as originally confessed, or to introduce any matter of defence that may have existed prior thereto, but to show that by reason of what has occurred since, viz.: defendant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy, the plaintiff is not entitled, according to the terms of his alleged agreement, to have execution of the judgment.' In this-respect the case is similar in principle to Hartzell <em>v. </em>Reiss, 1 Binney 289, in which it was held that under the plea of payment to a scire facias to revive a judgment, the defendant might show that when he executed the bond on which the judgment was confessed the plaintiff promised verbally to cancel it upon an event which occurred after the judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We think the testimony offered by the defendant should have been received, and if the evidence of the alleged agreement proved to be sufficiently clear and precise to justify its submission to the jury the question should have been left to them under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In refusing to charge as requested in defendant\u2019s point, the learned judge followed the ruling of this court in Wise\u2019s Appeal, 3 Out. 193, in which it was held that in an action on a judgment obtained after the defendant therein was adjudicated a bankrupt, and before his discharge, upon a debt provable under the bankrupt law, the original debt is merged in the. judgment, and the subsequently granted certificate of discharge is no defence thereto. The judgment on which this scire facias issued possesses all those distinctive features. It was confessed by defendant, after his adjudication and before his discharge as a bankrupt, for a provable debt contracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. It is clearly within the rule, and hence the fifth assignment of error is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">If defendant had succeeded in introducing testimony tending to prove the allegations of fact embodied in the offers rejected by the court, there might have been a question of fact for the consideration of the jury; but as the case stood there was no error in charging as complained of in the sixth specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
