The plaintiff moved for a hew trial, which was refused in the following opinion by Elcock, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">On the trial a point was raised by'plaintiff's counsel by an objection to the admission in evidence of the sheriff\u2019s deed to the defendant, under which he claimed title,'because the same was not recorded in the office of the. Recorder of Deeds of this county, contending that it was- necessary under the Act of Assembly of May 25th, 1878 (P. L. 151), which is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">\u201c Be it enacted, &amp;c., That all deeds, conveyances, and other instruments of writing, wherein it shall be the intention of the parties executing the same, \u2019 to grant, bargain, sell and convey any lands, tenements, hereditaments, situate, lying and being in any city of the first class in this Commonwealth, upon being acknowledged by the parties executing the same in the manner now provided by the laws of this Commonwealth, shall be recorded in the office for recording of deeds in the county where such lands, tenements and hereditaments are situate, lying. and being; and every such deed, conveyance or other instrument of writing, which shall not be acknowledged, proved and recorded as aforesaid, shall be adjudged fraudulent and void against any subsequent bona fide purchaser or mortgagee, unless such deed, conveyance or instrument of writing shall be recorded as aforesaid, before the recording of the deed of conveyance under which such subsequent purchaser or mortgagee shall claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">It would be hard to discover any reason or necessity for the passage of such an Act, so local and .unsettling in its consequences, if it were read literally. But, inasmuch as its language, with reference to the instruments to be recorded, is similar to that of the recording Act of March 18th, 1775, Brightly\u2019s Purdon 472, \u00a7 76, its interpretation and extent is easily discovered.' Both Acts use the words \u201c all deeds,\u201d &amp;c. Under the same language, \u201c all deeds,\u201d the Supreme Court, since the case of Shrider <em>v. </em>Nargan, 1 Dali. 68, have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sheriffs\u2019 deeds ar\u00e9 riot required to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds. In Naglee <em>v. </em>Albright, 4 Wharton 291, it was held that the acknowledgment of a sheriff\u2019s deed in open court, and the registering of it in the Prothonotary\u2019s office, are equivalent to recording it in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, in respect to notice to a subsequent pur-, chaser from the defendant in the execution. Justice Sergeant, in his opinion, remarking that the distinction in the recording of sheriffs\u2019 deeds and other deeds has existed in \u25a0Pennsylvania ever since the passage of the Act of 1705, relative to executions, and the Act of 1715 establishing a Recorder\u2019s office, and sheriffs\u2019 deeds have, it is believed, been rarely recorded in the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-4\">In Seechrist <em>v. </em>Baskin, 7 W. &amp; S. 404, where a sheriff\u2019s deed had been recorded in the Recorder\u2019s office, a certified copy of such record was not admitted in evidence. Chief Justice Gibson, in the opinion, saying that the authentication prescribed for its acknowledgment before the courts, and not before the magistrate, shows that it was not within the provision of the recording laws.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">After this decision it required the enabling Act of 14th March, 1846, to record such instruments, but such Act did not compel such a recording, but it was simply enacted that the certified copies of such an instrument might be read in evidence. We do not understand that it has ever become a custom to record sheriffs\u2019 deeds in the Recorder of Deeds office in any part of this state, and to hold that such was necessary, as contended for by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, would be to divest titles and unsettle estates to an enormous and uncertain extent. In the administration of.the law such wreck and ruin cannot be contemplated unless the legislature by an express enactment so decrees. Within the view of the law as it existed prior to 1878, if it was so intended by the law making power, language directly applicable to the special subjects, and admitting of no doubt, could have been used to effect the object contended for. It has not been so enacted, and we see no reason to deduce a ruinous inference from language which, although plain in itself, has already had a judicial interpretation which has been unquestioned for so long a period. Finding no error in the trial, the rule for a new trial is discharged.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">Arnold, J. I concur in the opinion just read, and would add that there.is no Act of Assembly which directs that a sheriff\u2019s deed shall be recorded at length in the Prothonotary\u2019s office, nor is there any statute which makes a certified copy of the record of a sheriff\u2019s deed which has been recorded in the Prothonotary\u2019s office since 1846 as good evidence as the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>nal deed apart from the rest of the record. That part of the Act of March 14th, 1846, which makes certified copies of sheriffs\u2019 deeds recorded in the Prothonotary\u2019s office evidence, applies onty to those deeds which had been recorded in the Prothonotary\u2019s office before the passage of that Act. If purchasers at sheriffs\u2019 sales wish to get the benefit of that part of the recording Acts which makes certified copies of their deeds evidence in the absence of the original, they should record them in the office of the Recorder of Deeds and not in the Prothonotary\u2019s office. The better practice would be to have a short minute of the deed made in the Prothonotary\u2019s office, as was formerly the practice, and to record it at length in the office of the Recorder of Deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">The plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning, for error the overruling of his objections to the defendant\u2019s evidence, and the direction to find for defendant!</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\"><em>Henry 0. Thompson, </em>for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5J\">The defendant was permitted to prove, in effect, that the debt, on which the judgment was recovered under which plaintiff claims title, \u2022was paid prior to judgment. That was <em>res adjudiaata, </em>and the evidence was not admissible in this collateral proceeding to affect the title of a stranger: Somers <em>v. </em>Alexander, 3 Yeates 268; Lewis <em>v. </em>Nenzel, 38 Pa. St. 222. Plaintiff was not affected with notice of .matters outside the record of his title. He bought at sheriff\u2019s sale, under a judgment for arrears of ground rent, the lien of which arrears and judgment therefor related back to the date of the ground rent .deed, and was paramount to any subsequently created estate or incumbrance. The mortgage, under which defendant claims, being subsequent in lien, the sheriff\u2019s vendee thereunder cannot, in this collateral proceeding, contest the validity of the judgment for arrears. The terre tenant had notice, in the line of his title, of the paramount ground rent; he also had legal notice of the action for arrears of ground rent, by advertisement and posting of the alias summons .covenant, under the provisions of the Act of April 8th, 1840 (P. L. 249), and if he did not come in and defend, he and all claiming under him are now estopped. The defendant, whose property has been sold in execution, and who has received the proceeds of sale, cannot dispute the purchaser\u2019s title. We further submit that the defendant\u2019s sheriff's deed is invalid, as against plaintiff\u2019s sheriff\u2019s deed, because the former is not recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds. We contend such is the effect of the Act of May 25th, 1878 (P. L. 151). Prior to the Act of 1846 there was no law authorizing sheriffs\u2019 deeds to be recorded, and if recorded, either in the Prothouotary\u2019s office or the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>corder\u2019s office, an exemplification of the record was not admissible in evidence: Seechrist <em>v. </em>Baskin, 7 W. &amp; S. 404. The Act of 1846 was permissive only. But in the Act of 1878, the legislature, as we contend, recognized and enforced the necessity of having <em>all </em>deeds recorded in one office.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-4\"><em>Thomas </em>Crreenbanh, for the defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJc\">Arrears of ground rent due at the time of a sheriff\u2019s sale of the lot out of which the ground rent issues, are discharged by such sheriff\u2019s sale, and payable out of the proceeds. The lien is then gone, the land is discharged, and nothing remains to give jurisdiction for a subsequent judicial sale of the land for those same arrears : Mather <em>v. </em>McMichael, 1 Harris 301. The defendant, Millard, being terre tenant and not a party to the suit against the covenantor for the arrears of ground rent, was entitled in this ejectment to make any defence that would have availed him in the original suit had he been a party to it: Delaney <em>v. </em>Gault, 6 Casey 63. A purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale is affected with notice of prior sheriff\u2019s sales, but is not concerned with subsequent sheriff\u2019s sales founded upon extinct liens which had been discharged bjr prior sheriff\u2019s sales. The objection that defendant\u2019s sheriff\u2019s deed, though prior in time, is postponed to the plaintiff\u2019s because not recorded in the Recorder\u2019s office, is groundless. The Act of 1878 merely re-enacted (as to Philadelphia) the old Act of 1775, omitting the proviso allowing .six months within which to recordideeds. It had no effect on the law as it was before, in relation to sheriffs\u2019 deeds.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-5\">Mr. Justice Trttnkey</author>\n<p id=\"AF2\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 16th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Arrears of ground rent, a lien on the land charged, upon a judicial sale of the land, are to be paid out of the proceeds. The owner of the ground rent cannot elect to refuse the money and continue the lien. When the sheriff makes the sale, he is bound to appropriate the fund in discharge of the liens in the order of priority, or pay the money into court: Mather <em>v. </em>McMichael, 13 Pa. St. 301. A private sale of the land will not divest liens, and the owner of the ground rent in some circumstances may prosecute proceedings for collection without actual notice to the subsequent grantee. The latter purchases with knowledge of the charge, and often must protect himself: Charnley <em>v. </em>Hansbury, Id. 16. A sheriff\u2019s sale divests the lien of the rent \u2014 no lien is divested by a private sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On April 22d, 1880, Clayton sued Neville for the arrears, and the summons was returned, \u201c Nihil habet.\u201d In Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ber following an alias summons was issued, which was executed by posting and advertising, and on November 22d, 1880, judgment was entered for want of appearance. After the beginning of the suit and before the entry of judgment, the land was sold by the sheriff, who paid the proceeds into court. The lien of the arrears was divested by that sale. If a sheriff\u2019s .sale of land, subject to the lien of a judgment, be made pending a scire facias for its revival, the lien of .the judgment is discharged, and it is no consequence to the purchaser whether judgment be subsequently entered against the defendant reviving the judgment for its full amount. So, when the laud was sold by the sheriff to Millard, the lien for the arrears of ground rent, the foundation of the action in covenant, already existed, and thereafter it could not affect the purchaser. It is not a question of actual payment of the debt on which the second sheriff\u2019s sale was founded, but whether its lien was divested by the first. The title of the first purchaser is not vitiated by the decree of the court misappropriating the fund. Had the owner of the ground rent appeared and made known his right, there would have been no such decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The purchaser at the second sale was as much bound to take notice of the first, and of the then 'existing liens, as would be a purchaser at a second sheriff\u2019s sale upon a judgment that was a lien when the first was consummated. No rent that accrued after the sale to Millard was included in the action of covenant which was begun before. Th.e Act of April 8th, \u25a01840, providing for the posting and advertisement of the alias summons, has no application \u2014 Millard was not a terre tenant till after the beginning of that suit, and there was no occasion for him to appear and make defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In the opinion of the court below, filed when determining the motion for a new trial, it is clearly shown that the Act of May 25th, 1878, does not apply to sheriffs\u2019 deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
