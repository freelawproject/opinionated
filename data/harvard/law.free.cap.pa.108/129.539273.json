And the words of said will, \u201c with power to dispose of the same as she may think best,\u201d were intended to apply only to her power over the estate during her life, to wit: exemption from liability to forfeiture for waste: Langham <em>v. </em>Sanford, 2 Mer. 22.

Cas. 436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">Fisher <em>v. </em>Herbell, supra, is clearly distinguishable from the present ease both in the subject of the devise (which was of \u201c the residue \u201d) and in the words employed as to the power of disposal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-8\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"AU4\">delivered the opinion of the court January 5th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">We think the interpretation given to the will in question in this case, by the learned court below, is correct. It is conceded that the intention of the testator must govern it if it can b\u2019e discovered in the words employed. To us it seems clear, that Hugh Forsythe, the testator, intended to give to his widow a life estate in all his property, with a power of abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>lute disposal in any manner she might think best. Disposal of what? The learned counsel for the plaintiffs in error say, the life estate. But the words of the will say,: \u201c with power to dispose of the 'same,'\u201d and the ante\u00f3\u00e9dent of the words \u201cthe same,\u201d is \u201call my property real and personal, including \u25a0the house and lot of ground that I now reside on.\u201d By .these words read ivi their plain and common Sehse meaning, the power of disposal relates to the property <em>in </em>specie,-and not to a mere interest in it,'and we can not read th'fe 'willin' any other way without,,doing violence to its express words, and, the manifest intent of the testator. ' If the testator' had said'that 'his Widow should have power to dispos\u00e9 of;the property 44 bjl .will,\u201d it. could hardly be conten'ded that be did not, mean that \u2022a disposition to become effective after her death'Was intended. But a general power to dispose of the property \u201cas she may think best,\u201d is unlimited as to the mode and therefore includes '\u00e1ny- kind' of disposition. . Moreover the word \u201c dispose,!\u2019, is \u00e9sp\u00e9cially apt to convey the idea of a gift' by will: But' besides this it is clear'that'the testator was'disposing of his 'entire estate when he made his\u2019will. ' He'sa3\u2019ps so in Words! He-nam'\u00e9s'noother devis\u00e9\u00e9 of legatee, possible 'oreobtingent! than his wife, in any'part of \u2018his will. He do'es not give her a residue,,aftqr other objects of his. b.oun.ty are provided,for, aS was 'the \u2019case in Fisher v. Herbell, 7 W. &amp; S. 63, but hp gives h\u00e9r everything, his whole estate, after payment of debts, during her life, and also the power to-dispose of:it all as she \u2022might'think b\u00e9st. \u25a0 She exercises this power.' She''enjoy\u00e9 the estate in its entirety during her life,' and she 44 disposes \u201d of it by will in. favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">- The plaintiffs are- in no manner 'named in the will as the actual or possible obje\u00f3ts of the testator\u2019s bounty in any contingency. Yet we are asked to hold that they tak\u2019e an estate by virtue' of this-will, and- against a disposition to' the contrary which was, authorized by its terms. There is no tech-1 nical' r'ule of law which requires us to do this, and we are hot willing to do' it in the face of wh\u00e1t we believe to be a clearly; expressed\u2019opposite intention. In Fisher <em>v. </em>Herbell th\u00e9 'decision was based upon what was regarded as a 'sufficiently expressed intention .of the testator that the pQwer, of disposition Was' -limited to the life' \u00e9state of the widow. :T'he will was therefore construed according to the intent of'the testator.' The case was only heard at <em>Nisi Pri\u00fcs </em>and did' not come' into this court in banc.' 'Whether it w'ould b\u00e9 io'llowed'now'i'f the1 same question a-ros\u00e9' upon the sam\u00e9'fa'cts may perhaps be doubted, but as the terms of the devise 'in the Case we are1 c\u00f3hsidei'i'ng. are in several respects different froto those of 'the' will construed in that'case,'We can'reach a different conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>without'determining its authority. -A technical <em>power </em>of disposal, of the very substance of the testator\u2019s estate, without any limitation as to the manner or kind of disposal, is given, and.there are' no other .words in the will which .indicate an intent to restrain the act of disposition ,so ,as to be effective during.the life of the widow, ',.In these circumstances we-are pot disposed to declare a meaning to the will' which, we think, was not the meaning of the testator. \u25a0 \u25a0 -</p>\n<p id=\"AqeF\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
