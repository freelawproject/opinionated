The nets were placed at distances from the shore varying from about 100 rods to a mile and a half. Dunlap continued to use the nets until late in the fall for the purpose of catching sturgeon.

The Court is requested to charge the jury that the boundary line of Pennsylvania is the margin of the lake, and if the jury find from the evidence that the pond nets were set thirty or forty rods from the margin of the lake, that they were outside of the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania, and the defendant must be acquitted.

That don\u2019t repeal the previous positive prohibition agains\u00ed pond nets. The legislature are not presumed to have meant by that general provision to have intended to repeal the positive prohibition of the previous Act. There may be other ways of catching sturgeon which we know nothing about. <em>We </em>have no evidence that they may not be caught in other ways. At all events you are instructed, so far as my opinion goes in this matter, that this Act of Assembly.urged to you as giving the leave and liberty to this defendant to set pond nets, does not give him that liberty.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-6\">It is claimed that the Act of May 16th, 1878* was repealed by the later Act of June 3d of the same year. This Act is entitled \u201c An Act to amend and consolidate the several Acts relating to game and game fish.\u201d It consists of forty-one sections and is a general Act applicable to the entire state. Tile Act under which the defendant is indicted is a local Act and applicable onl/ to Lake Erie and the bays, etc., adjacent thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-7\">[It is not alleged that the general Act contains any words repealing in express terms this local Act, but it is 'urged that inasmuch as the 22d section of the general Act prohibits pond nets and provides for a penalty of $25 only, while the local Act fixes a penalty of $50 and a forfeiture of the boats, lake implements, etc., used in such pond net fishing, that the Acts are repugnant, and that the former must be held as being repealed by implication.] It might perhaps be a sufficient answer to this to refer to the 40th section of the later Act, by which it is provided that \u201c nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply to any stream forming the boundary line between this and any state over which this state has concurrent jurisdiction with such state, so far as such streams form such boundary lines, nor.to any lake partly within the boundaries of this state.\u201d But as the question is, in my judgment, conclusively settled by a well known rule, it is not necessary to place it upon the <em>possibly doubtful meaning </em>of the language of the section just quoted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-8\">[The rule referred to is that a subsequent general Act does not repeal a prior particular or local Act, in so far as their provisions are inconsistent. Such repeals are not favored and are never allowed except in cases of strong repugnancy or irreconcilable inconsistency. In the case of Wright <em>v. </em>Vickers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>81 P. F. S., 126, the Supreme Court, Judge Woodward delivering the opinion, said: \u201c To repeal a statute by implication there must be such a positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new law and the old that they cannot stand together or be consistently reconciled.\u201d In the case of Brown against Commissioners, 9th Harris, 37, it was held by the Supreme Court that a general statute <em>ivithout negative </em>words will not repeal a previous statute which is particular, though the provisions in the two be different. In this case, as was said in the case of Harrisburg <em>v. </em>Scheck, the two Acts may be executed each within its appropriate sphere, without any repug-' nancy whatever, and hence there can be no repeal by implication. In Seifried <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Out., 200; Judge Trunkey said: \u201c It is against reason to suppose that the legislature in forming a general system for the state intended to repeal a special Act which the local circumstances of one county had made necessary.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-6\">Verdict, guilty as indicted, and defendant sentenced to pay a fine of $50 and the costs of prosecution, and to stand committed until the sentence was complied with. Defendant thereupon took this writ assigning for error the answers to his points, and the portions of the charge of the court inclosed in brackets above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-7\"><em>Benson Brain erd, </em>for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVC\">Our first two points should have been affirmed. The boundary of the state is the margin of the lake. See the Indian deed to the State of Pennsylvania in 1789: Appendix to Penna. Archives, 100, Laws of Penna. ed., 1810, vol. 2, p. 124. The \u201ctriangle\u201d was not conveyed to Pennsylvania by King Charles\u2019s charter: Duke of York\u2019s Book of Laws, 81; but was ceded to the Federal Government by New York and Massachusetts, and conveyed by the United States to Pennsylvania in 1792: 2 Laws U. S., 241. In the case of other states the boundary line has been expressly fixed at the middle of the lake: Charters and Constitutions of the United States, vol. 1, 994, 436; vol. 2, 1022: 2021; Carson <em>v. </em>Blazer, 2 Binney, 490. Judicial authority does not extend beyond the defined territorial limits: Manley <em>v. </em>The People, 3 Selden, 295; especially in the case of a penal statute. The local Act of May 16th, 1878, is repealed by negative words in the repealing clause of the general Act of June 3d, 1878, and also by implication. The former makes net fishing unlawful in all the waters of the state, except Lake Erie, and repeals all Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent therewith. The former Act was therefore repealed by implication, and as Lake Erie is expressly excepted from the provisions of the latter Act, neither apply to this case: John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ston\u2019s Estate, 9 Casey, 511; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cromley, 1 Ash., 179; Nusser <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Casey, 126. The fifth point should have been affirmed. The Act of June 27th, 1883 (P. L. 164), provides that the catching of sturgeon in any of the waters of the Commonwealth shall not be unlawful. The defendant was fishing for sturgeon and in the only possible manner. The rule as to jurisdiction over the high seas does not apply to the great lakes. It was therefore error to charge that under this rule the jurisdiction of the state extended to a marine league from the shore.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b628-4\"><em>B. A. </em>Walling-and <em>C. L. </em>Baker, district attorneys, and <em>J. B,oss Thompson </em>(with whom were <em>B. W. Grant </em>and <em>Clark Olds'), </em>for defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avcy\">The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth extends a marine league from the shore: See Resolution of Congress, Penna. Archives, vol. 11, pp. 387, 388; Martin <em>v. </em>Waddell, 16 Peters, 367; Mumford <em>v. </em>Wardwell, 6 Wall, 436; Dunham <em>v. </em>Lamphere, 3 Gray, 268; The Genesee Chief, 12 Howard, 457. The reasons which induced the passage of the Act in question are set out in the report of the conn mittee appointed by the Legislature, March 22d, 1877, to investigate the fisheries of the state presented March 5th, 1878: Legislative Record, 1878, p. 1054.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b628-5\">Mr.' Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"ANC5\">delivered the opinion of 'the court, March 30th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The only question in this case is one of jurisdiction, for the 40th section of the Act of June 3d, 1878, in express terms provides that its provisions shall not apply to any stream forming the boundary line between this state and any other having a concurrent jurisdiction over such stream, nor to any lake partly within the boundaries thereof. Hence, without troubling ourselves' about the question of repeal by implication, we conclude with the learned judge of the court below, that the local Act of May 16th, 1878, is operative if the State of Pennsylvania has jurisdiction oyer any part of Lake Erie. But on this subject we have no doubt whatever; we are, indeed, surprised that such a question should have been raised in the court below, and have been thought worthy of discussion in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">When the government of the United States ceded to Penn sylvania the triangular tract on Lake Erie it retained nothing and in the resolution of cession it was expressly declared that the laws and public Acts of the said state should extend to every part <em>of </em>said tract, to all interests, and intents and purposes as if the same had been within the charter bounds of the said state. But had it been originally within the charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>bounds of the state there could be no doubt about its jurisdiction over the adjacent waters of the late. It was only after the Act of Congress of February 26th, 1845, that even an admiralty jurisdiction was claimed for the United States over the waters of the lakes, and the constitutionality of that Act was seriously doubted until it was settled in 1851 by the Supreme Court in the case of the propeller Genesee Chief <em>v. </em>Fitzhugh, 12 How., 443. Previously to this time the doctrine was held, as established by the cases of the Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat., 428, and the steamboat Orleans <em>v. </em>Phoebus, 11 Pet., 175, that the jurisdiction did not extend beyond tide water. It is, therefore, obvious that previous to the Act of 1845 the courts of the states bordering on the great lakes must, <em>ex necessitate, </em>have had jurisdiction over them to the treaty line, for it could not be that they were altogether without law, and that crimes of every character could be committed thereon with impunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Indeed, we must regard the decisions in the two cases last above cited as declarative of the exclusive jurisdiction of the states, whilst the case of the Genesee Chief <em>v. </em>Fitzhugh put the jurisdiction of those states bordering on or having in them navigable rivers and lakes on precisely the same footing as those on the seaboard. But the general jurisdiction of these over their adjacent tide waters has never been doubted. There is not now, and never has been, any room for such doubt. The states, immediately before the adoption of the Federal Constitution, were independent sovereignties, and as such had right over the seas of their coasts to the extent of a marine league from the shores. Upon the adoption of that Constitution there was a partial surrender of this right, in that it was provided the judicial power of the Federal courts should extend to all admiralty and maritime cases. Nevertheless, as was said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in the case of the United States <em>v. </em>Bevans, 3 Wheat., 336, \u201cThe general jurisdiction over the place, subject to this grant of power, adheres to the territory as a portion of sovereignty not yet given away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Hence, in the case cited, it was held that where a homicide had been committed by a marine on board a United Statesship of war, anchored in the Boston harbor, the courts of Massachusetts had power to arrest and try the offender, and this, not because Congress had not the power by its legislation to- bring a crime thus committed within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, but because it had not so legislated. As an illustration of the power of a state to enforce its laws over its tide waters, notwithstanding the maritime jurisdiction of the United States, the learned Chief Justice asks the question: If two citizens of Massachusetts should step into shallow water, when the tide flows, and fight a duel, are they not within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>jurisdiction and punishable by the laws of that state ? There can, of course, be but one answer to a question of this kind. Yet this question may be just as pertinently put with reference to the waters of Lake Erie. In support of this same hue of argument may be cited the language of Mr. Chief Justice Tanby, in the case of Martin et al. <em>v. </em>The Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet., 367, that when the Revolution took place the states themselves became sovereign, and as such possessed the absolute right over all their navigable waters, and the soils under thorn, and that they are, even now, so held subject to the rights surrendered by the Constitution to the general government. The case of Dunham <em>v. </em>Lamphere, 3 Gray, 268, though not of equal authority as the cases above cited, is undoubtedly sound law, and is directly in point. It was there held that an Act regulating the time and manner of taking fish in the sea, within a mile of the shore, is within the authority of the State Legislature, and binding on citizens of other states, and on vessels enrolled and licensed as fishing vessels under the laws of the United States. One of the authorities cited in support of this ruling is Bennett <em>v. </em>Boggs, Bald., 60, where it was held that a law of Delaware prohibiting the use of a gil ling net in tide waters within the limits of the state, was valid, and that the legislature had power to regulate the fisheries in the Delaware by- the prohibition of a common law right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Thus, from what has been shown, it follows: (1) By the Act of cession the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania over the waters of Lake Erie, adjacent to the ceded territory, is the same as though that territory had been embraced in the original charter to William Penn. (2) That the legislative powers of this Commonwealth over these waters are absolute, except so far as they may be restrained by Congress for the purpose of carrying into effect the admiralty and maritime laws of the United States; and (3), The consequent of the above-stated proposi tions, the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth to regulate fisheries in these waters, in the absence of auy Act of the Federal Legislature abridging it, is plenary, and cannot be called in question by any other power short of the Government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
