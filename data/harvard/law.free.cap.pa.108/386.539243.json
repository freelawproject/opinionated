Per Curiam:. We have no doubt that the testatrix meant children when she .used the word issue. Considering the whole paragraph in which it is used, we cannot arrive at any other conclusion. The clear intent of the textatrix was to give to each of her daughters a life estate only, \u25a0 and on their death to give to their children and their heirs the estate-in fee. The language used was therefore a word of pur-d chase. Hence they took the remainder as purchasers, and not by descent. Robins et al. <em>v. </em>Quinliven (29 P. F. S., 333) rules this case.

The rule always applies where there is, first, an estate of freehold in the ancestor, and secondly, a limitation by way of remainder of the inheritance to his \u201c heirs,\u201d or \u201c the heirs of his body,\u201d by that description, or by any substituted term apparently designed to comprehend the whole line of the ancestor\u2019s inheritable succession: Abel\u2019s Case, Maynard, 18 Edw. II., folio 577; Hayes on Estates Tail, xlix. 3, 93; Smith\u2019s Executory Interest, 209, \u00a7 401;Coke upon Littleton, 319 b, 376 <em>b</em>; Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 Har. 344, 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-14\">The first branch of this devise, to daughters for life, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>limitation of an estate of freehold to them; and the second branch, then to their issue and the heirs and . assigns of such issue, is a limitation of the inheritance by way of remainder to their \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">It is immaterial that the remainder is to the \u201c issue \u201d of the ancestors. In a will, \u201c issue,\u201d prima facie, means \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d and is <em>ex vi termini </em>descriptive of all the issue of every generation to come, and is a word of limitation: Perrin <em>v. </em>Blake, Hargrave\u2019s Collectanea Juridica, 315, and cases there cited; Robinson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Burr., 38; Lees <em>v. </em>Mosley, 1 Y. &amp; Col.

It is admitted that in the latter case the device was not within the scope of the rule. The opinion of Williams, J., shows that it was not invoked because the en-grafting of words of limitation in fee and of distribution on the gift to the issue, indicated clearly and unequivocally the intention of the testator to use the term \u201c issue \u201d as a word of purchase, meaning children or descendants living at the death of the first taker, and thereby preventing the force of the rule. The two cases are therefore clearly distinguishable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>As to the intention -of the testatrix. Does she, by the language used in expressing her complete bounty, say that her daughters should take a life estate only, and that their lawful issue should take the remainder as purchasers in fee, and not as heirs by descent from their mother? If so, the devise repels the application of the rule. Or does she mean that her daughters should have the enjoyment of the estate during life; and subject thereto, that the estate should descend to all their descendants according to the rules of law? If so, the devise irresistibly invites the operation of the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">It may be probable that the testatrix intended to give her daughters a life estate only, and on their death to give to their children or issue then living the estate in fee simple. But has she unequivocally and with certainty expressed such an intent in language which according to the legal canons of construction shows such a meaning? Has she not employed words which under the rules of construction indicate an intention to create species of limitations which fall within the scope of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case ? She has devised a freehold for the life of the first takers with a limitation of the remainder to their issue, which issue not only include their ancestor\u2019s immediate issue, but also their remote and most remote, born'and to be born.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">This result is in accordance with the primary or paramount (general) intent of the testatrix, founded in the most vehement presumption, that the \u201cissue \u201d should take <em>qua </em>heirs, and not as a root of the new succession. The secondary or minor (particular) intent that the daughters should have but a life estate, and that their issue should take the remainder as purchasers, gives way to the general intent: Smith\u2019s Executory Int., 216, \u00a7 429 ; 219, \u00a7 436; 253, \u00a7 523 ; 254, \u00a7 526 ; Fearne\u2019s Contingent Rem., 200 ; James\u2019s Claim, 1 Dal., 47; Carter <em>v. </em>McMichael, 10 S. &amp; R., 430; Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, 3 R., 59; Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 1 Har. 344, 351; Kleppner <em>v. </em>Laverty, 20 Sm., 70, 72; Huber\u2019s Appeal, 30 Id., 348, 356. She may not have meant to give them an estate tail, or to apply the rule. But she used words which in law mean nothing else. If she intended to bestow but an estate for life, <em>voluit non dixit; </em>technical words must have their legal effect whatever the testatrix may have intended: Bender <em>v. </em>Fleurie, 2 Gr., 345, 347; Philada.\u2019s Co.\u2019s Apl., 12 N., 209, 214; Doebler\u2019s Appl., 14 Sm., 9, 15; Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, supra; Hayes on Estates Tail, 96. The superadded words in fee engrafted on the word of procreation, \u201c issue,\u201d do not operate to break or change the ordinary course of descent pointed out by the preceding words of limitation. They amount to a mere repetition of the former blanch of the gift. <em>Pxpressio eorum quce tacite </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>insunt nihil operatur: </em>Smith\u2019s Executory Int., 252, \u00a7 516 : Hargrave\u2019s Law Tracts, 504; Fearne\u2019s Contingent Rem., 181; Preston\u2019s Estates, *347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\">It follows that \u201cissue \u201d is used as a word of limitation of the estate, and the device is within the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case conferring upon the daughters an estate tail in possession, their life estate merging in their estate tail, which, by virtue of the Act of 1855, is converted into an estate in fee simple.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-8\"><em>Hampton L. Carson </em>(with him <em>William A. Redding </em>and <em>J. Levering Jones'), </em>for defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aax\">The intention of the testatrix must be first ascertained without the aid of the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, which operates only on the intention, when it has been ascertained, not on the meaning of the words used to express it: Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 H., 344. It is always a precedent question whether the limitation of the remainder is made to the heirs in fee or in tail as such, and in its solution the rule itself renders no assistance. It is silent until the intention of the grantor or devisor is ascertained: Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wr., 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-10\">In what sense did the testatrix use the words \u201c heirs and assigns of such issue ? \u201d \u25a0 This must be our first inquiry. Did she use the word \u201cissue\u201d in the technical sense of \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d or did she, by the superadded words of limitation, to-wit, \u201c the heirs and assigns of such issue,\u201d so far limit and restrain the generality of the term \u201cissue\u201d as to make it equivalent to the expression \u201c children ? \u201d This is a question of intention, to be ascertained according to the ordinary rules of construction peculiar to wills. Whatever ma3r be the views of Smith, in his work on Executory Interests, 256, \u00a7 519, we submit that the question has been determined in Pennsylvania by the case of Robins <em>v. </em>Quinliven, 29 Sm., 333. If it be argued that the c\u00e1se has been misunderstood or misapplied, because, in addition to the superadded words in fee, there were words of distributive modification, we ask this court to consider whether there is any real distributive modification-introduced by the words \u201c to the issue and their heirs forever, in the proportions to which they would be entitled, under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, respectively.\u201d What new principles of distribution are introduced ? Do not the words contain \u201c an accurate periphrasis of the word heirs ? \u201d \u201c Heirs\u201d has been judicially construed to mean \u201c to such person or persons, for such estate or estates, and in such proportions as would, by the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, be entitled to the same if he had died intestate seized thereof in fee\u201d: See Dodson v. Ball, 10 Sm., 492; Yarnall\u2019s Est., 20 Id., 335; Gaul\u2019s Est., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>30 Id., 348; Johnson\u2019s Appeal, 7 Norris, 346; Clark <em>v. </em>Scott, 17 Sm., 449. Even the strict technical import of the word \u201cheir\u201d means, in the words of Mr. Jarman, \u201c the person or persons appointed by law to succeed to the real estate in question in ease of intestacy.\u201d (2 Bigelow\u2019s Jarman on Wills, *81.) This is certainly the same thing as saying, \u201c such persons as would be entitled to the same, under the intestate laws, had he or she died seised and possessed thereof.\u201d There is no more difference between the substance of the two expressions of this same idea than there is between a \u201c green field \u201d and \u201c a field that is green.\u201d Gross on the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, in Pennsylvania, in Table VI., presents an analytical statement of the cases in this court, where the word \u201cissue\u201d has been regarded in the technical meaning of the words \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d but no limitations like those under consideration are exhibited as conferring an estate tail or in fee upon the ancestor. In Table VII., where the word \u201c issue\u201d is regarded in a sense different from the technical meaning of the words \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d appear cases (Nos. 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, and 40 a), in which the prima facie meaning of \u201cissue\u201d is converted into a word of purchase bv superadded words in fee : See also 1 Rhone\u2019s O. C. Practice, 764, \u00a7 475; Hill <em>v. </em>Hill, 24 Sm., 173; Daley <em>v. </em>Koons, 37 Leg. Intell., 299; Taylor <em>v. </em>Taylor, 13 Sm., 481. In Hill <em>v. </em>Hill, supra, Shabswood, J., said: \u201c No word is to be rejected to which a reasonable effect can be given.\u201d What, then, is the effect of the word \u201c such,\u201d when the testatrix says: \u201cTo my daughters for life and their issue,\u2019and to the heirs and assigns of such issue ? \u201d Does it not at once suggest the thought that the word \u201c issue\u201d is used in the sense of \u201c children of my daughters,\u201d and that there is no gift in fee until the grandchildren of the testatrix are reached? If this be so, the words are used as words of purchase, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case has no application.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-7\">Mr. Justice Tbtjnkey</author>\n<p id=\"ATzE\">delivered the opinion of the Court, March, 23d, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The only case relied on by the defendant to sustain the judgment of the court below, is Robins <em>v. </em>Quinliven, 79 Pa. St., 333. There the question arose upon a devise by the testator to his daughter \u201c for and during her natural life, and after her death to her issue and their heirs forever, in the proportions to which they would be entitled under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, respectively.\u201d The clear opinion of Justice Williams places the judgment on the true ground, namely : \u201cThe gift of the remainder is not to the issue alone, bat to the issue and their heirs forever, in the proportions to which they would be entitled, under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, respectively; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that is to say, in equal shares as tenants in common. The limitation to the heirs general of the issue, with the superadded words of distributive modification, clearly shows that by \u201c issue\u201d the testator meant children, and intended that they should take the remainder .as purchasers and not as heirs by descent.\u201d He then refers to the settled rule, citing some of the authorities, that where there is a devise to one for life, with remainder to his issue as tenants in common, with a limitation to the heirs general of the issue, the issue take as purchasers. There is no sign that had the devise omitted the words of distributive modification, the word issue would have been construed to mean children.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In the defendant\u2019s argument it was suggested that the terms of that devise introduced no real distributive modification, but contained merely \u201c an accurate periphrasis of the word heirs.\u201d Were this so, the fact would remain that the devise was construed to contain a distributive modification, in words equivalent to a provision that the issue and their heirs should take in equal shares as- tenants in common. That construction was the basis of the decision. If erroneous the mistake was of fact, not of law. But there was no mistake. The common law rule relating to inheritance was materially changed by the statute which defines the persons who shall inherit the lands of intestates, and the proportions which they shall take. The devise of the remainder to the issue in the statutory proportions, was conclusive that the testator used \u201cissue\u201d for children.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this case, the testatrix devised the real estate to her three daughters, to have and to hold to them during their natural lives, and after their death then to the lawful issue of her said three daughters, and the heirs and assigns of such issue. The rule is unquestioned that prima facie, in a will, the word issue means \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d and will be construed as a wordo'f limitation, unless there be explanatory words showing it was used in a restricted sense. It is urged that the word such, with the form of expression where used, is sufficient to show that by \u201cissue\u201d the testatrix meant children. There is no other explanatory word. What difference is there between a devise to A for life, and then to the issue of A, and the heirs and assigns of such issue, and a devise to A for life, and then to A\u2019s issue and their heirs and assigns ? Precisely the same persons are meant by issue in each phrase, and the word has the same power in one as the other. Each form expresses the same thing. If the word children were put instead of issue, each phrase would then express the same meaning, and the children after their ancestor\u2019s death would take in fee as purchasers. The clause in the will where \u201c such\u201d is used, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>equivalent for \u201cissue and their heirs.\u201d Technical words, or words of a definite meaning, must be construed according to their legal or definite effect, unless from other inconsistent Avords in the will it be clear that, they are used in some other definite sense. Applying the legal -rules of interpretation the intendment of this devise is plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A long current of decisions in England and in this Commonwealth has established and continued in force a rule as- follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c When the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited either mediately or immediately to his heirs in fee or in tail; that always in such cases the heirs are words of limitation of the estate, and not words of purchase.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The rule operates to give the ancestor an estate for life in the first instance, and by force of the devise to his heirs, general or special, the inheritance also, by conferring the remainder on him as the stock from which alone they can inherit, and the source from which alone inheritable blood can spring: Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. St., 344. Gibson, C. J., also said, that the rule subverts a particular intention in, perhaps, every instance of its operation; but it is an intention which the law cannot indulge, being an intention to create an inalienable estate tail in the first donee; and that the rule is too intimately connected Avith the doctrine of estates to be separated from it Avithout breaking the ligaments of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Aside from the Avordsof distributive modification, the devise in Robins <em>v. </em>Quinliven would have been Avithin the operation of the rule, and, therefore, that case does not determine this in favor of the defendant. Perhaps the testatrix intended to give a life estate to her daughters and the remainder in fee to their children; but she has used words which definitely vest in her daughters an estate tail, and the courts are not at liberty to wrest them so that they may mean anything else. She has used apt words to Greate a particular estate in certain persons, and it ought not to be arbitrarily ruled that she intended some other thing than that expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Judgment reversed, and judgment is now entered for the plaintiff, sum to be liquidated by the prothonotary of the Common Pleas.</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-10\">Merctir, C. J., and Gordon and Sterrett, JJ., dissent. They think the language of the testatrix so clearly sIioavs she meant children, and not heirs generally, that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case does not apply.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
