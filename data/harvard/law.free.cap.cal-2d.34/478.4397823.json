A jury found that he was.guilty of murder of the first degree and did not specifically recommend the penalty; the same jury found that he was sane at the time he committed the murder. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>appeals from the ensuing judgment imposing the death penalty and from an order denying his motion for new trial. His principal contention is that the trial court erred to his prejudice by excluding, on the trial of the general issue of not guilty, proffered evidence which assertedly would have tended to show (or raise a reasonable doubt) that he did not possess the mental state (\u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d deliberation and premeditation) essential to constitute the homicide murder of the first degree. We have concluded, for reasons hereinafter detailed, that defendant has failed to establish error in respect to this contention, and that other points urged by him show no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In support of his main contention defendant relies upon the recent holding of this court (in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1949), 33 Cal.2d 330, 350-351 [202 P.2d 53]) that \u201cAs a general rule, on the not guilty plea, evidence, otherwise competent, tending to show that the defendant, who at this stage is conclusively presumed sane, either <em>did </em>or <em>did not, </em>in committing the overt act, possess the specific essential mental state, is admissible, but evidence tending to show legal sanity or legal insanity is not admissible. Thus, if the proffered evidence tends to show not merely that he <em>did </em>or <em>did not, </em>but rather that because of legal insanity he <em>could </em>not, entertain the specific intent or other essential mental state, then that evidence is inadmissible under the not guilty plea and is admissible only on the trial on the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The standard by which the trial judge must appraise the admissibility of evidence in every case is, of course, the familiar \u2018right or wrong\u2019 standard ... by which legal insanity as a defense is gauged. <em>[McNaughten\u2019s Case </em>(1843), 8 Eng.Rep.R 718; see 7 Cal.Jur., p. 862, \u00a7 21, and cases there cited.] Evidence which tends to show legal insanity (likewise, sanity) is not admissible at the first stage of the trial because it is not pertinent to any issue then being litigated; but competent evidence, other than proof of sanity or insanity, which tends to show that a (then presumed) legally sane defendant either did or did not in fact possess the required, specific intent or motive is admissible. \u201d As is hereinafter shown, the exclusionary rulings of which defendant complains were made upon stated grounds contrary to this holding of the Wells case and, if no other ground for the rulings existed, error would appear; however, such rulings were actually correct because (as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielly </em>(1949), 33 Cal.2d 362, 364 [202 P.2d 18]), \u201calthough the proof of malice aforethought and deliberation and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>meditation was, of course, an essential part of the prosecution\u2019s case, the rejected evidence was not materially relevant to any theory of defense raised upon the trial of the general issue. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The objective circumstances of the killing, viewing the evidence most favorable to respondent People insofar as it is in conflict,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were as follows: In March, 1946, defendant married Catherine, the daughter of Antonio and Rosario Maniscalco. About one month after their marriage, defendant and his wife went to live with the wife\u2019s mother and father. Upon the premises were a two-flat dwelling and a small cottage. A son of the Maniscalcos and the son\u2019s wife, Roberta, lived in the cottage with their two small children. The elder Maniscalcos and other members of the family lived in the upper flat. Defendant and Catherine lived in the lower flat. Defendant killed not only his mother-in-law, Mrs. Maniscalco, but also his wife\u2019s infant niece, Rosario Cecchi, aged about 11 months. He was not charged with the latter killing. The infant Rosario was left in the care of her grandmother, the elder Mrs. Maniscalco, while her parents worked. Defendant and his wife were godparents of the infant girl. Prior to April 21, 1948, the day of the killings, defendant had consistently evidenced great affection for his mother-in-law and the infant niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On the morning of April 21, 1948, defendant had <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>cramps all over \u2019 \u2019 and did not go to work. His wife, who was regularly employed, went to her work, as did other adult members of the family. The only members of the family, aside from defendant, who remained on the premises were Mrs. Rosario Maniscalco (defendant\u2019s mother-in-law), the infant Rosario Cecchi, and Roberta and her two children. Some time after 10 o\u2019clock, while the mother-in-law was at the grocery store, Roberta was in her bedroom making the beds, and the three children were playing in the cottage. Defendant came to Roberta\u2019s kitchen window, stood on a\" chair, and forced open the window. Roberta went into the kitchen and defendant said, \u201cYou better let me in. I am going to get you anyway.\u201d Roberta unlocked the door of the cottage and ran to the street. As she passed defendant he \u201cmade a grab,\u201d caught Roberta\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>dress, but she \u201cbroke loose and ran out . . . and half way down the block. \u2019 \u2019 There she met her mother-in-law and told her that defendant \u201cwas breaking in the house after me, and she got mad. \u2019 \u2019 Roberta returned to her cottage. The mother-in-law went into defendant's flat and Roberta could hear her \u201chollering real loud,\u201d but could not understand what she said. The mother-in-law then returned to Roberta\u2019s cottage and picked up the infant Rosario. Defendant called to the mother-in-law from his flat, asking her to help him fix some artichokes. She replied that she would help him and went into his flat carrying the baby. Some time later (how long, Roberta did not recall) defendant returned to Roberta\u2019s cottage. The following description of events is taken from her testimony: \u201che had blood coming down his face, and he asked me for a Bandaid, and I said, \u2018What happened to you now?\u2019 And he said my mother-in-law had hit him with a ring, that he had a little quarrel, and she hit him with a ring. \u2019 \u2019 Roberta obtained a bandage and, as she was preparing it, defendant \u201cmade a grab for me ... He had my dress up and I started to holler, and I turned around, and he had a knife and he said, \u2018If you holler, I will cut your throat.\u2019 And I told my boy to call grandma; and he acted like nothing was wrong . . . [Defendant] grabbed me and pulled me on my little boy\u2019s bed . . . and took my pants off. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant removed his trousers and completed an act of sexual intercourse with Roberta. Blood from the cut on defendant\u2019s face was on her face and \u201cI was trying to get away from him. He kept threatening me and then I said, \u2018 Can I get up and wash the blood off my face?\u2019 ... He said, \u2018O.K.\u2019 And I got up to make a break . . . and he grabbed me and put me on my bed,\u201d where he accomplished two more acts of sexual intercourse. He then put on his trousers, combed his hair, and left the cottage. Roberta \u201cwaited until he went out, . . . and I put my pants on and I ran upstairs to tell my mother-in-law . . . what he had done . . . [Defendant] was standing at the phone, with the receiver in his hand . . . He said \u2018Dial this number,\u2019 \u201d and Roberta dialed a number as defendant directed. (Although Roberta did not know it, this was the number of the police station.) She then \u201cstarted walking away, and he said to me, \u2018 Guess who I am dialing ? \u2019 And I ignored him, and then he said, \u2018Come over here. There is a murder.\u2019 \u201d Roberta at once ran from the house and into the street in search of help. A police officer arrived and Roberta went with him to defendant\u2019s flat. The officer tried the door, found it locked, and knocked. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Defendant admitted them. \u201cI [Roberta] said, \u2018Where is my mother-in-law and the baby?\u2019 And he said coldly, \u2018In there.\u2019 And it was covered up with the blanket, and I looked, and I ran out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In the dining room of defendant\u2019s flat were the bodies of his mother-in-law and infant niece. Defendant had struck each of them many times about the head with a wrench, fracturing the skull and inflicting many lacerations and bruises, then, with a carving knife, had stabbed each of them repeatedly in the head, arms, chest, abdomen and thighs and partially eviscerated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">When he was questioned by the police and a deputy district attorney at about 2:20 in the afternoon of April 21, 1948, defendant gave an account of the killings largely similar to that which he gave in his testimony. According to defendant\u2019s testimony, Roberta (sometimes referred to as Bobbie) came into his flat on the morning of the 21st. They were \u201cholding hands\u201d when their mother-in-law came in. Defendant asked the mother-in-law to prepare some artichokes. As the mother-in-law was doing this, holding the baby under her left arm and a cup in her right hand, Roberta said, \u2018 \u2018 She is going to squeal, \u2019 \u2019 and handed defendant the wrench. Defendant \u201ctook the wrench and I did not hesitate, and I hit her . . . [S]he swung around and she is a heavy woman, and that cup hit me under the eye here and that got me dizzy a little bit too, and I don\u2019t know\u2014I must have hit her some more after that, I guess. I don\u2019t quite remember how many times I hurted her, and after that I turned around and Bobbie had the knife in her hand ... I don\u2019t remember hitting the baby ... I don\u2019t remember if I did [kill them], but I know I hit her [the mother-in-law] ... I am pretty sure I did have that knife <em>... I </em>don\u2019t remember cutting them up, though.\u201d Defendant changed his clothes and wiped off the knife. At Bobbie\u2019s suggestion they went to her cottage, taking the knife to \u2018 \u2018 clean it better.\u201d Defendant left the wrench on his kitchen table. In Bobbie\u2019s bedroom she voluntarily engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant. Defendant testified that he was not angry at his mother-in-law, that he loved her. Asked, \u201cWhy did you hit her on the head with that wrench?\u201d defendant replied, \u2018 \u2018 Bobbie told me she was going to squeal, \u2019 \u2019 and again, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... I didn\u2019t realize anything at the time.\u201d Defendant testified further that it was only \u201cwhen he got through having intercourse\u201d that he \u201crealized when she gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>me that wrench to hit my mother-in-law\u201d; defendant got up, dressed, and went to telephone the police; he dialed \u201cInformation\u201d and asked for the number of the police department; Bobbie came in and defendant asked her to dial the number because \u201cI was shaking ... I was nervous; I was scared\u201d; after she had dialed the number Bobbie asked, \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d; defendant replied, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what we done downstairs? I am calling the police\u201d; Bobbie said, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t call the police, \u2019\u2019 and ran out.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">According to the testimony of a police officer relating a statement assertedly made on the afternoon of April 21 defendant remembered that \u201cWhen I struck her [the mother-in-law] on the head she dropped the baby on the floor . . . The baby was crying, so I struck the baby, too. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant assertedly also remembered at that time that \u201cI stabbed my mother-in-law, and I ripped her open ... I also stabbed the baby. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>The Exclusion of Evidence Which, Defendant Contends, Would Tend to Show Lack of Malice Aforethought, Deliberation and Premeditation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">During his opening statement to the jury defendant\u2019s counsel said that he intended to adduce evidence \u2018 \u2018 directed to the mental state of the defendant. Now, I am not talking to you specifically about whether the defendant is sane or insane at this time ... We will show you facts which will demonstrate an explosion of the mind . . . that on this occasion he went so far berserk as to be nothing mentally more or less than a wild beast . . . We are further going to show you . . . that this man only a short time ago was confined in the psychopathic ward of the San Francisco Hospital. \u2019 \u2019 Counsel for the People then said, \u201cYou are not going to show anything of that kind during the first trial ... We are not going to go into this man\u2019s . . . sanity.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cI am not going to show it for the purpose of sanity. I am going to show it for the purpose of demonstrating a possible ease of hysterical amnesia, which is a proper question to raise in this trial.\u201d Again, defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that he intended to present the defense of \u201closs of consciousness at the particular time the thing happened, that has nothing to do with insanity. \u2019 \u2019 The trial judge properly ruled, \u201cThat is right.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel concluded his opening statement by saying, \u201cwe will have to let the evidence demonstrate for all of us exactly what degree of crime, if any, has been committed.\u201d These excerpts from defendant\u2019s opening statement indicate that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>counsel had a correct understanding as to the type of evidence of mental condition which is admissible on the trial of the general <em>issue; </em>i. e., that he could introduce evidence tending to show that defendant was unconscious at the time of the killings and thus incapable of committing crime (Pen. Code, \u00a7 26), and evidence tending to show that defendant did not possess the requisite specific mental state of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and a deliberate, premeditated intention to kill, so long as the evidence did not tend to show that because of legal insanity, he <em>could not </em>possess the requisite mental state. However (and in this, as previously indicated, the case is similar to <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielly </em>(1949), <em>supra, </em>33 Cal.2d 362, 364), defendant did not offer competent evidence of mental condition which would tend to negative his possession of the requisite state of mind. The instances of exclusion of evidence of which he complains are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel asked the autopsy surgeon who had described the wounds which caused Mrs. Maniscalco\u2019s death, \u201cWould you say, Doctor, that whoever inflicted the wounds on this woman certainly must have been operating at the time under an abnormal and just under an abnormal frame of mind, let us say?\u201d The district attorney objected on the ground that \u201cThe Doctor cannot possibly answer it categorically.\u201d The trial court correctly sustained the objection ; no proper foundation for the question had been laid. There is no showing that the doctor had, or legitimately could form, an opinion which could aid the jury in determining the state of mind of the killer who inflicted the wounds. In the absence of some affirmative showing of related materiality it will not be presumed that from mere examination of the wounds, the autopsy doctor could do more than speculate as to what the state of mind of the killer, insofar as it could properly constitute a subject of expert testimony is concerned, might have been; it is not shown that from the nature of the wounds alone the doctor could draw any material inferences which the jury themselves could not draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Defendant unsuccessfully sought to show, on the trial of the general issue, that prior to the homicide he had been in the psychopathic ward of the city hospital. A police officer, testifying for the People, was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel on cross-examination, did you ascertain at any time whether this man had been confined to the psychopathic hospital in San Francisco?\u201d The People\u2019s general objection to this ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tion was sustained; no offer of proof was made. Later on, however, in relation to the incident, defendant testified that approximately six months before the homicide his wife took him to the city hospital, \u201cand when I came back to myself, I was in the coocoo ward.\u201d The People moved to strike the quoted portion of defendant\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was \u201cself-serving\u201d and \u201cattempting to inject into this hearing a matter that is not proper\u201d; the motion was granted. Defendant did not, on the trial of the general issue, make any offer of proof to show the relevancy of this line of inquiry. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1949), 92 Cal.App.2d 639, 644 [207 P.2d 632].) However, it appears from the evidence introduced on the trial of the issue of insanity that the excluded testimony was not relevant to the general issue. At the second stage of the trial, when defendant\u2019s inquiry into the subject was not limited, his wife thus described the occasion upon which he was taken to the hospital: Defendant had been \u201cdrinking all day\u201d; he became violent, tore up a bed sheet, and announced, \u201cI am getting blind.\u201d His wife and brothers-in-law took defendant to the hospital, where he was examined and stayed for one night. On the trial of the issue of insanity a psychiatrist testified that he had seen the city hospital report and that it stated that the doctor who had examined defendant at the hospital \u201cmade a diagnosis of some nervous condition\u2014I have forgotten what it was\u2014not a mental condition\u2014and alcoholism and blindness due to ... a combination of those things.\u201d Defendant has not attempted to show the nature of the \u201cnervous condition\u201d and he does not try to explain, and it is not apparent, in what way the above incident would have any bearing on the question whether, six months later, he had the state of mind which would make the killing of his mother-in-law murder of the first or homicide of a lower degree. Certainly the incident does not appear to have any material bearing on the issue as to whether at the time of the homicides he was in a state of unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On the trial of the general issue defendant was not allowed to testify as to his first marriage in Canada in 1936, and the fact that he had never struck his first wife, and the circumstances which led to his separation from his first wife in or before 1940. On the trial of the issue of insanity, defendant testified at length that his first wife had an affair with a worker employed on defendant\u2019s faim, became pregnant by this worker, and attempted to poison defendant by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>giving him tea and soup containing arsenic. Defendant does not explain how, if these incidents actually occurred, they would affect defendant\u2019s formation of a deliberate intent to kill Mrs. Maniscalco several years later, in different surroundings, among persons whom defendant had not known at the time of his first marriage. Defendant made no attempt to show that the incidents did not occur or that his belief that they happened was the product of a diseased mind or that they in any way tended to prove that he was subject to amnesia. Thus the testimony as to defendant\u2019s first marriage, it developed when all the evidence was in, was relevant to no issue at either stage of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Defendant was asked, \u201cbefore April 21, 1948, did you ever strike or injure any human being?\u201d and answered, \u201cNever did.\u201d The prosecuting attorney objected and the trial court ruled, \u201cI will sustain his objection. I think it is irrelevant.\u201d There was no motion to strike defendant\u2019s answer. Defendant complains of the sustaining of the objection. However, his answer to the question is in the record and, furthermore, it is not suggested how the extremely general fact that he had or had not previously injured any human being would materially affect the proof as to his state of mind on April 21, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The above are the only instances of exclusion of testimony which defendant specifies as erroneous because of the asserted relevance of the testimony to his possession of the mental state necessary (on that theory of the case) to constitute the killing murder of the first degree. The evidence adduced at the trial of the issue of insanity and at a subsequent hearing as to whether he was a sexual psychopath has been examined in order to determine whether there was other evidence, relevant on the trial of the general issue, as to which defendant\u2019s counsel neglected to make a specific offer of proof at the first stage of the trial because he was led to believe, by the tenor of the trial court\u2019s rulings, that it would admit <em>no </em>evidence as to mental condition during that stage of the trial. Such examination of the record has disclosed no evidence which should have been before the jury at the time they were considering whether defendant possessed the conscious and deliberate intent which is an element of first degree murder. There is no expert testimony tending to show that defendant was unconscious or suffering from amnesia at the time he' committed the killings; all such testimony is to the contrary. On the trial of the issue of insanity two of the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>experts suggested that the manner of the killings was an indication that they may have been sadistic, but no expert testified that he had formed an opinion that defendant was a sadist. On the hearing as to sexual psychopathy the expert evidence in this connection was that the killings were not sadistic, not to arouse sexual desire, but were to eliminate an obstacle to fulfillment of a desire which previously existed. There is no evidence which indicates that killing may not be at the same time sadistic and, in the legal sense, deliberate and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>Asserted Errors in Instructions on the Trial of the General Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Defendant complains of the giving of the following erroneous instruction: \u201cIn homicide cases where the killing is proved, it rests on the defendant to show justification, excuse or circumstances of mitigation, subject to the qualification that the benefit of the doubt is to be given to the defendant.\u201d The instruction resembles section 1105 of the Penal Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The impropriety of reading that section to the jury is fully discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cornett </em>(1948), 33 Cal.2d 33, 43-44 [198 P.2d 877], and cases there cited. Under an instruction in the language of that section the jury \u201cmay believe that mitigating circumstances do not exist unless the defendant proves the existence of such circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence or by some other degree of proof. Moreover, the instruction is erroneous in that the jury was not fully advised that such an instruction has no application in determining the degree of murder, and that it is applicable only in determining whether the homicide constitutes murder or manslaughter, or is justifiable or excusable ... It may have the effect of foreclosing any consideration by the jury that mitigating circumstances, although not sufficient in law to justify or excuse the homicide, may be enough to reduce the crime to second degree murder by counteracting the element of premeditation or deliberation\u201d (p. 44 of 33 Cal.2d). Even though the instruction here given is qualified by the direction that \u201cthe benefit of the doubt is to be given to the defendant,\u201d this qualification does not correct the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>struction, for it is error to, intimate to the jury that <em>any </em>burden of persuasion rests upon the defendant on the trial of the general issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">However, it does not appear that any miscarriage of justice resulted from the giving of the erroneous instruction, even though its error relates to the only important ultimate question presented by the evidence; i. e., whether the killing was murder of the first or of the second degree. As to this question the jury were correctly and specifically told, \u201cif you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime of murder, but still if you entertain a reasonable doubt whether the killing was wilful, deliberate and premeditated, or done in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate rape, or by lying in wait, then in such a case you cannot find the defendant guilty of murder of the first degree,\u201d and \u201cIf you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing is murder, evidence tending to establish provocation may also be considered by you in determining the degree of the murder, and if, after due consideration of such evidence, you should entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether there existed at the time of the homicide in the mind of the defendant the deliberation and premeditation essential to constitute murder of the first degree, or that the killing was done in the perpetration of rape or attempt to perpetrate rape, or while lying in wait, it would then be your duty to find the defendant guilty of murder of the second degree. I instruct you that if you believe from all the evidence in the case beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of homicide, but have a doubt as to the degree of the offense of which the defendant is guilty\u2014whether it is murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, or manslaughter, you will give the defendant the benefit of such doubt and find him guilty only of the lowest offense as to which you may find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2019 \u2019 It does not appear that the jury, in deciding that defendant\u2019s admitted intentional striking of Mrs. Maniscalco with a wrench<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was in course of deliberate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>premeditated murder, chose to disregard these detailed, correct instructions and to follow a misleading interpretation of the vague instruction first above quoted.  As to the instruction under attack, it may be noted that it is erroneous also in that it purports to place some burden of persuasion on defendant when merely the <em>fact, </em>and not the <em>perpetrator, </em>of the killing has been proved. This error could have no prejudicial effect here, for defendant admitted that he committed the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The trial judge did not instruct the jury that the evidence of oral admissions of defendant is to be viewed with caution. (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7 2061, par. 4.) Defendant complains of this omission and urges that the error was made more serious by the giving of an instruction that circumstantial evidence includes, among other things, admissions and that \u201cThere is nothing in the nature of circumstantial evidence which renders it any less reliable than any other class of evidence.\u201d There were in evidence admissions of defendant assertedly made to a police officer and a deputy district attorney. Defendant did not deny making these admissions, but testified that he did not recall that, in the course of them, he described the manner in which he cut his mother-in-law and admitted the killing of the baby. He testified, further, that he did not in fact recall the cutting of the woman or the killing of the baby. However, from the entire record it does not appear reasonable to believe that, if the cautionary instruction had been given and the instruction concerning circumstantial evidence had not erroneously classified admissions as among the sorts of evidence which are not \u201cless reliable than any other class of evidence,\u201d the jury would have disregarded the testimony relating to the admissions of defendant assertedly made immediately after the killings, accepted his testimony at the trial that he had no memory of details which he had previously described, and thus come to the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant had acted with deliberation and premeditation or in the course of carrying out an intent to commit rape. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Koenig </em>(1946), 29 Cal.2d 87, 91 [173 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">On the trial of the issue of insanity (a part of the \u201centire cause\u201d which it is our duty to examine [Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4%]) two court appointed alienists testified that defendant told them that he had hit the woman and the baby with the wrench and slashed and cut both bodies; the third alienist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>testified that defendant said \u201che didn\u2019t quite remember killing the baby\u201d; defendant stated, further, that he did strike the woman and the baby and remembered taking the knife from Bobbie and returning it to her to be cleaned, but not what he did with the knife between those two occurrences. It thus appears that the extent to which defendant claimed to remember the details of the killings varied somewhat on different occasions. This supports the conclusion that no miscarriage of justice has resulted even if the jury, on the trial of the general issue, gave full credence to the testimony relating defendant\u2019s asserted admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The record wholly fails to show that any instructions whatsoever, other than a single one on the insanity phase of the trial, were or were not requested by either the plaintiff or the defendant. Instead, the record shows a stipulation that an \u201coral charge\u201d be given by the judge and transcribed by the court reporter. Under such circumstances, the appellant fails to show and we have no means of ascertaining whether the statement or the omission of any specific proposition of law was requested by a particular party or was given or omitted on the court\u2019s own motion.-  If a party is to make any point, whether of commission or omission, in relation to the giving of instructions, all the instructions requested should be filed and included in the record and, as stated in <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Jonas </em>(1948), 31 Cal.2d 586, 596 [191 P.2d 432], \u201cBach instruction should be identified by a number and should indicate by whom it was requested or that it was given by the court of its own motion; on each requested instruction the trial judge should endorse the fact as to whether it was given or refused or given as modified, with the modification, if any, clearly indicated.\u201d The burden is on the appellant to affirmatively show error and prejudice therefrom; he has not, on this record, sustained such burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>Contention that the Jury\u2019s Determination as to Penalty was Influenced by Conjecture and Public Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">After the jury had deliberated for three hours on the issues raised by the plea of not guilty, it presented, in open court, the following written question to the trial judge: \u2018 \u2018 Does the imposition of \u2018imprisonment in the State prison for the term of his natural life\u2019 allow of later pardon or parole and possible release?\u201d The trial judge stated, \u201cthat is something that is a matter for the Court. It is not, in the processes of law, a matter for your consideration . . . and we will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>answer it.\u201d This reply was in part correct; the possibility of pardon or parole was not for the jury\u2019s consideration. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcalde </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 177, 189 [148 P.2d 627].) It does not appear that defendant could have been prejudiced by the fact that the trial judge, in a strictly technical sense, erroneously stated that the questions were \u201cfor the Court,\u201d whereas the question of pardon is (at least ultimately) for the Governor (Cal. Const., art. VII, \u00a71; Pen. Code, \u00a7 4800) and the question of parole is for the Adult Authority, the power of which is defined by the Legislature (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3040, 3046).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Defendant complains that the mere asking of the question showed that the jury, contrary to an instruction which had been given, was being influenced in its deliberations by \u201cconjectures, . . . public opinion or public feeling\u201d that if they recommended a life sentence defendant might some day be released and that such release would be undesirable. He urges that, at the least, the trial judge, when the question was asked, should have reread the instruction forbidding the jury\u2019s acting under such influences. But we must presume that the jury followed the instruction which forbade its being influenced by conjecture or public feeling, and accepted the judge\u2019s statement that it was not to consider the possibility of pardon or parole. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferlin </em>(1928), 203 Cal. 587, 600 [265 P. 230]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1932), 120 Cal.App. 5, 8 [7 P.2d 202].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>The Refusal, on the Trial of the Issue of Insanity, to Permit Defendant\u2019s Wife to Testify to her Opinion of his Sanity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The trial judge sustained People\u2019s objections to the questions, asked of defendant\u2019s wife, \u201cwhat is your opinion, or, have you formed any opinion as to whether he was sane or insane at the time this act was committed?\u201d and \u201cDo you think he is sane, yourself?\u201d These rulings were erroneous. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1870, par. 10: Evidence may be given of \u201cthe opinion of an intimate acquaintance respecting the mental sanity of a person, the reason for the opinion being given.\u201d) The trial judge, on further reflection, came to this conclusion and, at the opening of court the next day, asked defendant\u2019s counsel to recall Mrs. Letourneau \u201cso that I may place the question to her.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cI am through, your Honor, and I don\u2019t.care about asking her to come back ... You can call her and question her if you want to ... It was asked at the end of her testimony at the time when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>it had importance and bearing. To call her back and re-ask her that question would seem to me to defeat the purposes of her being asked the question in the first place. So, I can\u2019t see how I can rebuild my case back to the point when the question was asked, without prejudicing my client now. I will have to stand on the record and let it go at that.\u201d  Having thus rejected the offer of the trial judge to cure the error, defendant cannot now complain of it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glover </em>(1903), 141 Cal. 233, 246 [74 P. 745]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(1912), 163 Cal. 368, 377 [125 P. 907]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klopfer </em>(1923), 61 Cal.App. 291, 295 [214 P. 878]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morley </em>(1928), 89 Cal.App. 451, 459 [265 P. 276].)  Furthermore, under the circumstances, it is not shown that the error was prejudicial, for Mrs. Letourneau had testified in detail to the conduct of defendant upon which her opinion would have been based, and it does not appear that the jury would have reached a contrary result had it known that one lay witness, the wife of defendant, was of an opinion contrary to that of the three court-appointed experts who testified that in their opinion, based upon the facts to which Mrs. Letourneau testified and other facts, defendant was sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\n<em>The Order of the Trial of the Issue of Insanity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asf\">Defendant complains that the trial court did not comply with section 1369 of the Penal Code when, despite defendant\u2019s request, it permitted the People to make an opening statement to the jury before defendant\u2019s counsel made his opening statement and permitted the People to open and close the argument to the jury. However, that section is in a chapter entitled, \u201cInquiry into the Insanity of the Defendant before Trial or after Conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No section of the Penal Code specifically directs the order of the trial upon a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and it has been repeatedly held that defendant has no right to open and close the argument to the jury <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1928), 204 Cal. 470, 482 [268 P. 909, 270 P. 1117]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goold </em>(1932), 215 Cal. 763, 766 [12 P.2d 958]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimball </em>(1936), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>5 Cal.2d 608, 611 [55 P.2d 483]; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1948), 33 Cal.2d 52, 65-66 [198 P. 865]) although the trial court may permit him to do so (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1930), 108 Cal.App. 609, 613 [291 P. 887]).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Gibson, G.

To establish the defendant\u2019s state of mind, either the People or the defendant may offer any evidence competent under the general rules of admissibility, which is relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Letourneau\u2019s counsel asked the autopsy surgeon, who had described the wounds causing Mrs. Maniseallo\u2019s death, \u201cWould you say, Doctor, that whoever inflicted the wounds on this woman certainly must have been operating at the time under an abnormal and just under an abnormal frame of mind, let us say?\u201d The district attorney\u2019s objection that \u201cThe Doctor cannot possibly answer it categorically\u201d was sustained. The majority opinion concludes that the ruling was proper because there was no showing of related materiality, and the inquiry called for an opinion upon a subject which is not a proper subject of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Had the doctor stated that the inflicter of the wounds was then acting under an abnormal frame of mind, his opinion would have been logically relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the homicide. That there may be a logical correlation between the circumstances of the homicide and the killer\u2019s mentation is recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kafoury, </em>16 Cal.App. 718, 720 [117 P. 938].</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Moreover, there is authority for holding that the examination of the autopsy surgeon concerned a subject upon which expert testimony is admissible. In <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>142 Kan. 417 [49 P.2d 1035, 103 A.L.R 893], the issue before the court was the soundness of mind of one who has executed a will. The trial court admitted testimony of an examiner of questioned documents, based entirely upon the appearance of the signa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ture, to the effect that the testator was in an abnormal mental condition at the time he signed the document. The Supreme Court of Kansas recognized that there was fair basis for non-expert inference of testator\u2019s mental faculties from the manner in which the signature was written. Against a contention that the subject ivas not a proper one for expert testimony, the court stated: \u201c . . . because the fact that the question has not heretofore been specifically decided is not sufficient to warrant refusal to admit the testimony. If it were, growth of the common law would be arrested, and it would be frozen where it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cAt the 1935 commencement, the president of Cornell University, addressing the graduates of the medical school, said there ivas a tendency on the part of the medical profession and on the part of the legal profession to act on the premise, \u2018Whatever was, is right.' A decision by this court that the testimony should have been excluded because there is no established rule of evidence authorizing its admission, would demonstrate soundness of the criticism. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The autopsy surgeon should have been permitted to state whether or not she had an opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s mental state derived from her study of the nature and circumstances of the homicide and the means used to accomplish it. Very often an expert in the medical field has formed no opinion as to the particular cause of injury or mental condition, although other members of her profession might have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">However, the witness was not asked these preliminary questions. The inquiry directed to her assumed both that such an opinion could be formed by an expert from the data at hand, and that the witness had formed such opinion. Under these circumstances the ruling sustaining the objection was correct only upon the ground that no proper foundation for the question had been laid. There was no attempt by counsel to follow up with questions as to whether such opinion could be formed and Avhether the autopsy surgeon had any opinion on the subject. It may not be assumed that the court would have restricted his examination for that purpose. In previous inquiry as to the type of instruments which caused Mrs. Maniseallo\u2019s death, counsel had properly asked the witness if she had an opinion as to the instruments used before asking for that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that evidence of the oral admissions of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>defendant are to be viewed with caution. This error was allegedly rendered more serious by the instruction given on circumstantial evidence. In \u25a0 determining that no substantial prejudice resulted, the majority opinion relies upon testimony of two court appointed alienists which was received \u201c [0]n the trial of the issue of insanity (a part of the entire cause\u2019 which it is our duty to examine [Cal. Const, art VI, \u00a7 4%]) ... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I agree that no substantial prejudice resulted from the omission of the instruction, but prejudice could not have been cured or lessened by evidence offered upon the trial of the issue of insanity. At that time the jury had returned its verdict finding Letourneau guilty. The determination of guilt had been made upon the evidence received in the trial of the general issue and the instructions of the court applicable to that evidence. It was then too late for the jurors to reconsider the question of Letourneau\u2019s guilt or innocence in the light of the evidence presented on the issue of insanity had they desired to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For these reasons I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Such conflict as exists will hereinafter appear from the summary of defendant\u2019s testimony. The basic facts -of the charged homicide are not in dispute. In his opening statement to the jury counsel for the defendant frankly recognized the circumstances with which he was confronted. He said: \u201cThis is going to be the kind of a ease where there is not going to be a dispute whether he did or did not kill these people . . . There is no disagreement here about the facts. This man did the killing. He killed both people. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Pen.

The same paradox is presented as that which existed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>33 Cal.2d 330 [202 P.2d 53], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielly, </em>33 Cal.2d 362 [202 P.2d 18], where, in my dissents, I pointed out the injustice which is bound to flow therefrom. This case presents another illustration of the hopeless position occupied by counsel and the trial court in attempting to present evidence on the subject, and the plain intent of this court to find some reason for not applying the rule it has declared to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">In the <em>Wells </em>case, <em>supra, </em>it was held that testimony of a physician who had examined defendant was material and pertinent to the issue, but its exclusion was not prejudicial. In the <em>Danielly </em>case other grounds for refusal to apply the rule were borne and given vitality in the fertile mind bent on withholding the benefit of the rule from the defendant. There a physician was offered as a witness to show that defendant did not possess the mental 'faculties for forming an intent or premeditation, but the majority found it irrelevant, and that the offer of proof was insufficient. Thus the <em>Wells </em>case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>deserted in its holding of materiality. In the case at bar, the court again uses irrelevancy and failure to make an offer of proof, adding a \u201ckicker\u201d that no foundation was laid. Defendant put a question to the autopsy surgeon, a duly qualified physician, as to whether the manner in which the bodies were mutilated in the course of the killings would show an abnormal mind. On the score of lack of foundation, whatever may be meant by that, there are several answers. If the \u2018 \u2018 foundation' \u2019 argument refers to qualification, the parties stipulated to the doctor\u2019s qualifications. <em>No objection was made on the ground of insufficient foundation. </em>If it is meant that there was no showing that the manner of killing would have a bearing upon the mental state of the defendant, the answers are even more numerous. In addition to those above mentioned, it should be noted that neither the trial court nor this court knows whether a physician may given an opinion on mental condition from the manner in which the killing was accomplished. The majority opinion makes the situation even worse when it says: \u201c ... it will not be presumed that from mere examination of the wounds, the autopsy doctor could do more than speculate as to what the state of the mind of the killer . . . might have been; . . . \u201d It will not presume a doctor could so testify, but by its very holding <em>it presumes conclusively </em>that <em>he could not so testify. </em>In other words, it assumes to know what it holds a doctor cannot know, and precludes the ascertaining of what a doctor may or may not know in his field. Lying at the base of the holding must be the thought that the offer of proof was not sufficient, but the court clearly indicated its intent that no evidence of that class\u2014mental state, would be allowed and therefore an offer of proof is unnecessary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>21 Cal.2d 71 [130 P.2d 123]; <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>23 Cal.2d 94 [142 P.2d 741]; <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Calaway, </em>24 Cal.2d 81 [147 P.2d 604]; <em>Eeimann </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, 30 </em>Cal.2d 746 [185 P.2d 597].) I say that must be the real basis, for the majority states: \u201cThere is no showing that the doctor had, or legitimately could form an opinion which could aid the jury in determining the state of mind of the killer who inflicted the wounds. \u2019 \u2019 That is to say, it demands that defendant show that the doctor\u2019s answer would be favorable to him. We are not told <em>how </em>he is expected to show that or that a doctor could give an opinion on mental state from the circumstances of the killing. By sustaining the objection to the question put to the doctor, he is foreclosed from showing those very things that the majority criticizes him for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>establish. Prom all that appears, the doctor may have had an opinion on defendant\u2019s mental state and been able to justify it by his learning and knowledge that there is a rational connection between a person\u2019s mental condition and the manner in which he commits a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">I also agree with Justice Edmonds that prejudicial error at the trial on the not guilty plea is not cured by evidence offered upon the trial of the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In my opinion, the errors committed during the trial were prejudicial and justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Traynor, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied December 27, 1949.
