By such action plaintiffs sought to have declared null and void because allegedly violative of various sections of the city charter certain ordinance provisions and one resolution passed by the council, having to do in general with the granting of \u201cconditional use permits\u201d under the \u201cComprehensive Zoning Plan\u201d of the city and in particular with the granting of such a permit to the company. For the reasons hereinafter stated, we have concluded that the judgment should be modified in form as hereinafter specified and, as so modified, affirmed.  Plaintiffs also attempt to appeal from the court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the action; such order, having directed that judgment of dismissal be prepared, is not appealable and the attempted appeal therefrom will be dismissed. (See <em>McColgan </em>v. <em>Jones, Hubbard &amp; Donnell, Inc. </em>(1938), 11 Cal.2d 243 [78 P.2d 1010]; 2 Cal.Jur. 156-159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Plaintiffs in their complaint (first amended) allege as follows : They are qualified voters and electors of the city. Under ordinance No. 90500 passed by the council in March, 1946, and known as the Comprehensive Zoning Plan of the city, certain land owned by plaintiffs together with some 486 acres of land owned by the company was designated as falling within the same \u201ccontinuous and unbroken\u201d R1 One Family Zone. Plaintiffs sue for themselves and \u201cfor the benefit of all the other owners of real property within the said R1 One Family Zone.\u201d No cemeteries \u201care to be located within areas so zoned as R1 One Family Zones except that a procedure for the obtaining of a permit for the \u2018Conditional Use\u2019 for cemetery purposes of real property so zoned as an R1 One Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Zone\u201d is established by subsection C of section 12.24 of ordinance 90500. In February, 1947, the council \u201cpurportedly\u201d passed ordinance No. 91503, section 20 of which amends subsection C of section 12.24<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of ordinance 90500. Acting under the provisions of subsection C as so amended, the company thereafter filed with the City Planning Commission an application for a \u201cConditional Use\u201d for cemetery purposes of its property mentioned above, the commission denied the application, the company appealed to the council, and the council, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>in. March, 1948, \u201cpurported\u201d to pass a <em>resolution </em>reversing the action of the commission and granting the application of the company. Pursuant \u201cto said resolution . . . the . . . Company has commenced the construction of a cemetery\u201d upon its property, the creation and maintenance of which will diminish the value, use, and enjoyment of real property owned by the other property owners, including plaintiffs, within the same El One Family Zone. Section 12.241 of ordinance 90500, section 20 of ordinance 91503 (amending \u00a7 12.24, subsec. C), and the resolution granting the company\u2019s application are pleaded in full in the complaint, and are averred to be in conflict with certain provisions of the city charter. Plaintiffs allege, finally, that an actual controversy exists between themselves and defendants relating to their legal rights and duties arising out of the resolution and pray that the court declare null and void the resolution and the ordinance provisions pursuant to which it was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Defendants filed motions to dismiss the action on the grounds that (1) the court had no jurisdiction of the subject of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>action for the reason that the complaint presented no justiciable controversy, and (2) it was not necessary or proper at that time for the court to make a declaration or determination of the rights and duties of the parties under the circumstances alleged. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1061.) The motions were granted, judgment was entered accordingly, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Pebtinent Chabtee Pbovisions</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">At the times material to this litigation, section 97 of the city charter provided that \u201cNo <em>ordinance, order </em>or <em>resolution </em>shall be adopted by the Council authorizing, ordering or involving any of the following enumerated matters, unless and until such <em>ordinance, order </em>or <em>resolution </em>shall have first been submitted to the City Planning Commission for report and recommendation ... (c) The creation of districts or zones for the purpose of regulating the use of lands, ... or the <em>changing, amending </em>or <em>altering </em>of any such zones, districts or regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of the City Planning Commission, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of any such proposed <em>ordinance, order </em>or <em>resolution, </em>to make and file its report and recommendation thereon with the Council, and should said Planning Commission recommend against the approval of the matter involved, the Council may adopt such <em>ordinance </em>only upon a two thirds vote of the whole of said Council. Should the City Planning Commission recommend approval or fail to make any recommendation within the time mentioned herein, said Council may adopt such <em>ordinance, order </em>or <em>resolution </em>by a majority vote of the whole Council ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Section 98<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the charter created the office of Zoning Administrator and gave him the power, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>to \u201cinvestigate, hear and determine all applications for variances from the rules, regulations, restrictions and requirements of the zoning ordinances and [to] . . . grant such variances . . . when practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships or results inconsistent with the general purposes of the zoning regulations may result\u201d otherwise. The administrator\u2019s determination \u201cshall be final except that appeals therefrom may be taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals,\u201d which by section 99 of the charter was given the power to \u201caffirm, change or modify the . . . determination . . . subject to the same limitations as are placed upon the Zoning Administrator. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">Plaintiffs contend that the charter has thus \u201cprovided for two distinct procedures whereby an owner of real property might obtain relief from onerous zoning restrictions, rules and regulations as they limit him in the use and enjoyment of his property\u201d; that a third procedure, in conflict with the charter, is set forth in subsection C of section 12.24 of ordinance 90500, as amended by section 20 of ordinance 91503; and that such sections, as well as the council\u2019s resolution adopted pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>suant thereto, granting the company a conditional use permit, are null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">It appears, however, that so far as here material the charter contemplates <em>three </em>situations, or means (apparently mutually exclusive since procedure for each is detailed in the charter), under or by which action relative to zoning matters may be taken: (1) The \u201ccreation\u201d of zones or \u201cthe changing, amending or altering of any such zones\u201d (\u00a7 97(c)); (2) the \u201cgranting of variances\u201d (\u00a7 98(c)); (3) \u201cchanges to zoning ordinances\u201d (\u00a7 98(b)). Several problems are thus presented: First, does the granting of \u201cconditional use\u201d permits fall within any of the three situations so designated by the charter ? Second, if so, does the procedure laid down by the ordinances attacked by plaintiff comply with charter provisions ? Third, if either the granting of conditional use permits or the ordinance procedure is not expressly authorized by the charter, is either or are both forbidden by it ? Plaintiffs concede that the charter operates \u201cas a limitation and not a grant of power, and hence should be strictly construed [against the limitation] . The city charter of the city of Los Angeles comes within this rule.\u201d <em>(Thille </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works of City of Los Angeles </em>(1928), 82 Cal.App. 187, 189 [255 P. 294]; see, also, <em>West Coast Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1939), 14 Cal.2d 516, 522 [95 P.2d 138]; <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1940), 15 Cal.2d 542, 549-550 [103 P.2d 168].) Section 2 of the charter itself provides that \u201cThe City of Los Angeles . . . shall have the right and power, subject to the restrictions in this charter contained: . . . (4) to make and enforce all laws and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to the restrictions and limitations provided in this charter ...\u201d The charter further states, in section 21, that \u201cAll <em>legislative power </em>of the city except as herein otherwise provided is vested in the Council and shall be exercised by <em>ordinance, </em>subject to the power of veto or approval by the Mayor as herein set forth. Other action of the Council may be by <em>order </em>or <em>resolution, </em>upon motion.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Plaintiffs have not attacked the procedure followed in the adopting either of ordinance 90500\u2014hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Zoning Plan of the city\u2014under which they claim protection, or of ordinance 91503 (which amends, or \u201cchanges,\u201d subsection C of section 12.24 of the Zoning Plan). Consequently we must assume that each of such ordinances was submitted to the planning commission for consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>prior to adoption by the council (charter, \u00a7\u00a7 97(c), 98 (b)), and is valid insofar as concerns adoption procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">The \"Changing, Amending or Altering \u201d of a Zone <em>(Charter Section 97)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Plaintiffs urge that the granting of a conditional use permit constitutes the \u201cchanging, amending or altering\u201d <em>of a zone </em>within the meaning of subsection (c) of section 97 of the charter, that therefore the procedural provisions of that section must be followed, and that those provisions require that action by the council granting such a permit after an adverse recommendation by the commission must be by' <em>ordinance </em>rather than by the resolution authorized by subsection C, as amended, of section 12.24 of the Zoning Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Defendants argue, first, that the granting of a conditional use permit authorizes a change <em>within, </em>rather than <em>of, </em>a zone; that the \u201cchanging, amending or altering\u201d <em>of </em>a zone means action affecting the entire zone, such, for example, as the changing of its boundaries or of its classification, as from residential to commercial, etc.; that the use deemed essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare\u201d (subsection B of section 12.24 of the Zoning Plan), including cemeteries (as well as airports, schools, libraries, public utilities, etc.), for which a conditional use permit is authorized by the Zoning Plan itself is entirely different in scope, nature, and purpose from the change <em>of </em>a zone contemplated by subsection (c) of section 97 of the charter; that, in consequence, the provisions of section 97 do not control the procedure to be followed when a conditional use permit is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defendants\u2019 viewpoint appears sound and is supported by the recent ease of <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg </em>(1949), 90 Cal.App.2d 348, 363 [203 P.2d 37] (hearing denied), in which the court, in considering the same section 12.24 of the same ordinance (Comprehensive Zoning Plan) here involved, especially \u201cnoted that conditional use permits are confined to uses of public concern, such as airports, cemeteries . . . By the specific terms of the ordinance such uses are permitted in any zoning district subject only to a finding by the planning commission, in the first instance, or the city council on appeal, that the use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. The decision to grant a conditional use permit does not create a new zone. It merely affirms as a fact the existence of the circumstances under which the ordinance by its terms prescribes that such permit shall issue. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>We hold that the council, in granting a concStional use permit after adverse recommendation by the commission, is not bound to follow the procedural provisions of charter section 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">It should be borne in mind throughout our discussion that the granting of either a \u201cuse\u201d permit or a \u201cvariance\u201d permit is administrative or quasi-judicial, rather than legislative, action (see <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1947), 31 Cal.2d 66, 73-74 [187 P.2d 686]; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg </em>(1949), <em>supra, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 348, 362-363; <em>North Side etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Hillside etc. Park </em>(1945), 70 Cal.App.2d 609, 616 [161 P.2d 618]) and may be accomplished by resolution rather than by ordinance without violating charter section 21, quoted herein-above.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The Granting op a \u201cVariance\u201d <em>(Charter Section 98, subsection (c))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Defendants contend that a conditional use is a separate and distinct concept from a variance and, as revealed by the Zoning Plan (\u00a7 12.24, subsec. B), is granted for a public or quasi-public purpose <em>within </em>the terms of the Zoning Plan or ordinance itself rather than to obviate the \u201cpractical difficulties, unnecessary hardships or results inconsistent with the general purposes of the zoning regulations\u201d as applied to individual property owners, which must be shown before a variance may be granted by the Zoning Administrator (charter, \u00a7 98, subsec. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We are satisfied that defendants are correct on this point. Aside from the difference in language between the variance provisions of the charter and the conditional use provisions of the Zoning Plan, which indicates the difference in character of the purposes sought to be accomplished, the case of <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1947), <em>supra, </em>31 Cal.2d 66, 73, recognizes that a \u201cuse permit\u201d and a \u201cvariance\u201d are not the same and at least suggests that the granting of the latter involves a \u201cbroader power\u201d than does the granting of a use permit. Also, <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Gregg </em>(1949), <em>supra, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 348, 363, makes the distinction with respect to the same Los Angeles ordinance which we are considering here. (See, also, <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Tafel </em>(1949), 309 Ky. 753 [218 S.W.2d 977, 981]; <em>Illinois Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1949), 402 Ill. 617 [85 N.E.2d 43, 50].) It therefore appears that the variance provisions of charter section 98 neither encompass nor prohibit the granting of the conditional use here in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Changes to Zoning Ordinances <em>(Charter Section 98, subsection (b))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As already noted, plaintiffs do not complain that the procedure followed in adopting ordinance 91503 (which amends subsection C of section 12.24 of the Comprehensive Zoning Plan ordinance) did not conform to charter provisions, and it is clear that a resolution performing the administrative act of granting a conditional use permit, as authorized by amended subsection C of section 12.24, does not constitute the \u2018 \u2018 changing of a zoning ordinance, \u2019 \u2019 and does not violate the provisions of charter section 98, subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Right to Referendum</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Plaintiffs further assert that the charter (\u00a7\u00a7 281, 282) authorizes a referendum only on ordinances, and complain that the action of the council in granting the conditional use permit to defendants by resolution rather than by ordinance deprives plaintiffs of their right to vote, which is precious and to be zealously guarded. It is our view, however, that plaintiffs\u2019 claim to vote upon the matter, whether by initiative (charter, \u00a7\u00a7 272-276) or by referendum, should properly be directed at the Zoning Plan itself (ordinance 90500), or at ordinance 91503, which amended subsection C of section 12.24 of the Zoning Plan, rather than at administrative action taken by the council by the resolution authorized by such amendment. Plaintiffs apparently do not contend that the granting of a use permit by the commission itself, or pursuant to a proposed council resolution which the commission has approved, would infringe upon their suffrage rights, but base their complaint entirely upon the situation where, as here, the council acts against the recommendation of the commission.' Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged no attempt to secure a referendum election on the resolution granting the use permit here involved. Plaintiffs\u2019 position on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">We hold that the granting of the conditional use permit to defendant did not violate and was not prohibited by the charter.  However, as was held in <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Hibernia S. &amp; L. Soc. </em>(1944), 23 Cal.2d 719, 728-731 [146 P.2d 673, 151 A.L.R. 1062] (see, also, <em>Columbia Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>DeToth </em>(1945), 26 Cal.2d 753, 760 [161 P.2d 217, 162 A.L.R. 747]), rather than a judgment of dismissal the trial court should have entered its judgment decreeing expressly (as is implied by the judgment of dismissal) that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the declarations in their favor, which they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is modified by: (A) Striking therefrom the words reading \u201cthe plaintiffs take nothing by this action and that the same is hereby dismissed,\u201d and inserting in lieu thereof the words: \u201cthe resolution adopted in March, 1948, by the Council of the City of Los Angeles, granting the application of the defendant Forest Lawn Company, a corporation, for a conditional use permit for cemetery purposes, and applying to that certain land owned by the defendant corporation and more particularly described in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, is not null or void, and does not violate and is not prohibited by the charter of the City of Los Angeles; and that the conditional use permit issued pursuant to such resolution is valid as against all contentions of plaintiffs at issue in this suit\u201d; and (B) Striking from the final paragraph of such judgment of the trial court the words \u201cof dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As so modified the judgment of the trial court is affirmed, respondents to recover their costs. The attempted appeal from the court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is itself dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">G-ibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Edmonds, J., Carter, J., Tray-nor, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The opinion and judgment were modified to read as above and appellants\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied February 8,1950.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Section 12.24, after the amendment of subsection O, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\u201cSec. 12.24\u2014Conditional Uses Permitted By Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u201cA.
