The testator died on May 14, 1945. In the course of administration the property at Clear Lake was sold, and the decree of distribution awarded the proceeds of the sale \u201cto the heirs or devisees of Otto Speckter, deceased, subject to the administration of his estate.\u201d Appellants, executors and legatees under the will, appeal from the decree of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The only question presented on this appeal is whether the devise to \u201cOtto Speckter or his Estate\u201d lapsed by reason of Speckter\u2019s death before the death of the testator. If a devisee who is not kindred of the testator dies during the testator\u2019s lifetime, \u201cthe testamentary disposition to him fails, unless an intention appears to substitute another in his place. \u2019 \u2019 (Prob. Code, \u00a7 92.) The determination whether the devise lapsed therefore depends upon whether the testator intended to substitute another for Speckter in the event he predeceased the testator and, if the testator had such intention, whether he substituted another in Speckter\u2019s place by designating Speckter\u2019s \u201cEstate\u201d as the substitutional beneficiary..</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Relying upon <em>Estate of Sessions, </em>171 Cal. 346 [153 P. 231], appellants contend that the phrase, \u201cor his Estate,\u201d does not indicate an intention by the testator to substitute an alternative taker in the event Speckter predeceased him. In that case, the court held that a bequest to \u201cWilliam E. Jackson [who predeceased the testator], <em>and to Ms heirs and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>assigns forever\u201d </em>lapsed on the ground that the italicized phrase was merely technical language customarily used to pass the fee to property. (See, also, <em>Estate of Barton, </em>196 Cal. 508, 515 [238 P. 681]; <em>Estate of Minor, </em>59 Cal.App. 616 [211 P. 807].) In the present case, however, the words \u201cor his Estate,\u201d are words, not of limitation defining the estate that Otto Speckter was to receive, but of donation to designate the recipient or recipients of the devise. The testator\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d clearly denotes an intention to substitute an alternative taker in the event Speckter predeceased him. (See <em>Estate of Coleman, </em>189 Cal. 612, 619 [209 P. 571]; <em>Estate of Minor, supra, </em>59 Cal.App. 616, 619; Atkinson on Wills, p. 728; 4 Page on Wills [Lifetime Ed.], p. 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The question remains, however, whether the testator\u2019s designation of Speckter\u2019s estate constitutes the substitution of <em>another </em>in the place of Speckter as required by section 92 of the Probate Code. The word \u201canother\u201d as used in that section necessarily implies another devisee or legatee capable of taking the property. Appellants contend that the estate of a named devisee is not another for the purpose of substitution, on the ground that an estate is not a natural person or entity capable by law of taking under a will within the meaning of section 27 of the Probate Code. Respondents contend, however, that the word \u201cEstate\u201d was used by the testator to designate Speckter\u2019s heirs or devisees as the substitutional beneficiaries and that therefore natural \"persons have been substituted in the place of Speckter to prevent the lapse of the devise. This contention is challenged by appellants on the ground that the meaning of the word \u201cEstate\u201d is too indefinite to denote the recipients of the devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The objective in the interpretation of a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as disclosed by the language he has used. <em>(Estate of Young, </em>123 Cal. 337, 345 [55 P. 1011]; <em>Estate of Henderson, </em>161 Cal. 353, 357 [119 P. 496]; <em>Estate of Ottoveggio, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 388, 391 [148 P.2d 878].)  In its technical sense, the term \u201cestate\u201d signifies the \u201cdegree, quantity, nature and extent of interest which a person has in real property.\u201d (Bouvier Law Dictionary. See, also,; Civ. Code, \u00a7761 et seq.; Rest., Property, \u00a79.) Section 106 of the Probate Code provides that \u201ctechnical words in a will are to be taken in their technical sense, unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intention, or unless it satisfactorily appears that the will was drawn solely by the testator, and that he was unacquainted with such tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>nical sense.\u201d The will before us was drawn by the testator, a layman, and it is evident from the context of the devise that he did not use the term \u201cEstate\u201d in its technical sense. (See <em>Estate of Gracey, </em>200 Cal. 482, 491-492 [253 P. 921]; <em>Estate of Peabody, </em>154 Cal. 173, 177 [97 P. 184]; <em>Estate of Coleman, supra, </em>189 Cal. 612, 620; <em>Estate of Thramm, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 756, 762 [183 P.2d 97]; <em>Estate of Olsen, </em>9 Cal.App.2d 374, 379 [50 P.2d 70].) When the technical meaning of the term is substituted for the term itself, there can be no doubt that the testator was not referring to the interest Otto Speekter was to have in the property devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The question therefore arises, what did the testator mean by \u201cEstate\u201d when he used that term in the devise? Appellants rely principally upon <em>Estate of Glass, </em>164 Cal. 765 [130 P. 868], to support their contention that \u201cEstate\u201d cannot be construed to mean Speekter\u2019s heirs or devisees. In that case the will contained the provision, \u201cThe balance to go to father Glass\u2019s estate.\u201d Since Father Glass was alive at the time of the execution of the will, the term \u201cestate\u201d was used with reference to a living person. In recognition of this fact this court stated: \u201cThe language of the testatrix thus being referred to the date of her will and not to the date of her death, by the plain terms of the will Nellie Glass attempted to leave the residue of her estate, not to Thomas Glass, but to Thomas Glass\u2019s estate. Thomas Glass\u2019s estate is not a person or entity which can take under the will. (Civ. Code, secs. 1275, 1313 [now, Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 41-43].) When used with reference to a living man \u2018estate\u2019 may either mean all of his property and property interests, as colloquially, \u2018upon his death he will leave a large estate,\u2019 or it may refer specifically to a particular property in land, as his \u2018estate in Sonoma County.\u2019 But however used as to a living man no property can pass to it by descent, devise or bequest.\u201d (164 Cal. at p. 767.) In the present case, however, since the will provided that the property was to go to \u201cOtto Speekter or his Estate,\u201d the term was used with reference to a deceased person. The testator\u2019s intention to provide for two contingencies is clear: if Otto Speekter survived the testator, the property was to go to Speekter, but if Speekter predeceased the testator the property was to go to Speekter\u2019s estate. Thus the testator\u2019s will itself provides for the very disposition of the property that the court in <em>Estate of Glass </em>said it could not read into the words \u201cto father Glass\u2019s estate\u201d: \u201cThe construction\"contended for by appellants,\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>namely, that the will is to be read as though it declared that the balance should go to Thomas Glass if alive, and if not, then to his estate, by his estate meaning his legal heirs, or his devisees or legatees as the case may be, is too strained to be permissible.\u201d (164 Cal. at p. 767.) By reason of the use of the alternative in the will before us, \u201cTo Otto Speckter <em>or </em>his Estate, \u2019 \u2019 that construction in this case is not strained at all. It is the natural one.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Moreover, such a construction is compelled by the rule that \u201cThe words of a will are to receive an interpretation which will give to every expression some effect, rather than one which will render any of the expressions inoperative . . .\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 102), and by the rule that \u201cWhenever a disputed word or phrase may be reasonably given either of two meanings, that meaning should be given which will prevent intestacy . . . constructions which lead to either total or partial intestacy are not favored.\u201d <em>(Estate of Olsen, supra, </em>9 Cal.App.2d 374, 379; <em>Estate of Lawrence, </em>17 Cal.2d 1, 7 [108 P.2d 893]; <em>Estate of Gracey, supra, </em>200 Cal. 482, 492; <em>Estate of O'Gorman, </em>161 Cal. 654, 658 [120 P. 33]. See, also, Prob. Code, \u00a7 102.) The application of these rules to the devise in question leads to the conclusion that the testator meant that if Speckter predeceased him, the property was to go to the persons entitled to succeed to Speckter\u2019s estate, namely his heirs or devisees. This construction is not only a reasonable and natural one, but is supported by decisions of courts of other jurisdictions. <em>(Leary </em>v. <em>Liberty Trust Co., </em>272 Mass. 1, 5 [171 N.E. 828, 69 A.L.R. 1239]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>288 Ky. 819 [157 S.W.2d 63]; <em>Reid </em>v <em>Neal, </em>182 N.C. 192 [108 S.E. 769]; <em>Bottomley </em>v; <em>Bottomley, </em>134 N.J.Eq. 279, 287 [35A.2d 475]; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>141 Me. 91 [39 A.2d 409]; <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Fairmont Trust Co., </em>70 W.Va. 296 [73 S.E. 930]; <em>In re Billman\u2019s Estate, </em>175 Misc. 334 [24 N.Y.S.2d 43, 47-48]. <em>Contra: Gardner </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>114 Kan. 778 [227 P. 743] [affirmed on rehearing, 116 Kan. 431 (227 P. 743)]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>167 Tenn. 438 [71 S.W.2d 211]; <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>251 Ill. 568 [96 N.E. 513]. See, also, Rest., Property, \u00a7 314, comment a, wherein it is stated: \u201cWhere a person makes a gift in remainder to his own heirs . . . [he] intends the same thing as if he had given the remainder \u2018to my estate. \u2019 \u201d <em>Accord: Bixby </em>v. <em>California Trust Co., </em>33 Cal.2d 495, 498 [202 P.2d 1018].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Neal, supra, </em>182 N.C. 192, the will provided: \u201cI lend to my daughter, Laura Reid, 59% acres, the remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of my land.... to, her during her natural life, and at her death I give it to her bodily heirs, if any, and if none to return to my estate.\u201d It was there contended that the devise over was void on the ground that the term \u201cestate\u201d did not refer to persons, but to the condition or circumstances in which the testator stood with reference to his property, and for the further reason that there was confusing uncertainty as to the persons who might succeed to the property upon failure of bodily heirs. In holding that the phrase \u201cto return to my estate\u201d should be construed to mean that the property was to go to the testator\u2019s heirs or next of kin upon failure of bodily heirs arid that therefore the devise over was valid, the court stated: \u201cIn construing this clause\u2014\u2018If any, and if none, to return to my estate\u2019\u2014the intent of the testator must be sought unless we hold as a matter of law that the clause is void upon its face. If the words referred to are susceptible of any construction which is consistent with the validity of the will in its entirety, we cannot declare them void. ... It cannot be successfully urged that the word \u2018estate\u2019 makes the last limitation void for uncertainty. This word has more than one meanirig, and is susceptible of more than one construction. Anciently confined to land, it has been enlarged so as to embrace property of every description. Enumerated with words which are descriptive of personal or chattel interests, it may exclude real estate altogether. It may denote the quantity of interest, or the thing devised, or the condition or circumstances in which the owner stands in regard to his property. [Citation omitted.] Also, it has been construed as meaning a person. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State </em>[62 Ark. 516], 36 S.W.R. 948. Its legal signification must be ascertained from the context, or an examination of all the provisions of the instrument in which it appears.\u201d (182 N.C. at 198-199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">As in <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Neal, supra, </em>we cannot hold as a matter of law that the devise to Speckter\u2019s \u201cEstate\u201d is void on its face, since the word \u201cestate\u201d is susceptible of more than one construction according to its context. It is clear from the context of the devise that the term \u201cestate\u201d was not used in its technical sense to describe Speckter\u2019s interest in the property devised, and was not used to refer to any particular property Speckter might have or to the aggregate of property he might leave upon his death. It is more reasonable to conclude, in the light of the rules that the provisions of a will must be construed to give them effect and to avoid intes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tacy, that the testator, a layman, in using the term \u201cestate\u201d with reference to a deceased person and to describe the alternative takers of the devise, intended that Speckter\u2019s heirs or devisees should take the devise in the event that Speckter died in the testator\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Gibson, C.

The essence of the holding in that case is that a devise to a named person\u2019s estate is not proper because the word \u201cestate\u201d cannot be construed to mean \u201cheirs or devisees.\u201d In the case at bar the majority determines, and I believe properly so, that the word \u201cestate\u201d should and must be interpreted to mean \u201cheirs or devisees.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b135-9\">SCHAUER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANr\">I concur in the judgment solely on the ground that upon the record the trial court was warranted in finding as a fact that the testator in using the language, \u201cTo Otto Speckter or his Estate, \u2019 \u2019 intended to make an alternative devise\u2014a devise to Mr. Speckter if he survived the testator but in the event of his demise prior to the death of the testator, then to the heirs at law of Speckter.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b135-10\">SHENK, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"APn\">I agree with the majority opinion of the District Court of Appeal of the First Appellate District, Division Two <em>(Estate of Brunet </em>(Cal.App.) [200 P.2d 59]) in holding that \u201can estate is not a person or entity which can take under a will\u201d as contemplated by the provisions of section 92 of the Probate Code and the decisions in this state construing that section.
