By its verdict the jury exonerated defendants Charles W. Renshaw and Charles A. Langlais from liability but found in favor of plaintiff as against defendants Harold Dyer and Jack M. Edmonds in the sum of $6,000. The latter two defendants appeal, arguing these points: (1) excessiveness of the damage award; and (2) prejudicial misconduct of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. In addition defendant Harold Dyer urges one further consideration not applicable to his coappellant: that his motion for nonsuit should have been granted on the ground of lack of \u201cevidence\u201d to \u201cconnect [him] in any way with the case . . . either as owner or employer\u201d in relation to the vehicle driven by defendant Jack M. Edmonds. Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>related with this alleged insufficiency in the proof is a clai3n of error in one of the instructions to the jury. Careful examination of the record compels the conclusion that these respective objections cannot avail defendants as ground for reversal of the judgment against them. (Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4%.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The accident appears to have happened in the following manner: Defendant Edmonds was driving a truck and trailer unit in a southerly direction on the westerly side of the Bay-shore Highway. A Langlais Company pickup truck was proceeding in the same direction behind the Edmonds\u2019 truck. The automobile in which plaintiff was riding, driven by one Dias, was traveling north in the easterly lane. There was some confusion in the passing operations of the two trucks by reason of other traffic on the highway,- resulting in an impact with the Dias automobile. As the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the negligence of Edmonds as the driver of one of the trucks is not challenged, the above recital is adequate for the purpose of discussing the points presented jointly by defendants Harold Dyer and Jack M. Edmonds on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">First to be noted is defendants\u2019 claim that the damage award for $6,000 is excessive and not justified upon the face of the record. In this connection they refer particularly to plaintiff\u2019s admission that his \u201cmedical bills as a result of this accident to the . . . time [of trial had] been $9\u201d and that he had a \u201cone day loss of work\u201d on the per diem scale of $14\u2014a total of $23. However, the evidence shows that plaintiff, by reason of the force of the collision, sustained cartilage and ligament damage to his knee, residual headaches, and a permanent facial scar; that these injuries had caused him protracted pain and suffering up to the time of trial, which was approximately one year and two months after the accident; that the impaired freedom of movement of his knee had decreased his efficiency in the performance of his work as a \u201cweather-stripping mechanic,\u201d a troublesome restriction of problematical duration constituting a future threat to necessary physical activities incident to his regular employment; and that there were still added medical expenses to be met, for the family doctor, in detailing his findings from two examinations of plaintiff within the year, testified that he had yet to submit his bill therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The trial court and the jury had the opportunity to observe plaintiff\u2019s condition and the extent of his injuries. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>matter of the excessiveness of the award was argued before the trial court as one of the grounds for a new trial, and the motion therefor was denied. As a matter determinable in the exercise of a sound discretion, the amount of damages fixed by the jury and approved by the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless the evidence shows that the award is so disproportionate to any reasonable limit of compensation as to indicate that it Was the result of passion, prejudice or corruption on the part of the triers of fact. <em>(Roedder </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>28 Cal.2d 820, 823 [172 P.2d 353]; <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Stellar, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 411, 424 [175 P.2d 607]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Boehm, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 595, 603 [178 P.2d 49]; <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>80 Cal.App.2d 857, 867 [183 P.2d 91].) Such does not appear to be the situation here. The cases cited by defendants furnish no criterion on the present record, for they involve various factual considerations of distinguishing significance. Moreover, the currently deflated value of the dollar must be recognized <em>(Dodds </em>v. <em>Stellar, supra), </em>and while the award to plaintiff may be liberal, it cannot be regarded as without \u201cthe realm of reason\u201d under all the circumstances to be considered. <em>(Freeman </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 40, 52 [174 P.2d 688]; see, also, <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 866, 870 [167 P.2d 488].)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Nor is there any merit to defendants\u2019 second objection charging misconduct on the part of plaintiff\u2019s attorney which operated to their prejudice in relation to the fixing of the amount of the verdict. It appears that in his closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s attorney informed the jury that he did not bring a certain doctor to testify in the case because plain-. tiff could not afford the expense. Other physicians testified sufficiently to establish by a preponderance of the- evidence that the particular injuries to plaintiff had occurred. While undoubtedly the mention of plaintiff\u2019s financial condition was improper and should not have been made <em>(Ensign </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>193 Cal. 311, 322 [223 P. 953]), that consideration alone will not justify a reversal here. (24 CaLJur. \u00a7 29, p. 746.) The reference apparently was a casual one, with no effort at repetition to \u201caggravate the effect\u201d (see <em>Carlston </em>v. <em>Shenson, </em>47 Cal.App.2d 52, 61 [117 P.2d 408]), and the trial court acted promptly to correct the impropriety and remove any effect it might otherwise have had, not only in directing the jury to disregard the objectionable statement but in reprimanding plaintiff\u2019s attorney with an admonition to confine his remarks to the evidence in the case. Under such circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>it may not fairly be said that the reference in question contributed to the amount of the verdict, and that the trial court\u2019s timely action was ineffectual in curing the impropriety. <em>(Tingley </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., </em>151 Cal. 1, 22-24 [89 P. 1097]; <em>Lanigan v. Neely, </em>4 Cal.App. 760, 779-780 [89 P. 441]; <em>Hansbrough </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>26 Cal.App. 261, 264 [146 P. 896].) Moreover, the alleged consequences of the cited reference were fully but unavailingly argued before the trial court as a ground for a new trial. There appears to be no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s conclusion on this point in negation of defendants\u2019 charge of prejudicial misconduct. <em>(Coppock </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>137 Cal.App. 80, 89 [30 P.2d 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">There now remains to be considered the additional ground of error assigned by defendant Harold Dyer\u2014the premise of his liability upon the theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>in relation to the acts of defendant Jack M. Edmonds. This point of challenge requires careful examination of the record pertinent to the issue in question.  The original complaint listed as defendants two \u201cDoes.\u201d It alleged, in part, that \u201cat all times herein mentioned\u201d the \u201cdefendant Jack M. Edmonds was the agent and employee of defendant First Doe and/or Dyer Trucking Company, a corporation, and . . . was acting in the course and scope of his said employment and said agency\u201d; and that \u201cthe vehicle\u201d which the \u201cdefendant Jack M. Edmonds\u201d was then driving and operating was \u201ca White truck and trailer unit . . . then and there owned by First Doe and/or Dyer Trucking Company, a corporation, and ... at the time and place . . . alleged . . . was driven with the consent of the owner.\u201d Several weeks later but before the appealing defendants, Dyer and Edmonds, filed their joint answer, plaintiff amended his complaint \u201cby inserting\u201d the name \u201cHarold Dyer, doing business as Dyer Trucks\u201d in the place of \u201cthe fictitious name First Doe . . . wherever it appear[ed] in [the] complaint.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 474.) Thereafter defendants Harold Dyer and Jack M. Edmonds jointly answered the original complaint, denying, among other things, the allegations of ownership and employment as above quoted. Apparently the amendment to the complaint was not served on defendants Dyer and Edmonds, and first came to their attention in open court during the course of the trial. However, service of such amended pleading, involving merely the \u201csubstitution of the real name of a defendant for a fictitious name\u201d was not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>quired. <em>(Kittle </em>v. <em>Bellegarde, </em>86 Cal. 556, 563 [25 P. 55].)  The amendment related only to \u201cformal or immaterial matters\u201d and did not \u201cchange the cause of action\u201d nor affect the issues as presented by the original complaint, so that the \u201canswer already in was as appropriate to the complaint as amended as before the amendment. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>203 Cal. 306, 311-312 [265 P. 246]; <em>Steinbauer </em>v. <em>Bondesen, </em>125 Cal.App. 419, 428 [14 P.2d 106].) Accordingly, defendants\u2019 answer, though not addressed to the complaint as amended, stood effective as a denial of the material allegations thereof, and the questions of ownership and employment bearing upon defendant Dyer\u2019s liability in this case remained, as originally framed, in issue as matters for trial between the parties. <em>(Harney </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>60 Cal. 314, 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Defendant Dyer did not testify at the trial. However, defendant Edmonds, called as a witness for plaintiff, testified as follows: \u201cQ. Jack Edmonds, you have heard the testimony of Charles Eenshaw [another defendant], that on November 18th, 1946, you were present at the time of an accident involving a three quarter ton Chevy pickup operated by Charles Eenshaw and another passenger car operated by Bobert Dias [plaintiff\u2019s driver], and is it true you were present at the scene of that accident? A. Yes, sir. Q. You were then and there, at that time and place, immediately previous to and immediately after this accident operating a truck, semi trailer unit? A. Yes, sir. Q. At that time by whom were you employed? A. Dyer Trucks. Q. Dyer Trucks of Corcoran, California? A. Yes, sir. Q. For how long a time had you been in their employ? A. Over five years.\u201d This testimony was given at the trial by Edmonds without objection. It was sufficient to support a finding that Dyer Trucks was the employer of Edmonds, the driver of the truck and trailer unit involved in the accident.  Furthermore, other evidence unquestionably established that Edmonds as driver of such equipment was personally liable, and the judgment against him must be affirmed. However, plaintiff maintains that the uncontradicted testimony also binds defendant Dyer consistent with the amendment of the complaint to include as a defendant \u201cHarold Dyer, doing business as Dyer Trucks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">At the conclusion off plaintiff\u2019s case, counsel for defendant Dyer moved for \u201ca nonsuit on the ground no evidence has been shown here to connect this defendant in any way with the case' . . . nothing to prove that Harold Dyer or the Dyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Trucking Company was either the owner of that truck or the master of the driver of the truck.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon called attention to the fact that the complaint had been amended \u201cto show that the person designated therein by the fictitious name of First Doe was discovered to be Harold Dyer, doing business as Dyer Trucks.\u201d In response to that point, defendant Dyer\u2019s counsel stated that he had not \u201cseen or heard of that amendment ... it was never served on us [the law firm acting as \u2018attorneys for the defendants Harold Dyer and Jack M. Edmonds\u2019].\u201d However, no request was made for time to answer the amendment and, as above indicated, the nature of the amendment was such as not to require the postponement of further trial of the case pending the \u201cjoining of issues.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>203 Cal. 306, 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The motion for a nonsuit was denied. This ruling was proper, for it appears that counsel for defendant Dyer argued such motion solely from the premise that there was only certain \u201chearsay testimony\u201d in the record purporting to establish that \u201cthe truck [Edmonds was driving] was a Dyer Trucking truck.\u201d He accordingly coupled his nonsuit claim with a motion to strike such \u201chearsay testimony,\u201d which motion likewise was denied. Apparently he overlooked entirely the evidence adduced from the driver Edmonds on the point of his employment by \u201cDyer Trucks,\u201d as above quoted, and to which testimony plaintiff\u2019s counsel referred in his argument in opposition to the nonsuit. Defendants then proceeded with the presentation of their evidence, which, however, did not include any attempt on the part of defendant Dyer, by talcing the witness stand or through other proof, to counteract the testimony of the driver Edmonds on the employment issue. Nor was there a motion for a directed verdict made on behalf of defendant Dyer because of any deficiency in the proof against him as an individual on the issue of liability for the happening of the accident. (24 Cal.Jur., \u00a7 163, p. 913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendant Dyer argues that \u201cmere statements that a truck belonged to and was being operated for Dyer Trucks constitute no evidence against\u201d him as an individual, for there \u201cwas no evidence that Dyer Trucks was either a copartnership or a corporation . . . [that he] was either an officer of the alleged corporation or a partner or sole operator of a concern called Dyer Trucks.\u201d He connects with this alleged lack of proof a claimed, error in one of the instructions given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>at the request of plaintiff and fixing the relationship of the defendants as follows: \u201cWhile there are several defendants in this action, two (2) of them, Charles A. Langlais and Harold Dyer, have been sued herein because, as has been established, they were the principals for whom defendants Charles W. Renshaw and Jack M. Edmonds, respectively, were acting as agents, and within the scope of their authority, at the time of the events out of which the accident occurred. It follows, therefore, that if the agents are liable, the principals are liable.\u201d The impropriety of such instruction, he argues, rests upon the ground that it \u201cassumes the existence of a fact which is not in evidence\u201d\u2014the employment relation between him and Edmonds\u2014and so the \u201cprovince of the jury [was] invaded\u201d on a matter which should have been left for its determination. <em>(Clarke </em>v. <em>Volpa Brothers, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 173, 179 [124 P.2d 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It may be argued that plaintiff\u2019s evidence connecting defendant Dyer as a responsible party in the ease was somewhat ambiguous, resting wholly upon Edmonds\u2019 testimony as to his employment by Dyer Trucks at the time in question (1 Cal.Jur., \u00a7 8, p. 698) and without any attempt to substantiate the precise allegation in the amended complaint that \u201cHarold Dyer\u201d was \u201cdoing business as Dyer Trucks.\u201d Likewise, it is doubtful whether such testimony in and of itself would warrant the quoted instruction declaring the principal-agency status between Dyer and Edmonds had been established as a matter of law, and applying the principle of <em>respondeat superior </em>in holding the former liable for the acts of the latter under the employment relationship assumed to exist between Dyer as an individual and the driver Edmonds. (1 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 117, p. 837.) However, conceding this instruction to have been erroneous, it does not appear to justify a reversal of the judgment against defendant Dyer in the light of other considerations in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As above stated, defendant Dyer did not testify at the trial yet he knew prior to the presentation of evidence by the defense, and upon denial of his motion for a nonsuit, that plaintiff\u2019s complaint had been amended to include him as a party defendant, an individual \u201cdoing business as Dyer Trucks. \u2019 \u2019 With no attempt made by counsel for defendant Dyer to challenge the testimony of the driver Edmonds as to his employment by Dyer Trucks, there was no evidence before the jury indicating .that Dyer as an individual should not be identified with the operation of Dyer Trucks pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>to the allegation in the amended complaint. In line with this evidentiary consideration is the fact that defendants Edmonds and Dyer filed a joint answer\u2014procedure which would seem strange on the face of the record if the former were not to be deemed the latter\u2019s employee\u2014and their defense was handled throughout the case by the same law firm expressly appearing as \u201cattorneys for the defendants Harold Dyer and Jack M. Edmonds.\u201d Moreover, as above noted, no motion for a directed verdict was presented on behalf of defendant Dyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Consistent with these observations is the premise of the following instruction given by the trial court at the request of defendants Dyer and Edmonds: \u201cI charge you that no liability exists against Harold Dyer or Edmonds unless defendant Edmonds was guilty of want of ordinary care. \u2018Ordinary care\u2019 as used in these instructions, is such care as an ordinarily prudent person in the same or similar business or transaction would exercise in the same or similar circumstances.\u201d Such instruction clearly implied that liability existed against Harold Dyer by reason of the accident if it existed against Edmonds\u2014a theory of responsibility which could only be correlated with the employer-employee relationship between the two. Having requested and been granted this instruction impliedly authorizing the jury to find \u201cHarold Dyer\u201d liable for \u201cEdmonds\u2019 \u201d negligence, defendant Dyer is in no position to complain of the instruction consistently declaring the agency relationship to exist between them in the fixing of their responsibility to plaintiff. Like implications prevail with regard to another instruction given by the trial court at the request of defendants Dyer and Edmonds: \u201cIf you find that Mr. Edmonds drove Ms truck in a careful and prudent manner and that he was not careless or negligent, then I instruct you that he was not legally responsible for the accident and that no damages should be awarded against him nor against Harold Dyer. \u2019 \u2019 It does not appear that these defendants made any request for an instruction submitting the issue of <em>respondeat superior </em>to the jury for its determination or in anywise countering an assignment of liability against defendant Dyer premised upon such principle. As has been frequently said, \u201c[prejudice is no longer presumed from error\u201d <em>\"(Anstead </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>203 Cal. 634, 640 [265 P. 487]), and in view of this examination of the record sustaining the propriety of the verdict and judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ment rendered against defendant Dyer, it cannot be said that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
