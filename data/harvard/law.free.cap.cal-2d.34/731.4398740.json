Laws, 1931, Act 8488, p. 4763; 1933 Supp., p. 2329; 1935 Supp., p. 1929), for the taxable years 1935 and 1936, which taxes were based respectively upon income for the years 1934 and 1935, and were paid under protest. The trial court found in defendant\u2019s favor, and from the judgment accordingly entered, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The sole point in controversy is the propriety of the reallocation formula used by defendant in computing plaintiff\u2019s franchise taxes for the two years involved. An examination of the record in the light of applicable legal principles compels the conclusion that the method of apportionment applied by defendant in determining the net income earned by plaintiff\u2019s unitary business for purposes of the state franchise tax may not be successfully challenged, and accordingly the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">During the years 1934 and 1935 plaintiff, a California corporation, was principally engaged in the processing and sale of cocoanut oil and meal. Its manufacturing plant and all related facilities were located in this state. It purchased the bulk of its raw material, copra, in the Philippine Islands, where it maintained offices for that purpose. In the first four months of 1934, a portion of its required copra supply was obtained in the Dutch East Indies through a buying agency in which plaintiff owned a 40 per cent interest, but such purchasing practice was discontinued in May of that year. The Dutch East Indies agency operated independently in making purchases on behalf of plaintiff as one of its stockholders, and plaintiff never had any of its own employees performing services outside of this state in connection therewith. Plaintiff\u2019s products were sold to purchasers throughout the United States,, with the shipping terms \u201cf.o.b. cars at [its] plant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>California.\u201d It maintained no sales office or salesmen in any state other than California. Sales to customers out of the state were negotiated in the main through independent brokers\u2014not employees of plaintiff\u2014although occasionally such customers contacted plaintiff\u2019s local sales office directly by telephone or telegraph. Plaintiff\u2019s executive committee meeting in its local office passed upon all proposals relating to sales transactions. Plaintiff\u2019s only employees located out of the state were those engaged in its purchasing activities in the Philippine Islands. At the same time plaintiff also had certain employees within the state who performed limited buying services for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Plaintiff made and filed its tax returns for the two years mentioned and paid the taxes so reported, using as the basis for the returns, in computing the percentage of business done in California, the average which these five factors within the state\u2014property, payroll, sales, purchases, and manufacturing costs\u2014bore to the total of such factors within and without the state. On this basis plaintiff allocated to California for the respective two income years, 1934 and 1935, 63.6282 per cent and 59.0915 per cent of its total net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Defendant Tax Commissioner rejected the schedules and returns so filed by plaintiff and made a reallocation on the basis of a formula consisting only of these three factors\u2014 property, payroll, and sales. In making such reapportionment, defendant accepted plaintiff\u2019s figures for two factors, property and payroll, but assigned 100 per cent of plaintiff\u2019s gross sales to business done within the state in lieu of the apportionment figures of 38.5029 per cent and 22.2821 per cent of total sales submitted by plaintiff for the respective income years, 1934 and 1935, upon the basis that sales to customers out of the state were not allocable to California. Under such reallocation, plaintiff\u2019s net income from business done within the state was fixed at 89.8786 per cent for the income year 1934 and at 82.18 per cent for the income year 1935, and additional tax assessments were accordingly made by defendant. After taking an appeal to the State Board of Equalization, which sustained defendant in his reallocation formula, plaintiff paid under protest the additional assessments with interest and then brought this action to recover such amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">As above indicated, the protested taxes were levied under authority of the Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act (Stats. 1929, p. 19, as amended; Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 8488), hereinafter referred to as the act. Section 4 provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>that a corporation doing business within the limits of the state, and not expressly exempted from taxation, shall annually pay, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchise in the state, a tax measured by 4 per cent of its net income earned during the preceding fiscal or calendar year, the minimum tax being $25. As in effect during the period here involved, section 10 provided that if the entire business of the corporation is not done within the state, the \u201ctax shall be according to or measured by that portion thereof which is derived from business done within this State . . . determined by an allocation upon the basis of sales, purchases, expenses of manufacturer, pay roll, value and situs of tangible property, or by reference to these or other factors, or by such other method of allocation as is fairly calculated to assign to the State the portion of net income reasonably attributable to the business done within this State and to avoid subjecting the taxpayer to double taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Plaintiff concedes that income from business done within the state may properly include income from interstate and foreign commerce to the extent that such is done within the state, as well as income from purely intrastate business <em>(Matson Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>3 Cal.2d 1 [43 P.2d 805], aff. 297 U.S. 441 [56 S.Ct. 553, 80 L.Ed. 791]; <em>United States Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Creek, </em>247 U.S. 321 [38 S.Ct. 499, 62 L.Ed. 1135]; <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U.S. 113 [41 S.Ct. 45, 65 L.Ed. 165]; <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 48, 61 [156 P.2d 81]), and that during the period here involved it was engaged in a unitary business within and without the state so as to be subject to an allocation method of taxation in the assessment of the franchise tax <em>(Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>17 Cal.2d 664 [111 P.2d 334], aff. 315 U.S. 501 [62 S.Ct. 701, 86 L.Ed. 991]). The only question is whether defendant may be sustained in his reallocation of plaintiff\u2019s net income for franchise tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As the disputed issue is so narrowed, plaintiff and amicus curiae argue that the Legislature designated in the terms of the act <em>five </em>factors for use in the allocation formula as a standard yardstick for determining that portion of a unitary business taxable within the state; that the statutory authority to use an alternative formula contemplates only a situation where the five-factor formula would not truly reflect the income-producing elements of the unitary business, and to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>limited extent the Franchise Tax Commissioner may exercise his discretion in the choice of a formula; and that since the five designated factors were all applicable to plaintiff\u2019s business, it was improper to substitute another formula for the computation of its franchise tax\u2014and in particular, excluding as a separate factor plaintiff\u2019s purchase transactions in the consideration of its business activities, an omission which allegedly threw the entire reallocation formula off balance in reflecting plaintiff\u2019s overall business operations. Plaintiff also objects to defendant\u2019s \u201carbitrary\u201d assignment of 100 per cent of its gross sales to within-the-state business, claiming that such treatment did not take into account its undisputed method of transacting sales without the state. Accordingly, plaintiff and amicus curiae contend that defendant\u2019s reallocation formula, in its application to plaintiff\u2019s unitary business, attributed to California a percentage of income out of proportion to the business done within the state and so violated the due process and equal protection of the law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">On the other hand, defendant urges that the three-factor formula he adopted in reallocating plaintiff\u2019s net income earned in its unitary business is recognized as a reasonable method of apportionment <em>(Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 664, 677, aff. 315 U.S. 501, 509 [62 S.Ct. 701, 86 L.Ed. 991]; <em>Edison California Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>McColgan, </em>30 Cal.2d 472, 479 [183 P.2d 16]) and is most frequently used throughout the states in working out allocation problems (Silverstein, <em>Problems of Apportionment in Taxation of Multistate Business, </em>4 Tax L.Bev. [1949], 207, 258; Altman and Keesling, Allocation of Income in State Taxation [1946], pp. 37, 107-108); that the act authorizes the exercise of discretion in the adoption of an allocation formula deemed appropriate to the tax problem at hand in determining the income derived from business done within the state; and that his reallocation formula based upon <em>three </em>rather than five factors, omitting as an independent item plaintiff\u2019s purchase transactions and reassigning the sales\u2019 values attributable to California activities, fairly apportioned plaintiff\u2019s income within and without the state and so is free from constitutional objection. We have concluded that the trial court properly found in accordance with defendant\u2019s views, consistent with his statutory power and the reasonableness of his procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The fact that defendant\u2019s reallocation formula was based on only three of the five factors specified in section 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of the act did not constitute a violation thereof, for under its express provisions the \u201ccommissioner is authorized to determine the net income derived from business done within this state by an allocation upon those specified factors, \u2018or by reference to these or other factors, or by such other method of allocation as is fairly calculated to assign to the State the portion of net income reasonably attributable to the business done within this State . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pacific Fruit Express Co. </em>v. McColgan, 67 Cal.App.2d 93, 104-105 [153 P.2d 607].) While in the cited ease the particular nature of the taxpayer\u2019s unitary business required special treatment and a three-factor formula consisting of property, payroll, and mileage (the latter item in lieu of sales) was deemed applicable, the wording of the section does not indicate that the commissioner\u2019s power to adopt a formula is restricted to such limited factual situation, in which the general formula mentioned in the section would be inappropriate as a tax base in the measure of the taxpayer\u2019s business activities. On the contrary, the broad language of the section indicates that the factors therein designated are suggestive, but not mandatory or exclusive, and that the commissioner is empowered in his discretion to choose such tax base for his formula allocation as will carry out the act\u2019s purpose to achieve a proper apportionment of business done within and without the state, and at the same time avoid double taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Nor does the Legislature\u2019s grant of such authority to the commissioner consistent with the flexible administration of the act constitute an unlawful delegation of power and render the act unconstitutional in that respect. So pertinent is the precise wording of the governing constitutional provision pursuant to which the act was adopted in 1929 (art. XIII, \u00a716, subd. (5)), stating that \u201cthe legislature shall <em>define </em>\u2018corporations\u2019 . . . shall <em>define </em>\u2018net income\u2019 [but] <em>shall provide for the allocation of income </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Had it been the intent that the Legislature should make the specific allocation, it would seem that the constitutional provision would have read \u201cshall allocate\u201d rather than \u201cshall provide for the allocation of\u201d income. Accordingly, in delegating to the commissioner the power of determining the formula to be used in apportioning the net income earned from business done within and without the state, the Legislature has \u201cprovided for\u201d the allocation of income within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the constitutional provision. <em>(Pacific Fruit Express Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 93, 101-102.) Moreover, it has been held under similar provisions of the Constitution (art. XIII, \u00a7 14, subd. (d), authorizing the imposition of the old corporation franchise tax) that the Legislature need not prescribe the exact method by which the tax is to be fixed, but \u201cmay delegate to its taxing officers the power to adopt a suitable method.\u201d <em>(Utah Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>187 Cal. 649, 652 [203 P. 401].) The essential requirement is the Legislature\u2019s specification of a standard\u2014\u201can intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [administer the act] is directed to conform\u201d <em>(Hampton &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 409 [48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624])\u2014but it may leave to the administrative agency the precise determination necessary to bring the standard into operation. Section 10 complies with this principle in \u201ccalling for a method of allocation which is \u2018fairly calculated\u2019 to assign to California that portion of the net income \u2018reasonably attributable\u2019 to the business done there.\u201d <em>(Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>315 U.S. 501, 506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales here applied by defendant in the apportionment of plaintiff\u2019s unitary business within and without the state has been recognized as sufficiently diversified to \u201creflect \u2018the relative contribution of [out-of-state] activities ... to the production of the total unitary income, \u2019 so as to allocate to California its just proportion of the profits earned . . . from [a] unitary business\u201d <em>(Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>315 U.S. 501, 509), and its \u201cfairness\u201d has been declared \u201csettled\u201d <em>(Edison California Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 472, 479), consistent with practical administrative difficulties that necessarily arise in fixing upon a workable formula for general application <em>(cf., Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 664, 677). Although the principal issue in these cited cases was whether the taxpayer\u2019s business activities within and without the state were such as to render the formula allocation rather than a separate accounting method appropriate for the admeasurement of the franchise tax, nevertheless in resolving such controversial point the fairness and reasonableness of the specific three-factor formula here in question was a necessary consideration in sustaining the propriety of the commissioner\u2019s tax assessment upon the apportioned tax base. <em>(Gwinn </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>75 Cal. 265, 266 [17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>P. 212]; <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>250 F. 943, 947 [163 C.C.A. 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Plaintiff argues the import of an official order addressed to it from defendant\u2019s office in 1933, directing it to use the five-factor formula in the allocation of its income for franchise tax purposes, but such directive would not estop defendant from adopting another formula for the measurement of the tax in conformity with the standard established by the statute. <em>(California Emp. Com. </em>v. <em>Black-Foxe </em>M. <em>Inst., </em>43 Cal.App.2d Supp. 868, 876 [110 P.2d 729].) One of defendant\u2019s auditors testified at the trial that in the years following 1933 it was the \u201cCommissioner\u2019s practice to use the three factor formula generally,\u201d and in line therewith the record shows that for the taxable year immediately preceding the years here involved, that is 1934, plaintiff was advised by defendant that its allocation would be made on the three-factor tax base. Such long-continued practice in the handling of thousands of allocation problems since the cited year 1933 was presumably within the knowledge of the Legislature and yet it made no modification in section 10 of the act which would require a different construction as to defendant\u2019s authority thereunder (Stats. 1935, p. 965; Stats. 1939, p. 2944) \u2014a strong factor indicating that the administrative practice was consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent relative to the commissioner\u2019s power in carrying out the allocation principle of the section. <em>(Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>25 Cal.2d 918, 922 [156 P.2d 1], and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Universal Film Exchange, ante, </em>p. 649 [213 P.2d 697]; see, also, <em>White </em>v. <em>Winchester Country Club, </em>315 U.S. 32, 41 [62 S.Ct. 425, 86 L.Ed. 619].) As section 10 is so construed, it necessarily must be concluded that defendant\u2019s application of the three-factor formula as a preferred general practice is not open to objection as an unauthorized exercise of power so long as it produces the desired proportionate result directed by the statute and at the same time avoids subjecting the taxpayer to double taxation. To this latter point it need only be said here that it is undisputed that plaintiff, on the basis of its business activities during the years involved in this ease, \u201cpaid [no] taxes in any state other than California.\u201d <em>(Cf., Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 48, 52-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">There now remains for consideration the constitutional challenge to defendant\u2019s reallocation of plaintiff\u2019s net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>income upon the claim that such procedure produced an arbitrary assessment in unreasonably assigning to California taxable values not attributable to business done within the state. As above noted, defendant\u2019s reallocation formula embraced only three of the factors mentioned in the statute\u2014property, payroll, and sales\u2014and omitted the other two\u2014purchases and expenses of manufacture. Complaint is made only as to the first-mentioned omission\u2014purchases. In this regard reference is made to the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s secretary that the \u201ccompany\u2019s profits came from three primary sources: purchase of raw material, manufacturing, and sales,\u201d and that the favorable buying of copra in the Philippine Islands did \u201cdefinitely increase the profit; a decrease of cost increases profit.\u201d Accordingly, it is argued that defendant\u2019s reallocation formula, excluding plaintiff\u2019s \u201cforeign purchases\u201d as a separate factor, did not result in a proper apportionment of plaintiff\u2019s unitary business but rather denied plaintiff the benefit of a saving it effected through an income-producing activity without the state\u2014an \u201cexclusion [which] worked to decrease the out-of-state profits and increase the within state profits or income for taxation purposes. \u2019 \u2019 But conceding that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cforeign purchases\u201d contributed to the profits of its overall business, it does not appear that defendant, though excluding such item as an independent factor in the reallocation formula, failed to take it into account in the apportionment of plaintiff\u2019s activities within and without the state. Thus, in the <em>payroll </em>factor allowance was made for compensation paid to plaintiff\u2019s employees who were engaged in purchasing activities in the Philippine Islands, and in the <em>property </em>factor the value of the foreign purchases of copra awaiting shipment or en route to plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing plant in the state was taken into account upon the estimate of plaintiff\u2019s total property holdings within and without the state, in the proportionate evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s integrated business. While it may be that such consideration was not equivalent to separate identification of the purchase item in the tax base, nevertheless it cannot be denied that the three-factor reallocation formula in its application to plaintiff\u2019s business for the determination of its franchise tax represented an honest effort on the part of defendant \u201cto reach only the profits earned within the state\u201d <em>(Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, supra, </em>254 U.S. 113, 121) and reflected with reasonable fairness a proper balance of plaintiff\u2019s respective activities in their relative contribution to plaintiff\u2019s total income <em>(Matson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d 1, 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">No method of allocation can precisely determine the exact amount of income attributable either to any given geographic area or to any given part of a series of business transactions culminating in the realization of a profit, and \u201cany effort\u201d in that regard \u201cmust be more or less arbitrary and fictitious\u201d <em>(Gorham Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>274 F. 975, 978) as a matter of practical tax administration. In short, as was recently said by the Supreme Court of the United States in sustaining the validity of a franchise tax assessment, the \u201cpractical impossibility of a state\u2019s achieving a perfect apportionment of expansive, complex business activities . . . [makes] \u2018rough approximation rather than precision\u2019 . . . sufficient\u201d in the formula allocation of income from a unitary business. <em>(International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>329 U.S. 416, 422 [67 S.Ct. 444, 91 L.Ed. 390].) Within this principle, plaintiff\u2019s \u201cforeign purchases\u201d received reasonable consideration in defendant\u2019s apportionment of plaintiff\u2019s net income on the three-factor tax base.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Nor is there merit in plaintiff\u2019s constitutional objection to defendant\u2019s reallocation formula because of its assignment of 100 per cent of plaintiff\u2019s sales to California, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contention that only its sales to California customers were so classifiable. It appears that plaintiff\u2019s out-of-state sales generally followed this pattern: the sales contract would be prepared by an independent broker, usually in Chicago, where \u201cthe principal brokers trading in [cocoanut oil and meal] held their offices\u201d; copies of the contract would be simultaneously transmitted to plaintiff and to the buyer for signature\u2014with plaintiff as seller executing one copy first, then returning it to the broker, who thereupon \u201cpassed [it] to the buyer for\u201d signing, which would be \u201cdone out of state,\u201d and \u201cso signed,\u201d the \u201ccopy came back to [plaintiff] . . . from the buyer direct or through the broker usually through the [latter channel] \u2019 \u2019; shipment would then be made on the buyer\u2019s request over routes mutually agreeable f.o.b. California; the bill of lading would be drawn to plaintiff\u2019s order endorsed by plaintiff and sent with a sight draft through plaintiff\u2019s bank to the correspondent bank in the city where the buyer was located; the buyer \u201cwould pay the draft, take up the bill of lading and take delivery\u201d of the shipment upon arrival. As above stated, plaintiff did not have any sales office outside of California and had \u201cno . . . employees out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>side of the state who made . . . sales\u201d; and all \u201cproposals for sales\u201d received from out-of-state brokers, or otherwise, were \u2018 \u2018 canvassed\u2019 \u2019 and <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018acted upon\u201d at \u201c daily \u2019 \u2019 meetings held by plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexecutive committee\u201d in its California office. One of defendant\u2019s auditors testified at the trial that it had been \u201cthe practice of the Franchise Tax Commissioner, since at least 1930 . . ., in [the] case of a corporation manufacturing goods in California which has no employees engaged in sales activities outside of California to treat the sales of that corporation as California sales regardless of whether title to the goods was transferred outside of the state of California or within the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Plaintiff maintains that such sales were not properly allocable to California because consummated without the state \u2014the contract was signed by the buyer without the state, and payment and delivery took place without the state. But disregarding the argument that \u201cthe property in the goods\u201d sold by plaintiff \u201cpassed to the buyer\u201d on delivery to the railroad carrier in California and the \u201cbill of lading\u201d was in form in favor of plaintiff \u201conly for the purpose of securing\u201d payment by the buyer in \u201cperformance . . . of his obligations under the contract,\u201d so as to make such sale one in fact consummated in California (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1740, subd. (2); Uniform SalesAct), it must be remembered that the tax problem here in question concerns not a sales tax upon the transaction itself but a franchise tax assessment measured by plaintiff\u2019s net income derived from business done within this state. Accordingly, the focal point for consideration is the place where the activities of the corporation occurred which resulted in the sales. This precise matter was at issue in the case of <em>Irvine Co. v. McColgan, </em>26 Cal.2d 160 [157 P.2d 847, 167 A.L.R. 934], where the plaintiff taxpayer, a foreign corporation authorized to do business within the state, sought an allocation of its net income for franchise tax purposes on the claim that it shipped a portion of its agricultural crop, all of which was grown in this state, \u201cdirectly to purchasers in other states upon orders obtained or sales made therein by independent produce brokers\u201d (p. 168)\u2014a method of marketing which in its opinion constituted the transaction of business without the state. Plaintiff in that case admittedly had no employees outside the state and the proceeds from all its sales were received here. Accordingly this court, in rejecting plaintiff\u2019s theory as to its franchise tax liability for business done within this state, continued at page 168: \u201cThe argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>that plaintiff is entitled to an allocation because the latter sales partook of the nature of transactions in interstate commerce, is successfully countered by the argument that plaintiff\u2019s entire business was done within this state since <em>all of its activities giving rise to income from interstate sales were carried on in California.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) A parallel situation exists here insofar as plaintiff\u2019s out-of-state sales are concerned, with \u201call of <em>its </em>activities giving rise to income\u201d therefrom\u2014its passing upon the sales in executive committee meeting, its signing of the contracts, its shipment of the product, and its receipt of the proceeds\u2014\u201ccarried on in California.\u201d In such circumstances the place where the buyer signed the contract with plaintiff or took delivery of the shipment from the carrier <em>(International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>329 U.S. 416) or where title to the goods passed <em>(Montag Bros. </em>v. <em>State Revenue Com., </em>50 Ga.App. 660 [179 S.E. 563], aff., 182 Ga. 568 [186 S.E. 558]; <em>Trane Co. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Tax Com., </em>235 Wis. 516 [292 N.W. 897]; see <em>Irvine Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>26 Cal.2d 160, 168) is not necessarily determinative of the sales situs for the purpose of computing the sales factor in the application of a \u201cmethod of allocation . . . fairly calculated to assign to the State the portion of net income reasonably attributable to the business done within this State\u201d (\u00a710).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In assailing defendant\u2019s reallocation formula as producing a wholly disproportionate result in the measurement of its net income from business done within and without the state, plaintiff mainly relies on these two cases: <em>People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>230 N.Y. 48 [129 N.E. 202], cert, den., 256 U.S. 702 [41 S.Ct. 624, 65 L.Ed. 1179]; and <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>283 U.S. 123 [51 S.Ct. 385, 75 L.Ed. 879]. Both cases are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In the Portland Cement Company case the question was whether the tax commissioner could constitutionally include within an allocation formula income received by the taxpayer \u2014a foreign corporation\u2014from stocks and bonds having a situs without the state and in nowise connected with the conduct of its unitary business. It was held that he could not since such income was clearly segregable \u201caccording to the situs of its origin\u201d and apart from the operations of the business, so that under constitutional limitations it was subject to tax only in that state where it had its source. <em>(Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 48, 57, 60.) Here, in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>trast, the tax problem concerns only income derived from the conduct of a unitary business, and the necessary use of a formula arises because of the recognized \u201cimpossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within [the state\u2019s] borders.\u201d <em>(Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, supra, </em>254 U.S. 113, 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In the Hans Rees\u2019 case the formula method of allocating income earned by a unitary business was recognized as generally sound in application, but in that particular instance the formula employed, consisting of the single factor of property, failed to give proper weight to the extensive activities of the company without the state so that the result reached was unreasonable. There, by use of the formula, approximately 80 per cent of the entire income of the company, a foreign corporation, was allocated to the taxing state\u2014\u201ca percentage of income out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted by the [company] in that state\u201d (p.. 135) in view of the company\u2019s evidence tending to show that for the years in question its average income having a source in its operations within the state was but 17 per cent, and in no event exceeded 21.7 per cent of its total business. Plaintiff here has made no such demonstration as to the unfairness of the result reached in the application of defendant\u2019s reallocation formula to its unitary business. (See <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>329 U.S. 416, 423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The \u201cstatute on its face carries [the] presumption of constitutionality which attaches to all legislative acts\u201d <em>(Maxwell </em>v. <em>Kent-Coffey Mfg. Co., </em>204 N.C. 365 [168 S.E. 397, 402, 90 A.L.R. 476]) and \u201c [t]o rebut the presumption that the formula produced a fair result, \u2018the burden is on the taxpayer to make oppression manifest by clear, cogent evidence\u2019 <em>(Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1936), 297 U.S. 682, 688 [56 S.Ct. 625, 80 L.Ed. 977]). . . . that more taxes have been exacted than in equity and good conscience should have been paid. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Pacific Fruit Express Co. </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 93, 96.)  As the record has been here analyzed in the light of plaintiff\u2019s contentions, defendant\u2019s reallocation formula based on the three-factor tax base\u2014 property, payroll, and sales\u2014appears in its application to plaintiff\u2019s business, to have been an honest effort to apportion to California that part of plaintiff\u2019s net income fairly attributable to business done within this state, and to have given appropriate consideration to the various elements entering into the overall enterprise so as to be free from constitutional objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>on the ground that it operated to tax extraterritorial values in violation of the due process and equal protection of the law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. It therefore follows that defendant\u2019s additional franchise tax assessments against plaintiff for the two years in question must be sustained. <em>(Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, supra, </em>254 U.S. 113; <em>Bass, Batclif &amp; Gretton, Ltd. </em>v. <em>State Tax Com., </em>266 U.S. 271 [45 S.Ct. 82, 69 L.Ed. 282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Gibson, C.
