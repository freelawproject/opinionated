L. 570, was decided by Mr. Justice Green in Fagely\u2019s Est., 128 Pa. 603.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">It would appear therefore that the commonwealth is entitled to interest at the rate of twelve per cent upon collateral inheritance tax from \u201cthe end of one year from the death of the decedent\u201d except in cases \u201cwhere from claims made upon the estate, litigation or other unavoidable cause of delay, the estate of any decedent or part thereof cannot be settled up at the end of the year from his or her decease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">The account of an executor or administrator cannot under the Acts of March 15, 1832, P. L. 135, and February 24, 1834, P. L. 70, as interpreted by Gallen\u2019s Est., 26 W. N. <em>G- </em>308; Rastaetter\u2019s Est., 15 Pa. Superior Ct. 549, and Clemens\u2019s Est., 21 Pa. Dist. Rep. 175, properly be filed until one year after the grant of letters testamentary or of administration and where the account is filed within a year distribution if made must be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>upon the responsibility of the accountant \u2014 it cannot be decreed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">It follows therefore that every estate subject to the payment of collateral inheritance tax would also be liable for interest at the rate of twelve per cent on the tax and this proposition is so unreasonable that an interpretation by which such a result would be avoided should, if possible, be adopted. The act of -May 6, 1887, provides the way. The decisions hereinbefore quoted and interpreting the acts of assembly therein cited make the filing of an account within a year improper and constitute in the opinion of the auditing judge the \u201cother unavoidable cause of delay\u201d in the payment of collateral inheritance tax at exactly the end of a year. Until an account has been audited it is impossible to determine what balance, if any, there will be. A creditor may present his claim within one day of the end of the year and demand the same recognition as though he had presented it one day after the death of a decedent. A widow or husband may elect to take under or against a will- \u2014 a child may be born. All these are reasons and good reasons why the tax cannot in many cases be paid within the.year. In the opinion of the auditing judge, therefore, the commonwealth is only entitled \u2014 in cases where the account is filed promptly and the tax paid as soon as properly may be \u2014 to interest from the end of the year following the decedent\u2019s death \u2014 at the rate of six per cent if the taxable estate has earned that amount, or, if it has not earned that amount, to interest at the rate earned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">The testator in this estate died on April 23, 1912. Letters testamentary were issued on May 2, 1912. The account might properly have been filed on May 2, 1913, and it was not filed until August 4, 1913. It happens, however, that the last day for filing accounts in the orphans\u2019 court in order that they might appear upon the June list was May 1, 1913. The account therefore if filed on May 2 could not have been audited until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the September list when it was audited. The accountants in this estate have therefore acted with all promptness possible, and the commonwealth in the opinion of the auditing judge is only entitled to interest from.one year after the date of the testator\u2019s death at the rate realized \u2014 represented by counsel to be between four and one-fourth and four and one-half per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">This opinion disposes of the claim presented on behalf of the commonwealth for interest at the rate of twelve per cent from the date of testator\u2019s death. Such a \u201cpenalty\u201d is under the provisions of the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 425, not to be \u201ccarried back to a period antecedent to the time when there should by law have been a settlement of the estate\u201d \u2014 a period in no event antecedent to a date one year subsequent to the date of a decedent\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">On exceptions Lamorelle, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">Both the executors and the commonwealth except, and a determination of the questions raised depends upon the proper construction to be given to certain sections of the Acts of April 10, 1849, P. L. 570, of May 4, 1855, P. L. 425, and of May 6, 1887, P. L. 79.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">While sec. 14 of the act of 1849 provides that if the collateral inheritance tax shall not be paid within one year from the death of the decedent, interest shall then be charged at the rate of twelve per cent per annum on such tax, to be computed from the time of the death, this provision is nullified by sec. 1 of the act of 1855, whereby it is enacted that the twelve per cent penalty \u201cshall not be carried back to a period antecedent to the time when there should by law have been a settlement of the estate.\u201d That the time contemplated for such settlement is at the expiration of one year is apparent, in that, where from any \u201cunavoidable cause of delay,\u201d the estate cannot be settled \u201cat the end of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>year,\u201d six per cent per annum shall be charged on such tax \u201cfrom the end of such time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">The act of May 6, 1887, which is, in a sense, a codification or re-enactment of the substance of previous, acts (Fagley\u2019s Est., 128 Pa. 603), provides (sec. 4) that if the tax is not paid at the end of one year from the death of the decedent, interest is to be charged at the rate of twelve per cent on such tax. It does not in terms, as did the act of 1849, provide that interest shall begin as of the time of death. In fact, by necessary implication, interest is not to be computed from the time of death because, by the same section of the act, this twelve per cent is reduced to six per cent from the end of the year, where the estate cannot be settled at the end of such year. This limits the period at which interest at any rate per centum shall commence to the expiration of the year. And the rate of interest is still further reduced to the amount actually earned, when the same is less than six per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">All previous laws inconsistent with that of 1887 are expressly repealed by sec. 24. Even if, therefore, the provisions of the act of 1849 as to a penalty of twelve per cent, beginning as of the date of decedent\u2019s death, are not in terms repealed by the later act of 1855, they are inconsistent with those of 1887, and come within the repealing clause of that act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201cThe law takes every decedent\u2019s estate into custody, and administers it for the benefit of creditors, legatees, devisees and heirs, and delivers the residue that remains, after discharging all obligations, to the distributees entitled to receive it. . . . And it is not until this work of administration is performed that the right of succession attaches,\u201d says Mr. Chief Justice Woodward, in Strode v. Com., 52 Pa. 181, 189. Some fifteen months must elapse before this work of administration can be consummated, if regard be given to the acts of assembly and the practice and procedure arising out of their proper interpretation, and, though interest may be charge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>able prior to the expiration of that time, the commonwealth, in strict compliance with the terms of the act of 1887, should not in any case receive more than six per centum from the end of the year; in the present case, but four and one-half per centum, the rate earned by the estate.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AddK\">February 20, 1914:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">In view of the exhaustive opinion of the auditing judge, in which we concur, further discussion is unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">All exceptions are dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-7\"><em>J.
