Maxwell, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-4\">It appears that the Presbyterian church of Sayre, Pa., is the owner of a lot of ground on the east side of Elm avenue, in Sayre borough, this county, with a frontage of seventy-five feet. The sidewalk in front of this property was of large flagstone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">In the fall of 1907, the said church entered into a contract with one Jay M. Ashton, a contractor, to repair and rebuild this church building located upon this lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">Early in October of 1907, the said J\u2019. M. Ashton, contractor, upon his own responsibility, and without obtaining any license or consent of the municipal authorities of Sayre borough, took up and removed two of the large flagstones from said walk on the east side of said street, at or near the south line of the said church lot, in order to enable the contractor to handle loads of materials, etc., over said walk, with teams and wagons in and out of said lot, during the course of repairs and construction of said church building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">This work of repairing the church was commenced by the contractor, and the flagstones from said walk removed, early in October, 1907, and the walk continued in that condition, until the accident to the plaintiff, on the evening of December 3, 1907, at between the hours of six and seven o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">The plaintiff claims, that at the time of the accident, there were frozen ruts in this sidewalk, where the flagstones had been removed, leading across the sidewalk made by the wagon wheels, in drawing heavy loads over the same, so that the walk at this point was uneven, full of ruts and rough. Some of the wagon tracks or depressions across the walk, were from two and a quarter to two and a half inches in depth, and towards the outside of the walk, and next to the street, the wagon tracks were from four to five inches in depth, or below the surface of the stone walk, upon either side of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>crossing, and between the wagon tracks, the ground was rough and uneven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-4\">There was building material .piled up on either side of said walk, to a height of three to three and one-half feet above the walk. That the weather, at the time, was cold, ground frozen, and some slight snow had fallen, covering the ground, and that in places, the walk was slippery and icy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">This was a street and sidewalk, much used by the people of Sayre. Mrs. Beloud claimed that she had been west, visiting during the fall, and returned home about November'15, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">That she commenced helping her husband, at his store, on the Monday previous to the accident, and in going to the store traveled this street, passing over along the west side, on the morning of the accident. She noticed the work being done at the church, as she passed on the opposite side of the street, going to her husband\u2019s-place of business, saw the building material piled up there, but did not notice the driveway,\u2019 into the church lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-7\">On the evening in question, she started from her husband\u2019s place of business for her home, between six and seven o\u2019clock p. m. The evening was dark, saw no lights at the point of accident, and there was nothing to warn, or to give her any notice of the change in the walk. That she was walking along in the usual way, and when she reached this point, her foot while passing over this place, slipped, or went into a hole in the walk where these flagtones had previously been removed, and she lost her balance and fell upon the ground, sustaining injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-8\">The negligence of the municipality complained of by the plaintiff was in permitting this sidewalk to be used by the public, generally, from early in October to December 3, 1907, a period of some two months, with these flagstones removed, thereby destroying the uniform and even surface of the sidewalk, and permitting these ruts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and uneven condition of the frozen ground to exist and continue for such a length of time, thereby rendering the sidewalk dangerous and unsafe to the; traveling public, without some warning signals or notice to the public, calling their attention to this condition and change in the sidewalk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-4\">The defense rested its case upon three grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">1. That while the flagstones had been removed by J. M. Ashton, the contractor for the church, that the place had been filled up and kept filled up with dirt or gravel, so as to make the walk reasonably safe, and that there were no ruts or holes in said walk at the time of the accident, and that there were three red lights displayed at or near the north line of the church lot, where a sewer pipe was being laid for the church, some thirty-six feet north from where the flagstones had been removed. These lights were located along the sewer ditch, one light on the street at or near the street railway tracks, another light, halfway between the sidewalk, and the first light, and the third light, at or near the outside of the sidewalk. That in addition to these lights, there was an arc light not far from the intersection of Elmer avenue, with Packer avenue, about 150 feet from the point of the accident, and elevated about twenty to twenty-five feet above the ground. Also an incandescent light at Park place and Elmer avenue, about 100 feet, or so, south from the point of accident, and while these lights were not put up by the contractor, yet they were sufficient, so that persons could well see the sidewalk and its condition, on the evening of the accident, providing they were using due care, under the circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">2. That on this evening in question, the weather was cold and freezing, and that during the day or evening, it had rained, and that sleet had fallen, and the streets and sidewalks of the borough, including the point of accident, were all covered with ice and slippery, and that it was this icy and slippery condition, that was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>proximate cause of the accident to the plaintiff, and for which condition the borough was not responsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">3. That even if the conditions in the sidewalk were as alleged by the plaintiff, and those conditions were the proximate cause of the accident to Mrs. Beloud, then the borough of Sayre would not be responsible therefor, for the reason that the party who changed the sidewalk and created the conditions complained of, was an independent contractor, for whose negligence the borough was not responsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">We submitted to the jury under proper instructions, the questions raised by the pleadings and testimony, with the exception of that part of the defense which interposed the question of the negligence of J. M. Ash-ton, independent contractor, as a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, we reserved this question for future consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">The verdict of the jury, under the charge of the court, implies a finding, that the defect in the sidewalk' had existed for such a length of time as to give the officials of the borough constructive notice of it, and this finding was fully warranted by the evidence, as it existed, from the forepart of October to the date of the accident. In this connection, we instructed the jury that there was no evidence of express notice to the officials of the borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">The verdict also establishes that there was no negligence on the part of Mrs. Beloud that contributed to the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">It was conceded that the place where the accident occurred, was on one of the main public sidewalks of the borough of Sayre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">It is not disputed that J. M. Ashton\u2019s contract with the church was lawful and legal, and that he was an independent contractor, so far as the church was concerned. This we assume, in the disposition of this motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-10\">It is conceded that Ashton and his employees, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>course of their work in rebuilding the church, removed the flagstones from this walk, hauled the loads over the walk that made the ruts, etc. Also piled the building material on either side of the stone walk, and as alleged by the plaintiffs did not take the necessary precaution to protect the place, or to warn the people using the sidewalk, of the change and danger, and this condition existed from early in October to the date of the accident, on December 3, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\">The evidence in the case does not disclose any building permit having been issued by the borough authorities, permitting the removal of the flagstones, and the occupying of any portion of the walk for piling building material upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">An abutting property owner in Pennsylvania is by necessity, allowed to occupy temporarily, a portion of the public street in front of his or her premises for building purposes, for a reasonable time, and to a limited extent, if his or her obstructions do not impede or interfere with travel: Smith v. Simmons, 103 Pa. 32. But a permit or license from the municipality should be obtained for this purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">\u201cWhen a license is granted by the municipality, the rule of responsibility and relation of the borough and builder is to be analogous to that of the independent contractor:\u201d 5 Thompson on Negligence, sec. 805.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">\u201cIn digging the sewer ditch without the written permission of the street commissioner he was a trespasser, and if his work rendered the street unsafe for ordinary travel it was the duty of the borough authorities, having actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition created by him, to take proper measures to protect the public against it. In other words, a municipality cannot tolerate unlawful and dangerous obstructions on its streets and claim exemption from liability for injuries caused by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">\u201cThe cases cited to sustain the borough\u2019s contention that it is not liable to the plaintiff for the injury she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>received in consequence of the work done by Rausch, are not applicable to the facts of this case. They are cases in which the work was done under a contract with or license from the municipality, while in this case the work was done without its permission and in violation of its laws. We see no occasion, and we are not disposed, to go a hair\u2019s breadth beyond them in relaxing the supervision by a municipality of the streets within it:\u201d Boyle v. Hazleton Boro., 171 Pa. 167. (Opinion of Justice McCollum, p. 176.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">Whether the defendant borough has an ordinance which requires a building permit, we are not informed by any evidence in this case, but this we regard as immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">\u201cIt is now stated at the argument of this motion that there is no evidence in South Bethlehem which requires a building permit. A failure on the part of the borough, to regulate and restrict, for protection of the public, the temporary occupancy of its highways for necessary purposes seems to me, will enlarge, not diminish its responsibility; that it cannot then be exempt at any time from proper supervision, and will not be relieved from any kind of negligence by the builder of which it has actual or constructive notice. This rule does not impair his fundamental right of occupation, without being treated as maintaining a nuisance:\u201d Rech v. South Bethlehem Boro., 10 Northampton County, 233.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">\u201cWhen the temporary occupation of the road by a person engaged in building is necessary, due care must be taken to guard the public from the danger; and if this be left undone, the corporation is answerable for an injury occasioned by the obstruction, if sufficient time had elapsed for the corporation by reasonable vigilance to have discovered the obstruction and provided a safeguard:\u201d Born v. Plank Road Co., 12 W. N. C. 283.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">\u201cWhen ignorance of the defect is the result of omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>sion of duty, actual knowledge of this existence is not an essential to the fixing of such liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\">\u201cIf the exercise of proper supervision would have led to discovery by the municipality in time to remove it, or to protect the public against it, there is the same liability for an injury caused by the nuisance as if there had been notice or knowledge of it:\u201d Norristown Boro. v. Moyer, 67 Pa. 355; Erie v. Schwingle, 22 Pa. 384.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">This case is not one in which the borough of Sayre had surrendered its control temporarily of the sidewalk in question, during these repairs, by the issuing of a building permit or license to J. M. Ashton, contractor, or to the Presbyterian church, neither is it a case where the borough had surrendered control of the sidewalk to an independent contractor, to do the work or make repairs on the sidewalk, for the borough or municipality. The jury has found by its verdict, that the conditions complained of by the plaintiff, as to the walk in question, was such that it was dangerous or not reasonably safe for travel, and that the plaintiff was injured thereby, without contributory negligence on her part, and that the borough authorities had constructive notice of its unsafe condition, and neglected to close up the sidewalk, but permitted the public to use the same during the repairs, without maintaining the same in a reasonably safe condition, and for this neglect of the borough, it was undoubtedly liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">\u201cA municipality is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor while engaged in the construction or repair of a street of which he has the exclusive control or charge, but to relieve the municipality from liability in such cases, the accident must be the result of the negligence of the contractor, and, he must have such exclusive control of the street where the accident occurs as to authorize him to prohibit the use of it by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">\u201cWhenever a municipality directs a street to be kept open and thereby invites the public to use it, an obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion is imposed on the municipality to see that it is maintained in a reasonably safe condition for travel:\u201d Norbeck v. Phila., 224 Pa. 30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">In the case at bar, the public were permitted to use the sidewalk in question without any effort or attempt upon the part of the contractor for the Presbyterian church, to guard the same, and the jury has found that this condition existed for a sufficient length of time to bring home to the municipality constructive notice of the situation, and in view of that finding, it seems to us that an obligation was imposed upon the municipality to see that this sidewalk was maintained in a reasonably safe condition for travel, and that for its neglect to perform this duty, it seems to us, the municipality is liable in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">In the case of Charles E. Johnson Co. v. Phila., 236 Pa. 510, Justice Elkin, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case uses the following language (p. 514): \u201cA municipality is not always relieved from liability for injuries resulting from the work of an independent contractor in repairing its streets. If, at the time of the commission of the negligent acts complained of, the contractor did not have the exclusive control of the street, with the authority to prohibit the use of it by the public, the city may be liable for failure to perform its duty in exercising proper care in the supervision and control of that street as a public highway. If, as we understand the facts in the present case, the city required the street to be kept open for use by the public while the repairs were being made,'the duty rested upon it to maintain the street in a reasonable safe condition for every purpose of a public highway.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">If the city would be li\u00e1ble under the above facts, it appears to us that the city or municipality would still be liable when the conditions created in the street were made by an independent contractor working for an abutting property owner, who had no permission or license from the municipality to change or occupy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sidewalk, and these conditions have existed for such a length of time that the city or municipality was affected with constructive notice, and failed to either close up the street or guard the same, we think the same liability would attach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">We therefore think that the points submitted by the defendant upon the trial of the case in court could not be affirmed by the court, for the reason that they all called for binding instructions in favor of the defendant. Therefore, we do not discover any reasons filed why a new trial should be granted in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">And now, to wit: June 16, 1913, the rule granted in this case, on September 24, 1912, to show cause why the verdict of the jury shall not be set aside and a new trial granted, is hereby discharged. Also the rule granted September 24, 1912, in this case, to show cause why judgment should not be entered for the defendant non obstante veredicto, upon the point reserved by the court, is also hereby discharged, and the prothonotary is hereby directed to enter judgment for the plaintiffs upon the verdict of the jury in the above case, for the amount of the verdict, with interest and costs, upon payment by the plaintiffs of the jury fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (1-5) in refusing defendant\u2019s points without reading them to the jury; (6) in refusing judgment for defendant n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-7\"><em>E.

The judge\u2019s charge is not made to a technical and critical audience, scanning closely every phrase capable of a construction which would be error, but is addressed to a jury of plain men of various ages, education, intelligence, and experience, and is intended to inform them as to the law, and to guide them in its application to the facts as they may find them from the evidence. Having given them one plain, full and adequate statement of the law, it need not do more.\u201d This is the language of our Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Lewis, 222 Pa. 302.
