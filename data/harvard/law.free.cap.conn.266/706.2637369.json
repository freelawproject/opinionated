The defendant appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denying the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The effect of this judgment was that the vehicles properly would be assessed in the towns where they are regularly parked or garaged. The defendant claims that the judgment was improper because the statutory scheme governing the taxation of a corporation\u2019s personal property for municipal taxation purposes provides that the corporation\u2019s motor vehicles be taxed in the town of the corporation\u2019s principal place of business. We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The plaintiff, Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc., brought this action as a tax appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking to remove certain of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>motor vehicles from the October 1, 1998 grand list of the defendant, the city of Waterbury, and declaratory relief from taxation of those motor vehicles by the defendant as to all future tax years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties filed a stipulation of facts, accompanied by numerous exhibits, and cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion, denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff is an electrical contractor employing more than 200 people with its principal place of business in Waterbury. The defendant is a municipal corporation authorized by law to assess and collect personal property taxes on motor vehicles. The plaintiff owns, registers and insures several motor vehicles that it assigns to its employees for use in their employment. Several of these employees do not reside in Waterbury and, therefore, several of the motor vehicles owned by the plaintiff and assigned to its employees are regularly parked or garaged in other towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On October 1, 1998, certain motor vehicles owned by the plaintiff and assigned to its employees appeared on the grand lists for the towns where the plaintiffs employees reside. These same motor vehicles also appeared on the defendant\u2019s grand list. Thus, the plaintiff was obligated to pay personal property taxes on its motor vehicles to both the defendant and the respective towns in which its employees park or garage its motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The plaintiff notified David Dietsch, the defendant\u2019s tax assessor, that several of its motor vehicles were garaged outside of Waterbury and claimed that their inclusion in the defendant\u2019s October 1, 1998 grand list was improper. Dietsch\u2019s subsequent refusal to remove the vehicles from the defendant\u2019s grand list and the defendant\u2019s position that it is the municipality to which the plaintiff owes taxes on its vehicles are the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In addition to the foregoing facts, the parties stipulated to the entry of various documents and deposition transcripts as evidence. These exhibits are summarized in relevant part, and include the testimony of the plaintiffs treasurer, the defendant\u2019s tax assessor, the chief of legal services of the department of motor vehicles (department), the manager of the department\u2019s property division, and the head motor vehicle examiner for the department\u2019s property tax unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The plaintiffs treasurer, Cynthia Graziano, is responsible for the administration of the plaintiffs property tax payments. Graziano testified in her deposition that the plaintiff had paid its property taxes on all its motor vehicles to the defendant until 1996. At that time she was contacted by the tax assessor for the city of Brook-field, who advised her that he had noticed a vehicle bearing the plaintiffs logo that he believed to be garaged in Brookfield and that he further believed should be included on Brookfield\u2019s grand list. Graziano testified further that she contacted Dietsch\u2019s office, and was advised that the plaintiffs vehicles should be taxed in the towns in which they are garaged, and that the plaintiff should obtain forms from the department that would allow the plaintiff to change the vehicles\u2019 \u201ctax town\u201d codes. Graziano also testified that, subsequent to filing the appropriate forms with the department to reflect the towns in which the plaintiffs vehicles were garaged, she received a visit from representatives of Dietsch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>office at the plaintiffs offices in Waterbury, who informed her that the plaintiffs motor vehicles were subject to taxation by the defendant regardless of where the vehicles were garaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Dietsch testified in his deposition that it was the position of the defendant\u2019s tax assessment office that the plaintiffs motor vehicles should be taxed in Waterbury, where the plaintiff maintains its principal place of business, rather than the towns in which the vehicles are garaged. Dietsch based this position on the text of the applicable statutes, and stated that his interpretation was shared with other municipal tax assessors with whom he serves on the motor vehicle committee of the Connecticut association of assessing officers (association). Dietsch also testified that the association has had to address the problem of taxpayers registering motor vehicles in towns other than their towns of residence in order to take advantage of differences among mill rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The chief of legal services for the department, John Yacavone, testified in his deposition that the issue of the \u201csitus\u201d of motor vehicles for personal property taxation purposes has arisen on regular and numerous occasions since he began his tenure with the department in 1987, and it has become a \u201cperennial subject\u201d in the legislature. Yacavone further testified that the department has a statutory duty to provide annual lists of registered motor vehicles to Connecticut\u2019s municipal tax assessors for taxation purposes, and that those lists are prepared from information provided by registrants, at the time they register their motor vehicles, in a standardized form, issued by the department, known as an \u201cH-13\u201d form. The H-13 form requires the registrant to provide the name of the \u201c[Connecticut] town where vehicle is to be taxed as property,\u201d and this information is used by the department to compile the list that the department is required by law to furnish to town tax assessors. Yacavone further testified that there is no statute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>regulation mandating the style and content of the H-13 form, that such matters are left to the discretion of the commissioner of motor vehicles, and that he had issued a memorandum in 1999 to the then deputy commissioner of motor vehicles suggesting a revision of the \u201ctax town\u201d language requested by the H-13 form. Finally, Yacavone testified that he had issued the memorandum because he did not believe that any statute or regulation authorized the department to base its lists on the situs of motor vehicles, and because personal property is generally taxable where the \u201cowner has his primary residence or principal place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The division manager of the property division of the department, David Ostafin, testified in his deposition that registrants are instructed by a parenthetical comment, located near the space on the H-13 form requesting the name of the registrant\u2019s tax town, that the proper name is the name of the town \u201cwhere vehicle is garaged for longest period in a year.\u201d This parenthetical instruction was revised in 1995 to add the word \u201cparked\u201d to supplement the word \u201cgaraged,\u201d because, as Ostafin testified, employees at the department were \u201csick of saying to people that they\u2019re still liable for taxes even though they don\u2019t have a garage.\u201d Ostafin further testified that, to his knowledge, no statute or regulation required the department to obtain the names of the towns in which registrants park or garage their motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The head motor vehicle examiner in the department\u2019s property tax unit, Marcia Mazur, testified that the department\u2019s property tax unit is responsible for correcting and revising the department\u2019s motor vehicle registration information, and that she processed the \u201ctax town\u201d changes requested by the plaintiff. Mazur further testified that she had informed the plaintiff that a town\u2019s tax assessor, and not the department, determines whether to accept a change in a registrant\u2019s \u201ctax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>town,\u201d and that the parenthetical instruction on the Hi-13 form was \u201cmisleading\u201d and creates \u201cchaos\u201d for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The parties presented these stipulated facts and evidence to the trial court, and they provided the basis for the court\u2019s subsequent judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly interpreted the taxation statutes applicable to this case and, therefore, that the judgment in favor of the plaintiff was improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We begin by stating the standard of review governing this appeal. In reviewing the propriety of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, this court\u2019s scope of review is plenary. <em>Fojtik </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>265 Conn. 385, 389, 828 A.2d 589 (2003). Furthermore, because the parties have stipulated to the relevant facts and there are no material facts in dispute, the dispositive issue centers around the proper construction of the applicable statutes, namely, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-41 (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 12-43,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>12-59,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 12-71 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 14-12 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 14-163.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Questions of statutory construction also raise questions of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>which are subject to plenary review by this court. <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 588, 830 A.2d 164 (2003); <em>Enfield </em>v. <em>Enfield Shade Tobacco, </em>265 Conn. 376, 380, 828 A.2d 596 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">All of the statutes involved in this appeal pertain to municipal taxation of tangible property, in general, and to the taxation, by municipalities, of a corporation\u2019s motor vehicles, in particular. The specific issue, namely, whether a corporate owner of a motor vehicle must pay personal property taxes on that motor vehicle to the municipality in which the owner has its principal place of business or to the municipality in which the motor vehicle is located, has, as this record demonstrates, vexed taxpayers and tax assessors for years. We begin our analysis of this issue by restating the process by which we interpret statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute[s] [themselves], to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [their] enactment, to the legislative policy [they were] designed to implement, and to [their] relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On the basis of the language of the relevant statutes, the policies they were designed to implement, and their relationship to other legislation governing the same subject matter, we conclude that a corporation\u2019s motor vehicles properly are assessed, for purposes of personal property taxation, in the town in which the corporation maintains its principal place of business, irrespective of where its motor vehicles are actually located. Furthermore, we conclude, based on the language of the relevant statutes, that it is the obligation of the commissioner of motor vehicles to furnish lists of all Connecticut registered motor vehicles and their owners to the tax assessors of the respective towns where those owners reside, or, in the case of a corporation, where the corporation has its principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We begin with the language of the applicable statutes. \u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute [s], because that is the most important factor to be considered. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>doing so, we attempt to determine [their] range of plausible meanings, and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The language of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-40,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 12-41,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 12-42,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>12-43; see footnote 5 of this opinion; and General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-58<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> strongly indicates that the primary foundation for the taxation of personal property is the \u201cdeclaration\u201d filed by the taxpayer. For example, \u00a7 12-40 requires the town tax assessors to notify \u201call persons therein liable to pay taxes to bring in a declaration of [their] taxable personal property . . . .\u201d Section 12-41 (c) describes what the \u201cannual declaration\u201d shall include. Section 12-42 provides for an extension of the time for the filing of the \u201cdeclaration.\u201d Section 12-43 makes special rules for the \u201cfiling [of] a declaration\u201d by the owner of taxable property who is a nonresident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>of a town where his or her property is located. Section 12-58 provides special rules for the filing of \u201cthe personal property declaration\u201d of property of trading, manufacturing or mechanical businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 12-71 (a), property of residents of this state \u201cshall be listed for purposes of property tax <em>in the town where such person resides, </em>subject to the provisions of sections 12-42<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 12-59.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) See footnote 7 of this opinion. Section 12-59 provides for declarations by corporations, and provides that their property \u201cshall be liable to taxation in the same manner as the property of individuals.\u201d See footnote 6 of this opinion. The trial court assumed, as have the parties on appeal, and as do we, that this means that the town of the coiporation\u2019s principal place of business is the statutory equivalent of the town of an individual\u2019s residence and, therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 12-71, a corporation must file its declaration with the tax assessor of the town of its principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Under this statutory regime, therefore, the plaintiffs motor vehicles would be taxable in Waterbury, because that is the location of the plaintiffs principal place of business, and, therefore, that is where the plaintiff was obligated to file its declaration of taxable personal property. This would be so <em>unless, however, there is a different set of rules governing the taxation of motor vehicles. </em>We conclude that there is such a different set of rules, but that they mandate the same result, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that motor vehicles are taxed in the town of their corporate owner\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">This different set of rules is set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 12-41 (b), 14vl2 and 14-163. Section 12-41 (b) provides: \u201cNo person required by law to file an annual declaration of personal property shall include in such declaration motor vehicles which are registered in the office of the state Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.\u201d See footnote 4 of this opinion. Thus, under this provision, motor vehicles registered in Connecticut are specifically exempted from the declaration of taxable personal property required under the general statutory scheme for taxation of personal property. Consequently, a tax assessor would not be informed of the taxability of a motor vehicle by virtue of a taxpayer\u2019s declaration. Under \u00a7 14-12 (a), Connecticut residents are required to register their motor vehicles with the commissioner of motor vehicles. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-163, however, the commissioner of motor vehicles is required to \u201cfurnish to the tax assessors in each town a list containing the names and addresses of the owners of motor vehicles and snowmobiles <em>residing </em>in their respective towns, as they appear by the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles, with a description of such vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 9 of this opinion. Thus, tax assessors do not secure the information regarding the ownership of motor vehicles by residents of their towns from those residents\u2019 personal property declarations, but, instead, secure that information from the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to \u00a7 14-163. This language strongly suggests, therefore, that motor vehicles are taxed in the town of their owners\u2019 residence and, in the case of the corporate owner, in the town of the corporation\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">This interpretation of the language of the applicable statutes is supported by the general purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>statutory scheme governing taxation of personal property. These legislative purposes are based on the fundamental premises that, first, the personal property tax system is, by practical necessity, a self-reporting system, and, second, \u201cit is a system that has long rested on the notion that taxation be as nearly equal as possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 434, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). The first premise, therefore, suggests a legislative intent to create simple and direct mechanisms for self-reporting, and the second premise suggests a legislative intent to create a reliable statutory scheme capable of spreading the tax burden as equitably as possible. Motor vehicles are, unlike much other taxable personal property, inherently mobile and, as the present case discloses, subject to being parked or garaged in various places. Requiring that their taxation be determined by where their registration indicates their owners reside, irrespective of where they may be garaged from time to time, lends a degree of certainty that is fully consistent with the twin purposes of the taxation system. Furthermore, by having the motor vehicle registration process automatically trigger the place of taxation, any potential for either manipulation of the taxation process<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or fraud on the part of the taxpayer<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is minimized.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The plaintiff argues that, because its motor vehicles are located for more than three months of each assessment year in towns other than the defendant, \u00a7 12-43 requires that it pay personal property taxes on those motor vehicles to the towns in which the vehicles are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>located and not to the defendant. Section 12-43 provides that \u201c [e] ach owner of tangible personal property located in any town for three months or more during the assessment year immediately preceding any assessment day, who is a nonresident of such town, shall file a declaration of such personal property with the assessors of the town in which the same is located . . . .\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff contends that, because its vehicles are located in towns other than the defendant for the requisite three months or more, \u00a7 12-43 requires it to file declarations with the tax assessors of those <em>other towns, </em>and to include in those declarations the motor vehicles located in those other towns. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Section 12-43 expressly directs taxpayers who are nonresidents of the towns in which their personal property is located for a specified number of months each year to file a declaration of such property with the tax assessors of the towns in which the property is located. Section 12-43, therefore, provides an exception to the general rule that personal property is taxed by the town in which the owner of the property resides. Nonetheless, \u00a7 12-43 still requires the taxpayer to file a declaration\u2014albeit with the tax assessor of the town where its property is located and not the tax assessor of the town in which it resides. The requirement to file a declaration under \u00a7 12-43, however, renders that section inapplicable to motor vehicles because \u00a7 12-41 (b) specifically provides that \u201c[n]o person <em>required by law to file an annual declaration of personal property </em>shall include in such declaration motor vehicles which are registered in the office of the state Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We conclude, therefore, that nothing in \u00a7 12-43 overrides the specific exemption from declaration of personal property provided by \u00a7 12-41 (b).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The plaintiff also argues that the language of \u00a7 14-163 requires the commissioner of motor vehicles to furnish a list of motor vehicles located in each town to the tax assessor of that town, and that this requirement evinces the legislature\u2019s intent to tax motor vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>where they are parked or garaged and not where the owner of the motor vehicles resides, if that residence is in a town other than the town in which its motor vehicles are located. Section 14-163 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe commissioner, on or before the first day of December, annually, shall furnish to the tax assessors in each town a list containing the names and addresses of the owners of motor vehicles and snowmobiles <em>residing in </em>their respective towns, as they appear by the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the phrase \u201cresiding in\u201d modifies \u201cmotor vehicles and snowmobiles\u201d and does not modify <em>owners </em>of motor vehicles and snowmobiles. Under the plaintiffs interpretation, therefore, the commissioner of motor vehicles must furnish a list of all motor vehicles \u201cresiding in\u201d a given town to that town\u2019s tax assessor. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Although the grammatical structure of the sentence in question may be seen as employing \u201cresiding in\u201d as a prepositional, adjectival phrase modifying \u201cmotor vehicles and snowmobiles\u201d;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we conclude, to the contrary, that the phrase \u201cresiding in\u201d more commonly refers to people, not inanimate objects and, therefore, as used in \u00a7 14-163, should be read as modifying \u201cowners.\u201d For example, the word \u201creside\u201d is generally defined in terms of where people five rather than where inanimate objects are located. The most apt definition of \u201creside\u201d in this context is \u201c[t]o dwell permanently or for a considerable time, to have one\u2019s settled or usual abode, to live <em>in </em>or <em>at </em>a particular place.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in original.) Oxford English Dictionary (2d Ed. 1989). Ordinarily, people, and not inanimate objects, dwell or have their abode in a place. Furthermore, \u201c[w]e may presume . . . that the legislature intended [a word] to have its ordinary meaning in the English language, as gleaned from the context of its use.\u201d <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 267, 736 A.2d 104 (1999). On the basis of an examination of the statutory text, the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of \u201cresiding in\u201d is strained and contrary to ordinary usage, and this fact alone strongly cautions against its adoption. Furthermore, the plaintiffs interpretation of \u201cresiding in\u201d would be inconsistent with the legislative purposes behind the entire statutory scheme for taxation of personal property of which \u00a7 14-163 is a necessary part. As we have explained, one of the fundamental premises of the taxation scheme is that it is, by practical necessity, a self-reporting system. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 434. This premise suggests, in turn, a legislative purpose to render mechanisms and procedures for self-reporting relatively simple and direct. Under the plaintiffs interpretation, however, the process of self-reporting would be confusing and difficult, because if the motor vehicle\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d were dispositive of the issue of which town may assess taxes on it, there would need to be some indication in \u00a7 14-163 of how long a motor vehicle must be located in a certain town before that motor vehicle could be considered, for taxation purposes, a \u201cresident.\u201d We can find no such indication.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The plaintiff relies, in support of its argument, on the department\u2019s H-13 form. The plaintiffs argument suggests the H-13 form, which all motor vehicle owners in Connecticut are required to fill out and submit to the department, requires the motor vehicle registrant to state, not only his town of residence, but also the name of the \u201ctown where vehicle is to be taxed as property.\u201d In the space on the H-13 form for the tax town, the department has included the following parenthetical information for instructional purposes only: \u201cWhere vehicle is garaged/parked for longest period in a year.\u201d This part of the form would indicate that the tax town is determined by where the motor vehicle is garaged or parked for more than six months per year and evinces the department\u2019s understanding that it must furnish a list to municipal tax assessors of motor vehicles \u201cresiding in\u201d each town, indicating in turn that the town in which the vehicle is located is the town to which personal property taxes are payable. The plaintiffs reliance on the H-13 form is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Simply put, we can find no statutory basis for the language used in the H-13 form. Nowhere in the statutory scheme for the municipal taxation of personal property, or in the statutory scheme for the registration of motor vehicles, is there any requirement that the department collect the names of the towns in which registrants\u2019 motor vehicles are parked. Section 14-163, however, expressly provides that the commissioner must furnish lists of names and addresses of owners of motor vehicles to the tax assessors for their respective towns of residence. No mention is made in \u00a7 14-163 of furnishing lists of motor vehicles parked or garaged in each town. Furthermore, the testimony of Yacavone indicates that he placed the commissioner of motor vehicles on notice that the H-13 form was not grounded in the statutes when he issued a memorandum to the commissioner advising him that the H-13 form should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>be revised to remove the instructional language on the location of registrants\u2019 motor vehicles. We agree with that prudent advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In addition, permitting the taxpayer simply to fill in the name of a town on the department\u2019s form and thereby subject a motor vehicle to taxation in a town other than the town in which its owner resides would lend itself to two potential forms of abuse. First, a motor vehicle owner could choose to garage a motor vehicle in a town with a mill rate lower than that of the town of his residence. Second, a motor vehicle owner fraudulently could claim that his motor vehicle was in fact garaged in a town with such a lower mill rate, and, in such a case, it would be difficult for the tax assessor of the owner\u2019s town of residence to detect such a fraud. In either event, the purpose of the taxation scheme to tax all persons and property equitably would be frustrated. We are not inclined to interpret our taxation statutes so as to frustrate their underlying purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The plaintiff, however, argues that taxing motor vehicles owners in the towns in which the motor vehicles are located does serve a legitimate purpose, namely, that it compensates the towns where the vehicles are garaged for the wear and tear on their roads. This purpose, the plaintiff suggests, supports its interpretation of \u00a7 14-163 that the commissioner of motor vehicles is required to notify the tax assessors of the towns of the <em>motor vehicles\u2019 </em>residences, rather than of their <em>owners\u2019 </em>residences.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This proffered legislative purpose, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ever, rests on a shaky premise, namely, that the legislature contemplates that motor vehicles would cause the most wear and tear to the roads in the towns in which they are garaged. That premise, however, is speculative at best, and for that reason we are not inclined to attribute it to the legislature, at least without some clear indication thereof. Motor vehicles are highly mobile by nature, and it is difficult to assess, in a meaningful way, their impact on the infrastructure of the town where they are garaged. One could just as easily claim that the roads in the town where a person is employed are impacted as much or more by that person\u2019s motor vehicles. Suffice it to say, the legislative purpose that the plaintiff proposes is not bolstered by an examination of the text of \u00a7 14-163, and would be contrary to the underlying purposes of the personal property tax system.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 provides: \u201cWhen it is claimed that a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the town or city in whose tax list such property was set, or that a tax laid on property was computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property, the owner thereof or any lessee thereof whose lease has been recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, prior to the payment of such tax, may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated.

The amendments substituted the filing of a \u201cdeclaration\u201d for a \u201clist,\u201d in order to clarify the difference between a town\u2019s grand list and the list or declaration of personal property filed by the taxpayer. The amendments did not alter the meaning or applicability of the statutes to this case in any way, nor did the technical amendments to \u00a7 12-71 (a) enacted by Public Acts 2000, No. 00-230, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> Under a contrary interpretation, a taxpayer could choose to garage his or her motor vehicle in a town with a mill rate lower than the mill rate of his or her town of residence, thus reducing the tax payable thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> A taxpayer could fraudulently claim, as we explain later in this opinion, that his or her motor vehicle is garaged in a town with a lower mill rate than the town of his or her residence, even though, in fact, it is garaged at his or her residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> We are cognizant that a portion of the legislative history surrounding No. 82-458 of the 1982 Public Acts, which amended \u00a7 12-43 by shortening the length of time, from seven months to three months, that personal prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>erty owned by a nonresident of a town would have to be located in that town before the town could assess and collect taxes on it, contains a brief statement susceptible of the interpretation that motor vehicles would be included within the definition of personal property referred to by \u00a7 12-43. That legislative history contains the following colloquy between Representatives Linda N. Emmons and Michael D. Rybalc, and Speaker of the House Ernest N. Abate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201c[Representative Emmons]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through you a question to the proponent of the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201c[The Speaker]: State your question please, madame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c[Representative Emmons]: When you discuss tangible personal property, would that be an automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201c[The Speaker]: Representative] Rybak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201c[Representative Rybak]: Yes, it could be an automobile, through you, Mr. Speaker.\u201d 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1982 Sess., p. 5402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">We do not read this legislative history as justifying an interpretation of \u00a7 12-43 that would require nonresident owners of Connecticut registered motor vehicles to declare those vehicles to the towns in which the vehicles are parked. This is true for three reasons. First, the comment was made within the context of a broader discussion about the liability of persons who are nonresidents of <em>Connecticut </em>for taxes assessed on their personal property located within the state for a certain number of months each year. Such nonresidents of Connecticut, by definition, would not fall within the motor vehicle exception of \u00a7 12-41 (b), because residents of states other than Connecticut would not ordinarily register their vehicles with the commissioner of motor vehicles. Only motor vehicles registered in Connecticut are excepted from declarations of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Second, \u201c[ujnlike other examples of exchanges on the floor of the [House], this exchange does not have the hallmarks of a colloquy designed to indicate a legislative intent behind statutory language. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388,412, 672 A.2d 921 (1996). Instead, the representatives were addressing a hypothetical situation that the bill may or may not have affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">Third, the statutory text of \u00a7\u00a7 12-43 and 12-41 (b) strongly supports our conclusion that \u00a7 12-41 (b) exempts Connecticut registered motor vehicles from declarations under \u00a7 12-43. \u201cIn such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports [a particular] meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 577-78. This brief legislative history is simply insufficient to yield a contrary meaning of the text that both its language and purpose strongly support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\"> See generally Chicago Manual of Style (15th Ed. 2003), rules 5.166 and 5.167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> It is true that the Oxford English Dictionary does contain quotations using the word \u201creside\u201d in reference to something other than where a person lives. For example: \u201cThe verie instant that I saw you, did My heart flie to your sendee, there resides To make me slaue to it.\u201d Oxford English Dictionary (2d Ed. 1989), quoting W. Shakespeare, The Tempest, act 3, sc. 1. Prefacing these quotations, however, is an editorial note stating that \u201cresides,\u201d in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>instances, is being used in a \u201ctransferred sense,\u201d meaning that its more common usage is being transferred for artistic purposes to another context. Thus \u201cresides,\u201d which commonly refers to human beings is, in this transferred sense, used to refer to a human heart. Simply because a word has been used in a particular way or in a particular context, however, does not mean that it must always be read to mean the same thing in every context. Merely because \u201cresides in\u201d <em>may </em>be used to refer to something other than where a person lives, does not compel us to desert common sense and common usage and assign it such a meaning in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\"> The plaintiff also relies on certain of the legislative history surrounding No. 82-458 of the 1982 Public Acts, which amended \u00a7 12-43. See footnotes 5 and 19 of this opinion. Representative Rufus Allyn stated, during the House debates, that he supported the bill because individuals residing in Connecticut for only part of the year \u201care paying few enough taxes in Connecticut,\u201d and that \u201cif they are using our roads and so forth, at least they can pay the taxes on their cars.\u201d 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1982 Sess., p. 5405. Representative Allyn\u2019s statements, however, do not support the plaintiffs argument that the legislature intended taxes to go to the benefit of the Connecticut town in which a motor vehicle is garaged as opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>to the Connecticut town where the owner of that motor vehicle resides. Instead, Representative Allyn\u2019s comments specifically referred to residents of other states who live here for part of the year, yet who were not obligated to pay taxes on their motor vehicles to <em>any </em>Connecticut town because their vehicles are not registered in Connecticut. Presumably, because those vehicles are not otherwise within the exception from declaration provided by \u00a7 12-41 (b), they may be taxable if they meet the requirements of \u00a7 12-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
