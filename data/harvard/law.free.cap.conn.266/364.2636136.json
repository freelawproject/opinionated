The defendant, Manuel Ceballos, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial before the court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>of one count each of the crimes of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the state\u2019s attorney violated the defendant\u2019s federal and state due process rights<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a fair trial as a result of numerous instances of misconduct in his closing arguments and in the questioning of witnesses, including the defendant; (2) the trial court improperly admitted constancy of accusation evidence; (3) the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that its verdict was required to be unanimous with respect to an underlying act that would support a conviction on each of the two counts charged; and (4) the trial court improperly failed to give the jury the child credibility instruction requested by the defendant. We conclude that prosecu-torial misconduct during the questioning of witnesses and closing arguments deprived the defendant of his federal due process right to a fair trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial. We also will address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>defendant\u2019s claims of instructional error because they are likely to arise again at the defendant\u2019s new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The record reveals that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant had resided in the New Haven home of his cousin, T, and her husband, since June, 1996. The victim, S,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and her mother, K, were T\u2019s granddaughter and daughter, respectively. In May, 2000, S and K resided in T\u2019s home, along with the defendant, T\u2019s husband, T\u2019s three other adult children and six of T\u2019s grandchildren, including S and her three younger brothers. K and her children, including S, lived in a bedroom on the third floor of the house. The defendant also had lived on the third floor, as did A, the uncle of S, and his infant son. The defendant did not share his bedroom with anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In May, 2000, S was seven years old. She testified that, on May 9, 2000, she was in her room with her younger brothers watching cartoons on television.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No one else was on the third floor of the house at that time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> S testified that the two boys were fighting; one brother had gone to the defendant\u2019s room and told him that the other boy was hitting him. S testified that the defendant had then entered the room and told the children to stop fighting. He then told S to come with him to his bedroom. She testified that, while she was in the defendant\u2019s bedroom with him, he kissed her, touched her chest with his hand, and partially inserted his \u201cpoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing finger\u201d into her vagina and rectum. S testified that she did not say anything to the defendant at that time because she was \u201ctoo afraid.\u201d The defendant then told her to keep what had transpired \u201ca secret\u201d and not to tell her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">S testified that the defendant had touched her in a similar manner on several occasions before May 9,2000, and that these incidents always had occurred on the third floor of the house. She testified that she could not recall the specific dates, but that all of the incidents had occurred in April and May, 2000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">S testified that on May 10, 2000, the day after one of the alleged incidents with the defendant, she had suffered from pain in the \u201cprivate part\u201d that was \u201c[bjetween [her] legs.\u201d S told K about her pain during the early evening of that day. At that time K also had observed S scratching and \u201cpulling on\u201d her vaginal area. K examined the area and instructed S to put diaper rash cream on it to reheve the irritation. K then asked S whether anyone had touched her in that area.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> K testified that S did not respond at first, and that she had seemed puzzled. K then testified that she repeated the question. At this point, S told K that the defendant had sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Subsequently, on the evening of May 10, K brought S to the Fair Haven Clinic (clinic) for medical evaluation. At the clinic, Laurel Shader, a pediatrician, had conducted a physical examination of S, including her vaginal and rectal areas, and also interviewed her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Shader testified that her examination of the vaginal area revealed normal anatomy, with the exception of a scratch, or a \u201cfaint abrasion,\u201d on the outer labia. She testified that the scratch could have been caused by digital penetration by an adult\u2019s finger, but also could have numerous other causes, including the child\u2019s own scratching,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or the fact that \u201csome kids at this age tend to wipe themselves too vigorously and sometimes cause little scratches . . . .\u201d Shader also testified that slight penile penetration of the child\u2019s vagina would not necessarily cause physical trauma or leave evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Shader indicated that the results of the rectal examination were normal; that, however, did not necessarily mean that the area had not been digitally penetrated. Finally, she testified that in the majority of sexual abuse cases, there is no physical evidence because of the delay in reporting the incident, especially when coupled with children\u2019s rapid physical healing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, a normal physical examination did not foreclose the possibility that a sexual assault had occurred.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Later on the evening of May 10, Jeff Hoffman, a New Haven police officer, responded to the clinic to conduct a preliminary investigation, and he spoke to K, S and Shader. Hoffman was met shortly thereafter by Edwin Rodriguez, a New Haven police detective. K told the police officers where they could find the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> K subsequently brought S to police headquarters to be interviewed by Rodriguez and another detective, Patricia Adger. During this interview, S told the detectives that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. She then indicated the areas where she alleged the defendant had touched her by circling the chest, genitals and buttocks on a picture of a girl given to her by the detectives. S testified that she was tired during this interview because it was late and past her bedtime. Rodriguez testified that the interview was performed at approximately 10 or 11 p.m.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Thereafter, on May 12, S and K discussed the incident again. S testified that she had told K that the defendant had put her hand onto his genitals, and had slightly penetrated her vagina with his penis.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> S testified that the defendant always had kept his clothes on during these encounters; the defendant would unzip his pants in order to expose his genitals. S testified that she did not talk about this on May 10 with K, Shader or the police because she was \u201ctoo afraid.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>this information, K had called the clinic and scheduled another appointment for S for May 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Subsequently, on May 15, Ruth McGraw, S\u2019s regular pediatrician, examined and interviewed her at the clinic. In light of S\u2019s additional disclosures, McGraw, with the assistance of Sandra Flatow, a sexual abuse expert, examined S, including her vaginal and rectal areas, and did not note any physical abnormalities. McGraw also took cultures from the vagina, rectum and throat to check for gonorrhea and chlamydia. These cultures returned negative after a laboratory analysis. Like Shader, McGraw also testified that her negative findings did not mean that S had not been sexually abused.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The defendant, T and A, K\u2019s half-brother, testified for the defense. T testified that when she came home from work on May 10, 2000, K told her that the defendant had sexually abused S. She testified that she only had spoken with K about S\u2019s allegations,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but that she did not believe them. T testified that she never questioned S about the allegations; she had returned to work when K took S to the clinic. T, however, stated on cross-examination that she and the defendant often were not home together at the same time. She routinely had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>returned from work at 8 p.m. and the defendant routinely had departed for work shortly before 10 p.m. on weeknights.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">A, who in addition to being K\u2019s half-brother, is a cousin and friend of the defendant. A testified that in May, 2000, he lived in the bedroom that was located between K\u2019s room and the defendant\u2019s room. At that time, he had worked on varying days between 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. as a senior citizens\u2019 driver. A testified that, to his knowledge, the defendant usually worked approximately from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. When the defendant was in his room, A testified that the door was always closed. A testified that he was present in the house on the day and evening of May 9, 2000, but that he had gone to church for part of the evening. He also testified that the police did not question him about whether he was present in the house at the time of the alleged incident. A testified that he never had seen S go into the defendant\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The defendant also testified in his own defense. He described the interior of his room as containing a bed, three bureaus, family photographs and a television. He testified that the room had one window and a solid white door with a lock. The defendant testified that in May, 2000, he usually worked on Monday through Friday from 10 p.m. until 7:30 a.m. stocking at a discount store. He also testified that on May 10, 2000, he fell asleep after coming home from work and watching television, and awoke to the early evening confrontation with K at approximately 6 p.m. He testified that K was swearing at him and threatening him. He had told K to bring S in and ask her for the truth. S subsequently entered the room and accused the defendant of abuse, and he told her to \u201cstop lying.\u201d The defendant told K to take S to the doctor and come back after an examination. Subsequently, S and K left the room, and the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>dant then went back to sleep. Thereafter, he awoke again and was arrested by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The defendant denied ever kissing S or touching any part of her body. He also denied that she had ever touched his penis. He testified that he did not know why S had made the allegations against him. The defendant also denied that S had ever been in his room, or that he had been in her room.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Subsequently, the jury convicted the defendant of one count each of the crimes of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). The trial court sentenced the defendant to ten years imprisonment for sexual assault, and five years imprisonment for risk of injury to a child, to be served concurrently for a total term of ten years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that deliberate and pervasive prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of his federal due process right to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney committed misconduct when he: (1) asked the defendant to comment on S\u2019s veracity during cross-examination and used that line of questioning during his summation; (2) made a religiously charged statement during closing arguments; (3) injected extraneous matters into the case and appealed to the jurors\u2019 emotions and sympathies for S during closing arguments; (4) bolstered S\u2019s credibility by asking her on direct examination whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>her testimony was the truth; (5) argued facts not in evidence in a deliberate attempt to influence the jurors against the defendant; and (6) violated the trial court\u2019s orders on three different occasions during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We note that the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct in the present case are similar to those that we recently addressed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 793 A.2d 226 (2002), because, as in that case, the defendant here contends that the cumulative effect of all the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improprieties during questioning and closing arguments sufficiently had infected the proceedings, and thereby rendered the conviction a denial of due process. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Singh, </em>we will \u201caddress each [claim] in turn to determine whether the particular conduct was improper before determining whether the impropriety, if any, deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Moreover, this case\u2019s similarity to <em>Singh </em>does not end with the nature of the misconduct alleged. Just as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 699, the defendant in the present case did not raise at trial all of his complaints of prosecutorial misconduct. He only objected to two of the misconduct claims that arose from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant \u201cmay prevail only if he satisfies all four requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 699. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>conclude that the defendant has satisfied all four prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Prior to analyzing the defendant\u2019s specific claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we set forth the well established principles that guide our inquiry as to all of his claims. \u201cTo prove prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must demonstrate substantial prejudice. ... In order to demonstrate this, the defendant must establish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may occur in the course of cross-examination of witnesses . . . and may be so clearly inflammatory as to be incapable of correction by action of the court. ... In such instances there is a reasonable possibility that the improprieties in the cross-examination either contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty or, negatively, foreclosed the jury from ever considering the possibility of acquittal. . . . Moreover, prosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 699-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201c[I]t is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole. . . . We are mindful throughout this inquiry, however, of the unique responsibilities of the prosecutor in our judicial system. A prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. ... By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>influence upon jurors. [The prosecutor\u2019s] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he [or she] should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Improperly Questioned the Defendant about the Veracity of S</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of misconduct is that, during cross-examination, the state\u2019s attorney improperly had asked him, in violation of our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 712, whether S was lying, and why she would make up allegations of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The defendant also contends that the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>attorney violated <em>Singh </em>when he used the answers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>that improper cross-examination in his rebuttal argument to the jury during summations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The state concedes that the questions at issue about whether S was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>lying were legally erroneous under the rule we articulated in <em>Singh. </em>The state, however, contends that these questions did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct because they did not amount to either deliberate or \u201cseriously egregious\u201d conduct by the state\u2019s attorney. We conclude that the line of questioning about whether S was lying, and its use by the state\u2019s attorney in closing argument, constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 706, we addressed, as an issue of first impression in Connecticut, the \u201cwell established evidentiary rule that it is improper to ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity.\u201d We adopted this rule, noting that: (1) \u201cquestions that ask a defendant to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury,\u201d which includes the determination of witness credibility; id., 707; and (2) \u201cquestions of this sort also create the risk that the jury may conclude that, in order to acquit the defendant, it must find that the witness has lied.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Id., 708. Moreover, we expressly rejected the minority rule, which \u201cprovides an exception to the prohibition of questions and comments on witnesses\u2019 veracity when the defendant\u2019s testimony is the opposite of or contradicts the testimony of other witnesses, thereby presenting a basic issue of credibility . . . [that cannot] be attributed to defects or mistakes in a prior witness\u2019 perception or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>inaccuracy of memory, rather than to lying.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The record reveals that the state\u2019s attorney questioned the defendant repeatedly about whether S was lying, and about any possible motives that she might have for making her allegations of sexual abuse. See footnote 26 of this opinion. Moreover, the state made use of this cross-examination in its closing argument. See footnote 27 of this opinion. We conclude, as the state conceded in its brief, that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s actions with respect to asking the defendant whether S was lying violated the rule articulated in <em>Singh </em>and, therefore, were improper. We also conclude, however, that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questions and subsequent arguments about S\u2019s possible motives for the allegations of sexual abuse were not improper. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 170, 778 A.2d 955 (2001) (\u201cthe state may properly argue that the witnesses had no apparent motive to lie\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Relying on this court\u2019s decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 562-64, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 246-54, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1975), the state claims that the violation of <em>Singh </em>by the state\u2019s attorney does not constitute prosecutorial misconduct because it was neither deliberately undertaken in bad faith, nor seriously egregious. We disagree. The state\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge that \u201c[t]he standard that we follow in analyzing constitutional due process claims that allege prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial rather than the culpability of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>229, 262, 780 A.2d 53 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. Singh, supra, 259 Conn. 723; <em>State </em>v. Williams, 204 Conn. 523, 539-40, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Thus, the lack of bad faith on the part of the state\u2019s attorney in his questions and arguments that violated <em>Singh </em>is irrelevant to the determination of whether they were improper. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s questioning of the defendant about the veracity of S, and the comments during summation reflecting that line of questioning, were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Made a Religiously Charged Statement during Summations</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The defendant also contends that the state\u2019s attorney made an improper religiously charged statement in his rebuttal argument during summations. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s attorney, after referencing S\u2019s statement that she believed \u201cGod will punish\u201d people who tell lies; see footnote 40 of this opinion; improperly argued that: \u201cI would submit that the defendant is not concerned about what God is going to do to him, not now anyways. He\u2019s worried about what you people are going to do, and that\u2019s why he had to say what he said yesterday.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The state claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>defendant misconstrues the nature and effect of that comment, contending that it was intended to \u201ccontrast [S], who, seemingly due to her youth, believed God would punish her if she lied, with the defendant, who likely was more concerned about the jury\u2019s immediate verdict.\u201d The state also contends that this was not an improper religiously charged argument because it did not ask the jury to disregard the court\u2019s instructions in favor of a \u201c \u2018higher law.\u2019 \u201d We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments were improper and constitute prosecutorial misconduct, especially when viewed within the context of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s prior comment regarding S\u2019s credibility, namely, that the defendant wanted the jury \u201cto believe that pure evil, Satan\u2019s daughter, appeared here on Friday morning in this courtroom . . . .\u201d See footnote 27 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As an initial matter, we are mindful of the fact that the statements made by the state\u2019s attorney during his summation not only directly invoke religious characters, including \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cSatan,\u201d but also impliedly reference notions of divine punishment for worldly transgressions. The extent to which prosecutors may employ religious references during argument presents an issue of first impression for this court.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Many other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>jurisdictions, however, both federal and state, have addressed this issue. In addition, our analysis is guided by an independent review of the substantial amount of academic commentary on the use of religious references by prosecutors. Our review of these authorities indicates that the courts overwhelmingly have taken a disapproving approach to the prosecutorial use of religious imagery and references during trials.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Angelone, </em>92 F.3d 1336, 1346 (4th Cir.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(\u201c[federal and state courts have universally condemned . . . religiously charged arguments as confusing, unnecessary, and inflammatory\u201d), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1002, 117 S. Ct. 503, 136 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1996). In a majority of these jurisdictions, the courts have concluded that prosecutorial use of religious references is always improper. These courts, however, do not concomitantly conclude that all improper religious remarks constitute harmful or reversible error. Rather, the majority approach follows the initial determination of impropriety with a subsequent analysis as to whether the defendant was prejudiced by the inappropriate remarks. See, e.g., <em>Sandoval </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765, 775-79 (9th Cir.) (prosecutor\u2019s argument during penalty phase of capital trial \u201cparaphrased Romans 13:1-5, a passage from the Bible\u2019s New Testament commonly understood as providing justification for the imposition of the death penalty\u201d; held both \u201cimproper and highly prejudicial\u201d because \u201cdelegation of the ultimate responsibility for imposing a sentence to divine authority undermines the jury\u2019s role in the sentencing process\u201d and \u201c[t]his is not a case where the evidence overwhelmingly supported the jury\u2019s verdict . . .

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>350 N.C. 1, 26-27, 510 S.E.2d 626 (prosecutor\u2019s discussion of biblical passages supporting imposition of death penalty not \u201cgrossly improper,\u201d but \u201cdiscour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>age[d]\u201d; court \u201ccautionfed] all counsel that they should base their jury arguments solely upon the secular law and the facts\u201d), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 880, 120 S.

See, e.g., <em>Carruthers </em>v. <em>State, </em>272 Ga. 306, 309-10, 528 S.E.2d 217 (\u201cwe have long declined to disapprove of passing, oratorical references to religious texts in arguments by counsel\u201d and \u201c[i]t is difficult to draw a precise line between religious arguments that are acceptable and those that are objectionable, but we conclude that the [prosecutor] in this case overstepped the line in directly quoting religious authority as mandating a death sentence\u201d), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 934, 121 S. Ct. 321, 148 L. Ed. 2d 258 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Finally, we note the per se reversible error approach adopted by Pennsylvania as to reliance on religious writings by prosecutors in death penalty cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>528 Pa. 558, 586, 599 A.2d 630 (1991) (\u201cIn the past we have narrowly tolerated references to the Bible and have characterized such references as on the limits of \u2018oratorical flair\u2019 and have cautioned that such references are a dangerous practice which we strongly discourage. . . . We now admonish all prosecutors that reliance in any manner upon the Bible or any other religious writing in support of the imposition of a penalty of death is reversible error per se and may subject violators to disciplinary action.\u201d [Citations omitted.]), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 946, 112 S. Ct. 2290, 119 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1992). This approach subsequently has been modified. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>v. <em>Cook, </em>544 Pa. 361, 384, 676 A.2d 639 (1996) (religious references by prosecutor \u201cwere a fair response to the evidence presented by the defense and did not violate the per se rule of Chambers\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>544 Pa. 219, 241-42, 675 A.2d 1221 (1996) (concluding that rule of <em>Chambers </em>did not apply to \u201ctangential\u201d references to God).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We also note that the commentators, like the courts, are divided with respect to the degree and type of religious references that should be permitted during trials. Compare J. Blume &amp; S. Johnson, \u201cDon\u2019t Take His Eye, Don\u2019t Take His Tooth, and Don\u2019t Cast the First Stone: Limiting Religious Arguments in Capital Cases,\u201d 9 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 61, 94\u201497 (2000) (endorsing Pennsylvania\u2019s automatic reversal rule for prosecutorial religious references, except for those that are \u201csingle\u201d or \u201cin passing,\u201d and providing definition of \u201creligious argument\u201d) with E. Brooks, note, \u201cThou Shalt Not Quote the Bible: Determining the Propriety of Attorney Use of Religious Philosophy and Themes in Oral Arguments,\u201d 33 Ga. L. Rev. 1113, 1174-80 (1999) (The commentator criticized the Pennsylvania per se reversible error rule and argued that \u201ccourts that evaluate whether religious arguments constitute error should be careful not to label all religious arguments as improper. Determination of propriety of religious statements should not look to the religious origins of the argument, but instead should compare religious arguments to other improper arguments to see if they rise to the same level of impropriety.\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Having reviewed these persuasive authorities, we see no reason to depart, in the context of statements made by state\u2019s attorneys that reference or invoke religious characters or beliefs, from our well settled standard by which we evaluate any other prosecutorial statement that is challenged as constituting misconduct rising to the level of a due process violation. See footnote 29 of this opinion. Accordingly, in the determination as to whether prosecutorial misconduct constituting a denial of due process has occurred, argument by the prosecution that invokes or references religion or religious beliefs is to be evaluated under a two step progression. First, a threshold inquiry is to be performed as to whether the challenged statements pass the threshold of impropriety in that they are inflammatory, unduly evoke the passions or prejudices of the jurors, or improperly invade the province of the jury.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Once it has been established that the statements were improper and thereby constitute \u201cmisconduct\u201d in the technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sense, a determination shall be made as to whether the misconduct was substantially prejudicial to the defendant. \u201cIn order to demonstrate this, the defendant must establish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 699-700; see also footnote 29 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As to the first stage in this process, a prosecutorial statement that references religion and is alleged to constitute misconduct can be evaluated, just as any other statement made by a prosecutor, on an individual basis to determine if the statement is improper. The best approach is to view the statement of the prosecutor in the context and in the manner in which it was made; to evaluate whether the statement improperly invaded the province of the jury as to the assessment of evidence or the finding of fact; and to determine if the statement had the inflammatory impact of infusing passion, prejudice, or resentment into the minds of the jurors on a case-by-case basis. If misconduct is found as a threshold matter, then the prosecutorial statement, viewed in the collective with all other statements found to be improper, will be measured within the second stage of the analysis: whether the statements were substantially prejudicial such that the fundamental fairness of the trial was adversely impacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The sum and substance of our analysis into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct when religious references are made is, therefore, in harmony with the analytical construct of the majority of jurisdictions. As already noted, in those jurisdictions prosecutorial impropriety does not necessarily equate to reversible prosecutorial misconduct; rather, a further showing of actual prejudice must be made in order for prosecu-torial misconduct to warrant reversal. This subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>demonstration of prejudice is identical to the second step of our progression: whether prejudice has been visited upon a criminal defendant as a result of established misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Turning to the statements made by the state\u2019s attorney in his summation in the present case, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct when he remarked: \u201cI would submit that the defendant is not concerned about what God is going to do to him, not now anyways. He\u2019s worried about what you people are going to do, and that\u2019s why he had to say what he said yesterday.\u201d This statement, particularly in light of his further reference to \u201cSatan\u2019s daughter,\u201d far overstepped the bounds of appropriate prosecutorial argument or permissible oratorical flair. We are persuaded that the context of the statements, the manner in which they were delivered, and the substance of the remarks constituted inappropriate statements under our well established standard regarding prosecutorial misconduct. In our view, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s separate direct invocations of religious characters served solely as an inflammatory emotional appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury, and bore no reasoned connection to the jury\u2019s determination as to the ultimate issue before them, namely, the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Zant, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>928 F.2d 1006, 1020 (11th Cir. 1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giry, </em>supra, 818 F.2d 134; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Moreover, we are markedly troubled by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to the possible divine consequences that await the defendant as a result of his actions. As mentioned, the state contends that this statement was relevant to the determination of the defendant\u2019s credibility because it was intended to contrast S, who \u201cseemingly due to her youth, believed God would punish her if she lied, with the defendant, who likely was more concerned about the jury\u2019s immediate verdict.\u201d We reject the state\u2019s assertion that this statement was not inflammatory and provided meaningful guidance to the jury as it undertook its credibility determinations. Rather, we view this statement as an indication to the trier of fact, the jury, that another trier of fact, a divine one nonetheless, awaited the defendant to punish him for his lack of veracity. By raising the inference that the defendant already had been adjudged guilty by an omnipotent other, the statement impermissibly invaded the province of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the respective witnesses. In addition, we are not convinced that this was the only inference that may have been planted in the minds of jurors; a statement referencing possible punishment by a divine being for wrongs allegedly peipetrated by the defendant, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the context of summations in a criminal trial, also may have served to cast doubt upon the ultimate issue before the jury: the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark about the defendant\u2019s concern with the jury, as opposed to God, was inflammatory, impermissibly invaded the province of the jury, and was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Improperly Appealed to the Jury\u2019s Sympathy for S and Improperly Injected Extraneous Matters into the Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The defendant next claims that, during the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s initial closing argument, he had: (1) injected extraneous matters into the trial; and (2) appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions to evoke sympathy for S. Specifically, the defendant contends that the following comments during closing argument constituted an improper appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions: (1) the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s descriptions of S\u2019s difficult childhood and poor living conditions; (2) statements of how courageous S was by testifying; and (3) the statement that S \u201cdid her part last Friday. With all due respect, ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s now time for you to do your part.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The state claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>in response that: (1) the description of S as courageous was not an improper appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions, but rather was an argument in support of her credibility because it explained that she had nothing to gain personally by testifying about embarrassing matters to strangers in court; (2) the discussions of S\u2019s living arrangements were intended to show that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the crime; and (3) the \u201cdo your part\u201d comment was not improper because, taken in context, it did not predict the negative future effects of an acquittal, but merely informed the jury that the matter was in their hands. We conclude that some of these comments breached well established boundaries of appropriate prosecutorial advocacy and, therefore, were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We begin with the well established proposition that \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal. . . . Therefore, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [but] such argument must be fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 719; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 307, 755 A.2d 868 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We begin by concluding that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments about S being the \u201cperfect victim\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of her difficult childhood and poor living conditions were not improper appeals to the jury\u2019s emotions. Although the state\u2019s attorney elected to make an opportunity argument in a manner that cast S in an undoubtedly sympathetic light because of her disadvantageous family situation, this did not detract from the main point of the argument, namely, that the defendant had ample opportunity to abuse S. We, therefore, agree with the state\u2019s contention that these remarks constituted a proper argument that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the crimes alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We also conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment that \u201c[S] did her part last Friday . . . [w]ith all due respect, ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s now time for you to do your part,\u201d was improper. We base this conclusion on our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 271-72. In <em>Whipper, </em>the prosecutor had stated to the juiy: \u201c \u2018Now you\u2019re here as members of the community. You represent what your community is going to be. Not me. I did my part. The police did their job ....\u2019\u201d Id., 271 n.19. In <em>Whipper, </em>we concluded that this comment was \u201cclearly . . . improper\u201d because, in suggesting \u201cthat the juiy had a duty, as members of the community, to convict the defendant ... it asked [the] jurors to consider matters not in evidence when deliberating the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Id., 271. We also concluded, however, that these remarks did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial because the defendant\u2019s counsel had objected and the trial court had given an adequate curative instruction. Id., 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In our view, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment in the present case to the jury to \u201cdo your part\u201d was as inappropriate as the prosecutor\u2019s statement in <em>Whipper. </em>We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s contention that this argument was proper because it did not predict the negative effects of a not guilty verdict, but merely stated that the matter was now in the jury\u2019s hands for delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tion. These arguments, taken in context, suggested that the mere fact that S came forward to testify obligated the members of the jury to \u201cdo your part\u201d and convict the defendant. Indeed, we note particularly that this statement was made in the sole context of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s discussion of S\u2019s courage. Accordingly, we conclude that this comment was improper. Moreover, we conclude similarly that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments about how courageous S was by coming forward with her allegations and testifying in court also constituted an inappropriate appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Improperly Bolstered S\u2019s Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s attorney improperly bolstered S\u2019s credibility by, in essence, rehabilitating her testimony before she was ever impeached. Specifically, the defendant, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Loggins, </em>257 Ill. App. 3d 475, 488, 629 N.E.2d 137 (1993), claims that the state\u2019s attorney improperly had questioned S at the conclusion of direct examination about whether her testimony was truthful; this, therefore, invaded the province of the jury because she had testified as to the ultimate issue in the case, which was her truthfulness, and permitted S to \u201clift herself by [her] own bootstraps . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The state claims in response that this line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>questioning dovetailed with preliminary background questions in which the state\u2019s attorney sought to ascertain whether S knew the difference between the truth and a lie,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> making it, therefore, merely confirmatory. The state also claims that this court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 474, 503 A.2d 599 (1986), implicitly has rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that a witness cannot \u201clift herself by [her] own bootstraps\u201d in the absence of impeachment. We conclude that the questioning by the state\u2019s attorney of S at the conclusion of direct examination, about whether her testimony was truthful was, in light of her young age, proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by exploring the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Loggins, </em>supra, 257 Ill. App. 3d 475, the case on which he relies. In <em>Loggins, </em>the defendant claimed that certain questions by the prosecutor on redirect examination were improper attempts to rehabilitate the witness. Id., 484-88. The court concluded that most of the questions were permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sible, but ruled improper the question to a witness on redirect: \u201c \u2018Can. you take a look at them [the jury] and tell them if you told them the truth?\u2019 \u201d Id., 488. The court stated that the question was \u201can improper attempt to rehabilitate the witness as to her veracity. The witness cannot lift herself by her own bootstraps.\u201d Id. The Illinois court concluded, however, that while the question improperly invaded the jury\u2019s function of determining the credibility of a witness and the weight afforded his or her testimony, the error was harmless in light of the \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence against the defendant. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We conclude that the reasoning of <em>Loggins </em>is inappo-site in the present case, wherein the witness is a young child such as S. Although S\u2019s awareness of the difference between the truth and a lie already had been established in the preliminary examination by the state\u2019s attorney; see footnote 40 of this opinion; this brief line of confirmatory questioning at the conclusion of her testimony did not improperly bolster her credibility in the absence of attack. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s followup questions were not extrinsic evidence; they merely served to confirm a young child\u2019s awareness of the significance of the oath that she had taken previously. We, therefore, conclude that the follow-up questions did not constitute improper bolstering of S\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Improperly Commented on Facts Not in Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The defendant next claims that, during his initial closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney twice improperly had commented on facts that had not been admitted into evidence. Specifically, the defendant claims that the following comments were improper: (1) stating, during his discussion of the testimony of Shader, that S suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome, when Shader had in fact testified that S never had been diagnosed with this syndrome;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and (2) remarking that the defendant had abused S \u201cphysically, sexually, and also mentally,\u201d because no evidence had been introduced as to any emotional trauma suffered by S.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The state con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>tends, in response, that: (1) there was sufficient evidence in the record to support an inference that S had suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome, and that Shader\u2019s testimony had been admitted in order to help the jury determine whether the delayed disclosure of S\u2019s allegations was indicative of fabrication; and (2) the principle that sexual abuse has mental, as well as physical, effects on children is obvious to the jury, and the statement to that effect therefore was not misconduct. We agree with the state, and we conclude that neither the statement about S having suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome, nor the remark about the mental effects of childhood sexual abuse, were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It is well established that a \u201cprosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. ... [A] lawyer shall not . . . [a]ssert his personal knowledge of the facts in issue, except when testifying as a witness. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument. . . . [T]he state may [however] properly respond to inferences raised by the defendant\u2019s closing argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u201cA prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence. . . . Moreover, when a prosecutor suggests a fact not in evidence, there is a risk that the jury may conclude that he or she has independent knowledge of facts that could not be presented to the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment about S having suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome was not improper because it was an argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>in support of an inference that could be drawn from evidence in the record, namely, Shader\u2019s testimony. Our review of the record indicates that although Shader testified that S never had been diagnosed formally with delayed disclosure syndrome, the timing of S\u2019s allegations, coupled with Shader\u2019s general testimony about the occurrence of this syndrome in child victims of sexual abuse, would permit the jury reasonably to infer that S had suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome. See footnote 20 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark about S suffering from delayed disclosure syndrome was a proper argument in support of an inference that permissibly could be drawn from the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Moreover, although the more artful way to phrase the argument probably would have been for the state\u2019s attorney to state that, \u201cyou can infer that S suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome,\u201d any impropriety stemming from this remark was cured by the trial court. We note that the defendant had objected to this comment. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and instructed the jurors to disregard that portion of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument that specifically related S to delayed disclosure syndrome.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Therefore, even if the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment improperly had referred to facts not in evidence, the prejudicial effect of this comment was mitigated by the trial court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 563, 462 A.2d 1001 (\u201ca prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks obviates any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>possible harm to the defendant\u201d), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S.

[j]urors are not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experiences, but rather, to apply them to the facts as presented to arrive at an intelligent and correct conclusion. . . . Therefore, it is entirely proper for counsel to appeal to a jury\u2019s common sense in closing remarks.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolli, </em>53 Conn. App. 269, 281, 729 A.2d 245 (prosecutor\u2019s remarks about driving time on Interstate 95 from West Haven to New Haven permissible appeal to jurors\u2019 common knowledge), cert. denied, 249 Conn. 926, 733 A.2d 850 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 716 n.22 (remark that \u201c \u2018gasoline is heavier than air\u2019 \u201d not improper because \u201cmost people would know\u201d that fact). In our view, it is axiomatic that child sexual abuse has mental and emotional repercussions for the victim. Thus, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments about the psychological effects of the sexual acts alleged to have been committed against S were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Whether the State\u2019s Attorney Improperly Violated the Trial Court\u2019s Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s attorney deliberately and improperly had defied the orders of the trial court when he: (1) questioned Shader about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>delayed disclosure syndrome without giving defense counsel advance notice of such testimony; (2) argued during summation that S suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome, despite the trial court\u2019s order that Shader was not allowed to testify about whether S actually had the syndrome; and (3) discussed S\u2019s testimony in front of K while arguing for the admission of constancy of accusation testimony, despite the trial court\u2019s having entered a sequestration order. The state claims in response that: (1) the state\u2019s attorney did not violate a court order with respect to Shader\u2019s testimony because there was no court order but, rather, merely an agreement between the parties that the state thought had been abrogated implicitly by the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Shader; (2) although Shader did not say that S had suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome, there was sufficient evidence introduced to permit the jury to infer that fact; and (3) the defendant failed to object to the sequestration order issue in a timely manner, and the trial court had authorized the state\u2019s attorney to put S\u2019s testimony on record in front of K. We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney neither improperly questioned Shader about delayed disclosure syndrome, nor violated the trial court\u2019s sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct was a deliberate circumvention of the trial court\u2019s express rulings is significant because we apply a different standard as such misconduct involves prejudice to the entire judicial system, in addition to prejudice to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 575. In <em>Ubaldi, </em>this court concluded that \u201c[w]here a prosecutor in argument . . . interjects remarks deliberately intended to undermine the rulings of the trial court to the prejudice of the defendant, his conduct is so offensive to the sound administration of justice that only a new trial can effectively prevent such assaults on the integrity of the tribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>nal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 575. This is distinct from misconduct that does not involve \u201cpurposeful disregard of a ruling, which requires the defendant to prove that he was deprived of a fair trial as the result of the misconduct . . . .\u201d Id. In contrast, a new trial ordered because of a prosecutor\u2019s deliberate violation of trial court rulings is ordered pursuant to this court\u2019s supervisory powers, rather than to remedy the violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. Id., 570. We emphasize, however, that this remedy is not automatic even in cases of deliberate defiance. This court will take a \u201ccautious approach\u201d and balance other interests and practical considerations, such as the trauma caused to the victim who must testify again, prior to ordering a new trial pursuant to its supervisory powers. Id., 572. Indeed, we will evaluate whether the violation of the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas so unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction is necessary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney had violated the court\u2019s orders by questioning Shader about delayed disclosure syndrome without first giving defense counsel advance notice of such testimony. We set forth the following additional facts and procedural history necessary for resolution of this claim. The defendant had filed a motion for disclosure of any expert opinion testimony to be proffered by the state. The court granted the motion after the state\u2019s attorney agreed to alert defense counsel, outside the presence of the jury, of any intention to introduce expert testimony about the victim\u2019s delayed reporting of child sexual abuse. During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Shader about the allegations that S had not disclosed initially. Subsequently, the state\u2019s attorney attempted to question Shader on redirect examination about delayed disclosure in child sexual abuse cases, but did not first notify the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>this line of questioning. The defendant then objected to these questions, claiming that they were beyond the scope of cross-examination, and that they violated the agreement that such questions would be asked outside the jury\u2019s presence. The trial court permitted Shader to testily, and concluded that this testimony was responsive to the cross-examination about the lack of certain disclosures. After voir dire by both parties, the trial court ruled that Shader was qualified to testily generally about delayed disclosure in child sexual abuse victims, but could not offer an opinion about S in particular. Shader then testified before the jury about delayed disclosure syndrome. See footnote 20 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning of Shader about delayed disclosure, without first notifying defense counsel, was not \u201cso unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction is necessary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Whipper, supra, 258 Conn. 269. Although the better practice would have been to give the requisite notice to defense counsel, we are persuaded by the state\u2019s contention that Shader\u2019s testimony was found relevant and admissible by the trial court, which led to those questions being asked in front of the jury. We also note that the state\u2019s questions occurred on redirect examination, after the defendant already had questioned Shader about the inconsistent and delayed disclosures as reflected in S\u2019s medical records. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986) (\u201cThe party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have opened the door to rebuttal by the opposing party. Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other grounds, the court may, in its discretion, allow it where the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence. . . . The doctrine of opening the door cannot, of course, be subverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>into \u00e1rale for injection ofprejudice.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney had violated the court\u2019s express orders when he had argued that S suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome. We already have concluded in part I E of this opinion that this argument was proper because it referred to an inference that reasonably could be drawn from evidence in the record. We note, however, that the defendant objected to these comments during summations, and that the trial court sustained the objection and gave a curative instruction to the jury. See footnote 44 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that, even if we were to assume that the comment was improper, its effects were mitigated by the trial court, and the comment, by itself, does not rise to the level of disobedience that requires reversal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 258 (value of curative instruction); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 563 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney violated the trial court\u2019s sequestration order when he had discussed S\u2019s testimony in front of K while arguing for the admission of constancy of accusation testimony. The defendant had filed a pretrial motion requesting the trial court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-36, to direct the state\u2019s attorney to: (1) sequester each of its witnesses during the evidentiary portion of the jury trial; and (2) warn each of his witnesses not to discuss the contents of his or her testimony with any other witness. The trial court granted this motion applicable to the witnesses for both parties. During his direct examination of K, the state\u2019s attorney indicated that he wished to introduce constancy of accusation evidence pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 304-305, 677 A.2d 917 (1996). While K was seated on the witness stand, the state\u2019s attorney stated that he wished to put on the record the accusations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>that S had testified to previously. The trial court granted this request. The state\u2019s attorney then discussed the specific accusations that S had testified that she had told K At this point, the defendant objected to this being done in front of K. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and excused K from the courtroom. The state\u2019s attorney then continued his recitation prior to resuming his questioning of K.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In our view, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements in the presence of K arguably may have contravened the spirit and purpose of the sequestration order. The defendant, however, did not object immediately, despite the fact that the state\u2019s attorney clearly had prefaced his comment with a statement of his intent to put the accusations of S on the record. Indeed, the defendant did not object until after the state\u2019s attorney already had begun his recitation. Accordingly, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s discussion of S\u2019s testimony in front of K did not rise to the level of deliberate flouting of a trial court order as contemplated by <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 575. See also <em>State </em>v. Whipper, supra, 258 Conn. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Whether the Prosecutorial Improprieties Deprived the Defendant of His Right to a Fair Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Having reviewed the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecu-torial improprieties, we now turn to the \u201cultimate ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion,\u201d which is \u201cwhether the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Singh, supra, 259 Conn. 723; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 303. The defendant contends that, viewed in light of the factors for determining the seriousness of misconduct, as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improprieties in the present case amounted to a due process violation because they were: (1) uninvited by the defense; (2) pervasive throughout the trial; (3) directed at the central issue in the case, which was the credibility of S and the defendant; and (4) made in the context of a weak state\u2019s case. The state contends in response that the defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutorial improprieties because many of the state\u2019s questions and comments were invited by defense counsel\u2019s arguments: (1) in support of the defense theory that S had fabricated her allegations, including counsel\u2019s comments on the lack of physical injury; (2) intended to generate sympathy for the defendant; and (3) expressing personal comments about the quality of the police investigation. The state also contends that: (1) curative measures taken by the court, and by the state\u2019s attorney during argument, mitigated any harm suffered as a result of these comments; and (2) the lack of conclusive physical evidence did not necessarily make the state\u2019s case against the defendant weak. We conclude that, when viewed in the context of the entire trial, the prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is well established that \u201c[i]n determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>conduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength ofthe state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.; accord State v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 723; <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Whether the Prosecutorial Misconduct Was Invited by the Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Much of the state\u2019s argument focuses on the first <em>Williams </em>factor, which is the degree to which the prose-cutorial improprieties were invited by defense counsel. Specifically, the state contends that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s violations of <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 706-707, during questioning and argument; see part I A of this opinion; were invited by the \u201c \u2018only possible\u2019 \u201d defense theory that S had fabricated her claims. We disagree with the state because we reject the notion that, standing alone, a legitimate defense theory can be viewed as inviting improper conduct on the part of the state\u2019s attorney. Accordingly, we conclude that the violation of <em>Singh </em>by the state\u2019s attorney was not invited by the defendant or his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">As for the remaining improprieties, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper comments during summation, were not invited by the arguments of defense counsel. Specifically, we disagree with the state\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments that implored the members of the jury to \u201cdo your part\u201d; see part IC of this opinion; were invited by defense counsel\u2019s depiction, during his summation, of the defendant as a good person who had emigrated to the United States in search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of a better life.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As the defendant correctly points out, the state\u2019s attorney made the challenged sympathy-generating comments during his initial summation, and <em>not </em>during the state\u2019s rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, the state does not claim that the religiously charged statement during rebuttal summation was invited. See part I B of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Whether the Prosecutor\u2019s Misconduct Was Severe and Frequent</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We next turn to the severity and frequency of the misconduct in this case. The defendant contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the misconduct was both frequent and severe because it had occurred during both cross-examination and summations. The state contends that the misconduct was not frequent and severe because most of the defendant\u2019s claims did not constitute misconduct, and what misconduct there was had been neither purposeful nor blatant. Our analysis, however, reveals that the prosecutorial improprieties that occurred in the present case were not just isolated instances. Indeed, they occurred during both the questioning of witnesses and during argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Moreover, we conclude that the prosecutorial misconduct present in this case was severe in nature. In particular, we note that the seriously inflammatory comments made by the state\u2019s attorney referencing religious entities and divine consequences; see part I B of this opinion; tainted the trial with fundamental unfairness. Although we decline, at this time, to adopt aper se rule that all prosecutorial references to religious beliefs or entities are improper, we are nevertheless mindful that religion, perhaps more so than any other subject, evokes intensely personal, and deeply held, feelings. Accordingly, when prosecutorial statements challenged as misconduct involve references to religion, courts are to scrutinize carefully the content, context, spirit and import of the remark, while affording due weight to the often deeply inflammatory nature of such statements. In this instance, we conclude that the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney were singularly inflammatory and prejudicial. Having determined that these statements were frequent and severe, we, therefore, must weigh them in the context of the remaining <em>Williams </em>factors: the existence of curative measures taken by the court; their relation to the case\u2019s central issue; and the strength of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Whether Sufficient Curative Measures Were Taken</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We next must determine whether the effect of the prosecutorial misconduct was mitigated by curative measures taken by the trial court. The record reveals that the trial court addressed specifically the objections of defense counsel to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments: (1) claiming that S suffered from delayed disclosure syndrome;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and (2) calling the defendant a \u201cliar\u201d during his rebuttal argument.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We also note that the trial court gave general jury instructions that: (1) admonished the jury not to consider their sympathy in determining the facts; (2) explained that evidence is limited to testimony and exhibits, the effect of limited, excluded or stricken evidence, and that the lawyers\u2019 arguments are not evidence; and (3) explained the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The defendant contends that, taken in the context of the other <em>Williams </em>factors, these general instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>failed to remove the prejudice to the defendant that stemmed from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct. The state claims in response that the jury is presumed to have followed these instructions, and with no evidence to the contrary, any harm to the defendant therefore was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u201c[W]e have previously recognized that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 569, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 365, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 563. Moreover, \u201c[i]n the absence of an indication to the contrary, the juiy is presumed to have followed [the trial court\u2019s] curative instructions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 258. We note, however, that a general instruction does not have the same curative effect as a charge directed at a specific impropriety, particularly when the misconduct has been more than an isolated occurrence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>72 Conn. App. 380, 399-400, 805 A.2d 142 (trial court gave general instruction on how to evaluate witness credibility, and that counsel\u2019s statements or arguments were not evidence; \u201cprosecutor\u2019s single comment about a witness\u2019 lack of credibility was not egregious enough such that the court\u2019s instruction could not have cured the impropriety,\u201d especially in light of strong state case), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 914, 811 A.2d 1294 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Bearing in mind these standards, we now turn to the misconduct at issue in the present case. The record reveals that the prejudicial effect of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments on delayed disclosure syndrome, and his having called the defendant a \u201cliar,\u201d was mitigated by the specific, direct and immediate instruction by the trial court. Indeed, we note that the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>object to the content of this curative instruction. See also part I E of this opinion. The record reveals, however, that the other instances of misconduct, namely, the violations of <em>Singh </em>and the inflammatory religiously charged arguments, were not addressed specifically by the trial court, either sua sponte or upon objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Before addressing the import of the uncured improper arguments, we note that the defendant, by failing to bring them to the attention of the trial court, bears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured. We emphasize the responsibility of defense counsel, at the very least, to object to perceived prosecutorial improprieties as they occur at trial, and we continue to adhere to the well established maxim that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that it was unfair in light of the record of the case at the time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>248 Conn. 1, 19-20, 726 A.2d 104 (1999). Moreover, as the Appellate Court has observed, defense counsel may elect not to object to arguments that he or she deems \u201cmarginally objectionable\u201d for tactical reasons, namely, \u201cbecause he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it or because he or she wants to later refute that argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>66 Conn. App. 238, 249, 784 A.2d 387, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 943, 786 A.2d 431 (2001). Accordingly, we emphasize that counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial, while not by itself <em>fatal </em>to a defendant\u2019s claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error contemplated by the third prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240, namely, that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d Put differently, <em>Golding </em>review of prosecutorial misconduct claims is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts, but rather, to address gross prosecutorial improprieties that clearly have deprived a criminal defendant of his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We conclude, however, that the prosecutorial misconduct in the present case, namely, the violation of <em>Singh </em>and the inflammatory religious argument, was sufficiently egregious to overcome the suggestion that defense counsel did not think it was unfair at the time. Although we deem trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to these blatant improprieties inexplicable, we nevertheless conclude that the curative measures were not, by themselves, sufficiently strong to cure the prejudice caused to the defendant by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improprieties. Therefore, we will continue our review of the defendant\u2019s claims under the other factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. Williams, supra, 204 Conn. 540, in order to determine if the prosecutorial misconduct ultimately violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Whether the Misconduct Was Central to the Critical Issues in the Case, Particularly in Comparison to the Strength of the State\u2019s Case against the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The final two <em>Williams </em>factors are the centrality of the prosecutorial misconduct to the critical issues of the case, and the strength of the state\u2019s case. Id. We deem it appropriate in the present case to review these factors together. The defendant claims that the state\u2019s case was not particularly strong because: (1) there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>no conclusive physical evidence of sexual abuse; and (2) the case rested on S\u2019s testimony, which largely consisted of answers to leading questions. The defendant also claims that as a result of the nature of the state\u2019s case, the sole issue at trial was the credibility of S and the defendant. The state contends in response that: (1) the lack of physical evidence did not automatically render its case weak; (2) witness credibility is an issue in virtually every case; and (3) the leading questioning aided S in testifying more fully, and that the defendant had the opportunity to attack her testimony on cross-examination. We conclude that these factors weigh firmly in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">While the state correctly notes that the absence of conclusive physical evidence of sexual abuse does not automatically render its case weak, that same absence surely does not strengthen the state\u2019s case against the defendant. In our view, the defendant\u2019s assessment of this case as entirely a credibility contest between S and the defendant is correct. Indeed, as we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 308, a child sexual abuse case lacking conclusive physical evidence, when the prosecution\u2019s case rests on the credibility of the victim, it is \u201cnot particularly strong . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 724 (\u201cthe state\u2019s evidence, while sufficient to result in a conviction, was not particularly strong\u201d). Also, as in <em>Singh </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>\u201call of the improprieties were connected directly to the critical issue, indeed the only disputed issue at trial . . . .\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 308 (\u201cimproper comments directly addressed the critical issue in this case, the credibility of the victim and the defendant\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In our view, without independent physical evidence to prove that the defendant had sexually assaulted S, or even that S had been sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>assaulted at all, the significance of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper conduct increases considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that, in light of the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct in the present case deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial because the prosecutorial improprieties, namely, the violations of <em>Singh, </em>the \u201cdo your part\u201d exhortation, and the inflammatory religious arguments, were pervasive and directed at the critical evidentiary issue, which was the credibility of both S and the defendant. We also note the general lack of curative measures. Indeed, we cannot conclude that, in the absence of other independent evidence to prove that the defendant had sexually assaulted S, the jury would have concluded that the evidence proved the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 725. Accordingly, the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">WHETHER A SPECIFIC UNANIMITY INSTRUCTION WAS WARRANTED</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Although the prosecutorial misconduct issue is dis-positive, and we remand this matter for a new trial, we will address two of the defendant\u2019s remaining three claims because the issues that they present are likely to arise again on remand.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Accordingly, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that its verdict had to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>unanimous as to an underlying act supporting conviction of each of the two counts charged, thereby violating his state and federal constitutional rights to a unanimous verdict and to a fair trial. The state contends in response that the trial court\u2019s instruction did not sanction a nonunanimous verdict, and that the defendant is therefore not entitled to have his claim reviewed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619, 595 A.2d 306 (1991). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury did not improperly sanction a nonunani-mous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial and seeks to prevail pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We will review this claim because an adequate record for review exists, and \u201c[a] claim bearing on the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict implicates a fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial and is thus reviewable despite the defendant\u2019s failure to request a specific unanimity charge or to take proper exceptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 619. We conclude, however, that the defendant failed to satisfy the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding </em>because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury did not sanction a nonunanimous verdict and, therefore, did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In charging the jury, the trial court first explained in detail the elements of each of the two charges, sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. This charge instructed the jury that the state must prove each element of each count beyond a reasonable doubt. After explaining the charges, the trial court then instructed the jury that \u201c[w]hen you reach a verdict, it must be unanimous as to each count charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Subsequently, after one day of deliberations, the jury reached a guilty verdict on the risk of injury charge, but not the sexual assault charge. The jury had indicated that this verdict was unanimous, and the trial court accepted it. The trial court then gave the jury additional time to deliberate on the sexual assault charge. Before the jury returned to deliberations, however, the court had emphasized three times that its verdict on this charge must be unanimous. Subsequently, after an additional day of deliberations, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the sexual assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 619-20, this court articulated the general principles governing specific unanimity charges. \u201c[W]e have not required a specific unanimity charge to be given in every case in which criminal liability may be premised on the violation of one of several alternative subsections of a statute. We have instead invoked a multipartite test to review a trial court\u2019s omission of such an instruction. <em>We first review the instruction that was given to determine whether the trial court has sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. If such an instruction has not been given, that ends the matter. </em>Even if the instructions at trial can be read to have sanctioned such a nonunanimous verdict, however, we will remand for a new trial only if (1) there is a conceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged, and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each alternative act with which the defendant has been charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">With respect to the first prong of <em>Famiglietti, </em>namely, whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions have sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict, it is well established that \u201cthe absence of language <em>expressly sanctioning </em>a nonunanimous verdict means that the defendant has not met the first part of the <em>Famiglietti </em>test. \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 454, 619 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>453 (1993); <em>State </em>v. Dyson, 238 Conn. 784, 793, 680 A.2d 1306 (1996). Indeed, if \u201cthe trial court did not sanction a nonunanimous verdict we need not address the other parts of the <em>Famiglietti </em>test.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s charges to the jury in the present case reveals a distinct absence of any language that could\u2019lead the jury to believe that a non-unanimous verdict was in any way permissible. We, therefore, do not reach the remainder of the <em>Famiglietti </em>test. In our view, the trial court took pains to emphasize the requirement that the jury\u2019s verdict be unanimous as to each count charged. Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Senquiz, </em>68 Conn. App. 571, 590, 793 A.2d 1095, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519 (2002), a case in which the defendant was charged with and convicted of sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child arising out of multiple occasions, the Appellate Court upheld instructions similar to those given in the present case<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> because, \u201cafter explaining the elements of each charge to the jury with reference to the victim\u2019s testimony, the court reminded the jury to consider each count separately, to make findings related to each element of each count and to act unanimously on each count.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury in the present case did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by sanctioning a nonunanimous verdict.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">WHETHER A CHILD CREDIBILITY INSTRUCTION WAS WARRANTED</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim in this appeal is that the trial court improperly refused to give the child credibility instruction that he had requested. The state claims in response that the trial court properly refused to give the defendant\u2019s requested charge because it contravened the rationale and ruling of the controlling case, <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 570-71, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). We conclude that the trial court properly refused to give the child credibility instruction requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We set forth the following additional facts and procedural history necessary for the resolution of this claim. The defendant had requested that the trial court instruct the jury that: \u201cYou should bear in mind that in certain aspects a young child is more apt to err than an older person; he or she is apt to be more amenable to any influence or suggestion which may be made to them by older persons, and the sanctity of the oath and solemnity of legal proceedings may affect them less than an adult. These are some factors which you may consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>when assessing the credibility of the children who testified in this case.\u201d Although the trial court refused to give the special child credibility instruction, it did charge the jury in accordance with the first part of the defendant\u2019s request to charge. The court instructed the jury only that it was solely responsible for assessing the credibility of S, and that it could consider her age, demeanor, capacity to understand and answer questions intelligently, and ability to observe and recollect facts.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The defendant took an exception to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We begin our analysis by noting the applicable standard of review. We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a child credibility instruction for abuse of discretion because that instruction is \u201cnot for the statement of any rule of law but for a cautionary comment upon the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 571; <em>State </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>237 Conn. 321, 330, 677 A.2d 912 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 570, this court overruled its earlier decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>152 Conn. 196, 198, 205 A.2d 488 (1964), and concluded that it is <em>not </em>\u201cessential to grant a requested charge that denigrates a child as usually less worthy of belief than an adult, especially when it treats all children uniformly regardless of differences in age or intelligence and also omits any reference to factors commonly recognized as enhancing the credibility of a child.\u201d In so concluding, this court considered the great weight of authority from both the courts of our sister states, and the scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>community, and noted that \u201c[authorities, more qualified than judges in regard to child behavior, question the conventional wisdom that children are less likely to be truthful on the witness stand than adults and, at least with regard to children as old as [the twelve year old complainants], that they are less capable of distinguishing the real from the imaginary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 568. This court concluded that the child credibility instruction is \u201cnot for the statement of any rule of law but ... a cautionary comment upon the evidence,\u201d which lies in the \u201cbroad discretion of [the] trial court . . . .\u201d Id., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">A court considering whether to give a special child credibility instruction considers factors that include, but are not necessarily limited to, the child\u2019s age, corroboration of the accusations, the child\u2019s ability to recall and discuss events in the past, and the child\u2019s understanding of the concept of truthfulness. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 331 n.11 (where victim was nine years old when incident occurred and thirteen years old when she testified at trial, instruction remains in discretion of trial court even when only corroboration evidence is constancy of accusation); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>52 Conn. App. 85, 96, 726 A.2d 119 (1999) (\u201cDuring questioning by the court, [eight year old complainant, who was five years old when incident occurred] demonstrated an understanding of the importance of being truthful and an ability to recall events several years in the past. On direct examination, she was cogent and coherent. We find nothing to suggest that the trial court\u2019s refusal to char ge on child credibility was unreasonable.\u201d), aff'd, 253 Conn. 639, 756 A.2d 833 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Under the facts of the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to give the requested child credibility instruction. S was seven years old at the time of the allegation and eight years old when she testified at trial. We note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that it was established during preliminary questioning prior to her direct examination that S understood the concept of truthfulness. See footnote 40 of this opinion. Moreover, the lack of corroboration, beyond constancy of accusation evidence, is not dispositive. <em>State </em>v. Angell, supra, 237 Conn. 331 n.11. We also note that the trial court gave the jury the general credibility instruction, which also had been requested by the defendant. See footnote 56 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give the child credibility instruction.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and PELLE-GRINO, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

Shader testified that this irritation would cause a child to itch or scratch at the area. A, who is S\u2019s uncle and lived in the house with K and her children, testified that, to his knowledge, K only bathed her children approximately once every four days, and that he had made comments to K about this practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> Indeed, Shader testified that examination of S\u2019s hymen revealed no abnormalities.

The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial, an inquiry that in the present case necessarily will require evaluation of the defendant\u2019s other misconduct claims. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 267; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540; see also part I G of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> The state\u2019s attorney had argued during summation as follows: \u201cI asked [S] what\u2014what happens when you tell a lie?

The opportunity to come in here and be vilified? The opportunity to tell you what happened to the intimate parts of her body? Some opportunity, huh? The opportunity to be examined by some doctors?

In <em>Thompson, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s statements in this case exceeded all bounds of acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>conduct by indicating that witnesses <em>\u2018have reserved a place in hell for themselves.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 307. The court reviewed federal and sister state case law addressing the issue and stated that \u201c[i]t is highly improper in a jury trial for a prosecutor to express an opinion suggesting to those jurors who believe in heaven and hell as an article of their religious faith that witnesses\u2019 trial testimony should result in the witnesses going to a place of eternal damnation after their own deaths. <em>Regardless of whether the appeal to religious imagery was meant literally, in our pluralistic society there is no place for such religious appeals in a criminal trial. </em>The case must be decided by the evidence or lack of it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Thereafter, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification for appeal from the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 69 Conn.

Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s three improper remarks in rebuttal argument required reversal of the judgment of conviction?\u201d and \u201c2. Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that: (a) the trial court improperly permitted one witness to testify as to the credibility of another; and (b) that ruling constituted harmful error?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>260 Conn. 936, 802 A.2d 90 (2002).

Our guidance on this issue is provided by the \u201cabiding principle of jurisprudence that common sense does not take flight when one enters a courtroom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gazo </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>255 Conn. 245, 266, 765 A.2d 505 (2001). We fail to see how the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cSatan\u2019s daughter\u201d puts it into the category of an otherwise common phrase with religious origins, especially when it is taken in context with the immediately subsequent remarks contrasting the respective concerns of S and the defendant about <em>God. </em>Moreover, the dissent is incorrect in its claim that the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the word \u201cSatan\u201d in the religious sense is obsolete. In fact, under the same entry set forth in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary as cited by the dissent, the first definition provided is a direct cross reference with the word \u201cdevil.\u201d \u201cDevil\u201d is defined by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary as \u201cthe personal supreme spirit of evil and unrighteousness in Jewish and Christian theology: the tempter and spiritual enemy of mankind who is the adversary of God although subordinate to him and able to act only by his sufferance and is represented frequently as the leader or prince of all apostate angels and as ruler of hell . . . .\u201d Thus, at least our scrutiny of such an authority as Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary reveals that the dissent\u2019s assertion that the word \u201cSatan\u201d has shed its religious implications is without foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> The stale\u2019s attorney also had argued: \u201cI said before that [S] was . . . a perfect victim.

In contrast, in the present case, <em>ssmLoggins, </em>the state\u2019s attorney already had elicited testimony from S about the <em>facts </em>relevant to the case against the defendant. The questioning at issue, therefore, dealt solely with her credibility and the <em>weight </em>that the jury should place on her testimony, not the facts at issue.

We decline to discuss these claims because the comments challenged by the defendant occurred primarily during the <em>initial </em>summation, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>could not have been <em>invited </em>by any improprieties committed during summation by the defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> See footnote 44 of this opinion for the trial court\u2019s curative instruction with respect to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s delayed disclosure syndrome comments.

I respectfully dissent from part I of the majority opinion, however, because I do not believe that the state\u2019s attorney made religiously charged statements during closing arguments, that he improperly suggested that the jurors had a duty to convict the defendant, or that the cumulative effect of the alleged improprieties deprived the defendant of his due process right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>fair trial. Accordingly, I do not agree that reversal is warranted in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The state\u2019s attorney argued during summation: \u201cI would submit that the defendant is not concerned about what God is going to do to him, not now anyways. He\u2019s worried about what you people are going to do, and that\u2019s why he had to say what he said yesterday.\u201d The majority concludes that this argument was especially damaging in light of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s earlier remark during summation that the defendant wanted the jury \u201cto believe that pure evil, Satan\u2019s daughter, appeared here on Friday morning in this courtroom . . . .\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">It is well established that, \u201c[w]hen making closing arguments to the jury . . . [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v.

Indeed, this court often has recognized \u201cthe power [and] the duty of the trial court to comment upon the propriety of counsel\u2019s argument ... to give curative instructions if necessary after the arguments of counsel to prevent prejudice ... or to declare a mistrial or to set aside a verdict if counsel\u2019s comments were so prejudicial that no curative instruction could preserve the parties\u2019 right to a fair trial. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCahill, </em>261 Conn. 492, 520, 811 A.2d 667 (2002). Consequently, I would give significant weight to the trial court\u2019s response, or lack thereof, to the allegedly prejudicial remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In the absence of a per se misconduct rule, which the majority expressly rejects, not all religious references, including allusions to the Bible, God or other biblical characters, are impermissible. This is because many words and phrases traditionally viewed as religious in nature or derived from religious sources have become, over time, an integral part of the English language, and no longer may be recognized by either prosecutors or jurors as having purely religious connotations or derivations. Consider, for example, the phrases \u201craising Cain\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cfor whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both phrases are common expressions derived from the Bible. Still other expressions, such as \u201can eye for an eye,\u201d have both religious<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and secular<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> origins. This court never has adopted a per se misconduct rule\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and declines to do so in the present case\u2014because it recognizes that a prosecutor\u2019s religious references will not always rise to the level of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In the present case, the state\u2019s attorney argued during summation that the defendant wanted the jury \u201cto believe that pure evil, Satan\u2019s daughter, appeared here on Friday morning in this courtroom . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary provides three definitions for \u201csatan\u201d: (1) \u201cdevil\u201d; (2) \u201ca minion of the archfiend\u201d; and (3) \u201ca wicked person: fiend . . . .\u201d The explanatory notes contained in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary provide that the order of the definitions is historical, and, thus, regular reference to satan as the \u201cdevil\u201d is deemed to have occurred the earliest in time of the three definitions provided. The entry for \u201csatan\u201d also provides that the definition, \u201cminion of the archfiend,\u201d is an obsolete definition, there being little or no evidence of its standard usage since 1755. The word \u201csatan,\u201d therefore, no longer can be construed as having purely religious connotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Moreover, even if certain words have religious implications or derivations, the majority misses the point. As in all languages, it is <em>how </em>the word is used that is important. In the present case, it is clear from the context of the statement that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to satan was intended to convey that the defendant wanted the jury to believe that S was a bad person, not that she was the devil or a minion of the archfiend. Similarly, when the state\u2019s attorney referred to S\u2019s acknowledgment during cross-examination that God would punish her if she told a lie and then stated that \u201cthe defendant is not concerned about what God is going to do to him,\u201d he was not suggesting that the defendant is or is not a God-fearing person, but, rather, that the defendant had a more immediate problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>conclude, as does the majority, that such a statement invokes \u201cnotions of divine punishment for worldly transgressions\u201d defies common sense. I therefore disagree that the state\u2019s attorney made a religiously charged argument when he stated that the defendant wanted the jury to believe that S was \u201cpure evil, Satan\u2019s daughter,\u201d and that the defendant was \u201cnot concerned about what God is going to do to him .... He\u2019s worried about what you people are going to do ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The majority insists that such references are fraught with religious implications, despite their common usage, but I would submit that not all religious references or arguments have a harmful effect when considered in context. In <em>Sandoval </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 847, 122 S. Ct. 112, 151 L. Ed. 2d 69 (2001), and cert. denied, 534 U.S. 943, 122 S. Ct. 322, 151 L. Ed. 2d 241 (2001), a habeas action, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals examined references to religion during closing arguments at the petitioner\u2019s underlying trial. In <em>Sandoval, </em>defense counsel stated the following during closing arguments: \u201c[I]n . . . thinking about how hard your job is, how difficult your job is, in reality you could sit, play God to an individual. . . . [The petitioner] has a chance for doing some good. Anything that you do. I don\u2019t think society requires revenge. I don\u2019t think that you require revenge. An eye for an eye.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 777 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The court noted that defense counsel's use of the phrase, \u201c \u2018play[ing] God,\u2019 \u201d and his reference to \u201can eye for an eye\u201d had occurred \u201cin the context of a secular argument against vengeance. Defense counsel did not invoke religious authority to support the result he advocated.\u201d Id., 777. Thus, the court determined that defense counsel\u2019s reference to \u201c[a]n eye for an eye\u201d was permissible in the context in which the reference was made. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The court in <em>Sandoval </em>viewed the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in a different light, however. In <em>Sandoval, </em>the prosecutor, in responding to defense counsel\u2019s argument, argued to the jury in relevant part: \u201c[Defense counsel] says don\u2019t play God. Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from God and those which are established by God. Therefore, he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and they who have opposed will receive condemnations upon themselves for rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise for the same for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid for it does not bear the sword for nothing for it is a minister of God an avenger who brings wrath upon one who practices evil.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 775 n.l. The court concluded that, although defense counsel\u2019s reference to \u201c lplay[ing] God\u2019 \u201d was not improper, the prosecutor\u2019s use of the same phrase in the course of a fully developed argument with a clear religious message \u201cwas not merely fair response to comments in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.\u201d Id., 777. In the present case, by contrast, the state\u2019s attorney did not make his religious references amid a fully developed argument imbued with strong religious implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The majority cites cases, almost all involving the imposition of the death penalty, in which courts in other jurisdictions have determined that the prosecutor made improper religious references. See part IB of the majority opinion. In each of those cases, however, the references were more numerous, developed or specific than the references in the present case.

I do not agree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that the references made by the state\u2019s attorney in the present case were similar in frequency, degree or specificity to those that were determined to be improper in the foregoing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The majority acknowledges that both the trial court and defense counsel took no action at trial in response to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s purportedly inflammatory remarks. The majority also observes that a defendant has the responsibility to object to perceived prosecu-torial improprieties when they occur, that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks in the present case was \u201cinexplicable,\u201d and that the inaction on the part of defense counsel suggests that he did not believe that the remarks were unfair or prejudicial when they were made. Part I G 3 of the majority opinion. I agree with those observations and, therefore, do not understand how the majority can conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks were \u201csufficiently egre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>gious to overcome the suggestion that defense counsel did not think it was unfair at the time.\u201d In my view, the failure of the court and defense counsel to raise any objection indicates exactly the opposite, namely, that the overall tone and inflection of the words when they were spoken, and their effect on the jurors, could not have been so inflammatory as to raise any eyebrows or to warrant a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">I believe that the invocation of a higher law urging the application of principles of various religious beliefs, in lieu of or in addition to our statutory and common law, as well as extensive quotations from religious sources, is almost always improper. I also believe that prosecutors should refrain from making any reference to religion unless it relates to a substantial issue in the case. Nevertheless, when a prosecutor makes reference to terms or phrases that originated in religious texts, but that, over time, have assumed a secular connotation, the court should conduct an analysis of the context, imagery and purpose of those terms or phrases. Reference to such terms or phrases can in certain instances be innocuous while in other instances rise to the level of misconduct. I conclude that the references in the present case were not improper, especially in view of the fact that the trial court failed to comment, and defense counsel failed to object, when the references were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment to the jury that S \u201cdid her part\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s now time for you to do your part\u201d was inappropriate under <em>State </em>v. Whipper, 258 Conn. 229, 780 A.2d 53 (2001). See part IC of the majority opinion. In <em>Whippet, </em>the state\u2019s attorney argued to the juiy: \u201cNow you\u2019re here as members of the community. You represent what your community is going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>be. Not me. I did my part. The police did their job . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 271 n.19. In <em>Whipper, </em>this court determined that the argument of the state\u2019s attorney suggested to jurors that they had a duty, as members of the community, to find the defendant guilty. Id., 271. The present case, however, is distinguishable. Unlike in <em>Whipper, </em>the state\u2019s attorney in the present case did not suggest that the jurors\u2019 failure to find the defendant guilty might taint the community, but, rather, that the jurors had a duty to decide the case, just as S had a duty to testify at trial. Moreover, defense counsel in <em>Whipper </em>immediately objected to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment whereas defense counsel in the present case did not. At best, the comment in the present case is a borderline example of prosecutorial misconduct. Nevertheless, such a comment does not provide a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Finally, I do not believe that the cumulative effect of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct in the present case deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial. The majority concludes that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s (1) inflammatory references to religion during closing arguments, (2) improper cross-examination of the defendant about the veracity of S and subsequent references to that improper cross-examination during closing arguments, and (3) request during summation that the members of the jury \u201cdo [their] part,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> constituted a pattern of misconduct that compromised the fundamental fairness of the trial. I conclude, to the contrary, that the religious references were made in a secular context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and, therefore, do not rise to the level of impermissible conduct. I also conclude that the cumulative effect of the other alleged improprieties, one of which I deem to be only borderline misconduct, if at all, does not require reversal pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The standard for reversal of a judgment on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct requires the defendant to \u201cestablish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 700, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). \u201c[I]t is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole.\u201d Id., 701. In the present case, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent reference to that testimony during rebuttal does not satisfy the required standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">I agree with the majority that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s attempt during cross-examination to question the defendant regarding S\u2019s veracity was not invited by defense counsel and that the state\u2019s attorney improperly referred to that questionable cross-examination testimony in his rebuttal argument when attacking the defendant\u2019s credibility. I would not characterize those violations as \u201cfrequent,\u201d however. The misconduct that had occurred during cross-examination of the defendant was limited to a single episode, as was the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>attorney\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination testimony during closing arguments. Regardless of whether those two events are considered related improprieties or separate occurrences, they reasonably cannot be deemed to be <em>frequent. </em>Nevertheless, such conduct is impermissible, and, accordingly, I would agree with the majority that the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney in that regard was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The majority next concludes that the trial court\u2019s curative instructions mitigated the prejudice stemming from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s accusation that the defendant was a \u201cliar,\u201d but did not mitigate the prejudice stemming from his remarks concerning the defendant\u2019s cross-examination testimony regarding S\u2019s veracity or the improper cross-examination itself. The majority accordingly concludes that the trial court\u2019s instructions were insufficient to cure the resulting prejudice stemming from the latter conduct. I disagree because I believe that the majority misconstrues the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument and the court\u2019s curative instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">A careful review of the transcript shows that the last portion of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s rebuttal argument was directed to the respective credibility of the defendant and S.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During his argument, the state\u2019s attorney dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>cussed: (1) the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>time he had consumed an alcoholic beverage; (2) the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had gone back to sleep after S\u2019s mother and her cousin\u2019s husband confronted the defendant and accused him of sexually assaulting S; (3) S\u2019s accusation that the defendant had assaulted her, remarks that were based on the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper cross-examination of the defendant; and (4) the respective motives of the defendant and S to he about the events that had transpired. All four points were made in support of a single contention, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that the credibility of the defendant was weaker than that of S. During the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s rebuttal argument, the word \u201clie,\u201d or a derivation thereof, was used eleven times in describing the defendant or S, but only to suggest that the defendant\u2019s testimony was untruthful because S had no motive to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Following closing arguments, defense counsel raised an objection with respect to the rebuttal argument of the state\u2019s attorney. Defense counsel stated: \u201c[0]n several occasions, [the state\u2019s attorney] called [the defendant] a liar. He lied to you, he\u2019s a liar, and ... I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s proper argument, and I think there are cases that have indicated . . . that it\u2019s not proper to refer to a witness as a liar. So, I take exception to that. I ask the court to give some instruction along the lines, either an admonition or some comment to the jury, that that\u2019s not proper comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In response to counsel\u2019s objection, the court, prior to delivering its general instiuctions to the jury, instructed the jury: \u201c[T]he term \u2018liar\u2019 was used during a portion of the state\u2019s [attorney\u2019s] rebuttal argument. Obviously, the credibility of all the witnesses is in your hands and you should consider all of the testimony and evidence about that in assessing credibility, but the use of the term \u2018liar\u2019 should be avoided in court and you should disregard that term that was addressed in the arguments ... of the [state\u2019s attorney] in his rebuttal.\u201d Defense counsel raised no objection to the special instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In its general instructions to the jury, the court advised the jurors of their duty to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Thereafter, the court delivered a more detailed instruction in which it advised the jurors at least five different times of their duty to determine the credibility of the witnesses, the factors to be considered in determining whether a witness has testified truthfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>and the importance of bringing the jurors\u2019 own personal experience to bear on such a determination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">I therefore submit that, although the state\u2019s attorney used the word \u201cliar\u201d only in connection with the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding drinking, the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>trial court\u2019s curative instruction was to mitigate the prejudice stemming from the multiple references to lying that were made in his <em>single </em>argument regarding the relative credibility of the defendant and S. The majority\u2019s conclusion that the instruction mitigated the prejudicial effect of only one portion of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument parses the instruction to such an extent that the forest cannot be seen for the trees. I also would submit that, to the extent that any doubt remains, the combination of the trial court\u2019s special instruction and the detailed and extensive instructions on witness credibility in general was more than sufficient to mitigate the prejudicial effect of the references of the state\u2019s attorney to lying in his rebuttal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">I also believe that the curative effect of the instruction extended to the improper cross-examination inasmuch as the state\u2019s attorney included in his rebuttal argument a nearly verbatim account of the disputed portion of the proceedings. See footnotes 26 and 27 of the majority opinion. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s curative instructions regarding credibility mitigated or, perhaps, eliminated any prejudice to the defendant arising from the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney, especially in light of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">With respect to the comment of the state\u2019s attorney regarding the duty of the jury, the court specifically instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the evidence is limited to the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits, and that arguments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>counsel are not evidence. In my view, those instructions were sufficient to cure any prejudice that may have resulted from such borderline misconduct. It therefore is unnecessary to consider the final two <em>Williams </em>factors, the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case, and the strength of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Because I believe that the trial as a whole was not fundamentally unfair, I conclude that reversal is unwarranted.

Now, according to the defendant, he told [S\u2019s mother], well, go get the child checked out by the doctor. Go get the child checked out by the doctor? You\u2019ve just been accused of sexually abusing a seven year old female. Go get the child checked out by a doctor, and then what do you do? Go back to sleep? That\u2019s what he said.

It is for you alone to determine their credibility. </em>Whether or not you find a fact proven is not to be determined by the number of witnesses testifying for or against it.

Nor is it necessarily so that because a witness testifies to a fact and no one contradicts it, you are bound to accept that fact as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u201cThe credibility of the witness and the truth of the fact <em>is for you to determine. </em>In weighing the testimony of witnesses, you should consider the probability or improbability of their testimony. You should consider their appearance, conduct and demeanor while testifying and in court, and any interest, bias, prejudice, sympathy, which a witness may apparently have for or against the state or the accused, or in the outcome of the trial. With each witness you should consider his or her ability to observe facts correctly, recall them and relate them to you truly and accurately. You should consider whether and to what extent witnesses needed their memories refreshed while testifying. You should, in short, size up the witnesses and <em>make your own judgment </em>as to their credibility, and decide what portion, all, some, or none of any particular witness\u2019 testimony you will believe based on these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u201cYou should harmonize the evidence as far as it can reasonably be done. You should use all your experience, your knowledge of human nature, and the motives that influence and control human conduct, and you should test the evidence against that knowledge.

The significance you attach to it may vary more or less with the particular fact as to which the inaccuracy existed or with the surrounding circumstances. You should bear in mind that people sometimes forget things.
