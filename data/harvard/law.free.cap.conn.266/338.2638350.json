The plaintiff, Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC, appeals from two judgments of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs appeals from two coastal site plan reviews conducted by the defendant, the planning and zoning commission of the city of New London (commission), pursuant to the Coastal Management Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 22a-90 et seq. The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly dismissed its appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that: (1) the commission\u2019s decision on a coastal site plan review performed in conjunction with a referral under General Statutes \u00a7 8-24<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is an appealable final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>decision; and (2) the plaintiff, which intervened in the administrative proceedings before the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> can appeal a coastal site plan review performed in conjunction with a report pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 because of the plaintiffs status as an intervenor under \u00a7 22a-19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the coastal site plan reviews conducted by the commission under the act were integral parts of the reports issued by the commission pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 and therefore are not subject to appeal. We further conclude that the plaintiff could not bring the appeals based solely on its status as an intervenor under \u00a7 22a-19. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the appeals before us. The city of New London (city), through an implementing agency, the New Lon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>don Development Corporation (development corporation), established a municipal development plan for the Fort Trumbull area of the city. The Fort Trumbull area is a ninety acre peninsula in the southeast region of New London bordering the Thames River. Historically, it has supported residential, commercial and industrial uses. The city formulated a municipal development plan that envisioned water enhanced and water dependent uses designed to revitalize the local economy while retaining the neighborhood\u2019s historic character. Specifically, the municipal development plan contemplated a series of office, hotel, residential and recreational facilities. This development effort included a number of municipal improvements, including the two that give rise to the present appeals. The facts specific to each of the two appeals presently before us follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On or about July 25, 2001, the development coiporation, on behalf of the city council, referred a proposal for the municipal construction of certain roads and infrastructure improvements for the Fort Trumbull area to the commission for the issuance of a report pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. Because the site of the proposed infrastructure project was within the \u201ccoastal area,\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-94,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the development corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tion also submitted a coastal site plan application<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for a coastal site plan review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-105 (b) (5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Both the coastal site plan application and the referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 were discussed at several of the commission\u2019s meetings, in which the public was invited to participate. The plaintiff, a limited liability corporation composed of residents, homeowners and taxpayers who reside in the Fort Trumbull area of the city, intervened in the commission\u2019s proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19. Following a special meeting on September 25, 2001, a two part motion was made by the commission\u2019s vice-chairman to approve the referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 and to approve the coastal site plan review pursuant to \u00a7 22a-105 (b) (5). On a single vote, the motion was approved by a vote of five to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. Thereafter, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>granted the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a report issued pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 because the report is not a final decision from which an appeal can be taken. The trial court further concluded that the plaintiff could not appeal from the coastal site plan approval because it also was approved pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 and therefore was unap-pealable. Additionally, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs status as an intervenor pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 did not provide the plaintiff with a right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The facts of the second appeal before us are similar. In August, 2001, the development corporation, on behalf of the city council, referred a proposal for the municipal construction of a riverwalk, a 1500 foot paved walkway running along the Thames River in the Fort Trumbull area, to the commission for the issuance of a report pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. In September, 2001, the development corporation filed an application for a coastal site plan review with the commission because the site of the riverwalk was within the coastal area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 and the coastal site plan application were discussed at several subsequent commission meetings. As with the infrastructure appeal, the plaintiff intervened in the commission\u2019s proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19. On November 29, 2001, a single motion was made to approve the coastal site plan and the referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. The motion was approved by a unanimous vote of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. The trial court granted the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, adopting the same rationale as set forth in its memorandum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>decision on the motion to dismiss the infrastructure appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Subsequently, the plaintiff appealed from the judgments of dismissal in both the infrastructure appeal and the riverwalk appeal to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly dismissed both of the plaintiffs appeals from the coastal site plan reviews for the Fort Trumbull area on the basis that the reviews were part and parcel of the reports issued pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. The plaintiff contends that its appeals should not have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because coastal site plan reviews result in final decisions that can be appealed despite having been conducted in conjunction with reports issued pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. The plaintiff concedes that there is no right of appeal from reports issued with regard to \u00a7 8-24 submissions. The plaintiff claims that a referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 and a coastal site plan review are two distinct inquiries, which must be considered separately, and that the coastal site plan review can be challenged separately.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commission responds that the trial court correctly decided that the coastal site plan reviews and the \u00a7 8-24 submissions are merely two parts of the same overall inquiry. We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our examination of these issues. The plaintiffs claim presents a question of statutory interpretation \u201cover which our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Waterbury v. Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 547, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>[231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994)]. In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>[258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001)]. Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">We always begin our analysis with the language of the relevant statutes. The plaintiff claims that a coastal site plan review, pursuant to the act, is separate and distinct from a review performed by the commission pursuant to \u00a7 8-24. Thus, we consider the text of both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Before analyzing \u00a7 8-24, we note that General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that, \u201c[a]ny city, town or borough which adopts the provisions of this chapter-may, by vote of its legislative body, exempt municipal property from the regulations prescribed by the zoning commission of such city, town or borough; but unless it is so voted municipal property shall be subject to such regulations.\u201d The city, acting pursuant to \u00a7 8-2 (a), has exempted city property from the applicability of its zoning regulations by adopting a regulation that provides that the \u201cZoning Regulation[s] shall not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>municipal property owned or leased by the [c]ity . . . for public purposes . . . except that municipal building and site development plans shall be approved by the [commission] in accordance with Chapter 126, Section 8-24 of the Connecticut General Statutes . . . New London Zoning Regs., art. I, \u00a7 120.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Section 8-24<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[n]o municipal agency or legislative body shall\u201d make municipal improvements \u201cuntil the proposal to take such action has been referred to the commission for a report\u201d approving or disapproving of the proposal. In the event of a report disapproving the proposal, the municipality nevertheless may proceed with the improvements on \u201csubsequent approval of the proposal by (A) a two-thirds vote of the town council where one exists, or a majority vote of those present and voting in an annual or special town meeting, or (B) a two-thirds vote of the representative town meeting or city council or the warden and burgesses, as the case may be.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-24. The report issued by the commission therefore has no binding effect on the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We next address the language of the act, which was intended to \u201cinsure that the development, preservation or use of the land and water resources of the coastal area proceeds in a manner consistent with the capability of the land and water resources to support development, preservation or use without significantly disrupting either the natural environment or sound economic growth . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-92 (a) (1). In the legislative findings provision of the act, the General Assembly noted that, \u201c[t]he key to improved public management of Connecticut\u2019s coastal area is coordination at all levels of government and consideration by municipalities of the impact of development on both coastal resources and future water-dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>development opportunities when preparing plans and regulations and reviewing municipal and private development proposals . . . General Statutes \u00a7 22a-91 (6).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn order to carry out the policies and provisions of this [coastal management] chapter and to provide more specific guidance to coastal area property owners and developers, coastal municipalities may adopt a municipal coastal program for the area within the coastal boundary and landward of the mean high water mark.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-101 (a). In addition, \u201c[c]oastal municipalities shall undertake coastal site plan reviews in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-105 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>A significant key to understanding the act is to determine what triggers a coastal site plan review. The answer is found in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-105, which provides, in subsection (a), that \u201c[c]oastal municipalities shall undertake coastal site plan reviews in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.\u201d Section 22a-105 (b) provides: \u201cThe following site plans, plans and applications for activities or projects to be located fully or partially within the coastal boundary and landward of the mean high water mark shall be defined as \u2018coastal site plans\u2019 and shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter: (1) Site plans submitted to a zoning commission in accordance with section 22a-109; (2) plans submitted to a planning commission for subdivision or resubdivision in accordance with section 8-25 or with any special act; (3) applications for a special exception or special permit submitted to a planning commission, zoning commission or zoning board of appeals in accordance with section 8-2 or with any special act; (4) applications for a variance submitted to a zoning board of appeals in accordance with subdivision (3) of section 8-6 or with any special act, and (5) <em>a referral of a proposed municipal project to a planning commission in accordance with section 8-24 or with any special act. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) From the language of \u00a7 22a-105 (b), it is clear that a referral under \u00a7 8-24 for a municipal project located within the coastal boundary is a coastal site plan that must be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of the act. This conclusion is confirmed by reference to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-93 (13), which defines coastal site plans as \u201cthe site plans, applications <em>and project referrals listed in section 22a-105 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The question we next must resolve is whether the coastal site plan review conducted by the commission in conjunction with a \u00a7 8-24 referral is simply part of the \u00a7 8-24 referral or whether, as the plaintiff contends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>it is an independent matter. Although the language of each of the various sections of the act is not conclusive, we conclude that the text of the various sections, taken together, strongly suggests that a coastal site plan review was intended to be part and parcel of the planning or zoning application or referral that triggers the coastal site plan review, including a referral under \u00a7 8-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">We begin with the definition of coastal site plan contained in \u00a7 22a-105 (b), and referenced in \u00a7 22a-93 (13), which provides specifically that a referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24, when located within the coastal area, \u201cshall be defined\u201d as a coastal site plan. See footnote 6 of this opinion. This language evinces an intent to incorporate coastal site review into the existing planning or zoning procedures for reviewing applications and referrals. If the legislature had intended that each of the applications and referrals listed in \u00a7 22a-105 (b) trigger a separate coastal site plan review, it would not have included within the definition of coastal site plan each of the types of planning or zoning applications and referrals listed in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-105 (b) and 22a-93 (13). Moreover, if the legislature\u2019s intent had been to require a separate coastal site plan review, it likely would have incoxpo-rated into the act specific provisions tailored to site plan approval similar to those found in General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which governs site plan review generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Moreover, \u00a7 22a-105 (b) (4)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provides further insight into the proper interpretation of the act. Section 22a-105 (b) (4) lists as a coastal site plan an application for a variance to a zoning board of appeals. A zoning board of appeals, however, has only those powers authorized under General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those powers do not include the authority to review a site plan. A zoning board of appeals therefore does not have the authority to conduct site plan review, beyond the process of ruling on a variance. The legislature is presumed to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>with knowledge of existing statutes and with the intent to create one consistent body of laws. <em>St. George </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>264 Conn. 538, 553, 825 A.2d 90 (2003). The legislature therefore intended the coastal site plan review to be part of the planning or zoning application or \u00a7 8-24 referral and not a separate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Further evidence that the legislature did not intend a separate site plan review of coastal site plans is found in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-109 (a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which negates the applicability of \u00a7 8-3 (g) to coastal site plan applications. Section 22a-109 (a) provides in part that \u201c[r]eview of a coastal site plan under the requirements of this section shall supersede any review required by the municipality under subsection (g) of section 8-3 ... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The legislative history of the act provides additional support for our interpretation. The lengthy legislative history attendant to the passage of the act demonstrates that the General Assembly\u2019s intent was that coastal site plan review be concluded concomitantly with the commission\u2019s review of the various planning or zoning applications listed in \u00a7 22a-105 (b), including \u00a7 8-24 referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">A brief overview of the history of the act informs our understanding of the legislative history. The act was enacted in two phases. In 1978, the General Assembly passed No. 78-152 of the 1978 Public Acts (P.A. 78-152), which created a skeleton statewide coastal management program and authorized further research and future legislation to incorporate municipal governance. Following the mandate of P.A. 78-152, numerous public hearings were held, many commission reports were circulated and various legislation was drafted. Ultimately, this process resulted in the adoption of No. 79-535 of the 1979 Public Acts, which codified the act\u2019s balance of authority for coastal management between the state and municipal governments. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-90 through 22a-113c.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The legislative history of the act in 1979 unequivocally reveals a deliberate effort to weave coastal site plan review into existing planning and zoning procedures. See 22 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1979 Sess., pp. 5143-62. One comment in particular from the Senate floor is illustrative. Senator Frederick Knous, a proponent of the legislation underlying Public Act 79-535, succinctly summarized its purpose with the following statement: \u201c[T]his proposal allows municipalities the authority, <em>through their existing planning and zoning </em>to evaluate impacts of developments on their coastal resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>through the site plan review. And <em>this review is designed to be compatible with existing planning and zoning </em>procedures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 5161.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">This intent to integrate coastal site plan review into the existing planning and zoning system is evident in committee reports underlying the act. Of particular note is a planning report prepared by the department of environmental protection. See Coastal Area Management Program, \u201cReport to the Legislature\u2019s Committee on Coastal Management\u201d (Dept, of Environmental Protection, September 1, 1978).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This report articulates a six step analysis incoiporating coastal site plan review with existing municipal regulations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., pp. 25-28. First and foremost, the report emphasizes that \u201c[t]he review is . . . designed to be <em>compl[e]mentary to and compatible with existing planning and zoning proce</em>dures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 25. Specifically, the review is \u201cdesigned to be <em>implemented by local planning and zoning commissions in the no'rmal process of evaluating </em>. . . activities only when they occur within the coastal boundary . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Under this six step analysis, the applicant initiates the process as normally required under existing planning and zoning procedures. Id., p. 26. The local planning and zoning commission then reviews the proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>solely on the basis of the standard, municipal planning and zoning regulations. Id., p. 27. After this phase, the local planning and zoning commission makes a threshold determination of whether there exists sufficient potential for coastal impact to necessitate a comprehensive review. If a significant coastal impact is found, an assessment of the effects should be considered more fully in a thorough coastal site plan review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id. Next, the local planning and zoning commission analyzes the project as a whole; id.; and ultimately issues a decision \u201con the basis of standard planning and zoning requirements <em>and the coastal site plan review as applicable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The practical application of this framework is graphically depicted in a series of flow charts contained in the same report. Id., pp. 29-30. One chart entitled, \u201cBuilding Permits Subject to Zoning Regulations,\u201d illustrates the then current, as of 1978, procedure for obtaining a building permit for projects outside the coastal boundary and demonstrates the proposed procedure for obtaining a permit for areas within the coastal boundary under the act. Id., p. 29, fig. 1. Another chart entitled, \u201cMunicipal Improvements,\u201d illustrates the then current procedure for obtaining approval of a municipal improvement pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 as well as the proposed procedure for municipal improvements within the coastal zone under the act. Id., p. 31, fig. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Of particular relevance to our interpretation of the act are the differences in the flow charts for municipal improvements as indicated in figure three, as com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>pared to applications by private applicants for properties in the coastal zone as indicated in figure one. See id., pp. 29, 31. Specifically, under the procedure proposed by the coastal area management program, when a private applicant seeks a building permit, figure one depicts the standard review for a building permit conducted by the local planning and zoning commission, followed by a coastal site plan review, resulting in one \u201cregulatory decision.\u201d See id., p. 29, fig. 1. When a municipality proposes making an improvement, the initial consideration is analogous. Figure three begins with a referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24, the standard for municipal improvements, followed by a coastal site plan review. The critical distinction is the next step; these reviews do not culminate in a \u201cregulatory decision.\u201d Instead, the chart branches into two options, approval or rejection of the municipal proposal by the local planning and zoning commission. If that commission issues a report rejecting the proposal, the chart shows the proposal going on to the town or city council, which can override the report by a two-thirds majority. See id., p. 31, fig. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The distinction is clear. Nonmunicipal project applications, such as those for building permits, result in regulatory decisions, which generally are appealable pursuant to \u00a7 8-8.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The result is the same regardless of whether a coastal site plan review is required. Similarly, because a report issued pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>result in a regulatory decision, the addition of a coastal site plan review does not alter the result. After conducting both zoning review and coastal site plan review, the local planning and zoning commission approves or disapproves the proposed municipal project. In both instances\u2014building permit and \u00a7 8-24 referral\u2014the result is the same; coastal site plan review becomes another component in the otherwise applicable planning or zoning process. Coastal site plan review does not result in a separate approval or decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Moreover, an opinion letter from the attorney general bolsters this point. See <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>250 Conn. 536, 545, 738 A.2d 604 (1999). In response to several questions by Stanley J. Pac, then commissioner of environmental protection, concerning interpretation of the act, the attorney general responded that, \u201c[i]t is our opinion that any time any site plans, plans and applications are submitted for any or all of the five situations listed in \u00a7 22a-105 (b) for activities within the coastal boundary, <em>they shall become coastal site plans, </em>and must be appropriately reviewed under \u00a7\u00a7 22a-105 (a) and 22a-106.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 85-82 (December 11, 1985). The use of the word \u201cbecome\u201d in reference to the relationship between the situations enumerated in \u00a7 22a-105 (b) and a coastal site plan suggests inclusion of the coastal site plan within existing procedures. When a referral pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 \u201cbecomes\u201d a coastal site plan, the result is a single inquiry under the aegis of \u00a7 8-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We therefore conclude that a coastal site plan review under the act is to be conducted as part of the planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>and zoning applications or as part of a \u00a7 8-24 referral as listed in \u00a7 22a-105 (b), and not as a separate application or proceeding. We note that our conclusion is consistent with dicta from two prior decisions of this court. \u201cThe act envisages a single review process, during which proposals for development within the coastal boundary will simultaneously be reviewed for compliance with local zoning requirements and for consistency with the policies of planned coastal management.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187, 196, 635 A.2d 1220 (1994); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 358, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). In the present cases, therefore, the commission\u2019s review of the coastal site plans properly was conducted as part of the \u00a7 8-24 submissions and not as a separate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The plaintiff correctly concedes that a report issued by a planning and zoning commission pursuant to a \u00a7 8-24 referral is purely advisory and is not appealable. This court previously has held that, although \u00a7 8-8 authorizes an appeal to a court from the actions of a planning and zoning commission, this right is limited to appeals of final decisions. <em>Sheridan v. Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 10, 266 A.2d 396 (1969). In particular, we have stated that no appeal exists where a planning and zoning commission issues a decision that is merely preliminary and not binding without further action by a municipal agency. <em>East Side Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 558, 561-62, 290 A.2d 348 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The commission\u2019s approval in the present cases of both municipal proposals pursuant to \u00a7 8-24, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>included coastal site plan reviews, were merely non-bonding recommendations to the city council. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly granted the commission\u2019s motions to dismiss on the basis that the commission\u2019s decisions on the \u00a7 8-24 submissions, which included coastal site pl\u00e1n reviews, were not appealable final decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The plaintiffs second claim is that, having intervened under \u00a7 22a-19, it was entitled to appeal from the commission\u2019s report pursuant to \u00a7 8-24 because of its status as an intervenor under \u00a7 22a-19. The plaintiff argues that the trial court acted improperly in concluding that no right to appeal was created by its intervenor status. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This issue presents a question of statutory construction. We previously have recited the applicable standard for statutory interpretation in part I of this opinion, and we therefore begin our plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Section 22a-19 (a), which is part of our Environmental Protection Act, provides that \u201c[i]n any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law, the Attorney General, any political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of a political subdivision thereof, any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\u201d Although \u00a7 22a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>19 (a) on its face is extremely broad regarding the parties who may intervene, the types of matters into which they can intervene, and the scope of the environmental issues that they may raise, it is silent as to the right of an intervenor to bring an appeal in a matter that is not otherwise appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u201cWe . . . note the rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of common law should receive a strict construction and [should not] be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>246 Conn. 223, 231, 717 A.2d 202 (1998). \u201cIn determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vitanza </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>257 Conn. 365, 381, 778 A.2d 829 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In providing broad rights of intervention to raise environmental issues, \u00a7 22a-19 is clearly in derogation of the common law relating to intervention. We therefore must construe \u00a7 22a-19 strictly. A review of the text of \u00a7 22a-19, as well as other sections of the Environmental Protection Act, reveals no language that even arguably suggests that the legislature intended to give environmental intervenors under \u00a7 22a-19 the right to appeal from administrative matters that are not otherwise appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The plaintiff relies on <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 506, for the proposition that its interve-nor status confers a right to appeal. This reliance is misplaced. <em>Waterbury </em>concerned the interplay between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 22a-18.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See id., 539-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>46. Specifically, we concluded in <em>Waterbury </em>that \u00a7 22a-16, which authorizes an independent action to challenge environmental issues, contains no exhaustion requirement. Id., 545. The appeals in the present case are distinguishable in that they involve intervention under \u00a7 22a-19 and not a separate action under \u00a7 22a-16. <em>Waterbury </em>is therefore inapposite. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff had no right to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 from the coastal site plan reviews conducted by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In this opinion NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-24 provides: \u201cNo municipal agency or legislative body shall (1) locate, accept, abandon, widen, narrow or extend any street, bridge, parkway or other public way, (2) locate, relocate, substantially improve, acquire land for, abandon, sell or lease any airport, park, playground, school or other municipally owned property or public building, (3) locate or extend any public housing, development, redevelopment or urban renewal project, or (4) locate or extend public utilities and terminals for water, sewerage, light, power, transit and other purposes, until the proposal to take such action has been referred to the commission for a report.
