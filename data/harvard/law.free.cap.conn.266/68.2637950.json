The defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claim that the trial court improperly: (1) construed the collective bargaining agreements as providing the plaintiffs with a vested lifetime right to the specific medical benefits they had at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement; (2) concluded that No. 01-1 of the 2001 Special Acts (S.A. 01-1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>authorize the defendant oversight board; see footnote 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>of this opinion; to modify the plan; and (3) granted permanent injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement of the specific medical benefits in light of the city\u2019s financial crisis. We conclude that, although the plaintiffs have a vested right to medical benefits generally, they do not have a vested right to the specific benefits prescribed in the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. For some time prior to 1986, the city provided medical benefits to retired city firefighters, but those benefits were not included expressly in the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreements. Beginning in 1986, the city and the Waterbury Fire Fighters Association, Local 1339 (union), a labor union in which each of the retirees was a member until his retirement, negotiated a series of collective bargaining agreements, each of which included a provision for retirees\u2019 medical benefits, effective: July 1, 1986, through June 30, 1989 (1986 agreement); July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1992 (1989 agreement); July 1, 1992, through June 30, 1995 (1992 agreement); and July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1999 (1995 agreement).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1986 agreement provided, in article XXXIII, \u00a7 16, that the city \u201cshall continue in full force and effect the benefits for each retiree and each employee who retires or dies after July 1, 1986, his spouse, and each eligible dependent of such retiree or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>employee . . . .\u201d The provision thereafter set forth the scope of the benefits, a basic plan supplemented by various home and office, major medical and prescription drug riders (indemnity plan),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which was to be provided \u201cat no cost to those eligible\u201d pursuant to article XXXIII, \u00a7 16a, of the agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The 1989,1992 and 1995 agreements provided similar indemnity plans, but referred only to providing such benefits to employees who retired after the execution of the agreement, and not to those employees who already had retired. The 1995 agreement imposed two additional terms: (1) \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII provided that the prescribed \u201cmedical benefits for retirees . . . may be substituted for similar\u2014but in no event, less\u2014medical benefits if the City and the Coalition of City Unions agree on a modified insurance plan for City employees\u201d; and (2) \u00a7 17 of that article mandated participation in medicare for retirees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>who had attained the age of sixty-five, had received medical benefits under the agreement and were eligible for medicare, with the city providing supplemental insurance. At the expiration of the 1995 agreement in June of 1999, the city and the union had not yet agreed on terms for a successor agreement. After negotiations failed to result in a consensus, the matter was submitted for binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">During the course of the negotiations between the city and the union, the state legislature determined that it had to take certain action because, as a result of many years of gross fiscal mismanagement, the city was in a state of financial crisis. See S.A. 01-1, \u00a7 1. Specifically, the city had underfunded its pensions for years and was paying its pension liabilities out of the city\u2019s general fund. In addition, the city had been paying health care benefits, the cost of which were rapidly rising, out of the city\u2019s general fund. As a result of these and other liabilities, the city\u2019s bond rating had been downgraded. The crisis threatened not only the city, but also the fiscal reputation of the state, which acts essentially as guarantor of certain of the city\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">To address the crisis, the legislature enacted S.A. 01-1, effective upon its passage on March 9, 2001. See footnote 4 of this opinion. In accordance with the special act, the city was required to undertake certain fiscal and management controls. As a further measure, the legislature created the oversight board to ensure that order was restored to the city\u2019s finances. S.A. 01-1, \u00a7\u00a710 and 11. The special act confers broad authority on the oversight board to take the necessary measures to accomplish this goal. S.A. 01-1, \u00a7 11. The oversight board\u2019s authority encompasses, inter alia, the power to set aside city contracts, under certain circumstances, and to serve as the arbitration panel with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>labor contracts subject to binding arbitration. S.A. 01-1, \u00a7 11 (a) (5) and (b) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Pursuant to its authority, the oversight board acted as the arbitrator in the collective bargaining dispute between the city and the union. On December 14, 2001, the oversight board issued an arbitration award prescribing the city\u2019s obligations, effective retroactively from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2004 (1999 agreement). Article XXXIII, \u00a7 16, of the 1999 agreement set forth the following terms regarding medical benefits: \u201cThose employees who are participating in the City\u2019s medical insurance plan at the time of retirement . . . shall be eligible to participate in such medical insurance plan which the City provides to its active bargaining unit employees, as such plans may change pursuant to any successor collective bargaining agreement, subject to the same conditions as may exist at any time for such active employees.\u201d Under the 1999 agreement, active employees, and therefore retirees, received medical benefits pursuant to a managed care plan with a preferred provider organization, rather than the traditional indemnity plan provided under previous agreements. Additional changes under the 1999 agreement included, inter alia, a requirement of a small copayment for office and home visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">On March 14, 2002, the plaintiffs filed in the Superior Court an application for prejudgment remedy, seeking temporarily to enjoin the defendants from altering the plaintiffs\u2019 existing medical benefits. The plaintiffs also filed the complaint in this action, seeking temporary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as damages, and alleging that the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted: (1) a breach of contract; (2) an ultra vires act; (3) a taking under the state and federal constitutions; and (4) an impairment of contract rights in violation of the federal constitution. Thereafter, the parties stipulated that the temporary injunction hearing also would serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>as the hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for permanent injunctive relief. At hearings on the matter, the court heard testimony from various city officials and several of the plaintiffs as to the city\u2019s prior practices with respect to the provision of specific medical benefits to retirees. The court also heard testimony from city officials regarding the city\u2019s financial crisis and the various measures the city had taken as a result, which affected the plaintiffs, other city employees and city residents generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On August 14, 2002, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision, concluding that the defendants had breached the plaintiffs\u2019 vested contractual right to the specific indemnity plan provided under the pre-1999 collective bargaining agreements. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court first examined the factual context in which the issues arose. It recognized the magnitude of the financial crisis facing the city and noted the oversight board\u2019s estimate of $2 million in savings resulting from the conversion of all of the city\u2019s retired employees to managed health care plans. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he failure of the city to bring prudent cost controls to retiree health benefits will create serious difficulties for the city in enacting the types of conservative budgets mandated by [S.A.] 01-1.\u201d The court then noted certain differences in cost and availability of services and service providers between the managed care plan provided under the 1999 agreement and the indemnity plan provided under the pre-1999 agreements. The court concluded that, \u201c[although] a managed health care plan is inherently less flexible than a traditional indemnity plan, it is by no means certain from the evidence that a given beneficiary will always fare worse under the new health care plan . . . .\u201d Nonetheless, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs here have succeeded in showing that there are significant differences between the traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>indemnity plans currently provided to them and the proposed managed care plan. The court cannot conclude that the differences are trivial, even though the plaintiffs have not shown that over their life expectancy they will suffer a specific quantifiable loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The court next turned to the legal issues. It first determined that the question of whether the plaintiffs have a vested right to the specific medical benefits was governed by ordinary contract principles. Applying those principles, the court pointed to certain language in the pre-1999 agreements providing that the city \u201c \u2018shall continue in full force and effect the benefits for each employee who retires or dies on or after the execution of this agreement.\u2019 \u201d The court noted competing interpretations by the parties as to the meaning of that phrase, and then turned to examine certain extrinsic evidence, specifically, testimony related to the city\u2019s prior practice of continuing benefits for retirees beyond the expiration of the agreements. The court concluded that, \u201c[t]he way the city and the current and former union membership jointly interpreted the provisions of these contracts for almost two decades clearly indicates the intent of the parties to create a vested right to the health benefits that each firefighter elected on retirement.\u201d The court rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that S.A. 01-1 empowered the oversight board to modify vested rights obtained under collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 remedies, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that injunctive relief was appropriate. The court further concluded that it was unclear whether any plaintiff yet had suffered a monetary loss and noted that it retained jurisdiction over the issue of damages should future damages be incurred. In light of its conclusion on the vesting issue, the trial court did not reach the other claims asserted by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>issued an order enjoining the defendants from taking any action to terminate involuntarily any plaintiffs\u2019 indemnity plan benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Thereafter, the parties submitted motions to correct the court\u2019s August 14, 2002 memorandum of decision. Specifically, they contended, inter alia, that the court\u2019s findings and order presupposed that the defendants had not yet converted the plaintiffs to the new health care plan, when the conversion had in fact been completed on or about April 1, 2002. The trial court issued a corrected memorandum of decision to amend the incorrect findings of fact and to order that the defendants \u201ctake all necessary steps to reinstate each plaintiff to the health care plan in which each plaintiff was enrolled prior to the involuntary conversion to the managed health care plan on or about April 1, 2002, unless the plaintiff requests not to be so reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The defendants also submitted an application for a stay of the permanent injunction, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, the defendants filed with this court a motion for an emergency temporary stay and a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s denial of its application for a stay of the permanent injunction. This court granted both motions and the relief requested therein. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The defendants raise three claims on appeal. First, they contend that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs had a vested right to the specific medical benefits in effect under the collective bargaining agreement at the time the retirees retired. Second, they contend that the trial court improperly determined that the legislature did not empower the oversight board, pursuant to S.A. 01-1, to modify the plan. Third, they contend that the court improperly awarded injunctive relief when a less drastic remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>was available that would both protect the plaintiffs\u2019 interests and effectuate the city\u2019s financial recovery goals. We agree with the defendants\u2019 first claim and therefore do not reach the latter two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The issue of whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs had a vested right to the specific medical benefits under the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement requires us to resolve two questions. The first question is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 right to benefits survived the termination of the collective bargaining agreements and thereby vested. Should we answer that question in the negative, we need go no further. Should we answer that question in the affirmative, however, the second question we must answer is wh\u00e9ther that vested right encompasses the specific benefit plan prescribed in the agreements, thereby precluding the defendants from changing the plaintiffs\u2019 coverage to the new managed care plan. In other words, the first question goes to the duration of the plaintiffs\u2019 right and the second question goes to the scope of that right.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 right survived the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements. We further conclude, however, that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs had a vested right to the specific plan in effect at the time they retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We begin with the question of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 right to benefits survived the termination of the collective bargaining agreements. It is well settled law that contractual obligations will not, in the ordinary course, survive beyond the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Litton Financial Printing Division </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>501 U.S. 190, 207, 111 S. Ct. 2215, 115 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1991); <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union </em>v. <em>Gold Star Sausage Co., </em>897 F.2d 1022, 1026 (10th Cir. 1990).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is also well settled, however, that \u201c[ejxceptions [to that rule] are determined by contract interpretation. Rights which accrued or vested under the agreement will, as a general rule, survive termination of the agreement.\u201d <em>Litton Financial Printing Division </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>supra, 207; accord <em>Bidlack </em>v. <em>Wheelabrator Corp., </em>993 F.2d 603, 606 (7th Cir.) (plurality), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 909, 114 S. Ct. 291, 126 L. Ed. 2d 240 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">A preliminaiy question raised by the parties in the present case is whether, in order to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>agreements to determine whether the right to benefits survived the agreements\u2019 termination, a particular legal presumption should be imposed, either against vesting or in favor of vesting. This question has been the subject of extensive debate, both in the courts and in academia. See generally C. Fisk, \u201cLochner Redux: The Renaissance of Laissez-Faire Contract in the Federal Common Law of Employee Benefits,\u201d 56 Ohio St. L.J. 153 (1995); D. Weckstein, \u201cThe Problematic Provision and Protection of Health and Welfare Benefits for Retirees,\u201d 24 San Diego L. Rev. 101 (1987); D. Sondgeroth, note, \u201cHigh Hopes: Why Courts Should Fulfill Expectations of Lifetime Retiree Health Benefits in Ambiguous Collective Bargaining Agreements,\u201d 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1215 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendants contend that, pursuant to our decisions in <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 415, 488 A.2d 803 (1985), and <em>Fennell </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>238 Conn. 809, 816, 681 A.2d 934 (1996), as well as case law from other jurisdictions, we should impose a presumption against vesting in the absence of unambiguous express vesting language. Conversely, the plaintiffs urge us to reject such a presumption and to rely on case law imposing a presumption in favor of vesting. This issue raises a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. <em>DeLeo </em>v. <em>Nusbaum, </em>263 Conn. 588, 593, 821 A.2d 744 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Connecticut cases cited by the defendants are inapposite. In <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 406, the issue was whether state employees had a vested, contractual right to benefits under the State Employees Retirement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 5-152 et seq. Our decision therein resolving that question in the negative was predicated on the absence of express language in that act evincing an intent to create a contract. Id., 416; accord <em>Cece </em>v. <em>Felix Industries, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 457, 465, 728 A.2d 505 (1999). In the present case, there is no question that the collective bargaining agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>at issue are contracts. Moreover, although our decision in <em>Pineman </em>recognized that such contractual obligations should not be construed lightly because of their binding effect on future legislatures, we also recognized two other issues relevant to the present case: (1) that retirement benefits are not mere gratuities; and (2) that employees have enforceable rights once they satisfy the eligibility criteria under the State Employees Retirement Act. <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>supra, 416-17. In <em>Fennell v. Hartford, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 816-17, we concluded that a pension manual created and distributed by the defendant city pension commission was not an implied contract because the pension commission did not have the authority to confer benefits not provided for by the city\u2019s charter. By contrast, there is no doubt in the present case that the city had the authority to enter into an express contract and confer the benefits at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">As to the case law from other jurisdictions cited by both parties, we note that most of it arises in the context of claims in which the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., is at issue. ERISA does not apply to government sponsored benefit plans.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003 (b). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>courts applying ERISA uniformly hold that, although the law does not require the vesting of health insurance plans, as it does for pension plans, employers may create vested rights in such benefits when the intent is expressed unambiguously. <em>American Federation of Grain Millers </em>v. <em>International Multifoods Corp., </em>116 F.3d 976, 980 (2d Cir. 1997). From that starting point, however, several different approaches have emerged. Some courts impose a presumption that there is no vesting in the absence of a written, unambiguous expression of intent to do so, whereas others impose a presumption in favor of vesting if there is some ambiguity in the language conferring the benefit. See <em>Rosetto </em>v. <em>Pabst Brewing Co., </em>217 F.3d 539, 543 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1192, 121 S. Ct. 1191, 149 L. Ed. 2d 107 (2001) (noting various approaches); <em>American Federation of Grain Millers </em>v. <em>International Multifoods Corp., </em>supra, 980 (same); see generally D. Sondgeroth, supra, 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1229-42 (discussing different presumptions applied and rationales offered in support thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In our view, the rationales articulated for either presumption are not particularly persuasive. The courts imposing a presumption <em>against </em>vesting base that approach largely on their construction of ERISA\u2014 drawing an adverse inference from Congress\u2019 decision to require vesting for <em>pension </em>rights, but not to include a comparable requirement for welfare benefits. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>e.g., <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, U.A.W. </em>v. <em>Skinner Engine Co., </em>188 F.3d 130, 137-38 (3d Cir. 1999); id., 139 (citing several courts that apply this rationale); see also C. Fisk, supra, 56 Ohio St. L.J. 172-73. In the absence of a comparable statutory scheme in the present case, no such adverse inference is warranted. Moreover, we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that, although requiring express terms, such as \u201cvested,\u201d \u201caccrued\u201d or \u201cguaranteed,\u201d facilitates the court\u2019s function in interpreting contracts, that rationale is an inadequate basis for imposing such a requirement when the parties\u2019 intent otherwise can be ascertained.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Bidlack </em>v. <em>Wheelabrator Corp., </em>supra, 993 F.2d 607; accord <em>Anchorage </em>v. <em>Gentile, </em>922 P.2d 248, 256-57 (Alaska 1996). Conversely, those courts that impose a presumption <em>in favor </em>of vesting rely on the status-based nature of retirement benefits and shift the burden to the employer to <em>disprove </em>vesting based on a contractual ambiguity. See <em>Maurer </em>v. <em>Joy Technologies, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 907, 914-17 (6th Cir. 2000) (reiterating holding of <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America </em>v. <em>Yard-Man, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 1476 [6th Cir. 1983], seminal case articulating this view); <em>Roth v. Glen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>dale, </em>237 Wis. 2d 173, 184-85, 614 N.W.2d 467 (2000), and cases cited therein. In our view, this burden shifting is inconsistent with the principle that contractual obligations generally cease at the termination of a collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Litton Financial Printing Division v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>supra, 501 U.S. 207; <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union </em>v. <em>Gold Star Sausage Co., </em>supra, 897 F.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We also conclude that neither presumption adequately takes into account the competing and significant policy concerns at issue. From the employer\u2019s perspective, courts should not impose lightly an indefinite financial obligation when, unlike with pension plans, the employer lacks the ability to predict or control costs. Indeed, this concern is of heightened importance in the public employment sphere. A municipality must ensure its fiscal integrity to provide not only benefits for past and future employees, but also necessary services to its residents. Furthermore, courts should hesitate to presume a vesting intent when the result could well be to discourage employers from providing such benefits in the first instance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See C. Fisk, supra, 56 Ohio St. L.J. 159 (\u201c[s]tringent regulation to protect employees will increase the cost of benefits to employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ers and thus, at some point, will create an incentive for employers to exercise their prerogative not to provide benefits at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">From the employee\u2019s perspective, the promise of health insurance benefits at retirement may be a significant inducement in determining employment. <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Glendale, </em>supra, 237 Wis. 2d 184-85; A. Sulentic, \u201cPromises, Promises: Using the Parol Evidence Rule to Manage Extrinsic Evidence in ERISA Litigation,\u201d 3 U. Pa. J. Lab. &amp; Emp. L. 1, 2 n.6 and accompanying text (2000-2001); cf. <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 750, 785 A.2d 197 (2001) (noting in context of pensions benefits, \u201cemployers frequently use lucrative retirement packages in lieu of additional salary to attract and retain desirable employees\u201d). Employees reasonably relying on ambiguous terms as making such a promise may be put in an untenable position when their employer unilaterally withdraws or substantially diminishes benefit insurance\u2014incurring a substantial financial burden for which they had not planned at a time when it is least affordable, if they can obtain coverage at all. See <em>Law Enforcement Labor Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>483 N.W.2d 696, 701 (Minn. 1992); see generally P. Frostin &amp; D. Salisbury, \u201cRetiree Health Benefits: Savings Needed to Fund Health Care in Retirement\u201d (Employee Benefit Research Institute, February 2003) p. 13, fig. 9 (comparing cost of health coverage for retiree covered by employer health plan with retiree not covered by plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Therefore, we reject both presumptions and conclude that the best course is to apply our well established principles of contract inteipretation. We do so mindful of the fact that, in the present case, we have a contract formed between two parties of relatively equal bargaining power. Under these well established principles, \u201c[a] contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Niehaus </em>v. <em>Cowles Business Media, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 178, 188-89, 819 A.2d 765 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201c[T]he mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>259 Conn. 665, 670, 791 A.2d 546 (2002). \u201cIf the language of the contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the contract is ambiguous.\u201d Id., 671. By contrast, \u201clanguage is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning . . . concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 732, 746, 714 A.2d 649 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>244 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>280, 290, 709 A.2d 549 (1998). When only one interpretation of a contract is possible, the court need not look outside the four corners of the contract. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>232 Conn. 272, 278, 654 A.2d 737 (1995). Extrinsic evidence is always admissible, however, \u201cto explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hare </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>234 Conn. 581, 597, 662 A.2d 1242 (1995). With these principles and standards in mind, we turn to the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 right to medical benefits survived the termination of the collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We first consider whether the trial court properly determined that the agreements evinced the parties\u2019 intent that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to medical benefits survived the termination of the agreements. In addressing this question, the defendants contend that we need to consider only the scope of the benefit conferred to address whether they unilaterally can modify the benefits. Indeed, the defendants have represented to this court, in their brief and at oral argument, that they recognize \u201cthat the city is obligated to provide medical benefits for the [plaintiffs] who reasonably expected that such benefits would be available. Only the source and precise scope of that obligation are in dispute.\u201d We cannot, however, determine the \u201csource and precise scope\u201d without first addressing the legal predicate to that issue as to whether the right arises from a vested contractual obligation. S<em>ee Diehl v. Twin Disc, Inc., </em>102 F.3d 301, 309 (7th Cir. 1996) (first considering whether plaintiff retirees had vested right to lifetime benefits and then considering scope of those benefits); <em>Helwig </em>v. <em>Kelsey-Hayes Co., </em>93 F.3d 243, 247 (6th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1059, 117 S. Ct. 690, 136 L. Ed. 2d 613 (1997) (framing issues before court as whether: \u201c[1] the benefits promised to the [employees] vested at the time they retired, and [2] the benefits were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>subject to any modification or termination provision\u201d); see also <em>Bidlack </em>v. <em>Wheelabrator Corp., </em>supra, 993 F.2d 609-10 (first addressing general vesting question and then responding to employer\u2019s contention that, even if retired employees had vested rights, those rights were limited to those enjoyed by active employees). Accordingly, we first consider whether the plaintiffs in the present case have a vested right to medical benefits that survived the expiration of the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">As with any issue of contract interpretation, we begin with the language of the contract. As we noted previously, with minor exceptions, the 1986,1989 and 1993 agreements each contained essentially the same language in the relevant provisions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> All the retirement related benefits, including those at issue in the present case, were set forth in article XXXIII of the agreements, entitled \u201cPensions\u201d (retiree provision). The retiree provision provided in relevant part: \u201cSection 1. The retirement and survivor benefits in effect for employees of the Fire Department on December 31, 1971, (as per the provisions of . . . the 1969 Agreement between the City and this Union and as per the provisions of Chapter 27 of the [City Charter]), <em>shall remain in effect throughout the life of this Agreement </em>except that such benefits shall be improved as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201c(a) The provisions of this Article have been extended to non-members of the bargaining unit ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201cSection 2. Each employee shall have vesting rights in his pension benefits after ten (10) years of service regardless of the reason for termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">H= * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">\u201cSection 16. Effective July 1, 1986, the [city] <em>shall continue in full force and effect </em>the [medical] benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>for each . . . employee who retires or dies after July 1,1986, his spouse, and each eligible dependent of such . . . employee as described as follows ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cSection 16a. The City will provide the medical insurance program prescribed in Section 16 hereof at no cost, to those eligible.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Two other agreement provisions are relevant to our analysis: article XXVIII, entitled \u201cInsurance,\u201d which prescribed the benefits for active employees (active employee provision);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and article XXXVIII, entitled \u201cDuration,\u201d which set forth the effective and termination dates of the agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The active employee pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>vision contained the same medical benefits as those provided in the retiree provision, using identical language. The active employee provision also contained a section reserving the city\u2019s right to modify, to a limited extent, insurance benefits for active employees; there was no comparable section in the retiree provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The trial court relied on the phrase in \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII of the agreement providing that the city <em>\u201cshall continue </em>in full force and effect the [medical] benefits for each . . . employee who retires . . . after [the execution of this agreement]\u201d; (emphasis added); as the source of contract ambiguity regarding the vesting of rights under the agreement. On appeal, each of the parties contend that this phrase has a different meaning. The defendants contend that it means that the benefits shall continue until the expiration of the agreement, as set forth in the agreement\u2019s general duration provision. The plaintiffs contend that it means that the benefits shall continue throughout retirement. We agree that this phrase, in light of the contract as a whole, creates an ambiguity with regard to the duration of medical coverage. See <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, U.A.W. </em>v. <em>Skinner Engine Co., </em>supra, 188 F.3d 141 (language \u201c \u2018will continue,\u2019 \u201d when viewed in isolation, subject to equally reasonable interpretations of continuing during retirement and continuing until contract expiration); <em>Upholsterers\u2019 International Union of North America, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>American Pad &amp; Textile Co., </em>372 F.2d 427, 428 (6th Cir. 1967) (language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>that \u201c[c]ompany will continue to cover such eligible retired employees\u201d is ambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">On the one hand, there is support for the defendants\u2019 construction of the phrase. The active employee provision uses the same phrase\u2014\u201cshall continue in full force and effect\u201d\u2014with regard to identical medical benefits. It is undisputed that active employees\u2019 benefits continue only until the expiration of the agreement, as that date is set forth in the duration provision. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Therefore, because the phrase \u201cshall continue\u201d means \u201cshall continue until the expiration of the agreement\u201d in the context of active employees under article XXVIII, it is reasonable to assume that the same term is intended to have the same meaning when it is used in the retiree provision. Indeed, there is no additional durational term in \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII, setting forth the medical benefits, to contradict that meaning. Cf., e.g., <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>274 F.3d 76, 85 (2d Cir. 2002) (life insurance benefits \u201c \u2018for the remainder of their lives\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>537 U.S. 1170, 123 S. Ct. 1015, 154 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2003); <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Twin Disc, Inc., </em>supra, 102 F.3d 306 (medical benefits \u201c \u2018for lifetime of pensioner\u2019 \u201d); <em>Law Enforcement Labor Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>supra, 483 N.W.2d 701 (\u201cretired employee shall be allowed to continue [in medical plan] until his death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On the other hand, there is support for the plaintiffs\u2019 construction, namely, that \u201cshall continue\u201d means \u201cshall continue throughout retirement.\u201d Significantly, we first note that, \u00a7 1 of article XXXIII\u2014carrying over pension and retirement benefits from a prior agreement\u2014uses the phrase \u201cshall remain in effect throughout the life of this Agreement\u201d to indicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>duration of those benefits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 1 therefore clearly indicates that the benefits conferred therein terminate upon the expiration of the agreement. Section 16 of article XXXIII, which sets forth the medical benefits at issue in this case, uses the durational term \u201cshall continue.\u201d The use of different durational terms within the retiree provision, therefore, raises a question as to whether the parties intended a different duration in the two sections. See <em>Maurer </em>v. <em>Joy Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 212 F.3d 915 (\u201c[v]ariations in language used in other durational provisions . . . may . . . provide inferences of intent useful in clarifying a provision whose intended duration is ambiguous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We also note, with regard to the use of the same phrase\u2014\u201cshall continue\u201d\u2014in the sections setting forth medical benefits for both retirees and active employees, that the context in which the benefits are provided to the two groups reasonably suggests that the parties may have intended that the term should have a different meaning as to duration for retirees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the context of retiree benefits, a construction of the phrase \u201cshall continue\u201d limited to the duration period set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>agreement often would render the benefit inconsequential, lasting months or weeks, as the plaintiffs no longer would be in a position to negotiate with the city over future benefits. See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Schenectady, </em>244 App. Div. 2d 845, 846-47, 665 N.Y.S.2d 716 (1997), appeal denied, 91 N.Y.2d 812, 695 N.E.2d 717, 672 N.Y.S.2d 848 (1998).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, there is textual support in the agreements for the conclusion that the parties intended for retiree medical benefits to be treated differently than active employee benefits. Although, as we noted previously in this opinion, the agreements conferred identical medical benefits on active employees and retired employees, until 1995, only the active employee provision contained a section expressly reserving the city\u2019s right to modify medical benefits. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Indeed, there is no reference in the active employee provision to the retiree provision, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>vice versa, as is not uncommon when agreements confer identical benefits.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, the different contexts for receiving benefits and the limitation imposed on active, but not retired, employee benefits reasonably suggest that the parties may have intended that the phrase \u201cshall continue\u201d have a different meaning as to the duration of retiree medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Finally, we note some ambiguity as to whether the medical benefits expressly are vested in the agreements. As we noted previously, \u00a7 2 of the retiree provision of the agreements provides that \u201c[e]ach employee shall have vesting rights in his pension benefits after ten (10) years of service . . . .\u201d The term \u201cpension,\u201d although not defined in the agreements, means, in its usual sense, a deferred wage replacement benefit. <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 743. The term \u201cpension\u201d is also, however, the title of the retiree provision, which sets forth all retirement benefits, <em>including medical benefits. </em>This fact raises a question as to whether the parties intended for the phrase \u201cpension benefits\u201d to have a broader meaning in \u00a7 2 of article XXXIII, such that all retirement benefits would vest after ten years of service. See footnote 21 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Accordingly, because \u201cthe language of the contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the contract is ambiguous.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 671. Our conclusion, therefore, that the trial court properly concluded that the agreements were ambiguous as to the parties\u2019 intent as to whether to vest lifetime medical benefits, has two consequences. First, it permits the trial court\u2019s consideration of extrinsic evidence as to the conduct of the parties. <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 527, 546 n.17, 791 A.2d 489 (2002). Second, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract, being a determination of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact that is subject to reversal on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>HLO Land Ownership Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>248 Conn. 350, 357, 727 A.2d 1260 (1999); accord <em>Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u201cWe construe a contract in accordance with what we conclude to be the understanding and intention of the parties as determined from the language used by them interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . The intention of the parties manifested by their words and acts is essential to determine the meaning and terms of the contract and that intention may be gathered from all such permissible, pertinent facts and circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blatt </em>v. <em>Star Paper Co., </em>160 Conn. 193, 202-203, 276 A.2d 786 (1970); accord <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 313, 327, 714 A.2d 1230 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In the present case, the defendants do not dispute what the extrinsic evidence revealed\u2014that the city continued to provide medical benefits to the plaintiffs after the expiration of the pertinent collective bargaining agreements under which the retirees retired. Moreover, the defendants do not dispute that they continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>provide the specific benefit plan in effect at the t\u00edme the retirees retired.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They contended at oral argument before this court, however, that this conduct was merely a result of administrative inefficiency\u2014no one had instructed the city\u2019s benefits administrator to make any changes to the existing arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We conclude that the past conduct of the city just as easily could have been a result of intent as inertia. Compare <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Schenectady, </em>supra, 244 App. Div. 2d 847 (defendant city\u2019s \u201c[nineteen year] practice of continuing to provide fully paid health insurance coverage . . . even after the expiration of the various collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which [retirees] obtained such benefits, constitutes very substantial evidence that the provisions in question were intended to provide benefits to retirees for the entire period of their retirement\u201d) with <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Varity Corp., </em>896 F.2d 1107, 1110 (8th Cir. 1990) (\u201c[m]erely because [the] defendants chose to exempt retirees from plan changes in the past does not mean that [they] considered themselves forever bound to do so\u201d). In light of the deferential review that we accord the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, however, we cannot conclude that it drew an improper inference that such conduct was purposeful. Indeed, the defendants\u2019 concession in this court that the city is \u201cobligated\u201d to provide medical benefits to the plaintiffs in light of their \u201creasonable expectations\u201d bolsters the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Accordingly, we conclude that, in hght of the contract ambiguities and the extrinsic evidence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>have a vested right to medical benefits that survived the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Having decided that the plaintiffs have a vested right that survived the expiration of the agreements, we next turn to the critical issue in this case\u2014the scope of that right. Specifically, we must determine whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs have a vested right to the <em>exact plan </em>of medical coverage under the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement. The defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s conclusion improperly was based on its determination that the agreements were ambiguous as to the parties\u2019 intent in this regard. The defendants further contend that, in the absence of any contract ambiguity, the court improperly relied on extrinsic evidence\u2014the city\u2019s practice of continuing to provide the specific medical plan in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement\u2014to support its conclusion that the defendants could not make changes to the medical plan. The plaintiffs, relying primarily on the language we identified in part I B of this opinion, contend that the agreements unambiguously manifest the parties\u2019 intent to provide the specific benefits set forth therein. Therefore, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants could not change the plaintiffs\u2019 medical coverage from the traditional indemnity plan previously provided to the managed care plan. We agree with the defendants that the trial court improperly relied on extrinsic evidence in the face of unambiguous contract language permitting them to make changes to the form, but not the substance, of the benefits provided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The only language that the trial court cited in reaching its conclusion that the plaintiffs have a vested right to the specific plan under the pertinent agreement was that language in \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII providing that the city \u201cshall continue in full force and effect the benefits for each employee who retires or dies on or after the execution of this Agreement . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As we discussed in part IB of this opinion, this language reasonably is susceptible to an interpretation favorable to the plaintiffs as to the <em>duration </em>of the benefit; it does not, however, address the <em>scope </em>of the benefit. Although a right that is vested may not be modified unilaterally; <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, U.A.W. </em>v. <em>Skinner Engine Co., </em>supra, 188 F.3d 139; the scope of the right determines whether conduct infringes on that right. See <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Twin Disc, Inc., </em>supra, 102 F.3d 309; <em>Helwig </em>v. <em>Kelsey-Hayes Co., </em>supra, 93 F.3d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Several provisions in the agreements manifest the parties\u2019 intent that the city retain the right to make limited modifications to the benefits plan. The most obvious permitted modifications are those contained in the 1995 agreement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As we noted previously, the 1995 agreement set forth two changes from prior agreements, both expressly imposing new conditions on retirees, past and present. One change, set forth in \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII, permitted the city to modify the plan to provide \u201csimilar\u2014but in no event, less\u2014medical benefits\u201d if changes were made to the medical benefits of active employees.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The other change, set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00a7 17 of article XXXIII, included a requirement that those retirees who were eligible for medicare must participate in that program, with the city providing reimbursement for the cost of supplemental insurance coverage.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> These changes evinced that the city: (1) recognized an obligation to retirees that extended beyond the expiration of the preceding agreements, thus supporting our conclusion in part IB of this opinion; and (2) intended to retain authority to make some modifications to the form, but not the substance, of the medical benefits plan.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Even agreements prior to 1995 suggest that the city intended to withhold the right to make reasonable modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>fications to the plans by referring to specific benefits in a temporal sense. Specifically, beginning in 1986, all of the agreements refer, in \u00a7 16 (d) of article XXXIII, to the \u201cMajor Medical Program <em>currently </em>in effect which provides <em>essentially </em>the following [benefits] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The 1986 and 1989 agreements also referred, in \u00a7 16 (f) of article XXXIII, to the \u201cHome and Office Medical Care Rider (which <em>presently has a $5 </em>Deductible) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Notably, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not address any of the foregoing language in the agreements that expressly or implicitly provides for the city\u2019s right to modify the benefits. The court\u2019s conclusion that the city could not modify the specific benefits plan under the pertinent collective bargaining agreement rested solely upon the city\u2019s long-standing practice of providing to the retirees the specific benefits plan in effect at their retirement. That evidence was sufficient, in combination with the ambiguous duration language in the agreements, to support the court\u2019s conclusion that the right to benefits survived the expiration of the agreements. That evidence alone was not sufficient, however, in the absence of <em>any </em>textual support in the agreements, to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the parties manifested an intent to vest in the plaintiffs the specific benefits plan, unalterable by the city. See <em>In the Matter of Aeneas McDonald Police Benevolent Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Geneva, </em>92 N.Y.2d 326, 333, 703 N.E.2d 745, 680 N.Y.S.2d 887 (1998) (\u201cpast practice, like any other form of parol evidence, is merely an interpretive tool and cannot be used to create a contractual right independent of some express source in the underlying agreement\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous in that respect. See <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>264 Conn. 266, 277, 823 A.2d 1172 (2003) (\u201cfinding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Nonetheless, we are faced with the question of whether, despite the city\u2019s retention of the right to make some modifications to the medical benefits plan, the defendants violated the plaintiffs\u2019 vested contractual right to the benefits generally. In this regard, we agree with the approach taken recently by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit when facing a similar situation in <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Twin Disc, Inc., </em>supra, 102 F.3d 301. That court stated: \u201cThe [plaintiff retirees] maintain that they contracted for exactly the same insurance coverage that they were receiving by virtue of the 1983 Insurance Agreement. At the other extreme, [the defendant company] . . . presumably would argue that [its] duty to provide lifetime coverage is satisfied so long as the [defendant] maintains some insurance coverage, however reduced. The interpretive dilemma that we confront here is one of vagueness rather than ambiguity. We are faced, not with a choice between two reasonable interpretations, but with a continuum of options that lies between these two intuitively implausible results. If [the defendant] were permitted to \u2018modify\u2019 coverage until it became all but nominal, the promise of lifetime benefits would begin to look rather illusory. On the other hand, we cast a cold eye on the claim that [under a subsequent 1986 agreement] [the defendant] contracted to provide for the life of its retirees the precise benefits described . . . previously.\u201d Id., 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In <em>Diehl, </em>the Seventh Circuit concluded that, in light of the defendant\u2019s reservation of its right to modify the plan, \u201cthe [1983] Insurance Agreement obligated [the defendant] to secure a certain level of benefits, and [the defendant] presumably remained free to negotiate with various insurance carriers (or to self-insure) and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>impose cost-saving measures that did not substantially reduce benefits. But in exercising this discretion, [the defendant] could not have been free to arrange for coverage that would eviscerate the promise of benefits. We therefore would read the [1986 agreement] as requiring [the defendant] to expend reasonable efforts to secure coverage at a level substantially commensurate with the benefits provided under the [1983 agreement in effect at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 retirement]. We believe that this understanding most accurately reflects the intent of the parties.\u201d Id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Indeed, we note that it runs counter to all of the parties\u2019 interests to construe the agreements in the present case as conferring on the plaintiffs the <em>exact </em>plan set forth under the agreement in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The continued availability of the pertinent plan is dependent upon a third party not bound beyond the term of the agreements\u2014the insurer. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The insurer could decide to discontinue coverage of city employees or discontinue the particular plan. It also could raise the cost of coverage to the point that it no longer would be feasible for the city to procure the insurance. The defense of impossibility of performing the contract, therefore, would release the city from its obligation and leave the retirees with no medical insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Therefore, in accordance with the Seventh Circuit, we conclude that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs . . . bear the burden of demonstrating that the changes brought their benefits below a level reasonably commensurate with the coverage that they had enjoyed theretofore. . . . We caution that it will not suffice for the plaintiffs to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>strate that the changes have increased payments for some retired employees. The changes should be examined for their effect on the class of retirees as a whole, to determine if they have significantly reduced their general level of benefits. In addition, individual modifications should not be scrutinized in isolation. In other words, the changes must be examined in their totality for their effect upon the class of retirees as a group.\u201d <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>Twin Disc, Inc., </em>supra, 102 F.3d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Accordingly, in order for the plaintiffs to prevail, they must demonstrate that the changes to their benefits are not substantially commensurate with the benefits provided under the agreements in effect at the time of the retirees\u2019 retirement, when viewing the group of plaintiffs as a whole. We conclude that, under the facts found by the trial court, the plaintiffs cannot meet this burden as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The trial court made the following factual findings as to the differences between the traditional indemnity plan and the new managed care plan, which are, with one exception, undisputed by the parties.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The trial court identified five areas of change from the traditional indemnity plan to the managed care plan that created the cost savings sought by the defendants, three<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> of which affect the plaintiffs directly. The first area of change is that, under the managed care plan, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tiffs are required to submit a copayment for each health service utilized\u2014ranging in amount from $5 to $15 per visit. Even under the indemnity plan, the plaintiffs faced the possibility of incurring some financial costs\u2014they were reimbursed for medically necessary services, up to a certain combined cap, after which they might be obligated to contribute a \u201cdeductible\u201d amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The second area of change would come from using a specific network of health care providers under the managed care plan, with whom the insurer has negotiated set rates of payment for services. Under the traditional indemnity plan, the plaintiffs could choose their own provider. Under the new plan, the plaintiffs still may use their own provider, but if that provider does not belong to the insurer\u2019s network, the plan generally will not cover the full cost and the plaintiffs will have to pay the cost difference directly to the provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The third area of change is the imposition of management on the utilization of services. Under the traditional indemnity plan, the insured patient and the physician alone decided what services were medically necessary. Under the managed care plan, the insurer maintains certain schedules of levels of services, which establish a presumption as to the appropriate amount of service based on the particular medical condition. The presumption can be overcome only through a consultation with the insurer. The trial court noted that \u201c[o]ften the consultation is less [a consultation] than a negotiation. At worst it may result in a denial of services . . . .\u201d The court also noted, however, that an insured who wants to challenge a denial of services may initiate an administrative type of appeals process to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, despite these differences, was that, although \u201ca managed health care plan is inherently less flexible than the traditional indemnity plan, it is by no means certain from the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>dence that a given beneficiary will always fare worse under the new health care plan than the old. . . . Depending on what health problems occur for a specific beneficiary and what services or prescription medications are necessary, the evidence demonstrated that there are situations in which the out-oi-pocket costs can indeed be greater under the old plan than the new.\u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs here have succeeded in showing that there are significant differences between the . . . plans .... The court cannot conclude that the differences are trivial, even though the plaintiffs have not shown that over their life expectancy they will suffer a specific quantifiable loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In our view, these findings and conclusions fall short of establishing that the \u201csignificant differences between the . . . plans\u201d resulted in a new plan that either substantially reduced the provision of services or substantially increased the cost to the group of plaintiffs as a whole.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Accordingly, the modifications made by the defendants affected the form, and not materially the substance, of the vested benefit. We need not, in the present case, delineate the precise contours of the substance of the vested benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\"> The defendant Waterbury financial planning and assistance board and its members who were named as defendants; see footnote 3 of this opinion; appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court.

The reason for doing so is self-evident in those cases in which the courts respond in the negative to the vesting question. If the right does not survive the agreement, its scope is irrelevant. We surmise that, in those cases in which the courts have concluded that the right does survive, the factual context was weighed against the need to inquire into the specific scope of the right to medical benefits. Often these cases come to the appellate court on a motion for summary judgment solely on the general vesting issue; see, e.g., <em>Maurer </em>v. <em>Joy Technologies, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 907, 914-17 (6th Cir. 2000); <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America </em>v. <em>Yard-Man, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 1476, 1479-82 (6th Cir. 1983); <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Glendale, </em>237 Wis. 2d 173, 179, 614 N.W.2d 467 (2000); or under circumstances in which the employer has terminated benefits altogether; see, e.g., <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Variety Corp., </em>896 F.2d 1107, 1108 (8th Cir. 1990); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Schenectady, </em>244 App. Div. 2d 845, 846, 665 N.Y.S.2d 716 (1997), appeal denied, 91 N.Y.2d 812, 695 N.E.2d 717, 672 N.Y.S.2d 848 (1998); or when it is undisputed that the modification of benefits resulted in a substantial decrease in services or increase in cost.

This argument, however, ignores the important distinction to be made between retirees and existing City employees. To be sure, the benefits accorded existing City employees may vary from one collective bargaining agreement to another and, hence, during the term of their employment, such employees may gain or lose certain benefits. We must question, however, whether the parlies to the collective bargaining agreements at issue here intended the retirees\u2019 benefits to be as fungible, inasmuch as at the expiration of such agreements [the union] no longer represents the retirees, has no bargaining rights or obligations on their behalf and, indeed, may not even have the right to bargain voluntarily on their behalf .... Accepting [the city\u2019s] argument as to the duration of the benefits accorded under that agreement might result in a retiree receiving but a few months or days of benefits thereunder, and the same can be said of each of the subsequent agreements (although none had a durational limit of less than two years).

See, e.g., <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America </em>v. <em>Yard-Man, Inc., </em>supra, 716 F.2d 1480 (\u201c[c]ompany will provide insurance benefits equal to the active group benefits\u201d); <em>Della Rocco </em>v. <em>Schenectady, </em>252 App. Div. 2d 82, 84, 683 N.Y.S.2d 622 (1988), appeal dismissed, 93 N.Y.2d 1000, 717 N.E.2d 1082, 683 N.Y.S.2d 745 (1999) (agreement provided for medical benefits \u201c \u2018equivalent to the plan presently in effect for each member of the [police] [department and his family, and for retired members and their families\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> One of the plaintiffs, Russ Rosselli, testified regarding his receipt of retirement benefits. Under the 1986 agreement, which was in effect at the time Rosselli retired, employees were vested after ten years of employment, but were not entitled \u201cto retire and receive a service pension\u201d until they had accrued twenty years of service pursuant to article XXXIII, \u00a7 9, of the agreement. Rosselli testified that he had retired after sixteen years as a city firefighter, was \u201cheld off\u2019 from receiving benefits for four years and, <em>at that time, </em>had received <em>both </em>his pension and medical benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> Because we agree with the defendants that they retain the right to modify the benefits plan, we do not reach their claim that the city charter, which is incorporated by reference into the collective bargaining agreements, permits it to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\"> See \u00a7 16 of article XXXIII of the 1989, 1992 and 1995 agreements. The 1986 agreement had similar language; the provision therein, however, included the specific effective date of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> As we noted previously, the record does not indicate under which particular collective bargaining agreement any individual retiree retired. See footnote -5 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\"> Section 16 of article XXXIII of the 1995 agreement provided in relevant part: \u201cThe medical benefits for retirees prescribed in [the preceding paragraphs] may be substituted for similar\u2014but in no event, less\u2014medical bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>fits if the City and the Coalition of City Unions agree on a modified insurance plan for City employees; said modified medical program is currently under study by a committee consisting of the representatives of the City and representatives of all City Unions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> Section 17 of article XXXIII of the 1995 agreement provided: \u201cEffective as of the signing of this agreement a retiree, who has attained the age of 65 years and receives medical insurance benefits per the provisions of this Article XXXIII and who is eligible for either (1) Medicare A or B, or (2) Medicare A and B, must participate in the Medicare program in which he is eligible to participate. The City will provide supplemental coverage (the City to reimburse the retiree/spouse of retiree for the cost of the monthly premium for this supplemental coverage, the payment for which will be made in the first instance by the retiree/spouse of retiree); which reimbursement will be made annually to the retiree/spouse of retiree upon proof of payment of the premium for said supplemental coverage by the retiree/ spouse of retiree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> All parties concede that the two changes to the 1995 agreement, adding the medicare and modification provisions, were intended to apply to those employees who <em>already </em>had retired under agreements prior to 1995, as well as those who retired under the 1995 agreement. The plaintiffs do not concede, however, that the city had the authority to make these changes applicable to those employees who retired prior to 1995, but they never have challenged the city\u2019s authority to do so. Nevertheless, it is clear from the 1986 agreement, which expressly included medical benefits for \u201ceach retiree and each employee who retires\u201d after a certain date, that the city and the union understood the term \u201cretirees\u201d to mean those employees who already have retired under previous agreements. Accordingly, we conclude that the city and the union believed, when executing the 1995 agreement, that the city had the authority to impose certain modifications on retiree benefits plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> We note that, should other parties intend a different construction of their contract by the courts, they readily may ensure such a result by negotiating and expressly setting forth terms that clearly demonstrate their intent that the right vest, or not vest, or their intent that the benefit be or not be subject to specific modifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> The defendants dispute the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the management of treatment services and the scope of out-of-state network providers. See footnote 31 of this opinion. We treat the court\u2019s factual findings as undisputed, however, in light of our conclusion that, even if we were to accept those factual findings as proper, the defendants retain the right to shift the plaintiffs to the managed care plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> In addition to the three areas of change discussed in the text of this opinion, the two other areas of change are: (1) the provision of an incentive for the patient or care provider to select lower cost generic prescription drugs, rather than name brand drugs; and (2) the consolidation of all city employees under one or two insurance plans, rather than the numerous and varied plans under which the city previously was obliged to provide benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> Because we view the issue as it pertains to the group of plaintiffs as a whole, we do not address their concerns as to those few plaintiffs who either need to, or may need to, use out-of-state providers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
