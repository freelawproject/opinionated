DeSpain, Terry L. DeSpain and Charles Smith III, brought a consolidated appeal to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court improperly had granted the applications of the plaintiff, Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., to compel arbitration and denied their motions to dismiss and motions to stay. <em>Doctor's Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>72 Conn. App. 310, 311-12, 805 A.2d 120 (2002). The Appellate Court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. Id., 318. We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification, limited to the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant Terry L. DeSpain had been properly served with process by virtue of service on her attorney?\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>262 Conn. 922, 812 A.2d 864 (2002). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThis case concerns the authority of the Superior Court to enforce an arbitration clause in a franchise agreement. As part of the arbitration clause, the parties agreed that arbitration would take place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The franchisor brought four applications in the Superior Court to compel the franchisees to arbitrate. All but one of the franchisees are residents of Florida. . . . The franchisees have appealed from the court\u2019s granting of the franchisor\u2019s applications for orders requiring the franchisees to proceed with arbitration in Bridgeport. We affirm the judgments of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff, Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., is the franchisor of numerous Subway sandwich shops around the country. It is a Florida corporation that has its principal place of business in Fort Lauderdale. The defendant Daniel Keating is a present or former Subway franchisee in this state. The defendants Ruth Reed, Dennis M. DeSpain, Terry L. DeSpain and Charles Smith IE (Florida defendants) are or have been Subway franchisees in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">\u201cHaving filed aproper demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, the plaintiff sought court orders compelling the defendants to proceed with arbitration. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-410; 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. In accordance with the forum selected in each of the franchise agreements, it asked the court to designate Bridgeport as the venue for the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u201cIn response, the defendants filed two motions. The Florida defendants filed motions to dismiss in which they asserted that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. All the defendants filed motions for stay in which they urged the trial court to stay its hand because of ongoing proceedings in Illinois. The trial court denied the motions to dismiss and declined to order a stay.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 311-12. Terry L. DeSpain argues that the Appellate Court improperly found that the trial court had personal jurisdiction over her because she was not properly served with process, but, instead, process was served on her attorney, Brenden Leydon.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the parties\u2019 oral arguments before this court persuade us that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. We take judicial notice of the following facts: (1) the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules, by which the defendants agreed to be bound in their franchise agreement, allow service of process on a party\u2019s representative;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) during oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff represented to this court that he had confirmed in writing that Leydon was Terry DeSpain\u2019s representative prior to serving process on Leydon;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) in current proceedings before the Fifth District of the Illinois Appellate Court; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>Docket No. 5-03-0390; Terry L. DeSpain argues in favor of judicial notice of the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>in light of these facts, it would be inequitable to grant Terry L. DeSpain\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-6\"> Rule R-41 (a) of the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules provides in relevant part: \u201cAny papers, notices or process necessary or proper for the initiation or continuation of an arbitration under these rules, for any court action in connection therewith . . . may be served on a party by mail addressed to the party, or its representative at the last known address or by personal service . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\"> Leydon did not deny this representation during oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\"> In light of these judicially noticed facts, our affirmance of the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in this matter is confined solely to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
