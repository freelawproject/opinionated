(Pp. 756-757; see also <em>In re Mark L. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 171, 177 [193 Cal.Rptr. 165, 666 P.2d 22].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosaia </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 832 [203 Cal.Rptr. 856], the Fifth District Court of Appeal adopted a rule requiring that where a defendant has a right under <em>Arbuckle </em>to be sentenced by the judge who accepts a negotiated plea of guilty, the record of proceedings in the trial court must demonstrate the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his <em>Arbuckle </em>right before there can be a valid waiver of the right. (22 Cal.3d at p. 840.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In this case, we hold that where a defendant entered into a detailed, comprehensive written negotiated plea agreement before the time set for his preliminary hearing in municipal court, and the agreement did not specify that the judge who took his plea would sentence him, defendant had no right under <em>Arbuckle </em>to be sentenced by the superior court judge who ultimately took his plea. We further conclude that, even assuming arguendo defendant had an enforceable <em>Arbuckle </em>right, he waived it by his failure to assert it in the trial court. In our view, the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosaia, supra, </em>should be applied prospectively only to sentences imposed after <em>Rosaia </em>became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">On August 8, 1981, Mohammad Ali asked defendant Ruhl to kill All\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammad Alamgir, for $400. Ruhl asked defendant Danny Joseph Duchene to assist him in the murder. About 5 a.m. the two, armed with knives, drove to a squash field where they knew Alamgir would be working. They observed Alamgir and another man working in the field. Defendants approached the two and engaged them in conversation. Defendants withdrew a short distance away and agreed that both men would have to be killed. Defendants returned and, after a struggle, killed both men with their knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In October 1982, a complaint was filed charging both defendants with first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and alleging special circumstances, i.e., that as to each defendant the murders were intentional and carried out for financial gain (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(1)) and that defendants have been convicted of more than one offense of murder. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">On October 21, 1982, defendants and their attorneys met in a conference room at the Sutter County jail with the District Attorney of Sutter County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and several representatives of the Sutter County Sheriff\u2019s office. The meeting was transcribed by a court reporter and is part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">At the meeting, after appropriate explanations and advisements, each defendant entered into a six-page written negotiated plea agreement with the district attorney. The agreements were substantially identical. Each defendant essentially agreed to waive preliminary examination and to testify truthfully at the preliminary examination of Mohammad Ali. In the event defendant so testified, the district attorney agreed to file an information in superior court charging two counts of first degree murder but no special circumstances. Each defendant further agreed to enter a plea to the aforementioned information, to testify at any trial of Ali, and to waive time for sentencing so that sentence would be imposed after he had completed all testimony required in the criminal proceedings against Ali.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The agreement provided further in relevant part, \u201cThe District Attorney further agrees that he will not urge that the sentences for the two counts of first degree murder be served consecutively unless such consecutive sentencing is recommended by the Probation Department in their report to the Court in connection with judgment and sentence. [Defendant] understands that consecutive sentence [sfc] for the two counts of first degree murder may be imposed by the Court on the Court\u2019s own motion irrespective of whether the District Attorney does or does not argue for such position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Each agreement also recited, \u201cthere have been no . . . promises, no representations of any kind made to [defendant] to induce his participation in this negotiated plea and Memorandum of Understanding other than those that are contained specifically within this written agreement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">On October 29, 1982, defendants appeared in municipal court and waived preliminary examination. The written agreements with the district attorney were admitted into evidence. Defendants were ordered to appear as witnesses at Ali\u2019s preliminary hearing and, thereafter, to appear for arraignment in superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Defendants apparently having satisfied their obligation to testify at Ali\u2019s preliminary hearing, an information was filed November 12, 1982, charging each defendant with two counts of first degree murder without special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">On November 15, 1982, both defendants pled guilty before Judge Keeley to two counts of first degree murder as charged in the information. At the conclusion of that hearing, each defendant waived time for sentencing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that each could testify at the trial of Ali, all in accordance with the written agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Defendants were sentenced on different days in August 1983 by Judge Steel. Defendant Ruhl made no objection to being sentenced by Judge Steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In accordance with the recommendation of the probation department, each defendant received consecutive sentences on the two counts of murder. (See \u00a7 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Both defendants appeal and contend: (1) because constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws require that the procedural safeguards of the determinate sentencing law (DSL) apply to indeterminate sentences, they were prejudiced because the trial court allegedly failed to follow rules for sentencing under the DSL; (2) the court erred in imposing consecutive sentences; and (3) they were entitled to have their presentence custody credits calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 2933. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we reject these contentions. Defendant <em>Ruhl </em>also contends he was denied his rights under <em>People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 749 when he was sentenced by Judge Steel rather than by Judge Keeley who had accepted his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">It is not always an implied term of a plea bargain that the judge who accepts the plea will impose the sentence; rather, the record must affirmatively demonstrate some basis upon which a defendant may reasonably expect that the judge who accepts the plea will retain sentencing discretion. <em>(In re James H. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 911, 919-920 [212 Cal.Rptr. 61].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Here, there is no basis for any reasonable expectation by defendant Ruhl that Judge Keeley would retain sentencing discretion. The detailed, written plea agreement expressly set forth all terms of the agreement; sentencing by Judge Keeley was not one of the agreed terms. Moreover, when Judge Keeley took defendant\u2019s plea, he gave no indication that he would be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sentencing judge. Nor could such be fairly implied from the circumstances since, by agreement, the sentencing was to be continued until after All\u2019s trial\u2014a necessarily indefinite period of postponement during which judicial assignments could reasonably be expected to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Finally, a fundamental purpose of the <em>Arbuckle </em>rule would not be served by its application here. One reason <em>Arbuckle </em>implies (as a \u201cgeneral principle\u201d) a right to be sentenced by the judge taking the plea is because the propensity in sentencing demonstrated by a particular judge is often an inherently significant factor in a defendant\u2019s decision whether to plead guilty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 757.) Here, the circumstances make clear that defendant Ruhl decided to plead guilty well before he ever got to superior court; the identity of the judge taking his plea clearly did not influence his decision. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Miskiewicz </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 820, 825 [204 Cal.Rptr. 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We conclude defendant had no right under <em>Arbuckle </em>to be sentenced by Judge Keeley; Judge Steel\u2019s sentence was lawfully imposed. However, even assuming arguendo defendant had a right under <em>Arbuckle </em>to be sentenced by Judge Keeley, we conclude defendant waived his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">When defendant was sentenced in 1983, the law uniformly provided a defendant had to assert his <em>Arbuckle </em>right in the trial court or he waived it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 987, 992 [165 Cal.Rptr. 24]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>DeJesus </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 413, 417-418 [168 Cal.Rptr. 8].) In 1984, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosaia, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at page 840, the Fifth District Court of Appeal adopted a rule \u201crequiring . . . that the <em>record </em>demonstrate the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his <em>Arbuckle </em>rights to support a conclusion that defendant waived those rights by his conduct.\u201d (Italics in original.) The record in the instant case does not demonstrate defendant Ruhl\u2019s knowledge of any <em>Arbuckle </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">However, <em>Rosaia\u2019s </em>authors stated expressly, \u201c[W]e intend the rule to be prospective only.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 835.) We will be faithful to that intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 385 [208 Cal.Rptr. 162, 690 P.2d 635] our Supreme Court recently reexamined the guidelines by which a new rule promulgated by judicial decision is given prospective or retroactive effect. The court acknowledged that there exists a \u201cnarrow class of decisions\u201d in which justifiable reliance on an old rule will justify prospective application of the new rule on grounds of policy. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 401.) In deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>mining whether to give a new rule prospective application, our task is first to examine whether the purpose of the new rule points plainly towards retroactivity or prospectivity. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where the primary purpose of a new rule is to promote reliable determinations of guilt or innocence, so that the truth-finding function of trial is protected, the new rule should ordinarily be given retroactive effect. (Ibid.; cf. <em>In re Love </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 179, 188 [113 Cal.Rptr. 89, 520 P.2d 713].) If the question of retroactivity is a close one after the purpose of the new rule is considered, only then should we consider the extent of reliance on the old rule and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of new standards. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We conclude that, by the first of these standards\u2014the reason for the rule\u2014 <em>Rosaia </em>should be given prospective effect. The rule has no bearing on the truth-finding function of trial. As is evident from the instant case, whether a defendant expressly waives his right to be sentenced by the judge who takes his plea has no effect on his guilt or innocence: with or without a demonstration of defendant\u2019s knowledge of his <em>Arbuckle </em>right on the record, defendant\u2019s guilt is admitted by his plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While <em>Rosaia </em>promulgates a rule that will ultimately serve the administration of justice by quieting claims of <em>Arbuckle </em>ignorance, the rule is collateral to a fair determination of guilt or innocence and deserves prospective application. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Colvin </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 614, 628 [171 Cal.Rptr. 32]; see also <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24, 38-39 [196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110]; <em>In re Joe R. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 496, 511 [165 Cal.Rptr. 837, 612 P.2d 927]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 1, 10 [136 Cal.Rptr. 409, 559 P.2d 1028]; <em>In re Johnson </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 404, 412-413 [90 Cal.Rptr. 569, 475 P.2d 841] and authorities there cited.) Nor is a defendant who has, in fact, been uninformed of his <em>Arbuckle </em>right left without a remedy. (See <em>In re Thomas S. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 934 [177 Cal.Rptr. 742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We conclude <em>Rosaia </em>applies only to sentencings that have occurred on and after September 28, 1984, when <em>Rosaia </em>was final.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Ruhl was sentenced before that date, <em>Rosaia </em>is inapplicable. Thus, because defendant failed to object to being sentenced by Judge Steel, for purposes of this appeal he waived his right to be sentenced by Judge Keeley. <em>(People </em>v. <em>West, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d at p. 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Anticipating this conclusion, defendant Ruhl argues that trial counsel was incompetent for failing to request a transfer to the judge who accepted his plea. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412 [152 Cal.Rptr: 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].) However, upon this record, we are unable to divine counsel\u2019s reason for proceeding before Judge Steel. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>West, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d at p. 992.) In such circumstances, we may not second-guess trial counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 426; see <em>In re Thomas S., supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As to each defendant, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Carr, Acting P. J., and Sparks, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The petition of appellant Duchene for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 14, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The facts, about which there is no dispute, are taken from the probation reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Although this conclusion is strictly dictum, we think the trial courts may like to know, even by way of dictum, how we view <em>Rosaia.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Nor is there any danger, in the absence of <em>Rosaia\u2019s </em>rule, that the trial court was unaware of its sentencing discretion. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348, fn. 8 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>Rosaia </em>was filed by the Fifth District Court of Appeal on June 26, 1984. (157 Cal.App.3d at p. 832.) It became final as to the Court of Appeal 30 days later since no rehearing was granted. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24.) However, for purposes of precedential value and reliance by trial courts, the case became final only after the Supreme Court denied a hearing, which it did on September 27, 1984. (See <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Sheehan </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 334, 335 [200 P. 392].) Since trial courts could not reasonably be expected to apply the rule of <em>Rosaia </em>on the same day the Supreme Court denied a hearing, the next day\u2014September 28, 1984\u2014is the earliest date the case should be given precedential value. We note that rules of court applicable to obtaining review by the California Supreme Court have been amended extensively (eff. May 6, 1985) to implement Proposition 32, enacted at the 1984 General Election, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>to allow review of selected issues in a decision of a Court of Appeal. However, we do not believe the new rules affect the foregoing rules of finality of a Court of Appeal opinion where the Supreme Court denies review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
