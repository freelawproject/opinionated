On motion of the district attorney, the trial court then dismissed three charged counts of burglary and struck a firearm use allegation. Defendant was sentenced to the middle term of three years for the robbery (\u00a7 213), with an enhancement of five years for the prior robbery conviction (\u00a7 667), making a total prison term of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On appeal, defendant raises numerous challenges to his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contends: (1) application of section 667 constitutes an unconstitutional ex post facto law; (2) application of section 667 denies him equal protection of the laws; (3) the conflict between sections 667 and 667.5 entitles him to the more favorable provisions of section 667.5; (4) it was error to deny his motion to strike the enhancement for his prior robbery conviction; (5) the trial court improperly considered the stricken weapon enhancement in sentencing him; (6) his sentence exceeds twice the base term in violation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g); and (7) his prior robbery conviction was not \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We concluded none of the contentions had merit and affirmed the judgment in a decision filed July 30, 1984. Our Supreme Court granted a hearing on October 4, 1984. Subsequent thereto, on January 28, 1985, the Supreme Court filed the decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736], and <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 841 [210 Cal.Rptr. 450, 694 P.2d 135], which treat some of the issues raised by defendant herein. On April 18, 1985, the Supreme Court ordered the cause retransferred to our court with the suggestion that the opinion be refiled with appropriate reference to <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 826, and <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 841. We comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Defendant contends that because a robbery prior is punishable, for enhancement purposes, under both section 667 and section 667.5, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>flict requires that he be given the benefit of the more favorable statute, section 667.5. Defendant has misconstrued both the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Defendant cites <em>Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420] in support of his assertion. <em>Keeler </em>involved the familiar canon of statutory construction that where a <em>single </em>penal statute is susceptible of two interpretations, the construction more favorable to the offender will be adopted. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 631; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 814, 828 [176 Cal.Rptr. 521, 633 P.2d 186].) This rule has no application if defendant\u2019s offense is punishable by <em>two </em>separate statutes. The latter case is governed by section 654, which provides in part that \u201c[a]n act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one.\u201d Section 654 does not prohibit multiple convictions, merely multiple punishment. The appropriate remedy for a violation of the statute is to eliminate the penalty predicated on the <em>lesser </em>offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 764, 766 [48 Cal.Rptr. 139, 408 P.2d 747].) The law does not require that defendant be given the benefit of the more favorable of two applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Were we to accept defendant\u2019s erroneous view of the law, his assertion that his robbery prior is punishable under both sections 667 and 667.5 is factually incorrect. The statutes may overlap in certain instances, but the defendant in this case was charged in the information with having been previously <em>\u201cconvicted </em>of a serious felony offense, Robbery, ...\u201d Section 667 applies to \u201c[a]ny person <em>convicted </em>of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state ....\u201d(\u00a7 667, subd. (a); italics added.) Section 667.5 covers \u201c[e]nhancement of prison terms for new offenses because of <em>prior prison terms </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Because defendant was charged with only a prior <em>conviction, </em>an additional one-year term for a \u201cprior separate <em>prison term served </em>for any felony\u201d could not have been imposed pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). (Italics added.) The critical element of a prior prison term was neither specifically charged in the information nor necessarily included within the charge of a prior conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364, 367 [173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183].) Nor did defendant consent to be sentenced on the \u201clesser related\u201d allegation of having served a prior prison term. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510, 526 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303].) His argument below was that the prior conviction allegation should be stricken entirely because the prior conviction was so old. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, we conclude there is no \u201cconflict\u201d between sections 667 and 667.5. Section 667 was applicable and defendant was properly sentenced under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Defendant next contends the trial court improperly sentenced him to an aggregate term which exceeded twice his base term in violation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He overlooks the enactment of article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution, enacted by the voters at the June 8, 1982 primary election. This section states in pertinent part that prior felony convictions \u201cshall subsequently be used <em>without limitation </em>for purposes of . . . enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.) Its enactment was an unambiguous expression of the electorate\u2019s intent to supersede the twice the base term rule as it applied to enhancements. In a single initiative measure, the electorate adopted a five-year enhancement for each prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), and mandated that such enhancements be imposed \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d (Art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (f).) \u201cThe courts must interpret a constitutional amendment to give effect to the intent of the voters adopting it.\u201d <em>(In re Quinn </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 473, 483 [110 Cal.Rptr. 881].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">As the Supreme Court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 826, 838, and in <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 841, 845, \u201cenhancements for serious felonies under section 667 were not intended to be subject to the double base term limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g). To carry out the intention of the enactment, we read section 1170.1, subdivision (g), as if it contained an exception for enhancements for serious felonies pursuant to section 667, comparable to the explicit exception for enhancements for violent felonies under section 667.5.\u201d As observed by the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 826, at page 838, footnote 15, \u201cProposition 8\u2019s failure to amend section 1170.1, subdivision (g) appears to be a draftsman\u2019s oversight. . . .\u201d The enhancement for defendant\u2019s prior robbery conviction is not subject to the double base limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Puglia, P.
