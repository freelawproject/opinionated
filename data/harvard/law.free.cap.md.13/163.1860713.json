Alexander </em>for the appellants, relied upon the following objections as fatal to the validity of the deed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">1st. The deed carries the assets of three firms, viz., Falconer &amp; Haskell, Kynock &amp; Co., and Haskell &amp; Co., one of the partners (Kynock) in the two firms last named being no party to the deed, and its declared purpose is to settle the affairs of those firms with their respective creditors. It is submitted, that the deed is void by reason of the junction of all these separate concerns in one conveyance, for administration, together. In the first place it exposes the creditors of Falconer &amp; Haskell (to which class the appellants belong) to be delayed of their dividends, by proceedings instituted by the creditors of Haskell &amp; Co., and Kynock &amp; Co., for the avoidance of the deed. These last named creditors are strangers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>in interest, to the appellants, and yet the rights of the appellants are subject, by the execution of this deed, to disturbance and defeat by these strangers. This ground of objection would be available, even if there were apparent upon the face of the deed no flaw in it. The risk of fatal defects, <em>dehors </em>the deed, would be enough. But, in this instance, it is certain the deed could not stand an assault by the creditors of Kynock &amp; Co., or of Haskell &amp; Co., because it stipulates, in effect, for a release of Kynock, (bjr the release, without reserve, of his partners in these firms,) and yet does not convey Kynock\u2019s separate estate. In the next place, if there were no other objection, it suffices that the terms of the deed virtually authorise the trustees to delay the distribution of Falconer &amp; Haskell\u2019s assets among <em>their </em>creditors, until all questions arising out of the claims made upon Kynock <em>&amp; Go., </em>or Haskell &amp; Co., or the prosecution of claims due those firms are settled. This consequence grows necessarily out of the power which the trustees have to apply Falconer &amp; Haskell\u2019s assets to pay the expenses of resisting claims against, or collecting debts due to, the other partnerships, in. the last place, the clause No. 11, which allows the trustees, before any distribution, to apply so much of the fund in their hands, made up of all the estates conveyed, as may be necessary \u201cfor prosecuting claims of, and defending and resisting claims against, the said trust estate and funds,\u201d presents a fatal objection to the union, in a single deed, of several indebted concerns. The fund in the hands of the trustee, so to be applied, is to spring from several sources: 1st, the partnership estate of Falconer &amp;. Haskell; 2nd, the individual estate of Falconer; 3rd, the individual estate of Haskell; 4th, the partaersiiip estate of Kynock &amp; Co.; 5th, the partnership estate of Haskell &amp; Co. Coming from all these quarters, it is to be massed together into a single fund, and out of that general fund payments are to be made for prosecuting claims of, and resisting and defending claims against, the said trust estate and funds. Thus Falconer <em>&amp;, </em>Haskell\u2019s assets may all be swallowed up in suits against the insolvent debtors of Kynock <em>&amp; </em>Co., or in resisting the attempt of one creditor of Haskell <em>&amp; </em>Co., to get a preference over the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>creditors of that firm. A man in failing circumstances cannofi devote his property to pay another man\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">2nd. The 12th clause gives a preference to two specified creditors. A deed of trust, stipulating for releases, must not only <em>convey </em>all the grantor\u2019s property, but convey it equally for the benefit of all. 9 <em>Gill, </em>222, <em>Powles, et al., vs. Dilley, et al. </em>The act of 1854, ch. 193, sec. 13, clearly strikes down-such a deed as this, because the preference is such as is there <em>condemned.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">3rd. The 13th clause directs the trustees \u201cto pay in such order and priority, as <em>by law </em>they may be entitled <em>to be </em>paid, all such of the creditors of the parties of the first part, being creditors in any of the co-partnership or individual relations aforesaid, as shall,\u201d &amp;c. This clause assumes there is a dis-tinction between the creditors and the funds applicable to their satisfaction, but it does not declare what that distinction is. It leaves it to be ascertained <em>\u201cby law.\u201d </em>The grantors probably meant that Falconer &amp; Haskell\u2019s assets ought to pay Falconer &amp; Haskell\u2019s debts, Falconer\u2019s assets his individual debts,, and so on, but they do not say so, and the question is, whether,, under the circumstances of the case, \u201cthe law\u201d says so, or says anything on the subject? At law, strictly speaking, there-is no rule whatever limiting the claims of partnership creditors to partnership assets. A partnership creditor suing and recovering judgment against the partners may take in execution-separate as well as joint assets. 6 Ves., 126, <em>Ex-parte Ruffin. </em>1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>675. Assuming, however, (what is by no means conceded,) that the words <em>\u201cby law\u201d </em>mean law in its largest sense, as including <em>equity, </em>is there any rule inequity which prescribes for that <em>forum </em>the distribution of partnership and separate assets <em>in such a case as </em>this? It will be-found, on examination, that the only cases in which equity, prescribes any rule, are cases of dissolution by technical bankruptcy, or the death of a partner. <em>Story on Part., secs. </em>360, 361. Whether, therefore, we look to law or equity, there io no rule laid down for the distribution of partnership and individual assets in a case circumstanced like the present, in which, there is neither death nor bankruptcy. The deed then pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>scribes no rule of distribution, but leaves the distribution to the law governing the case, and there is no law governing such a case. The only law laid down in the books applies to quite other and different cases. If, however, the terms of the deed be disregarded, and a loose construction should substitute for the words \u201cby law,\u201d the words \u201cby analogy of the law,\u201d so as to bring to bear on this case the rule which belongs to other cases in some degree resembling it, it must be conceded, that the only quarter to which resort can be had, will be to the cases of dissolution by technical bankruptcy or death, and to the rule which governs distribution in such cases. But it will be found, that the rule is not the same in both these cases. Where one partner dies, a joint creditor may resort to his individual assets, in the first instance, without resorting to the joint funds in the hands of the surviving partner. 1 <em>Mylne &amp; Keene, </em>582, <em>Wilkinson vs. Henderson. </em>In bankruptcy the joint creditors cannot go upon the separate estate until he has first exhausted the joint estate. There are other points of difference between the distributions in these classes of cases. <em>Story on Part., secs. </em>362, 363, and cases in the <em>notes. </em>It is plainly impracticable then, to find, in the only analogies possible, the rule sought for, as those analogies furnish different rules, and there is nothing to indicate which is meant. In addition to all which, it is plain, that the clause in question was framed upon an entire misapprehension. It manifestly proceeds upon the assumption, that the creditors, <em>as such, </em>have a lien, the joint creditors upon the joint estate, and the separate creditors upon the individual estates. It is well settled, that the creditors have no such lien as is supposed. 2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>1, <em>Glenn vs. Gill. </em>7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>403, <em>Guyton vs. Flack. </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>595, <em>Greenwood vs. Brodhead. </em>11 <em>Barb., </em>240, <em>Van Rossum vs. Walker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">4th. The power of sale given to the trustees, by the 10th clause, is fatal to the deed. The sale is not to be made at once, but is to wait the pleasure of the trustees, and their action is to be determined by what they shall think conducive to the interest, <em>not of the creditors, </em>but of <em>the trust. </em>It might be well enough for creditors appointing assignees, to vest them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>with such discretion, but not so where the debtor undertake\u00ae to guide their action for his own benefit. There is here ara ultimate trust, not implied merely, but expressed, for the benefit of the grantors, and the'interest confided to, and to be consulted by, the trustees, in selling, is not merely that of creditors, but of the grantors likewise. If, by waiting and keeping the property out of the market, the trustees can realize one hundred cents for the creditors, and a surplus for the debtors, they are not to consult merely what is best for the creditors, but what will benefit the debtors and keep the creditors waiting. 9 <em>Barb., 257, Woodburn vs. Mosher. 7 Md. Rep., </em>391, <em>American Exchange Bank vs. Inloes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">5th. The limitation of the responsibility of the trustees in the 16th clause is also a fatal objection. 3 <em>Selden, </em>438, <em>Litchfield vs. White. Burrill on Assignments, </em>209. Their liability is limited to \u2018their wilful commission, omission or neglect,\u201d which means wiiful commission, wilful omission, and wilful neglect, for otherwise the <em>slightest </em>omission or neglect would render them liable, whereas nothing but <em>wilful </em>commission will do, which was clearly not the intention of the parties to the deed. But the law holds trustees responsible for something less than wilful commission, omission or neglect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">6th. The power of composition with debtors, contained in 8th clause, also vitiates the deed. <em>7 Md. Rep., </em>391. 9 <em>Barb., 257.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">7th. The power given by the 9th clause, to the trustees, to delegate their powers, is a new and wholly indefensible clause in such a conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-9\">8th. By the 11th clause, the trustees were to <em>hold </em>the <em>entire </em>estate <em>liable for, </em>and apply it to the payment of, <em>all expenses </em>attending the execution of the trust, inclusive of counsel fees, contracted and owing by the grantors, in and about the management of their affairs, <em>since they stopped </em>payment. This authorises them to hold the whole of the trust estate until all the litigation, in reference to the trust, is terminated, and such power makes the deed frauduient and void. 23 <em>Barb,, </em>68, <em>D\u2019Ivernois vs. Leavitt.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Wm.H. Norrio </em>and <em>Geo. W. Dobbin </em>for the appellees, argued.';</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\">1st. The fact, that the deed conveys several separate estates is no objection to it; for if such an objection could be sustained then it would follow, that a party could not convey his individual and partnership property by the same conveyance, for these are two estates. The error in the argument for the appellants on this point is, that it confounds <em>conveyance </em>with <em>distribution, </em>There is no delay or hindrance of creditors by the <em>conveyance </em>of the estates of the three firms in one deed; their <em>administration </em>is to be separate, and by operation of law it is the same thing, so far as administration is concerned, as if there were separate conveyances of each estate simultaneously-executed, and it is an erroneous construction of the deed to say, that the settlement of the estate of one partnership, is to be deferred until the expense of resisting claims against or collecting debts due to the other partnerships is paid. Nor is the objection, that Kynock is no party to the deed, though it stipulates for releases to him, one which can be taken advantage of by these appellants, for they are <em>not creditors of </em>Kynock, and not therefore prejudiced by the deed. The deed is only void by the <em>Stat. of 13th Eliz., </em>as to those who are hindered and delayed by it; as to all others it is valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">2nd. The preference contained in the 12th clause is legal. The <em>insolvent </em>law of 1854, ch. 193, has no application to such a case, but has exclusive reference to cases of technical insolvency, where there has been a petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws. 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>452, <em>Triebert vs. Burgess. </em>This law does not declare, that all other deeds than those mentioned in its 13th section <em>shall be void, </em>and that such a preference as the one in question, in a deed not affected by the insolvent laws, is legal, is manifest from the case of <em>Powles vs, Dilley, </em>cited by the appellants. See, also, 22 <em>Barb., 550, Bank of Silver Creek vs. Tallcott.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">3rd. By the true construction of the deed, looking to its recitals, which fully set out the co-partnership and individual relations of the grantors, the purpose of the deed, and the clauses providing for the distribution of the trust funds, there is no provision therein, which either expressly directs or would per \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>mit, the application of any part of the funds in a way coEk trary to the provisions of the law, as they would be declared \u2018 by a court administering the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-4\">The <em>intention </em>of the parties is to prevail in the construction of <em>deeds, </em>as well as all other instruments, unless it violates some established principle of law. (9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>77, <em>Hope vs. Hutchins.) </em>Such a deed as this is not to be construed as to what it <em>may mean, (Burrill on Assignments, </em>347,) but it must be construed by reference to all its clauses and parts, and the <em>recitals </em>contained in it are to be looked to as the language of the grantors, for the purpose of ascertaining their intention. 3 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, 513, Rogers vs. Brooks. </em>69 <em>Eng.

Now the principle upon which the argument for the appellants proceeds is, that though the partners have an equity to have the partnership effects applied to partnership debts, and have a <em>lien </em>on them to have them so applied, <em>yet </em>the creditors have something approaching to a lien, but not a lien, and, therefore, there is no law of distribution in such a case. The answer to this is, that the fact that the creditors have no lien, does not authorise the inference that there is no law of <em>distribution. </em>There is a law of distribution in such a case, the law, that all the property is to be distributed among all the creditors equally, both joint and several, where they have no lien \u2014 the law of equality. If the partners have an equity or lien, there is nothing to prevent their <em>conveying </em>that right and lien, and to impress it upon the proceeds of sale in the hands of the grantees. But if they have no such right, to convey, the property is then left to be distributed .equally among all their creditors, and this deed was framed with both aspects \u2014 to suit either alternative. The deed is in fact veiy similar to that in <em>Andress vs. Miller, </em>15 <em>Penn. State Rep., </em>316, where the court, held, that, the intention of the parties was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>so preserve the distinction between joint and separate creditors, but as we have said, it was framed to suit either alternative. The only objection then is, that the grantors have not pointed out all the modes of distribution. But it is because the law of distribution is not clear, that the courts say, the trustees may go <em>into equity </em>and ask the advice of that court as to the distribution and management of the trust, and this protects the deed from all cavil, as to the uncertainty of the distribution pointed out in it. 11 <em>Md.

The clause exempting the trustees from liability for a loss to the trust estate, except the same shall arise from their wilful commission, omission or neglect, creates no exemption which the law does not create irrespective of such clause, and of consequence the validity of the deed is not affected thereby. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>183. 8 <em>Gill, </em>430, <em>Gray vs. Lynch &amp; McDonald. </em>6 <em>Waits &amp; Sergt., </em>304, 313, <em>Helmsley vs. Western Bank.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-6\">5th.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqP\">(with Bartol, J., concurring.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The appellants in this case had recovered a judgment in the Superior court of Baltimore city, against Falconer and Haskell, upon which they issued an attachment, by way of execution, and laid it in the hands of the appellees, who were trustees under a deed from John Falconer and John H. Haskell. The garnishees pleaded <em>nulla bona, </em>and, on issue joined, the plaintiff offered in evidence the writ of attachment,- and the admission of the garnishees, that at the time of its issual and service on them, they had in their hands moneys of Falconer and Haskell, more than sufficient to cover the amount of the judgment against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Upon this state of case, the plaintiffs offered a prayer, (which, was rejected by the court,) in effect denying the efficacy of the deed of the defendants, so far as their claim to judgment, in this case, is concerned. The only questions, therefore, which are now before us, are those which involve the validity and sufficiency of the deed set out in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">We shall examine the objections urged to the deed, in the order they have been presented to us on the part of the appellants; who were the plaintiffs below. The deed, as it appears in the report of this case, is separated into sections, and as such, numbered, and, for the purposes of perspicuity, we shall, in what we say, notice the particular parts referred to, by the designation of the number affixed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>sections of the deed recites, that the defendants, under the firm of Falconer and Haskell, carried on business in the city of Baltimore; that in company with John Kynock, of the city of Buffalo, they carried on business in the city of Buffalo and in Canada, under the firm of John Kynock &amp; Company; and also carried on business in company with the said Kynock, in New York, under the firm of Haskell <em>&amp; </em>Company. It is also recited, that the said firms of Kynock &amp; Company, and Haskell &lt;&amp; Company, were dissolved by mutual consent, which dissolution was duly advertised, and that thereupon, and thereby, full power was given to the defendants, to take the assets and wind up the business of said co-partnerships, which they proceeded to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>To these clauses of the deed are interposed two objections. 1st. That the deed is executed by Falconer and Haskell only/ 2nd. That by uniting in the same trustees, the power to settle the affairs of three distinct firms, the separate creditors of each will be delayed in the acquisition of what belongs to them, until the assets of all be accurately ascertained, and ready for final distribution. In reply to the first of these objections,- it is only necessary to observe, that the failure of Kynock to unite in the deed, can in no sense give' the appellants cause of complaint, whatever right, in this regard, it might afford to the individual creditors of Kyrtock, or to those of the firms of which he was a member/ The appellants have no claim against either Kynock of the firms, as sueh, of which he was a member. All the appellants have a right to ask is, that the assets of Falconer and Haskell, <em>individual </em>and <em>partnership, </em>shall he made liable for the payment of their debts, and this is done by the deed. The second objection, in our view of it, is founded in a misapprehension of the true character of the deed. It contemplates separate distributions; that is to say, the funds belonging to the several firms and to the individuals composing each, are to go, in their proper order, to the creditors of each. The accounts of each cae j\u00abst as readily be kept distinct/ the one from the other, as though separate deeds had been made in each case. Each fund is only to be subjected to the expenses and delays incident, and properly belonging, to it. VYe are unable to perceive the force of the objection. If the trustees fail to discharge their duty in this particular, a court of equity will be always ready to compel them.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It is said, that the 12th clause -of the deed is objectionable for two reason's; <em>first, </em>because it gives a preference to two specified creditors; and second, because a deed of trust stipulating for releases, must not only convey ail the grantor\u2019s property, but, convey it equally for the benefit of all; and, in sup port of these propositions, the case of <em>Powles, et al., vs. Dilley, et al., </em>9 Gill, 222, and the act of 1854, ch. 193, sec. 13, are cited. Neither the case in <em>9th Gill, </em>nor the act of Assembly, is sufficient to invalidate this part of the deed. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>speaking of the avoidance of a deed because of a preference,\u00bb the court refer to the -operation of <em>the insolvent laws. </em>They say,-to render a transfer to a favored creditor void <em>under the' insolvent system,- </em>the debtor must intend <em>both </em>to apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws, and intend to prefer the particular creditor or creditors; <em>the guilty intent must concur in both particulars. </em>Moreover, that it is incumbent on the complaining party to establish this motive. In the case before us, there is no question touching the insolvent laws; it arises under a deed of trust, and there is no proof of an application for, or intention to apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws. So far from the case cited being an authority against the validity of this clause in the deed, it is an express one in favor of it,declaring, as it does, that the common iaw has always, in the absence of every badge'of fraud, sanctioned the right of one creditor to obtain the payment of his debt from the debtor,to the exclusion of other creditors. The act of 1854, ch. 193, is, as its title declares, <em>\u201cArt act for the relief of insolvent debtors;\u201d </em>and in <em>Triebert vs. Burgess, and others, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>452, it was d eclared to have no application to a case in which there has been no petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws of the State. In support of this view of the clause in question,several authorities were cited at the bar, but inasmuch as the decisions of our own appellate tribunal are pointed and con-elusive, we deem it unnecessary to indulge in any 'comment upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The 13th clause of the deed is assailed on the ground, that* it directs the. trustees <em>\u201cto </em>pay in such order and priority, and out of such part of the trust funds, <em>as by law </em>they may be entitled to be paid, all such creditors of the parties of the first part, being creditors in any of the co-partnership or individual relations aforesaid, as shall, within sixty daj's,\u201d &amp;c. It is rather' difficult to comprehend an argument which rests, for its support, on the ground, that it is <em>unlawful </em>to do that which the' <em>law </em>approves. So far from this provision of the deed being obnoxious to censure, we think it evinces, very clearly, a disposition not to do anything forbidden by the law, and the grantors, in the use of these broad and comprehensive terms, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>play a becoming and upright intention to submit, as far as they .could do so, all legal questions for the adjudication of the tribunals constituted for that purpose. As to the order of distribution, there ought to be no difficulty. 'Where priorities have been secured, they will, of course, be respected and enforced, and, for the rest, the law of distribution is pointed out in the cases of <em>McCulloh vs. </em>Dashiell, 1 <em>Harris &amp; Gill, </em>106, and <em>Glenn vs. Gill, </em>2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>15. The deed being one of trust, (although this circumstance does not necessarily oust the jurisdiction of a court of law, 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>387,) yet, it enables equity to take cognizance of the matter, and to marshall and distribute the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The 10th clause is claimed to be fatal to the deed, because, by it, the sale is not to be made at once, but the trustees are empowered to make it \u201cwhenever they shall think proper and most conducive to the interests of the trust.\u201d In support of this objection, the case of the <em>American Exchange Bank vs. Inloes, Garn. of Turnbull </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>is relied upon. That case was before the court on two occasions, and will be found reported in the 7th and 11th volumes of Maryland Reports. The clause which was there held to be fatal to the deed, was one which expressly empowered the trustee, at his discretion, to sell, <em>\u201cgradually, in the manner and on the terms in which, in the course of their business Turnbull &amp; Co. had sold and disposed of their merchandized'' </em>This the court held to be an indefinite postponement of the execution of the trust, and not a mere discretion, which, to some extent, must be confided to the trustee. A reference to the case, as reported in 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>390, and 391, will show, that the court did not intend to go any farther than to declare, that the law will not tolerate any hindrance in assignments for the benefit of creditors, <em>\u201cbeyond what may be necessary for the purposes of the trust f </em>and also, that it was not its purpose to overrule the case of <em>Beatty vs. Davis, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>211, or, to deny, on this point, the force of the case of <em>Macham </em>vs. <em>Stearns, </em>9 Paige., 398. When the case came again before the court, (11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>184,) the following language is employed: \u201cIt does not <em>follovi, </em>from the views we have expressed, in reference to provisions of this kind, that sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>must be always made <em>immediately </em>and fqr cash, whether <em>the </em>interests of creditors will be affected or pot. <em>The trustee may pe left to the exercise of a sound discretion, </em>but the assignment must not confine him by unreasonable provisions. * * * if these assigntnents are fairly and <em>bona fide </em>made, the creditors, if consulted by the trustee, will know best how the trust should be conducted, and if sales, in any particular manner, will yield larger results, they will have the best reason for assenting to that mode. Thus the creditors can prescribe a law for the guidance of the trustee, which will fully protept him, and may \u00a1accomplish for them what, under the terms of the deed, he may not be able to' effect. And, where the trustee is appre? hensive of difficulty, or, <em>for </em>any reason, desires protection in the performance of his duties, he may invoke the jurisdiction pf a court of equity, and proceed under its direction.\u201d These pbservations relieve this clause of the deed from the objection urged against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Clause No. 16, which prqvides, that neither the trustees, por their representatives, shall be answerable for, or bound to piake good any deterioration or loss that may happen to the paid trust estate, effects and property, unless the same be consequent upon their wilful commission, omission or neglect, does nothing more than declare what the law ascertains, as the pxtent of their liability: 6 <em>Watts &amp; Sergt., </em>313, and the case of <em>Gray, et al., vs. Lynch &amp; McDonald, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The next, and only question remaining to be considered, relates to the 9th section of the deed, which authorises the trustees \u201cope or inore attorney or attorneys under them, for the purpose of executing the trusts herein contained, to appoint at pleasure and to remoye, and such .appointment to revoke and annul.\u201d This, it is said on behalf of appellants, is a new and wholly indefensible clause in such a conveyance. We do not concur in this opinion. This is not a case to which fire maxim <em>pofestas delegata non potest delegari, </em>will apply. Here, the authority to make such appointments is expressly given, and the only inquiry therefore is, whether the grantors had the right to confer it? And we answer it in the words of |jre Supreme Copi't of Pennsylvania, in the case of <em>Hennessy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>vs. The Western Bank, </em>6 <em>Watts &amp; Sergt., 312: \u201cWe </em>see nothing wrong in that part of the deed which, in order to facilitate and hasten the object and purposes of the assignment, gives full power to assignees to appoint and employ, according to their discretion, one or more agents or attorneys under them, with full or limited powers, and the same at pleasure to dismiss and revoke. There is nothing more in this clause, than what is usually contained in every letter of attorney.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AQn\">(Decided March 11th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">From what we have said, it follows, we are of opinion the court below properly rejected the prayer of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<author id=\"b189-6\">Eccleston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al5-\">\u2014 I am of opinion that the deed is void on its face, because it exacts unconditional releases from the creditors of Falconer and Haskell, of all claims against them as individuals and as partners, they being interested in firms of which Kynock was a partner; and the deed not including Kynock\u2019s property.
