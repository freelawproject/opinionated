Rep., </em>408, <em>Carroll vs. The Granite Manf. Co. </em>To enable the appellant to succeed on this general objection to the whole evidence, it must be fully established, that both of the' deeds of assignment, offered in evidence by the appellees, ar\u00e9 absolutely void on their face, and without reference to any extrinsic evidence whatever, for if the deeds are not so void in law an objection could not have been taken to their admissibility in evidence, but by instruction to the jury only. And if the deed for the <em>land </em>should be considered inadmissible, for any reason, still, if the assignment of the personalty is valid, the objection cannot be sustained and the judgment must be affirmed. Are then these deeds of assignment, or either of them, void in law?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">It is first objected, that the power conferred by them upon the trustees, to sell the property \u201cfor cash or on reasonable credit,\u201d is an unlawful hindrance and delay of creditors,'and therefore rendered the deeds altogether void. j^This^question is of foreign importation and has never troubledjour courts until recently. But however it may have been determined else-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>whore, I maintain, that it is settled in this State by judicial precedent and decision, that this power is valid and constitutes no legal objection to the deeds. 6 <em>G. &amp; </em>363, <em>Union Bank vs. Ellicott. 7 G. &amp; </em>J., 480, <em>Houston vs. Nowland. </em>6 <em>G.

The deeds were all declared valid, \u2014 a thing which could not have been if this power, expressed on their face, condemned them as void. In the cases of <em>Inloes vs. American Exchange Bank, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>173, and of <em>Macunel, et al., vs. Murdock, </em>decided at the present term of this court, the question was distinctly raised and expressly decided. These cases must be taken as decisive of this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">It is also objected to these deeds, that they do not affirmatively show and state, on their face, that the property conveyed was all the property owned by the assignors at the time. If these deeds contained stipulations, with creditors, for fioaL releases, then, perhaps, the objection would come with some force, under the decisions of this court. They belong, however, to a different class of assignments. They do not require of the creditors releases, as a condition precedent to a participation in the benefits of the trust. In assignments, stipulating for releases, because the creditor is required to relinquish forever his claim, he is entitled, as a fair consideration therefor, to a surrender of all the debtor\u2019s property. The condition of the creditor, under the deeds in question, is altogether different. If his debt is not fully discharged out of the trust fund, he continues to hold it as a' subsisting demand against the assignors, to be enforced whenever they may be able to pay. It is the ordinary case of a debtor conveying his property for the benefit of his creditors generally, giving preference to some over others. This is a well established right. The debtor, though he be in insolvent circumstances, may convey his property, either directly to a favored creditor, or to a trustee for his benefit. All that is required is, that it be done in good faith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cThere is little force,\u201d says this court in <em>Glenn vs. Grover &amp; McColm, 3 Md. Rep., 227, </em>\u201cin the objection, that Grover was insolvent and transferred all his property in payment of this one claim, provided it was done in good faith. Preferences are allowed. They always presuppose, that there are-creditors, against whom the assignment is to operate, and it is-generally true, that in such cases the debtors are embarrassed,, if not insolvent, yet this cannot affect the validity of the conveyance.\u201d Here the assignment is for the benefit of all the-creditors, with a preferred .order of payment. There is nothing in the case that in the least impeaches the <em>bona fides </em>of the transaction. 3 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>499, <em>Bruce vs. Smith. </em>6 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>206, <em>State vs. Bank of Maryland.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">It is further objected to the deed for the land, that the description it contains is too indefinite and uncertain, and that no extrinsic facts can be resorted to, for the purpose of showing its application to the land attached. To make this objection availing to the appellant, under the exception to the <em>mere admissibility of the deed in evidence, </em>the court must see that it presents a case of incurable patent ambiguity, such, as with the aid of extrinsic facts, could not be made intelligible with any degree of certainty, for it is not every case of patent ambiguity that is beyond the aid of extrinsic circumstances. The instrument must be very defective upon its face, to justify the court in adjudging it void, as incapable of' being made intelligible and certain by extrinsic facts. This the court below was required to determine of this deed, upon the objection to its admissibility. It is proper therefore for us-to see, in what cases instruments may be sustained by a resort to extrinsic aid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">In <em>Colpoys vs. Colpoys, </em>1 <em>Jacob, </em>451, it was said by Sir Thomas Plumer, Master of the Solis, that \u201cwhen the person or thing is designated on the face of the instrument, by terms-imperfect and equivocal, admitting, either of no meaning at all by themselves, or of a variety of different meanings, referring; tacitly or expressly to extrinsic circumstances, it has never-been Considered an objection to the reception of evidence of' those circumstances, that the ambiguity was patent, manifested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>on the face of the instrument. When a legacy is given to a man by his surname, and the Christian name is not mentioned, is not that a patent ambiguity? Yet it is decided that, is admissible. <em>Price vs. </em>Price, 4 Ves., 680.\u201d The classification of ambiguities, as stated by Lord Bacon, has not been adhered to, and his rules for the reception and rejection of evidence have been greatly modified, as will be seen by the authorities. <em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing., 553, Smith vs. Jersey. </em>1 <em>Pet., </em>652, <em>Barry vs. Coombe. </em>13 <em>Pet., </em>98, <em>Bradley vs. Steam Packet Co. </em>1 <em>Mason, </em>11, <em>Peisch vs. Dickson.

There is no patent ambiguity. The only difficulty that could arise, would be in comparing the description in the deed with external objects, and giving it an application. It is in doing this, that it may be found that things have been in some immaterial <em>respecta </em>misdescribed, or that inaccurate language or terms have been <em>used; </em>but in neither case is the deed made void. If it be a partial misdescription only, the instrument will be effective, provided there is sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the paper to justify the application of evidence. So much of the description as is false, \u2022is rejected upon the principle, <em>\u2018 falsa demonstrate non nocet cum de corpora </em>constat.\u201d 8 <em>Bing., </em>244, <em>Miller vs. Travers. </em>4 <em>Mass., </em>196, <em>Worthington vs. Hylyer. 7 G. &amp; J., </em>251, <em>Creswell vs. Lawson. </em>\u201cLanguage may be inaccurate without being <em>ambiguous, </em>and it may be ambiguous though perfectly accurate.

B., the description though inaccurate would occasion no ambiguity.\u201d \u201cThe language may be inaccurate, but if the court can determine the meaning of this inaccurate language, without any other guide than a knowledge of the single facts upon which \u2014 from the very nature of language in general \u2014 Its meaning depends, the language, though inaccurate, cannot be ambiguous.\u201d And \u201cthe circumstance, that the inaccuracy is <em>apparent upon the face of the instrument, cannot, </em>in principle, alter the case. <em>Wigram on Extrinsic Evidence, </em>175, 176. 1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., sec. </em>299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The land conveyed by the deed in question, is described as \u201call that farm or tract of land lying and being in Washington county, in the State of Maryland, near Hagerstown, late the estate of-Dali, containing one hundred and seventy-one acres of land more or less.\u201d This description alone, taken in connection with the extrinsic facts, that the grantors owned but the one farm in Washington county, and that it had been a part of John R. Dall\u2019s estate, near Hagerstown, containing nearly the exact number of acres as specified in the deed, and that they never, at any time, owned any other land in Washington county, puts it beyond doubt as to what land was intended. It could, in fact, have intended no other land than that attached, because the grantors owned none other in that county. 4 <em>Mass., </em>204. <em>Shep. Touch., </em>247 to 250.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">This is the case of an attachment levied on land, credits and com. The garnishees admitted, in one case, the indebtedness, and in another, the possession, of a certain quantity of com, the property of the defendants. There is no question, whatever, as to the correctness of the claim of the plaintiff, the present'appellant. By an agreement filed in the cause it appears, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>that separate cases were docketed against the several garnishees, which have b\u00a7en <em>stetted </em>to abide the decision in this one. Independently of this agreement, the cases would necessarily be separate, and distinct judgments pronounced in each. The rule, in this regard, is stated with correctness by Mr. Evans, at pages 98, 99 of his work on Practice. He says: where \u201cthe attachment has been laid in the hands of several garnishees, severally, that is, unconnectediy, or of some jointly and of other separately from them, and either jointly or severally, among themselves, the proceedings are somewhat different. Each several garnishee, and each set of joint garnishees, must then appear severally, even although they may all employ the same attorney. The clerk then dockets as many suits as there are separate appearances, and each of these is regarded as a separate cause, and goes on without any reference to the other, than is necessary to secure the defendant against the risk of the plaintiff\u2019s getting more than one satisfaction for his debt.\u201d This being so, the present appeal is confined to the validity of the attachment levied on the <em>land, </em>and this depends entirely upon the solution of the question, whether the deed of the 5th of October 1857, offered in evidence, and the other testimony objected to, but admitted by the court, be sufficient to show .title in the claimants so as to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to condemnation. It has riot been pretended that the deed, in terms, covered the particular land levied upon, but, it was insisted, that the description in the deed was of a character to create such an ambiguity as would authorize the introduction of other evidence to explain its true application. We are clearly of opinion, that the deed does not present any ambiguity, either patent or latent. It gives the devolution of the title and describes the property with clearness, and neither the one nor the other corresponds with the land levied upon, which is conceded to have been that of the defendants. The evidence adduced to show the identity of the land conveyed, with that levied upon, in no-sufficient way connects itself with the description in the deed, to overrule and set it aside. Although, it was said, that if the deed of the 5th of October 1857, did not cover the land in question, and for that reason was inadmissible, yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that If <em>any part </em>of the evidence was admissible, it would have been error in the court to have rejected the whole, and that as the assignment of the personalty of the assignors was admissible to change the title to it, the court did right, in overruling the objection. \u00edt is undoubtedly true, that if testimony be' offered generally, and it be objected to in <em>entirety, </em>and any pari of it be admissible, it is error to reject the whole. The cases of <em>Budd vs. Brooke, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>220, <em>Pegg, et al., vs. Warford, </em>7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>582, and <em>Carroll\u2019s Lessee vs. The Granite Manufacturing Co., </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>403, are sufficient authority for this doctrine. But the question here is, was any part of the evidence admissible? Clearly not,. The only question involved in this case (the claim of the plaintiff being admitted) was the title to the land, and if the deed, offered in evidence, did not embrace it, the assignment of the personalty could not make that relative and competent which was irrelevant and incompetent evidence, because the assignment of the personalty was also irrelevant and incompetent to establish any thing in issue. But, were it possible to try all the cases under the issues joined in this one, there would still be some doubt as to the admissibility of the evidence, and this doubt grows out of the true meaning of the admission in reference to the deed of assignment from F. &amp; Alexander H. Dodge to Matthews and Chapman, dated the 5th day of October 1857. Inasmuch as this case must be sent back to have a judgment of condemnation entered against the land, and inasmuch as-this court cannot enter judgments in the other cases,- it is unnecessary we should employ any effort in the interpretation of the admission, and, therefore, content ourselves with merely stating a few principles which must govern the matter in the' circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">If, by the admission of the \u201cdue execution\u201d of the deed-last referred to, it was designed to give to the office copy the' same effect as if the original had been produced and proved,\u2022 then the admission should be so amended as to express that intention. Without that there is no sufficient, evidence of the' existence of the assignment, because the only evidence of any such instrument .having been executed, is an <em>office copy </em>of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>which - is no evidence whatever, first, because if there was a sufficient delivery, then there was- no need to record the assignment, and, therefore, an <em>office copy </em>is not evidence.

Supposing the symbolical delivery to be sufficient in law, yet the claimants should have proved the execution of the assignment by testimony other than an office copy.-</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ACd\">(Decided June 3rd, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The objection to this deed of assignment, chiefly relied upon by the appellees, in this court, was, that it is fraudulent and void on its face, under the statute of <em>13th Elizabeth..- </em>That seems, from the record, to have been the only objection taken below. This court has fully considered that question, and a majority of it are of opinion that such objection cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">From what we have said, it follows, that the court erred in permitting the testimony to go to the jury, and that, in this case, the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment of condemnation of the land. It may be further remarked, that whatever doubt there might be, as to where the title in the corn would be,, if not severed from the realty, in the suit in which it has been, attached, no such question can arise, inasmuch as the garnishee, in his answer to the interrogatories, admits that he holds it as the property of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.-</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
