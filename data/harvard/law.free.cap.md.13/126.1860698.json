Marshall </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">1st. No exception was taken by the defendant to the proof of the contents of the trunk, or to the proof of their loss, and since the act of 1854, ch. 323, it is contended that as to a part of the property proved to have been lost, for which an innkeeper, as such, would not have been responsible at common law, he is now responsible by the provisions of that act. Moreover, there is no question raised by either exception as to the pleadings; on the contrary, the defendant\u2019s prayer concedes a liability on his part, other than the law would impose,if this be regarded as an action against him as inn-keeper simply : for not only did the defendant fail to except to the proof of the value and loss pf the articles for which, as <em>innkeeper </em>only, he would not have been responsible, but, by higprayer, he concedes that he would have been responsible for the loss of these same articles, and that, too, <em>after </em>they had been carried away from the <em>inn, </em>and after the plaintiff had ceased to be a guest thereat, provided the loss occurred by cob lusion or fraud of the defendant. Under these circumstances, no issue with regard to the pleadings is raised by the exceptions, and the correctness of the instructions given, and of the refusal to grant the defendant\u2019s prayer, is to be determined by a consideration of the law applicable to the cases assumed in these prayers, and without reference to the sufficiency of the pleadings to meet these casos. The point as to the pleads ings cannot now be made. <em>Act of </em>1825, <em>ch. </em>117. 1 <em>Gill, </em>227, <em>Leopard vs. Ches, &amp; Ohio Canal Co. </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>421, <em>Stockton vs. Frey. </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>5, <em>Brooke vs. Waring. </em>1 <em>Md.

Rep., </em>116, <em>Owings vs. Jones. </em>And even if the court should be of opinion that-the exceptions raise any question as to the sufficiency of the declaration; it is contended that the evidence is pertinent to the second count, which is a special count for negligence in performing a duty assumed by the defendant, and that the ruling of the court below correctly declares the law applicable to the case made in the second count, and sustained by the evidence. <em>Coggs vs. Bernard, </em>1 <em>Ld. Ray., </em>909, and 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Lead.

But even if the correctness of the instruction is to be determined with reference to the pleadings, it is right. The ground of an inn-keeper\u2019s liability is the profit he received from keeping the goods or entertaining the guest, if the keeping of the goods yield no profit. <em>5 H. &amp; J., </em>52, <em>Towson vs. Havre-de-Grace Bank. </em>9 <em>Pick., </em>285, <em>Mason vs. Thompson. 2 Ld. Ray., </em>866, <em>Yorke vs. Grenaugh. 25 Wend., </em>653, <em>Peet vs. McGraw. </em>In this case the defendant received pay from the plaintiff for the <em>entire day </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s departure, and the act by the plaintiff, in calling to pay his bill, was in strict accordance with the rules of the inn. The innkeeper ought not, on grounds of public policy, to be discharged from liability by the fact of a guest leaving, under the circumstances described in this case, for a guest could not otherwise be safe. He could not get his property without paying-his bill, and he could not pay his bill without discharging the liability of the inn-keeper, if the doctrine contended for be correct. Although it is conceded, that to charge a defendant, as inn-keeper, for the loss of goods, the loss must occur while the goods are in his custody as inn-keeper, and, as a general rule, while they are in the curtilage, yet it is insisted, that the inn-keeper could always extend his liability by his own act, and that the <em>custody </em>required by the rule is to be understood according to the custom of the inn and the duties as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>turned by the inn-keeper, which, it is submitted, are more extensive now than when guests alighted at or departed from the door of the inn. 8 <em>Coke, 32, Calye\u2019s Case, </em>in 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Lead.

The defendant\u2019s prayer was properly rejected, because it was erroneous in view of other facts in evidence which it does not bring before the court. 3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>450, 462, <em>Bosley vs. Chesapeake Ins. Co. </em>It requires the jury to find that the defendant was <em>licensed, </em>which the law presumed, and which also was not necessary to make him responsible. 1 <em>Gill, </em>503, <em>Casey\u2019s lessee vs. Inloes. </em>It also submits the <em>legal </em>question of the <em>regularity </em>of the license to the jury. It is erroneous in excusing the defendant for loss while the property was in the custody of his servant, provided there was no <em>fraud </em>or <em>collusion </em>of the defendant; <em>negligence </em>would have made him liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">4th. The objection that the property lost was, in part, plate, and something other than baggage, cannot be sustained. It is respectfully submitted, that the cases cited by this court, to sustain the <em>dictum </em>in the case of <em>Pettigrew vs. Barnum, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>434, do not establish the doctrine embraced in the <em>dictum, </em>and that the doctrine is opposed by a large number of cases. It is also respectfully submitted, that this court was not called upon in that case to decide directly upon the question of the kind of property, for the loss of which an inn-keeper is responsible. To sustain this view, the following authorities are relied on: 5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>47, <em>Towson vs. Havre-de-Grace Bank.

The amount of the whole</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">A witness named Gwinn testifies, that on or about the 17th of April 1855, as the agent of the plaintiff, he called upon the defendant in relation to the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s trunk, when he stated that it had been delivered to Barnum\u2019s porter, according to the usage of the house. And that if there was any loss, he, defendant, would hold Barnum\u2019s porter answerable for it. This conversation was about a month after the trunk had been lost. Some weeks afterwards, whilst passing the hotel, the defendant\u2019s clerk called the witness in and showed him a black leather trunk, and asked him if it belonged to the plaintiff. He could not identify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">The plaintiff also proved by Harback, that during the mouth of March 1855, the witness was the clerk in the office of the hotel kept by the defendant, on Baltimore street, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>from the 14th day of said month, until the morning of the 17th, the plaintiff was a guest in said house.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Upon cross-examination this witness states, that on the morning of the 17th day of March 1855, before 12 o\u2019clock, M., the plaintiff called at the office, and told witness that he intended to leave, and then paid his bill up to that time, and that what he paid for the room entitled him to its use for the entire day. When the bill was thus paid, the plaintiff requested witness to keep his trunk for him \u201cuntil 4 o\u2019clock, P. M., in the afternoon of said day, and then have it sent to the steamer Virginia, or Gladiator,\u201d witness does not remember \u25a0which, but that they both belonged to the same line. The plaintiff left with the witness twenty-five cents to pay the porter, and then left the said hotel and did not return again. Sometime after the plaintiff had left, witness sent word to Barnum\u2019s porter to call at 4 o\u2019clock for said trunk, there being no regular porter connected with said hotel, and it being the custom of the house to employ said porter when baggage was to be taken away.' At 4 o\u2019clock the porter called and witness had the trunk brought down by servants and delivered to him, and told him to take it to the steamer which the plaintiff had named; witness cannot now recollect whether it was to be taken to the steamer Virginia or Gladiator, but is certain, that at the time he directed the porter to carry it to the right boat, and gave the porter twenty-five cents, the sum which the plaintiff had left with him to pay the porter. This witness further states, that when he caused the trunk to be delivered to the porter, he believes that it contained all the articles mentioned in the schedule filed by the plaintiff in this cause, and that none of them were lost while the trunk was in the hotel. He did not particularly examine the trank when brought down, but saw it and was near it, and thinks it was in order. He saw no marks of its having been opened. That when the witness Gwinn called about the loss of the trunk, the defendant, on being informed of its loss, sent for the said porter and told him that it must be found; that after some time the trunk was found in the office of the Norfolk boats, in this city, broken open and the contents stolen, and was, in that condition, brought by said porter to the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The plaintiff also proved by Mr. Cassin, that before the present action was brought, he, as attorney for the plaintiff, called upon the defendant in relation to the loss of the trunk, when the defendant said to witness, that there was the trunk, pointing at a trunk lying there; the defendant made no further offer to deliver it, nor did witness demand its delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendant then gave in evidence the following as the rules of his hotel, at the time when the plaintiff was a guest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\n<em>\u201cRules of Giles\u2019 Hotel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201c1st.

The jury gave a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $102.55, on which judgment was rendered, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The defendant contends: \u201cThat the plaintiff having, on the morning of the 17th March 1855, given notice to the agent of the defendant of his intention to quit the inn, and also at the time of said notice, having paid his bill, his relation as a guest was destroyed; and that the defendant is not liable in this action for any loss that may have subsequently occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">It is also contended by the defendant: \u201cThat the plaintiff having declared specially against the defendant as an innkeeper, it was not competent for the court to instruct the jury, under the pleadings, that if they found a collateral undertaking on the part of the defendant, whereby he undertook to deliver the plaintiff\u2019s goods at a place without the inn, that the defendant was liable in this action npon such undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">It will be seen, however, that, by this appeal, we are only called upon-to revise the decisions of the court below, in grant-\u00bb ing the plaintiff\u2019s prayer and refusing that of the defendant.And neither of these prayers points or refers to the pleadings,' Whether they were decided correctly or not, must, therefore, depend, not upon the state of the pleadings, but upon the evidence to which they alone make reference. <em>Dorsey vs. Dashiell, </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>207, and the cases therein referred to on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">From the testimony of the clerk, in connection with the rules of the house, it appears to have been the usage of the hotel to send the baggage of guests to steamboats or railroad cars by a particular porter, when there was such baggage to be sent. It is also in proof, that on the 17th of March, before 12 o\u2019clock, M., the plaintiff paid his bill, which payment entitled him to the use of the room for the <em>entire day) </em>that he then informed the clerk -lie intended leaving, aud requested the clerk to send his baggage, at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, to a particular steamer; and at the time of making this request, the plaintiff left twenty-five cents to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>for the porterage of the trunk. The further testimony of the clerk is, that at 4 o\u2019clock on the 17th of March, the trunk was delivered to the porter usually employed for such purpose, with instructions to cany it to the steamer directed by the piaintilF, and 25 cents were paid to the porter. Some weeks afterwards the trunk-was found broken open and the contents stolen. When found it was at the ofiice of the Norfolk boats in Baltimore, and there is no proof that it ever was at the steamer directed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">With such proof before us, we cannot assent to the position that the defendant is not liable for any loss which occurred subsequently to the morning of the 17th of March, when the plaintiff gave notice of his intention to leave the inn, and paid his bill. For he was, in fact, entitled to the use of the room for the entire day, and his baggage was left behind, in the eare of the clerk, he undertaking to send it to the steamer, at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">in <em>Dickinson vs. Winchester and </em>another, 4 <em>Cush. Rep., </em>114, it appears that the keeper of a public house, in the neighborhood of a railroad station, gave public notice that he would furnish a free conveyance, to and from the cars, to all passengers, with their baggage, traveling thereby, who should eome to his house as guests, and for which purpose he employed the proprietors of certain carriages, to take ali such passengers, free of charge to them, and to convey them and tbeir baggage to his house. A traveller by the cars, to whom this arrangement was known, having employed one of the carriages, thus provided, to take him and his baggage to such public house, it was held, that if his baggage was lost or stolen through a want of due care or skill on the part of the proprietor of the carriage, or his driver, the keeper of the house would be liable therefor in <em>assumpsit </em>or case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The court thought it immaterial whether the defendants were to be charged as inn-keepers, who assumed the care of the guest and his baggage at the station, instead of waiting until he came to their own door or stable, or whether they were to be considered as common carriers of persons, and .therefore responsible for passengers\u2019 baggage. In eithe,r case,</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\"><em>u </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the profit to be derived, by the inn-keeper, from the entertainment of the traveller, as a guest, was held to be the consideration for the undertaking, and that such consideration formed the basis of an implied promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">It was argued in defence, that the proprietor of the carriage, whose driver lost the trunk, was carrying on a separate employment, and therefore he, and not the defendants, were responsible for the loss. But notwithstanding this argument, the defendants were considered to be liable for the baggage lost or stolen through a want of due care or skill on the part of the proprietor of the carriage or his driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, we do not think that the liability of the defendant, for the baggage, as innkeeper, ceased when the trunk was delivered to the porter, but that the defendant continued to be responsible for any loss which resulted from the negligence or mistake of the clerk or porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The baggage was that of a guest, who, after paying his bill was entitled to the use of his room for the whole day. The agent of the landlord undertook to keep the trunk until 4 o\u2019clock, and then send it to a particular steamer. And such an undertaking, it seems, was consistent with what a traveling guest had a perfect right to expect, in accordance with the rules and usage of the house</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The conveniences and facilities held out to travellers, are matters which influence them in selecting hotels for their accommodation. And the profits which inkeepers derive from the entertainment of their guests, afford considerations for such undertakings as the one here alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">There was evidence tending to show, that instead of the trunk having been taken to the steamer directed by the plaintiff, it was carried to the office of the Norfolk boats, and there broken open and its contents stolen; and if the jury believed it to be so, they might have inferred, that the loss was occasioned by the negligence or mistake of the clerk of the hotel, or of the porter. And for each of them, as his agent, the defendant is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Notwithstanding the views which have been expressed, w\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>think the plaintiff\u2019s prayer should not have been granted. It fully authorized the jury to understand, that if they believed the matters presented for their consideration, to be true, the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the trunk, and the whole contents thereof. And that they did so understand, is shown by the amount of the verdict. The articles contained in the trunk, however, are not, <em>all &lt;of them., </em>such as can be properly considered the baggage of a traveller; and for those which are not such baggage, the defendant is riot responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In <em>Pettigrew vs. Barnum, et al., </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>449, 450, the liability of an innkeeper for a traveller\u2019s baggage, was under consideration. And the court then said: \u201cWe do not think the term embraces merchandize or other valuables not designed for use, or personal convenience on the journey. It is not within the implied contract of the landlord, that he will be responsible for all goods which may be brought to his house, merely because they happen to be in a trunk.\u201d It is also said: \u201cIn the present case, we find that the trunk contained silver knives, forks and spoons. For them the appellees w'ere not responsible. If a party may recover for these, why may he not for many dozens of the same articles, or for any description and amount of plate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">According to the ruling in that case, there were articles in the trunk of the plaintiff, for which the defendant cannot be held responsible, the same not properly constituting pairs of a traveller\u2019s baggage. These are the Colt\u2019s pistol and the silver tea spoons. And inasmuch as there is no proof that the plaintiff was either a physician, a surgeon, or a student of medicine, we do not think he could recover for the case of surgical instruments or the tonsil cutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The defendant\u2019s prayer was properly refused* tf it had been granted, the plaintiff would have been excluded from any right to recover, if the jury believed the matters therein set forth, unless they also believed, that the loss was occasioned <em>by collusion or fraud, on </em>the part of the defendant or his agent*</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Conceding the matters stated in the prayer to be all true; and even conceding that the relation of guest ceased, when the plaintiff left the hotel, still it would have been erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to re* cover, unless they believed the loss was occasioned by <em>collusion or fraud, </em>on the part of the defendant or his agent.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AT\">(Decided March 10th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">It follows from what has been said, that the judgment must be reversed and a <em>procedendo </em>ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\"><em>Judgment reversed and procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
