That if they believe from the evidence, (hat the defendant agreed with the plaintiff to pay the debt contracted by John S.

That if they find from the evidence, that the bond or promissory note of John S.

Lanahan </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-9\">1st. The promise of the defendant, that \u201che would see the bill paid, as he expected his brother, John S. Cropper, to send some produce to market, consigned to him, in three months, and he would appropriate the amount to pay the bill,\u201d is not tantamount to a promise to pay the debt, so as to make the undertaking an original one. 2 <em>Stephen\u2019s N. </em>P., 1963, 1964; 1 <em>Ld. Ray., </em>224. 2 <em>Parson\u2019s on Cont., </em>499. The other words, that \u201che would see the bill paid,\u201d or \u201che would see the bill paid if John S. Cropper purchased the goods of the plaintiff,\u201d are identical with the words, \u201cI will pay if he do not,\u201d which in <em>Conolly vs. Kettlewell &amp; Wilson, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>263, were held to import a collateral and not an original liability on the part of the party promising, where, as in this case, the original party to whom the goods were sold, remained liable on the same contract. In this case the goods were charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>upon the books of the plaintiff to John S.- Cropper, and he' remained liable therefor. The undertaking of the defendant,was, therefore, a <em>collateral </em>liability. The.true test in such cases now is, was the party purchasing the goods or undertaken for <em>liable </em>on the contract? <em>Smith\u2019s Law of Cont., </em>43, 44.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\">2nd. There was sufficient evidence in the cause, to authorise the court to grant the defendant\u2019s prayers, and refer to the jury the existence of the facts therein set forth, and if the jury found the facts there stated, the legal effect of such a contract, which the court was bound to pronounce, is well settled in the cases of <em>Elder vs. Warfield, 7 H. &amp; J., </em>392, and <em>Conolly vs. Kettlewell &amp; Wilson, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>260.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\">3rd. If these views are correct, the instruction granted by the court was clearly wrong in point of law. It rvas also defective in <em>formf </em>because it <em>assumes </em>that the goods were sold, which fact should have been left to the finding of the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-7\"><em>Whitney and Thomas </em>for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-8\">1st. The court below was right in refusing the appellant\u2019s prayers, because the first <em>assumes </em>the fact, that the debt was contracted by John S. Cropper, and the second, the fact, that a bond or .promissory note of John S. Cropper, was taken by the plaintiff \u2014 facts which should have been left to the jury, ta find from all the evidence in the cause. 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>162, <em>Gaither vs. Martin. </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>244, <em>Rail Road Co., vs. Woodruff. </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>259, <em>Brooks vs. Elgin. </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., 71, Crawford vs. Berry. </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>260, <em>Conolly vs. Kettlewell &amp; Wilson. </em>The second prayer was also calculated to mislead the jury, inasmuch as it assumes the right of the defendant to a verdict on the facts therein stated, when all the facts and circumstances in the cause should have been left to them, from which to find the nature and character of the defendant\u2019s undertaking. <em>7 H. &amp; J., </em>392, <em>Elder vs. Warfield. </em>1 <em>Pet., </em>476, <em>De Wolf vs. Rabaud. Brown on Statute of Frauds, </em>sec. 199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-9\">2nd. The court below was also right in the instruction given to the jury, as it left to them to find from all the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>circumstances in the cause, to whom the credit was given in the sale of the goods, and if that credit was given to the defendant, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>392, <em>Elder vs. Warfield. Brown on Statute of </em>Frauds, <em>sec. </em>199.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-4\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYY\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">There is no substantial difference between this case and <em>Conolly vs. </em>Kettlewell, <em>et </em>al., 1 <em>Gill, </em>260, in which it was decided, that the defendant could not be held answerable, where he had promised to pay for goods, if another person did not, such words importing a collateral and not an original liability. It was laid down as a general rule, that wherever the party undertaken for is originally liable on the same contract, the promise to answer for that liability is collateral, and must be in writing, as if one gives credit to another for goods sold and delivered, on the promise of a third person :ito see him paid.\u201d We cannot doubt, that John S. Cropper was liable for the goods delivered to him, or that the plaintiff considered him as debtor for them. They were selected by and charged to him, as was the state of facts in 1 Gill, 260; and there is nothing to show that he was not credited by the plaintiff. Sometimes the question arises, to whom was the credit given at the time of the sale and delivery of the goods, and it may depend on inferences to be drawn from ah the facts and circumstances attending the transaction, as in <em>Elder vs. Warfield, </em>7 <em>H. </em>&amp; J. 391; <em>Northern Central R. R. Co., vs. Prentiss, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>119; <em>Smith\u2019s Law of Contracts, </em>34, (56 <em>Law Lib.) </em>But if the court see that the evidence is not legally sufficient to charge the defendant, as upon an.original undertaking not collateral to the liability of another, there is no propriety in sending the parties to a jury. Hence, in <em>Conolly vs. Kettlewell, </em>the Court of Appeals, deeming the words insufficient to create such a responsibility, reversed the judgment and refused a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We are of opinion that the prayers on the part of the defendant were properly refused, because, the first assumes that the debt was contracted by John S. Cropper, when the question was, whether it was the original debt of the defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and, as to the second, because it assumes the existence of a bond or note from John S. Cropper to the plaintiff.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AHo\">( Decided March 17th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The first instruction, on the part of the court, was erroneous, in assuming that goods were sold; and also, because it left to the jury to find, that they were sold on the credit of the defendant, when the evidence was not legally sufficient to warrant such finding. 1 <em>Gill, </em>260. It was also defective in not requiring the jury to find the delivery as well as the sale of the goods. <em>7 G. &amp; J., </em>28, <em>Cole vs. Hebb. </em>We do not say, that in every case where the words, \u201cI will see the bill paid,\u201d nre used, they necessarily import a collateral undertaking, and thatin no such case could the plaintiff recover, but, that where they stand alone, as here, they must be so interpreted. . If accompanied by other words or facts, sufficient to authorise a jury to find from all the evidence, that credit was given to the party using them, a different result might follow. Such was the case in 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>391, where the defendant was held responsible; but this appeal is decided on the authority of <em>Conolly vs. Kettlewell &amp; Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and no procedendo.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
