The same cause of action having befen once fully and' fairly tried between the sain\u00e9 parties in the same court,- that should be final and conclusive:' <em>Interest reipublicce ut sit finis litium;\u201d </em>and <em>Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadefn causa.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, </em>131, 135.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">2nd. The case of <em>Offutt vs. Offutt, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>178, is not applicable, because there the former judgment was not pleaded in bar, but given in evidence under the gen\u00e9ral issue of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the court in that case say, (page 181,) \u201cit is made a question, whether the record of this proceeding <em>thus conducted,- </em>and thus eventuating,- is a bar to a recovery in- the present action, or can be given in evidence as such.\u201d The'r\u00e9cord sought to be given in evidence was not the same in th\u00e9\u2019 subject matter as the case reported, for the tacked account had not been an object of controversy in the former suit. The judgment for the defendant in the former action, for costs, was not in effect a judgment of <em>non pros. </em>The Act of 1835, ch. 201, sec. 4, was passed since the decision of <em>Offutt vs.Offutt, </em>and it requires such a judgment, where the verdict of the j.\u00fary is for a.sum below the jurisdiction of the court, and takes this case out of the rule applicable to cases of ordin\u00e1ry <em>nonpros., </em>and to the case of <em>Offutt vs. Offutt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-9\">3rd. \u00edt was competent for the jury to find the amount- due' the plaintiff, though, as that sum was below the jurisdiction of the court, no judgment could be entered up for it. Now,- the sum due the plaintiff being, by the jury on the former trial, ascertained to be less than $50) no action could be maintained for it, or upon the same subject matter in the Circuit court. The verdict of the jury fixed the jurisdiction of the court,- and the judgment must pass. As a full trial was had, and the jurisdiction fixed by the' verdict of the jury, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>judgment of the court rendered as required by the acts of Assembly upon such a finding. It is a conclusive bar in this' cause under the pleadings. See 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>254, <em>Ott vs. Dill. </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>248, <em>Carter vs. Tuck.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-5\"><em>Richard H. Alvey, </em>for the appellee\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">Moved the court to dismiss the appeal, because the same was taken from a judgment on demurrer, and not from the final judgment in the cause, and in support of this motion referred to the case of <em>Wheeler, et al., vs. State, use of Bateman's Adm\u2019rs, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>33, and <em>Boteler &amp; Belt vs. State, use of Chew's creditors, </em>7 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">He then argued, that if the appeal could be entertained, the question made by the plea and demurred to, admits of no discussion. The plea states the amount of the former verdict to bo $40, a sum less than sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the court. What legal proposition can be plainer, than that where a court has no jurisdiction it can render no valid or effective judgment.? If the court had even proceeded and rendered judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff,Tor the $40, such judgment would have been a simple nullity, and without the least force to conclude the plaintiff in another action. \u2018 But there tvas no judgment whatever rendered upon the verdict. The parties were simply dismissed for want of jurisdiction to determine their controversy, the defendant taking judgment for his costs. The matter in litigation was left altogether unadjudicated, undisposed of by judgment for want of jurisdiction to render a valid and binding judgment. The judgment relied on, and pleaded as a bar to this action, is that for the defendant\u2019s costs only. Upon what principle can such a judgment be made a bar to this action? The case of <em>Ofutt vs. Offutt, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>178, is in all particulars conclusive of this, if it required authority for a matter so plain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-8\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap1\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The arheadment of the record in this case shows, that upon the trial of the issues of fact, in the Circuit court, a final' judgment was rendered against the appellant.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A_U\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>(Decided April 28th, 1859.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">This distinguishes the case from the principal decided in 7 <em>Gill, </em>33, <em>Wheeler vs. State, use of Admr\u2019s of Bateman. </em>The motion to dismiss the appeal must be overruled. The case being properly before us, the only question for our decision arises upon the demurrer to the third plea. This question is identical with the one decided by the former Court of Appeals, in 2 <em>Harris &amp; Gill, </em>178, <em>Offutt vs. Offutt. </em>There it was held, that \u201cthe record of an action of <em>assumpsit </em>between the same parties, in which the jury assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at a less sum than $50, and the court for want of jurisdiction gave judgment for-defendant, treating the verdict as a nullity, is no evidence of the former recovery of the debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff, nor can it operate as a bar in another action for the same debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">To avoid the effect of that decision, the appellant has referred to the 4th section of the act of 1835, ch. 201, which altered the legal effect of such a verdict. But, by the act of March session 1841, ch. 64, sec. 1, the act of 1835, ch. 201, was repealed, so far as relates to Washington county, leaving the law, in this respect, where it stood at the time of the decision of <em>Offutt vs. Offutt, </em>which we regard as conclusive of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
