The trial judge determined that no such duty existed and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant fire insurance company and in favor of May Linnington, Inc. (Linnington) variously described as either an agent or a broker or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>While we have been considerably hampered by the absence of findings by the trial judge, with respect to defendant fire insurance company, the harm (if not the inconvenience) is minimized, because no arrangement, custom or course of dealing between plaintiffs and the company, other than the ordinary insurer-insured relationship, is anywhere suggested and we are convinced there was no other. In such case we are persuaded by reason and by substantial authority elsewhere that neither the insurer nor its agent has a legal duty to give notice of the expiration of a policy, generally on the cogent ground that the insured is charged with knowledge of the expiration date stated in the policy. <em>Shepard v.

W. </em>2d 408 (Tex. Civ. App. 1965); 13A <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 7642 at 410 (1976). See <em>Norkin v. United Stales Fire Ins. Co., </em>237 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 435, 47 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>15 (D. Ct. App. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">This view seems particularly appropriate in New Jersey where the Legislature has expressly authorized the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance (now the Commissioner of Insurance; see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:1C-1 <em>et seq., </em>and especially <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:10-3 and 17:110-8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\"><em>r </em>* * to direct, by rule or regulation as hereinafter provided, that insurance companies organized under the laws of this State or organized to do business in this State, shall include provisions in policies of insurance written by any such company in this State, wher.eby 30 days\u2019 written notice shall be given; (1) to the insured, of the cancellation of any such policy; and, (2) to any desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>nated mortgagee not named therein as the insured of the cancellation of any interest in such policy; and, (3) to the insured, of intent not to renew any such policy. <em>[N. J. S. A. </em>17:29C-1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">To date the Commissioner has not chosen to implement the statute in this respect. We are confident that the Legislature intended to commit the establishment of the notice obligation to the sole discretion of the Commissioner of Insurance in connection with policies such as that before us, for the Legislature itself undertook to require notice by the insurer of its intention not to renew in connection with automobile insurance. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>17:29C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial judge achieved the right result with respect to defendant insurance company and we affirm the judgment in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Defendant Linnington presents a different problem and here we are shackled by the absence of findings below. Our consternation has its genesis in the fact that we are simply not certain as to whether Linnington was an agent for the company or a broker holding himself out to the public and engaged by plaintiffs for their insurance needs. If Linnington was simply an agent for the company, no obligation greater than that of the company is imposed on it. On the other hand, if it was a broker, it owes to those engaging its services reasonable skill, care and diligence in the execution of the commission. <em>Rider v. Lynch, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>465, 476 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The threshold question then is what was the nature of Linnington\u2019s presence in the problem? It is referred to both as an agent and as a broker. The record is sparse with respect to its engagement, but there are some factual suggestions conducing to the reasonable conclusion that it was acting as a broker for plaintiffs. While these are barely sufficient to cause us to entertain only a doubt with regard to the summary judgment in Linnington\u2019s favor, in such case to doubt is to deny. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>67, 75 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>If it develops that there is a palpable absence of material fact with respect to this threshold question and that Linning-ton was amply an agent of the company, summary judgment in its favor is appropriate. If, on the other hand, there is an issue of fact in this regard, then the matter must be submitted on plenary hearing to the trier of the fact not only for a determination of this issue, but in the event of a determination that Linnington was a broker whose services were engaged by plaintiffs, for determination of the further issue as to whether Linnington exercised the requisite care in the execution of that commission. <em>Bates v. Gambino, </em>72 <em>N. J. </em>219 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">We affirm the judgment in favor of Camden Eire Insurance Association. We reverse the judgment in favor of May Linnington, Inc., and remand for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing. We do not retain jurisdiction. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
