A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-c\">This appeal involves a provision for extended total disability benefits contained in a contract between the Board of Education of the Township of Piscataway (board) and the Piscataway Maintenance &amp; Custodial Association (association). The contract concerned the terms and conditions of employment of maintenance and custodial workers-employed by the board and was for the period from July 1, 1973 to June 30, 1976. The issue is whether the provision in question, to the extent that it granted such benefits to employees who were qualified under the contract, exceeded the board\u2019s statutory authority under the Education Law <em>(Title </em>18A) and was thus invalid and unenforecable despite the provisions of the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-1 <em>et seq).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">On December 11, 1974 Jerry Columbis, a school custodian in the employ of the board, fell from a ladder while at work and sustained a compression fracture of one of his lumbar vertebrae. He alleged in an affidavit filed in these proceedings that the injury required hospitalization and medical treatment; that he returned to work in September 1975, but after about five weeks was unable to continue because of intense pain, and that although he later again attempted to work for several months, his physical condition forced him to stop. On March 10, 1976 Columbis applied for extended total disability leave benefits \"commencing with the expiration of my accumulated sick leave and after applying accumulated personal, floating holiday and vacation time..\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The request was not acted upon, whereupon Columbis submitted a written grievance to the board, which responded by rejecting the application on the ground that total disability had not been established medically. The association demanded arbitration of the dispute under the grievance procedure set forth in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The board then filed a verified complaint to compel the association to withdraw the arbitration demand. It alleged that the demand was premature in that the preliminary steps in the grievance procedure had not been exhausted. It alleged further that the dispute was beyond the scope of arbitration. The board obtained an order directing the association to show cause why the relief sought in the complaint should not be granted. On the return day of the order to show cause, following a short and perfunctory hearing, the trial judge entered an order \u201cdenying the relief sought in the Order to Show Cause and Complaint.\u201d The board appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The hearing below consisted essentially of the board\u2019s argument that arbitration was premature and, further, that the extended total disability provision in the contract was <em>ultra vires </em>and unenforceable. The trial judge\u2019s oral opinion follows in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">I would have to take the view, Mr. Rubin, and Mr. Birnbaum, that whether exhaustions of intermediary grievance steps, whether there has been an exhaustion is itself an arbitrable question, and that the denial of the extended siek leave related to the terms and conditions of employment is an arbitrable question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">The amendment to the PERO law vested that within the scope of arbitration as against the relief under Title 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Since the board does not argue on appeal the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, we deem it abandoned. <em>Klotz v. Lee, </em>36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>6, 12 (App. Div. 1955), app. dism. 21 <em>N. J. </em>148 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The disputed provision for extended total disability leave is contained in Article XIY, paragraph G, of the contract. Total disability is defined in it as that which (a) results from bodily injuries or disease, and (b) wholly prevents the employee from engaging in his regular occupation or assuming duties assigned by his superior, taking into consideration the nature and degree of the disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employee must be under the care of a physician. Eligible employees may apply for benefits \u201conly after the maximum sick leave days, determined by the employee, have been used to cover absence resulting from his total disability.\u201d An elaborate method of calculating benefits is established in sub-paragraph 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">a. The amount and duration of such benefits shall be determined by the employee\u2019s eurent salary, length of service, and the number of sick days utilized prior to the commencement of this benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">b. The amount of daily benefits shall be determined in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">1. The basic daily salary shall be computed by dividing the annual salary by 260.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">2. Benefit payments shall be increased by %% above the basic 45% payment for each sick day used after the first 12 working days of total disability and prior to the commencement benefit payments; e. g., an employee used 30 sick days after the first 12 working day waiting period to cover Ms absence under this program. On the basis of %% for each of these days, the percentage factor would be added to the basic 45%, or 60%. Employees in this case would be entitled to 60% of his monthly contract salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">c. Daily benefit payments shall not exceed 65% of an employees regular daily salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">d. The number of days that benefits shall be payable shall be determined by dividing the total number of days of service as an employee by 4. Except that benefits shall not be payable for a period of more than 1 calendar year, or 260 working days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>e. In no case shall benefits be payable concurrently with payments received by an employee for retirement or disability under the Social Security Program or any state employees or teachers pension plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">f. Benefits under this program shall be reduced by the amount of any Workmen\u2019s Compensation payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">g.

J. S. A. </em>18A:30-1 through 7) deals with leaves of absence for employees of boards of education. It allows all employees sick leave with full pay for a minimum of ten school days in any school year <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-2), sick leave being defined, to the extent per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tinent here, as \u201cabsence from his or her post of duty, of any person because of personal disability due to illness or injury\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>18A.-30-1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accumulation of unused sick leave is authorized <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-3). There is also a provision for the payment of full salary for up to one calendar year, without having the same charged against sick leave, to any employee unable to work because of personal injury caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, less the amount of any worker\u2019s compensation award made for temporary disability <em>(N. J. S. </em>A. 18A:30-2.1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The sections on which the board relies to support its <em>ultra vires </em>argument are <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6 and 7\u2014in particular the former, which provides that in case of absence exceeding the annual and accumulated sick leave,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">* * <em>* </em>the board of education <em>may </em>pay any such person each day\u2019s salary less the pay of a substitute, if a substitute is employed or the estimated cost of the employment of a substitute if none is employed, <em>for such length of time as may be determined by the board of education in each individual case. </em>A day\u2019s salary is defined as 1/200 of the annual salary. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Section 7 recognizes the right of the board of education</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\"><em>r </em>* * to fix either by rule or by individual consideration, the payment of salary in cases of absence not constituting sick leave, or to grant sick leave over and above the minimum sick leave as defined in this chapter or allowing days to accumulate over and above those provided for in section 18A:30-2, except that no person shall be allowed to increase his total accumulation by more than 15 days in any one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>These sections are deemed by the board to preclude it from negotiating a blanket contractual provision under which eligible employees are entitled to extended sick leave benefits as a matter of right. It asserts that its position is bolstered by determinations of both the State Commissioner of Education and the Public Employment Relations Commission (at least, as to the latter, with respect to contracts entered into prior to 1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The association disagrees. Its thesis is that the subject of sick leave relates to terms and conditions of employment and is therefore a proper subject for negotiation, and under the contract\u2019s grievance procedure, is arbitrable. Although the association\u2019s reasoning is not entirely clear, we assume its position to be that the discretionary authority of the board under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6 and 7 is not a bar to a negotiated scheme for extended sick leave or other authorized absences such as the one involved in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Unquestionably, sick leave or other leaves of absence are matters that directly and intimately affect the terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>conditions of employment. <em>Burlington Cty. Col. Fac. Ass\u2019n. v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>10, 14 (1973), and, as such, would ordinarily be a subject of mandatory negotiation between a public employer and the duly authorized representative of its employees. <em>N. J. 3. A. </em>34:13A-5.3. Eor self-evident reasons, we are not concerned on this appeal with matters predominantly of major educational policy which would be within the board\u2019s exclusive prerogative. <em>Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>17, 25-26 (1973). The question to be resolved is whether or to what extent the negotiability of a term and condition of employment, in this case extended sick leave benefits, which otherwise would be mandated by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-5.3, is circumscribed by a specific statute on the subject in Title 18A. More narrowly, it is whether in the matter of such extended leaves of absence the Legislature has specifically clothed boards of education with a managerial prerogative or discretion which they may not bargain away despite their statutory responsibility under the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A\u20141 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cof negotiating in good faith with representatives of their employees with respect to those matters which intimately and directly affect the work and welfare of their employees.\u201d <em>Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Ass\u2019n., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">A recurrent problem affecting the labor relations of boards of education and teacher associations has been the potentiality of conflict between <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-1 <em>et seq. </em>and the Education Law <em>(Title </em>18A). When the contract here involved was entered into, the Employer-Employee Eelations Act expressly stated that no provision in the act shall \u201cannul or modify any statute or statutes of this State.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-8.1. The <em>Dunellen </em>court took cognizance of this \u201cstrong qualifying statement,\u201d observing that \u201cit is our clear judicial responsibility to give continuing effect to the provisions in our Education Law <em>(Title </em>18A) without, however, frustrating the goals or terms of the Employer-Employee Relations Act * * 64 <em>N. J. </em>at 24\u201425. Thus, as we indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in <em>Red Bank Bd. of Ed. v. </em>Warrington, 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>564, 571-572 (App. Div. 1976), where <em>general </em>provisions in the Employer-Employee Relations Act and the Education Law may bear on the same subject, the question is not so much which prevails over the other, but how the two can be harmonized so as to give sensible effect to both and not to \u201cthwart and nullify the legislative design expressed in the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">But, as to possible conflicts between the Employer-Employee Relations Act and <em>specific </em>provisions in the Education Law, the court said in <em>Dunellen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">New Jersey\u2019s laws relating to education have had a long-standing provision of specific nature dealing with tenure teachers and their dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Jfi* # # $ if* $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">They have had an equally long-standing provision vesting statutory jurisdiction in the Commissioner of Education over controversies arising under the school laws which have traditionally included dismissal proceedings against tenure teachers. * * * When the Employer-Employee Relations Act * * \u2022 was passed * * * there was a blanket statement in Section 10 to the effect that no provision in the Employer-Employee Relations Act shall \u201cannul or modify any statute or statutes of this State.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-8.1. In the light of this strong qualifying statement and, absent further clarifying legislation, we are not prepared to construe the general provision in Section 7 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-5.3) authorizing the parties to agree on grievance procedures providing for \u201cbinding arbitration as a means for resolving disputes,\u201d as embodying legislative contemplation that the parties may agree on such arbitration in total replacement of the Commissioner\u2019s hearing of dismissal proceedings now required by the express terms of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:6-10. *'**\u2019* [64 <em>N. J. </em>at 28-29]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"> The import of the above seems to be that the general provisions of the Employer-Employee Relations Act relative to negotiating on matters affecting terms and conditions of employment should yield to specific sections of the Education Law dealing with the subject. This accords with well-settled law that where there is a conflict between a general statute and a specific statute on the same subject, the latter prevails. <em>Kingsley v. Wes Outdoor Advertising Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>55 <em>N. J. </em>336, 339 (1970). See <em>Red Bank Bd. of Ed. v. Warrington, supra </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 571. Further support is found in <em>Englewood Bd. of Ed. v. Englewoad Teachers, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>1, 7 (1973), in which the court said that a board of education could not agree on hours or compensation of teachers in violation of specific terms of the education laws or in violation of specific departmental rules or regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"> We do not mean to imply that nothing pertaining to sick leave or other leaves of absence may be negotiated merely because the subject is covered by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-1 <em>et seep We </em>are certain that there is ample room for negotiation on particular matters. But we need not stake out the boundaries of that which is mandatorily negotiable within the framework of that statute. Those issues are not before us. Furthermore, the statutory right of an employee to the payment of salary for up to one year during an absence occasioned by a job connected disability, without having the same charged against annual or accumulated sick leave, is not involved here. Our concern is over the payment of salary, in whole or in part, for prolonged absence beyond the allowable annual and accumulated sick leave. As to such payment, the controlling statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6, plainly leaves the matter to the discretion of the local board of education,- which <em>may </em>pay any such person each day\u2019s salary, less the pay or estimated cost of a substitute, <em>for such length of time as may be determined by the board of education in each individual case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">By granting its employees extended total disability leave benefits as a matter of right, the board in this case surrendered its statutory obligation to deal with each case on an individual basis. We are convinced that in \u00e1dopting the Employer-Employee Relations Act the Legislature did not contemplate that local boards of education' could or would abdicate their statutorily imposed management responsibilities. <em>Cf. Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>64 N. <em>J. </em>at 25. As we recently held in <em>In re Englewood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Bd. of Ed., </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>265 (App. Div. 1977), where the subject matter sought to be negotiated or arbitrated is left to the managerial discretion of the school board by legislative mandate, any agreement to the contrary is invalid and unenforceable. See also, <em>Union Cty. Bd. of Ed. v. Union Cty. Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. 1976); <em>Clifton Teachers v. Clifton Bd. of Ed., </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336 (App. Div. 1975). <em>Cf. Patrolmen\u2019s Benev. Ass\u2019n v. Elizabeth, </em>146 <em>N. J. Super. </em>257, 261 (App. Div. 1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> The association raises the further ipoint that if <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6 should be held to apply to contracts antedating the effective date of the 1974 amendments <em>(L. </em>1974, <em>c. </em>123) to the Employer-Employee Relations Act, then we should take note of the fact that a new contract containing the same provisions was entered into by the parties on June 30, 1976, and that the grievance was filed after that date. The argument is advanced that the amendments shed \u201ca new light on the entire matter.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Eeliance is placed upon the deletion from <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A\u20148.1 of the clause, \u201cnor shall any provision hereof annul or modify any statute or statutes of this State,\u201d and the substitution of the clause, \u201cnor shall any provision hereof annul or modify any pension statute or statutes of this State.\u201d But the change in language, undoubtedly the Legislature\u2019s response to the <em>Dunellen </em>court\u2019s hesitancy to construe the act more expansively in view of the \u201cstrong qualifying statement\u201d then contained in the statute, \u201cabsent further clarifying legislation,\u201d 64 <em>N. J. </em>at 29, did not, in our view, effect a wholesale repeal or modification of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>portions of <em>Title </em>18A which deal with specific matters relating to terms and conditions of employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">It is settled law that in the absence of an express re-pealer in the statute itself, indication of the intention of the Legislature to repeal a prior act or any portion thereof must be clear and compelling. <em>Loboda v. Clark Tp., </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>424, 435 (1963); <em>Henninger v. Bergen Cty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>68, 71 (1949). The court said in <em>Swede v. City of Clifton, 22 N. J. </em>303 (1956) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">The question of repeal is essentially one of legislative intention; and there is a presumption as a matter of interpretive principle and policy against an intent to effect a repeal by legislation by mere implication. The purpose to do so must be free from all reasonable doubt. Repeals by implication are not favored in the law; and where the statutory provisions may reasonably stand together, each in its own particular sphere of action, there is not the repugnancy importing the design to repeal the earlier provision, [at 317, citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is true, of course, that this doctrine is merely an aid in ascertaining legislative intent, and that \u201ca law cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, but must be considered in the context in which it was adopted.\u201d <em>N. J. State P. B. A. v. Morristown, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>160, 165 (1947). But we deem it sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>nificant here that the Legislature, though invited by the court to express itself more explicitly on the subject of statutes containing related or parallel matters, chose not to employ language from which an intent to repeal or modify could be implied, leaving it instead to the courts to determine on a case-by-case basis how the statutes may coexist harmoniously. <em>Cf. Red Bank Bd. of Ed. v. Warrington, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Accepting the association\u2019s premise that the case before us should bo viewed in the light of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34: 13A-8.1 as amended, we nevertheless find nothing in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6 which is so inconsistent with or repugnant to the general provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34.13A-5.3 relating to collective negotiations concerning terms and conditions of employment as to preclude any reasonable possibility of their standing together. <em>Cf. Garfield City Council v. Perrapato, </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>184, 193 (App. Div. 1971). We know of no reason, and none has been suggested to us, why the Legislature may not choose to include as part of the managerial prerogative and discretion of a board of education a particular matter which would otherwise be mandatorily negotiable as a term or condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We conclude that the contractual provision for extended total disability leave exceeded the authority of the Board and is invalid and unenforceable. There was thus no issue to be submitted to arbitration. The validity of any other provision in the contract relating to personal and sick leave is not before us and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The order under review is reversed; the arbitration sought by the association is permanently restrained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">It is to be noted that Columbis petitioned for and was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In response to our inquiry, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>been informed by the board\u2019s attorney that Oolumbis received his full salary through July 31, 1975, and that thereafter, during the periods he did not work, full pay was continued, in lieu of accumulated sick leave and vacation time, until April 27, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Elsewhere in Article XIY of thei contract \u201csick leave\u201d is defined to mean absence of an employee because of, among other things not significant here, <em>non jol-eonnected </em>illness or accident. We assume it is so defined because under <em>N. J. S.

D. </em>69.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In two decisions also cited by the board, the Public Employment Relations Commission held that contracts entered into prior to the adoption of the 1974 amendments <em>(L. </em>1974, <em>e. </em>123) to the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-1 <em>et seq.) </em>were governed by applicable substantive law in Title 18A, and that provisions for automatic extended sick leave benefits were inconsistent with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6. <em>Rockaway Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>PERC No. 76-44, 2 <em>N. J. Pub. Empl. Reporter </em>214 (1976) ; <em>Matawan Regional School Hist. Bd. of Ed., </em>PERC NO. 77-23, 2 <em>N. J. Pub. Empl. Reporter </em>350 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Beyond what we have said on the subject, it is also to be noted that whereas the amount of extended disability leave benefits in the contract is determined by a schedule based on the employee\u2019s current salary, length of service and number of prior sick days utilized, but not to exceed 65% of the employee\u2019s regular daily salary (reduced by the amount of any workers\u2019 compensation payable), under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:30-6 the amount payable is each day\u2019s salary less the pay or estimated cost of a substitute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The purpose of the amendment, according to the sponsor\u2019s statement appended to the bill, was to provide some clarification of the scope of negotiations between public employees and employee organizations, the importance of which was emphasized in <em>Burlington Gty. Gol. Fac. Ass\u2019n. v. Bd. of Trustees, supra; </em>and <em>Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Assn., supra. </em>It was intended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">* * *\u2019 to give greater guidance to PERO [Public Employment Relations Commission] and to the courts in making the determination whether a particular issue is within the scope of negotiations. Section 6 [N. <em>J. S. A. </em>34:13A;8.1] provides that guidance without enacting a list of negotiable subjects. Questions concerning the scope of negotiations will still be resolved on a case-by-case basis, but both the administrative agency charged with enforcing this act and the courts will be aided by the statutory standard that the impact on terms and conditions of employment of the exercise of statutory duties by a public employer is negotiable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
