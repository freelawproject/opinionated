On January 6, 1988, the district court, <em>sua sponte </em>in' a pretrial conference order, enjoined Hamilton \u201cfrom filing any new lawsuits in the Southern District of Texas\u201d without first obtaining leave of court to so proceed. Hamilton appeals this injunctive order. The claimed basis for the appealability of the district court\u2019s order is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">This Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion if necessary. <em>Benson v. Bearb, </em>807 F.2d 1228, 1229 (5th Cir.1987). Section 1292(a)(1) authorizes appeals from interlocutory orders that grant or deny an injunction. This statutory provision, however, \u201cdoes not authorize appeals from orders that compel or restrain conduct pursuant to the court\u2019s authority to control proceedings before it, even if the order is cast in injunctive terms.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Bankers Trust Co., </em>799 F.2d 1060, 1066 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">The Supreme Court most recently has reminded us that \u201c[a]n order by a federal court that relates only to the conduct or progress of litigation before that court ordinarily is not considered an injunction and therefore is not appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 1138, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988) (overruling <em>Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 55 S.Ct. 310, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935), and <em>Ettelson v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942), and hence the <em>\u201cEnelow-Ettelson </em>doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">We have long recognized a clean distinction between injunctions prohibiting proceedings in other courts, which are appeal-able, and orders, whether or not styled \u201cinjunctions,\u201d that control proceedings only in the court that issues the order. The latter are not appealable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-18\">If a district court acts to halt proceedings in <em>another </em>court, its action is indeed an injunction within the meaning of section 1292(a)(1); where a court acts to halt proceedings on <em>its own docket, </em>however, that action \u2018is not an injunction but merely a calendar order issued under the court\u2019s inherent power to regulate the administration of its own business.\u2019 <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>520 F.2d 1027, 1028 (5th Cir.1975), <em>quoting Penoro v. Rederi A/B Disa, </em>376 F.2d 125, 128 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 852 [88 S.Ct. 78, 19 L.Ed.2d 676] ... (1967). <em>See </em>16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; E. Gressman, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3923 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-19\"><em>Castanho v. Jackson Marine, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 546, 548-49 (5th Cir. Unit A Jun.1981) (court\u2019s emphasis). <em>See Tenneco Resins, Inc. v. Davy Int\u2019l, AG, </em>770 F.2d 416, 418 n. 2 (5th Cir.1985). <em>Cf. Hunt v. Bankers Trust Co., </em>799 F.2d at 1066 (injunction against \u201cthe possible proliferation of suits in <em>other </em>jurisdictions\u201d held appealable (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">The order being appealed here, which is part of a \u201cPretrial/Motion Conference Order,\u201d does not enjoin the plaintiff from filing lawsuits in other courts. Accordingly, it is not an injunction, under the controlling precedent set forth above, and hence is not appealable under section 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">We are without jurisdiction. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
