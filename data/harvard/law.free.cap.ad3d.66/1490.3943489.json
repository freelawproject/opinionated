Monroe County Department of Human Services, Respondent; Emmeran M., Appellant.</parties>\n<citation id=\"AVBE\">[885 NYS2d 813]</citation>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b1456-5\">Appeal from an order of the Family Court, Monroe County (John J. Rivoli, J.), entered March 20, 2008 in a proceeding pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b. The order, among other things, terminated respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p><p id=\"b1456-6\">It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without costs.</p><p id=\"b1456-7\">Memorandum: On appeal from an order of disposition that, inter alia, terminated his parental rights, respondent father contends that Family Court abused its discretion in refusing to issue a suspended judgment. We reject that contention. Petitioner established that, over the course of more than a year and six months, the father made little to no effort to visit the child and that, during visitation, he made minimal efforts to interact with the child <em>(see Matter of Lenny R., </em>22 AD3d 240 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>6 NY3d 708 [2006]; <em>Matter of Jason J., </em>283 AD2d 982 [2001]). Petitioner further established that the father failed to complete \u00e1 court-ordered substance abuse treatment program or to attend court-ordered domestic violence counseling <em>(see Matter of Melissa DD., </em>45 AD3d 1219, 1221 [2007], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 701 [2008]). We thus conclude that the court properly determined that a suspended judgment would not serve the best interests of the child <em>(see Matter of Ada M.R., </em>306 AD2d 920, 921 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>100 NY2d 509 [2003]; <em>see generally Matter of Michael B., </em>80 NY2d 299, 310-311 [1992]). Present\u2014 Smith, J.E, Fahey, Garni, Pine and Gorski, JJ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
