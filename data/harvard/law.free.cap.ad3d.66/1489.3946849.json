The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two counts), criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (two counts) and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (two counts).</p><p id=\"b1455-8\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.</p><p id=\"b1455-9\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury trial of, inter alia, two counts each of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.16 [1], [12]) and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree (\u00a7 220.50 [2], [3]). We reject the contention of defendant that County Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant. \u201cThe \u2018core of each defense [was not] in irreconcilable conflict with the other and . . . there [was no] significant danger, as both defenses [were] portrayed to the trial court, that the conflict alone would lead the jury to infer defendant\u2019s guilt\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Bolling, </em>49 AD3d 1330, 1332 [2008], quoting <em>People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d 174, 184 [1989]; <em>see People v Cardwell, </em>78 NY2d 996, 997-998 [1991]). Although at least one comment made by the codefendant\u2019s attorney on summation was unfavorable to defendant, that single display of hostility did not warrant severance <em>(see People v Watkins, </em>10 AD3d 665, 665-666 [2004], <em>lv denied </em>3 NY3d 761 [2004]). Also contrary to the contention of defendant, he did not establish his entitlement to severance on the ground that he would have been subjected to prejudicial cross-examination by the attorney for his codefendant had defendant testified <em>(see generally People v McGee, </em>68 NY2d 328, 333 [1986]). \u201cAt no stage of the proceedings [did] defendant establish[ ] that his potential testimony would have given the co-defendant an incentive to impeach his credibility\u201d <em>(People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number><em>Frazier, </em>309 AD2d 534, 534 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>1 NY3d 571 [2003]).
