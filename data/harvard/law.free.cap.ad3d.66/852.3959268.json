Co., </em>98 NY2d 208, 218 [2002]; <em>see Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304, 311 [1984]; <em>Essex Ins. Co. v Pingley, </em>41 AD3d 774, 776 [2007]). In the instant case, the defendants conclusively established with documentary evidence that the policy exclusion for \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u201cperforming operations\u201d for the plaintiff applied to defeat coverage for the instant loss <em>(see Metropolitan Heat &amp; Power Co., Inc. v AIG Claims Servs., Inc., </em>47 AD3d 621, 622 [2008]; <em>Brooklyn Hosp.-Caledonian Hosp. v Medical Malpractice Ins. Assn., </em>286 AD2d 410, 411 [2001]). The plaintiff failed to refute that documentary showing. Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted those branches of the defendants\u2019 motion which were pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1) and to declare that they were not obligated to defend or indemnify the plaintiff in the underlying action.
