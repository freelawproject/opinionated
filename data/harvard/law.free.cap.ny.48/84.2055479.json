Gardner resided in New York city and carried on the business of a cabinet-maker and furniture dealer in said city, and in July or August of that year one Levi Blosson, who then resided in Milwaukie, ordered a bill of furniture from him, the property described in the complaint. The order was a verbal one. The goods were to be sent to Blossom, at Milwaukie, to the care of Thomas P. Williams. Blossom was to give his acceptances for the amount of the bill on delivery of the goods at Milwaukie, payable in six months. The goods were sent according to directions about the 20th of October, 1854, and went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Milwaukie by the lakes and canals. In October, 1854, Gardner drew two drafts on Blossom for the amount of the bills and forwarded them to Milwaukie for Blossom\u2019s acceptance. They bore date, respectively, 9th and 30th October, 1854\u2014 were for $514.25 each, and each payable six months afterdate. The two drafts were returned to Gardner a few days after he sent them forward for acceptance, unaccepted. Blossom did not receive the property. He left Wisconsin for the State of California before the goods arrived, and did not return there again in some year and a half or two years. Before leaving Wisconsin, Blossom directed one Watkins to inform Mr. Gardner that he would not receive the property, and return the same to Gardner if it should arrive. Blossom never gave any bill or acceptance for the goods. About the 27th day of \u00a1November, 1854, Gardner learned that Blossom had left for California, and immediately wrote a letter to one O. \u00a1K. Watkins, and sent it to him, authorizing Watkins to take possession of all of the several boxes of furniture in store at Milwaukie, marked Levi Blossom, in his, Gardner\u2019s name, and hold them as his property until further orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">On the 24th day of \u00a1Nivember, 1854, a writ of attachment against the property of said Blossom, directed to the sheriff of Milwaukie county, was issued out of the County Court of Milwaukie county, in an action therein pending wherein \u00a1Newcomb Cleveland was plaintiff, and said Blossom was defendant, commanding him to attach so much of the property of said Blossom in his county as might be necessary to satisfy the demand in suit. In executing this writ, Herman L. Page, the then sheriff of Milwaukie county, on the 24th day of \u00a1November, 1854, seized and attached as Blossom\u2019s property the furniture in question, Cleveland having first given said sheriff a bond of indemnity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">On the 18th day of January, 1855, Gardner executed to the plaintiff in this action an instrument, of which the following is a copy: \u201c This is to certify that I have, this eighteenth day of January, 1855, for and in consideration of one hundred dollars, assigned, sold and delivered into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>hands of John S. Hicks, of the city and county of New York, my account against Levi Blossom, formerly of the city of Milwaukie, for the purchase of a large bill of cabinet furniture, amounting to $1,028.50, which lot of furniture has been seized by the sheriff of that county for the debts of the said Levi Blossom, and sold for the benefit of certain of his creditors. It is further understood and agreed that the said Hicks is to assume the responsibility and expense of suit for the collection, if possible, of said claim, and appropriate the proceeds, if any, to his use and benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">\u201cWILLIAM C.

Moore, 2 John. Ch. R., 585; Story\u2019s Eq. Jurisp., \u00a7 161.) It is the duty of the court to so construe the assignment as to give force and effect to the instrument. (Story on Con., \u00a7 660; 17 N. Y., 468; <em>McKee </em>v. Judd, 2 Kern., 626.) Any unlawful interference with property after assignment gave plaintiff right of action without demand. (N. <em>Y. Car Oil Co. </em>v. Richmond, 6 Bosw., 213; 5 Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>224.) A sheriff acts at his peril in levying. <em>(Kulkman </em>v. <em>Orser, </em>2 Duer, 242.) The sale put it out of defendant\u2019s power to comply with demand. Hone, therefore, was necessary. (Ev<em>eritt </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>6 Wend., 668; <em>La Place </em>v. <em>Auprix, </em>1 John., 406, and cases cited; <em>Cortelyeou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>2 Caine\u2019s Cases, 213; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Donadi, </em>2 E.

Y., <em>384; Duell </em>v. <em>Cudlip, 1 Hilt, 166; Cass </em>v. <em>N. Y. and N. H R. R. Co., </em>1 E. D. Smith, 522; <em>Hassell </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>1 Hilt., 128.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-9\">Earl, C.</author>\n<p id=\"A44\">It is not claimed on the part of the respondent that any title to these goods was ever vested in Blossom. The sale was void by the statute of frauds. There was no delivery, acceptance, part payment or memorandum in writing. Hence the defendant was an undoubted wrong-doer in causing this property to be attached and sold as the property of Blossom. The cause was first tried in 1860, and the plaintiff had a verdict. The defendant appealed and a new trial was granted, Mr. Justice Ingraham writing the opinion, from which we extract the following: <em>\u201c </em>The assignment transfers the bill for the prices of the goods and the goods themselves, but does not transfer any claim for damages, either for previous conversion of the goods, or for a trespass for taking them. Originally the assignment was only for the bill of the goods sold, made in January, 1855. The property was sold by the sheriff in June, 1855. The alteration of the paper, so as to include the sale of the goods, was two years after, or in 1857. It is clear the first assignment did not transfer this claim, but ratified the sale. The subsequent sale of the goods, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>after the conversion and sale with knowledge, did not give a right of action for the previous trespass or conversion. If it was of any avail, it could only he so on a demand, after the conveyance of the goods was complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">There was a second trial in 1862, and a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the General Term; and the General Term in 1863 set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial substantially upon the same grounds as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">It is important first to determine what the plaintiff really got by his purchase from Gardner. The assignment, as drawn, was clearly only of an account for the goods against Blossom. But Gardner had no account or claim against Blossom. The sale to him was entirely void. I am unable to see how making out and assigning this account ratified the previously void sale. The sale could in no legal sense be ratified; but it could be rendered valid only by a compliance with the statute of frauds, which could only be by the concurrence of both the vendor and the vendee in some one of those things required by the statute. Hence, the assignment, as originally drawn, did no harm, if it did no good.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">It must be conceded that the interlineation, so far as this case is concerned, gave the plaintiff no new rights, and in no way bettered his position. He must stand or fall by what took place when the assignment was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The plaintiff could purchase the property or a claim for damages for its conversion, without a writing. As it was of the value of more than fifty dollars, he was simply required to comply with the statute of frauds; and this he did by paying the whole or a part of the purchase-money. If, therefore, by mistake, as now claimed, the writing did not express the intention of the parties, and did not cover the property really sold, the plaintiff did not lose the property, but can show, by parol, precisely what it was that he bought. Before the commencement of this suit, the parties to the writing got together and made the interlineation, so as to conform it to their origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>nal intention; so that it no longer, as evidence, in any sense, concluded even the parties to it, as originally drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">What, then, does the parol evidence show that the plaintiff actually bought of Gardner? Most clearly, the property. Gardner, by the sale, clearly meant to give him the right to pursue and recover the property, or its value. He says it was the agreement that he should assign the goods and the claim for the property to him. I think there would be but little difficulty, upon the evidence, in also holding that he assigned to the plaintiff his claim for damages for the conversion. <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>12 JST. Y., 622; <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>17 id., 466; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>24 id., 381; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Slauson, </em>30 Barb., 276; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 N. Y., 293.) But it is not necessary to go so far in this case. He purchased the property January 18, 1855, after it had been attached by Sheriff Page, who kept it in his possession until January 1, 1855, when he delivered it over to his successor in office, Sheriff Conover. For the conversion by Sheriff Page the plaintiff in this action could not recover, for the reason that that was before the sale of the property to him, and he never made any demand after the sale to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">But this seizure of the property by virtue of the attachment did not change the title to the property. It still belonged to Gardner, and his sale of it conveyed the title to the plaintiff. After the plaintiff got the title, the defendant caused the property to be seized by virtue of the execution in his favor against Blossom, and sold; and this was a conversion of the property, of which this plaintiff had the right to complain. Every fresh interference with the property was a new wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The defendant first caused the property to be attached by Sheriff Page; for this he became liable to Gardner, if he chose to prosecute him. He then caused the property to be seized upon the execution and sold; and this was a wrong to this plaintiff, for which he can prosecute him; and, hence, upon the plainest principles of law, and the plaintiff can recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">And, for this last interference with the property, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ant is liable without a previous demand. He was a naked wrong-doer, without any color of right. I do not think that the property was so in the possession of Blossom that even the sheriff could have justified- a seizure of it; but it is sufficient, as against this defendant, to show that he caused the property to be wrongfully seized and sold after the plaintiff had purchased it.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">These views lead to the reversal of the judgment and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">All concur, except Leonard, C., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted; costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
