Plaintiff filed an action against Dairyland and others seeking personal protection insurance benefits and property protection insurance benefits pursuant to the Michigan no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq. </em>Subsequently, plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment against Dairyland in respect to his claim for the cost of repairing his motorcycle. Plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished opinion per curiam, finding no liability on the part of Dairyland for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>physical damage to plaintiffs motorcycle. We granted leave to appeal. 414 Mich 863 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The issue we are asked to decide is whether damages sustained by a motorcycle involved in a collision with a motor vehicle are excluded from property protection insurance coverage under \u00a7 3123 of the no-fault act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the analysis used in <em>Pioneer State Mutual Ins Co v Allstate Ins Co, </em>417 Mich 590; 339 NW2d 470 (1983), decided today, controls the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Plaintiffs argument may be synopsized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">1. The definition of motor vehicle in the no-fault act expressly excludes motorcycles. MCL 500.3101(2); MSA 24.1310K2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">2. \"Motor vehicle\u201d and \"vehicle\u201d are used interchangeably and synonymously throughout the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">3. \"Vehicle\u201d as that term is used in MCL 500.3123(l)(a); MSA 24.13123(l)(a) must mean \"motor vehicle\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>4. Therefore, property damage to a motorcycle is recoverable as property insurance benefits under MCL 500.3121(1); MSA 24.13121(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In <em>Pioneer, ante, </em>p 594, where plaintiffs advance the identical argument, we state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\"We disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the Legislature intended the term 'vehicle* as used in \u00a7 3123(l)(a) to be synonymous with the term 'motor vehicle\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 3101(2)(c). If the Legislature had intended these two terms to be synonymous, there would have been no need to provide a separate definition of the term 'vehicle\u2019, as found in \u00a7 3123(l)(a). Although the term 'vehicle\u2019 is also used in other provisions of the act, it is not separately defined in those provisions as it is in \u00a7 3123(l)(a). Consequently, although the Legislature may have used the term 'motor vehicle\u2019 and 'vehicle\u2019 interchangeably in other provisions of the act, the fact that the term 'vehicles\u2019 in \u00a7 3123(l)(a) is accorded a separate definition in order to preclude the application in that section of the more limited term 'motor vehicle\u2019, as defined in \u00a7 3101(2)(c), indicates that the Legislature obviously chose to include a broader class of vehicles within the scope of \u00a7 3123(l)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\"We believe that the language of \u00a7 3123(l)(a) is clear and unambiguous. The exclusion in that section applies to vehicles operated or designed for operation on a public highway by power other than muscular power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Consistent with our analysis in <em>Pioneer, </em>we conclude that the exclusion in \u00a7 3123(l)(a) applies to motorcycles. A motorcycle is a vehicle operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>by power other than muscular power. At the time of the collision in this case, the motorcycle was being driven on a public highway. As a result, we hold that property protection insurance benefits are not available for damages sustained by a motorcycle involved in a motor vehicle accident which occurs while the motorcycle is being operated on a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-6\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Levin, Ryan, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\"> Plaintiff was awarded $1,907.63 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Our review of the motion filed by plaintiff, of the argument before the trial court, and of the order entered by the trial judge has not revealed the subsection of GCR 1963, 117, relied on as authority for the granting of plaintiff\u2019s motion. In view of our disposition of this matter, further action is not required. We note, however, that the practice of \"hedging one\u2019s bets\u201d by failing to specifically cite to the appropriate authority prompted proposed rules MCR 2.116(C) and 2.119(A)(1)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\"> Plaintiff settled his claim for personal protection insurance benefits.
