FACCIOLA, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b161-22\">Now pending before the Court and ready for resolution is <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Documents </em>(\u201cMTC\u201d) [# 340].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion will be granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b161-24\">The facts of the case are set out in <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>587 F.Supp.2d 27, 29-31 (D.D.C.2008) and <em>In re Rail Freight Ftiel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>258 F.R.D. 167, 168-69 (D.D.C. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-25\">Discovery in this case has been progressing on a rolling basis, beginning August 1, 2009. Scheduling Order \u00b6 1. The parties agreed to attempt to \u201cfront-load\u201d this production. <em>Id. </em>The parties spent months negotiating search terms, filters and protocols for the search, reviewing, and producing the immense discovery in this case, eventually seeking judicial intervention regarding a set of circumscribed issues that they were not able to resolve. <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 07-MC-489, 2009 WL 3443563, at *1 (D.D.C. Oct. 23, 2009). In response, I ordered certain documents to be produced. <em>Id. </em>The parties have continued with discovery, and, after great effort to work together to narrow the discovery disputes between them, have brought several discrete issues regarding privileges asserted by defendants BNSF Railway Company (\u201cBNSF\u201d) and Union Pacific Railroad Company (\u201cUP\u201d) before the Court. First, plaintiffs assert that BNSF has improperly withheld communications involving the Association of American Railroads (\u201cAAR\u201d). <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motion to Compel Production of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Documents </em>(\u201cPls.Memo\u201d) [# 340-1] at 1. Second, plaintiffs claim that both BNSF and UP, pursuant to the work-product doctrine, have improperly withheld documents prepared in connection with the 2006 hearings of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 2. Lastly, plaintiffs argue that BNSF has also improperly claimed attorney-client privilege for documents prepared for the STB proceedings by non-attorney or unspecified personnel. <em>Id. </em>I will consider each issue raised by plaintiffs in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II. Documents Shared Among Defendants and AAR Members</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Plaintiffs argue that BNSF has improperly withheld two kinds of documents shared between BNSF and AAR members: (1) documents originating with in-house counsel that were then shared with other defendants and other members of AAR; and (2) communications between AAR membership and counsel to the AAR or an AAR member. Pis. Memo. 6. Plaintiffs argue that the first type of document loses any protection provided by the attorney-client privilege because distributing a privileged document to a third party destroys the privilege. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to protect a client\u2019s confidences to his or her attorney, thereby encouraging an open and honest relationship between the client and the attorney. <em>Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C.Cir.1980). The public interest in the observance of law and administration is promoted by the \u201cfull and frank communications between attorneys and their clients.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). The communication from an attorney may be protected if it is based on confidential information provided by the client. <em>Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 254 (D.C.Cir.1977). Thus, \u201cwhen an attorney conveys to his client facts acquired from other persons or sources, those facts are not privileged.\u201d <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>737 F.2d 94, 99 (D.C.Cir.1984) (citing <em>Brinton v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>636 F.2d 600, 604 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 905, 101 S.Ct. 3030, 69 L.Ed.2d 405 (1981)). Further, as plaintiffs argue, the communication of the otherwise privileged information to a third party can vitiate the protection created by the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">There were six documents in issue; however, BNSF has withdrawn its claim of privilege regarding minutes from a AAR committee meeting where counsel for the AAR provided advice to committee members. <em>Opposition of Defendants BNSF Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Documents </em>[# 341] (\u201cDef.Opp.\u201d) at 12. BNSF claims that the remaining five documents are protected by attorney-client privilege by virtue of BNSF\u2019s membership in the AAR. Counsel for AAR provides legal advice to an AAR committee, which consists of members from multiple corporations. Thus, BNSF argues that there is no third party present to vitiate the claim of privilege because all members of the committee share the protection of the privilege. It gives me pause to allow categorically communications among different companies to be cloaked in privilege by virtue of their membership in the same trade organization. Such a finding of privilege could seriously expand the attorney-client privilege beyond its normal, common law constraints. Thus, I will order the remaining documents be produced for an <em>in camera </em>review. I will review the documents to confirm that the attorney-client communications reflected in the documents are between BNSF as a committee member in the AAR and counsel for AAR and relate directly to the work of the committee. BNSF should provide the documents to chambers no later than 5 days from the date of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">There is an additional document at issue withheld by UP. It is a memorandum containing information related to a phone call with BNSF. I have little doubt that this document is properly withheld, as it is in fact an internal UP document. I will nonetheless order it be produced for an <em>in camera </em>review, so as to resolve any doubt left by UP\u2019s privilege log that this document is indeed a privileged document.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>III. Work-Product Privilege and Documents Prepared in Connection with the STB Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Plaintiffs seek to compel documents prepared in preparation for the STB hearing on fuel surcharges. In doing so, plaintiffs claim that the STB hearing does not qualify as litigation; thus, the attorney work-product related to the hearing is not protected by the privilege. MTC 11. Defendants counter that the hearing was an \u201c \u2018adversarial administrative matter[ ]\u2019 \u201d and falls within the scope of the privilege. Opp. 8 (citing <em>General Elec. Co. v. Johnson, </em>No. 00-CV-2855, 2006 WL 2616187, at *11 (D.D.C. Sept. 12, 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The question of whether the <em>ex parte </em>hearing by the STB qualifies as litigation, so as to protect the work-product is complex. Plaintiffs claim that the fundamental question is whether the STB hearing provided the opportunity for cross-examination; without that, the proceedings do not qualify as litigation and the privilege does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure protects from production written materials that lawyers prepare \u201cin anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). According to that Rule, \u201cdocuments and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative\u201d may not be discovered. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3)(A). The purpose of the privilege is to protect the adversary process by ensuring that lawyers work with a \u201cdegree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.\u201d <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 510, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). Neither Rule 26(b)(3) nor <em>Hickman </em>provide a clear delineation of what is to be considered \u201clitigation.\u201d In distinguishing between proceedings which qualify as litigation and those that do not, the adversarial nature of the proceeding is characteristic of litigation. <em>See, e.g., Amobi v. District of Columbia Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>262 F.R.D. 45, 52 (D.D.C.2009) (finding that because arbitration was adversarial in nature it can be characterized as litigation). \u201cThe proceeding for which documents are prepared need not actually take place in a court of record, as long as the proceeding is adversarial in nature.\u201d Edna Selan Epstein, <em>The Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine </em>827 (5th ed.2007). The challenge in determining whether the STB proceedings are to be considered litigation is the unfortunate description of the proceedings as <em>ex parte. </em>Courts have found patent application proceedings, which are primarily <em>ex parte </em>in nature, do not constitute litigation because they are not adversarial in nature. <em>See, e.g., McCook Metals L.L.C. v. Alcoa, Inc., </em>192 F.R.D. 242, 260 (N.D.Ill.2000) (citing <em>Oak Indus, v. Zenith Electronics Corp., </em>687 F.Supp. 369, 374 (N.D.Ill.1988); <em>Avery Dennison Corp. v. UCB Films PLC, </em>No. 95-CV-6351, 1998 WL 703647, at *6 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 30, 1998)). A closer look at the STB proceedings, however, reveals that there is a significant adversarial aspect to the proceedings. Even a simple review of the STB docket for the proceedings shows that there was a back and forth among the carriers and shippers, with some of the railways even providing written responses to filings made by shippers. <em>See, e.g., </em>Union Pacific Reply to Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation, Opp. at Ex 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Plaintiffs argue that there is a bright-line test to determine whether a proceeding qualifies as litigation: the parties must have the right to cross-examine witnesses. They rely on <em>United States v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>86 F.R.D. 603, 627 (D.D.C.1979), for the supposition that the \u201cright to cross-examine is the determinative factor\u201d of whether a proceeding is litigation. MTC 11 (quoting <em>United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>86 F.R.D. at 627-28). Unfortunately, <em>AT &amp; T </em>does not provide such a clear-cut definition. <em>AT &amp; T </em>was an antitrust case with considerable discovery. Two Special Masters, Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Paul R. Rice, issued Guidelines for the Resolution of Privilege Claims to the parties. Guideline 15 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">In the terms \u201cmaterial prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">(a) \u201cLitigation\u201d includes a proceeding in a court or administrative tribunal in which the parties have the right to cross-examine witnesses or to subject an opposing party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>presentation of proof to equivalent disputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">(b) \u201cIn anticipation\u201d means any time after initiation of the proceeding or such earlier time as the party who normally would initiate the proceeding had tentatively formulated a claim, demand, or charge. When the material was prepared by a party who normally would initiate such a proceeding, that person must establish the date when the claim, demand, or charge was tentatively formulated. When the material was prepared by a potential defendant or respondent, that person must establish the date when he received a demand or warning of charges or information from an outside source that a claim, demand, or charge was in prospect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>AT &amp; T, </em>86 F.R.D. at 627. According to the guidelines \u201clitigation\u201d includes proceedings with the right to cross-examine or the right \u201cto subject an opposing party\u2019s presentation of proof to equivalent disputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs look to these guidelines for their definition of litigation, but the guidelines do not support a bright-line rule that the right to cross-examine witnesses is crucial to a proceeding being denominated as \u201clitigation,\u201d since they admit of the possibility that a disputation equivalent to cross-examination suffices.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">More to the point, guidelines by Special Masters, no matter how distinguished, are not controlling precedent. The proper focus should be whether the proceeding required the lawyer to function as lawyers usually do at a trial so that the proceeding can be classified as \u201clitigation.\u201d This properly segregates the transactional work of lawyers who draft contracts or provide legal advice from lawyers who have to represent clients before tribunals that have the power to adjudicate their clients\u2019 rights, whatever the nature of the proceeding. If the tribunal has the power to adjudicate those rights and demands that the party before it either make a certain showing or disprove a particular allegation, the process is adversarial by its very nature and surely qualifies as litigation. It is irrational to suggest that such a process can never be denominated as \u201clitigation\u201d, no matter how severe its consequences, and even though the lawyer prepared for it and functions during it in the exact same manner as she would if the case were being tried to a jury. It surely cannot be the law that a proceeding that did not feature cross-examination is never \u201clitigation\u201d, but beating a traffic ticket is because one can cross-examine the cop.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The STB called for the hearing after receiving complaints about the fuel surcharges utilized by the rail carriers. The STB sought to rule on the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the practice, and ultimately concluded that the practice was unreasonable. In preparing for the hearings, there is no doubt that both the carriers and the shippers approached the hearings as adversarial in nature. Representatives from the carriers were subjected to questioning by the Board. Additional briefings were requested and filed, and the question of reasonableness was adjudicated. That the proceeding bore the description \u201cex parte\u201d and that it lacked the formal structure of cross-examination of witnesses does not lessen its adversarial nature. The Federal Court of Claims has carefully parsed the adversarial and non-adversarial aspects of certain administrative proceedings, and determined that \u201cdocuments that were created \u2018with an eye towards\u2019 adversarial aspects of administrative proceedings ... and that would not have been created in similar form but for these adversarial aspects, should be afforded protection as documents created \u2018in anticipation of litigation\u2019 under the work product doctrine of RCFC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 26(b)(3).\u201d <em>Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>69 Fed.Cl. 784, 808 (Fed.Cl.2006). This approach is applicable here. The documents defendants seek to protect in this case relate specifically to the STB proceedings on fuel surcharges and would not have been created otherwise. As the Court of Claims notes, this approach is consistent with the privilege because it does not allow an opponent to \u201cride on the litigator\u2019s wits,\u201d while at the same time not expanding the privilege beyond its bounds. <em>Id. </em>Defendants will not have to produce these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>IY. . Attorney-Client Privilege and Documents Prepared in Connection with the STB Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Plaintiffs also seek to compel documents from defendant BNSF related to the STB proceeding claimed to be protected by attorney-client privilege. Plaintiffs claim that BNSF\u2019s privilege logs are insufficient to determine whether some of the documents involve attorney-client communications or whether some of the documents relate primarily to business, technical or other nonlegal matters. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compel Production of Documents </em>[# 351] at 5. There was some confusion between the parties related to different versions of the privilege log based on family-relationships between documents <em>(i.e. </em>parent-child documents, typically e-mails and attachments). Regardless of that confusion, based on my reading of the privilege log, I have already found many of the documents for which BNSF claims the attorney-client privilege to be protected by the work-product privilege. The remaining documents for which only the attorney-client privilege has been claimed, with the exception of two documents, appear to relate specifically to preparations for the STB proceedings. I shall review <em>in camera </em>the few documents for which only the attorney-client privilege has been claimed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Note that one of the documents not related to the STB proceedings reflects the legal advice of the AAR law department.
