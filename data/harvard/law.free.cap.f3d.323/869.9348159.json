The district court overruled his objection and used the enhancement in fashioning Fuentes\u2019s sentence of seventy-six months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">Fuentes now appeals, contending that a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d under the Application Note to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), is an offense that: (1) has the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, as an element; and (2) is murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, or burglary of a dwelling. He submits that, because burglary under California law does not include the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force as an ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>ment of the offense, his 1995 conviction for first-degree burglary does not qualify as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The career-offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as an offense that contains the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force as an element, or is burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Fuentes argues that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in Section 4B1.2, and the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in Section 2L1.2, demonstrates that the Sentencing Commission intended the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to be more restricted in Section 2L1.2. He claims that, because the district court determined that his 1995 conviction for burglary was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d against the plain reading of Section 2L1.2, and because without its accompanying sixteen-level enhancement Ms guidelines range would have been reduced from 70-87 months\u2019 to 30-37 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 806 (11th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1019, 121 S.Ct. 1956, 149 L.Ed.2d 752 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">As noted, Fuentes pled guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). If prior to deportation, Fuentes was convicted of a felony that was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the guidelines provide for a 16-level enhancement in his offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Application Notes to Section 2L1.2(b)(l) define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(ii)(I). The Application Notes also provide that the following offenses are \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under Section 2L1.2(b)(l): \u201cmurder, manslaughter, kid-naping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">In the case at hand, the district court found that Fuentes\u2019s California conviction for first-degree burglary was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d despite the offense\u2019s lack of an element regarding the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, because it was one of the offenses enumerated in Application Note l(B)(ii)(II). We have not decided the issue of whether an offense must include the physical-force element <em>and </em>be listed in the Application Notes to qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The decisions of our sister circuits, however, have addressed the issue and rejected the argument Fuentes advances here. The Eight Circuit has held that \u201ca prior felony conviction for any of the crimes enumerated in subpart (II) of application note l(B)(ii) is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Hernandez, </em>300 F.3d 974, 979 (8th Cir.2002) (rejecting argument that the offense of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was not a crime of violence because it did not contain the physical-force element), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 931, 154 L.Ed.2d 831 (2003). In its reasoning, the Eight Circuit noted that the Sentencing Commission included \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d in Application Note l(B)(ii)(II)\u2019s list of offenses, despite the fact that \u201cburglary, or at least \u2018generic\u2019 burglary, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>never had as an element \u2018the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit rejected the interpretation that Application Note l(B)(ii) required an offense to have the physical-force element and be listed, because it would render Application Note 1(B)(n)(II) surplusage. <em>Id. </em>Under similar reasoning, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 318-320 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 694, 154 L.Ed.2d 645 (2002) (holding that all the offenses listed in Application Note 1(B)(ii)(II) were crimes of violence, regardless of their elements under various state laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The analysis in <em>Gomez-Hemandez </em>and <em>Rayo-Valdez </em>reflects the principle that, when interpreting a statute, it is necessary to give meaning to all its words \u201cso that no words shall be discarded as being meaningless, redundant, or mere surplus-age.\u201d <em>United States v. Canals-Jimenez, </em>943 F.2d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.1991). The rules of statutory construction and interpretation also apply to the guidelines. <em>Cf. United States v. Lazo-Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 1282, 1284-86 (11th Cir.1998). If we were to adopt Fuentes\u2019s proposition that burglary of a dwelling is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it does not have as an element of the offense the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force on the person of another, Application Note 1(B)(ii)(II)\u2019s enumeration of burglary of dwelling, as well as kidnaping and arson, would be rendered superfluous. The Supreme Court rejected a similar proposal as it pertained to the issue of whether \u201cburglary\u201d was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because \u201cburglary, arson, extortion ... so often presented a risk of injury to persons ... that they should be included in the enhancement statute even though, considered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not necessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 597, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2157, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Therefore, because the Sentencing Commission enumerated burglary of a dwelling in Application Note 1(B)(ii)(II), despite its lack of an element regarding physical force, and because an alternative reading would render the sub-part (II) mere surplusage, the district court did not err in determining that burglary of a dwelling was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>See Canals-Jimenez, </em>943 F.2d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-12\">.
