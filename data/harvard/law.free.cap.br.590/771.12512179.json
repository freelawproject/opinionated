Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Chapter 13 case was filed by the Debtor, Maurice M. Gorges (\"Gorges\") on December 17, 2014. The voluntary bankruptcy petition was signed by Gorges, and also by his attorney, Stuart Sandweiss (\"Sandweiss\"), of the law firm Sandweiss Law Center, P.C. (the \"Sandweiss Firm\"), and Sandweiss filed the petition for Gorges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, Gorges voluntarily dismissed the case, on motion and an order entered on March 4, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At all times, at least until the dismissal, Sandweiss represented Gorges as his attorney in this bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the voluntary dismissal of this case, on March 10, 2015, a creditor, The Huntington National Bank (\"Huntington\"), filed a motion entitled \"The Huntington National Bank's Motion to Set Aside Order Granting Debtor's Request for Voluntary Dismissal of Chapter 13 Case\" (Docket # 50, the \"Motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   All aspects of the Motion have been resolved by orders of the Court, except that part of the Motion that seeks an order \"awarding sanctions in favor of Huntington and against the [Debtor's] counsel,\" based on the Debtor's alleged filing of this bankruptcy case in bad faith and for an improper purpose. The orders partially resolving the Motion were entered on March 20, 2015 and on April 6, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, those orders left the voluntary dismissal of this Chapter 13 case intact, so that the case remains dismissed, and sanctioned Gorges, by default, in the amount of $78,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The remaining, unresolved portion of the Motion (the \"Sanctions Motion\") seeks sanctions against Sandweiss personally, based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011. Huntington is a creditor who had a mortgage on the home owned by Maurice and his wife, Hana Gorges, located at 13248 Maplelawn Drive, Shelby Township, Michigan (the \"Real Property\"). Huntington foreclosed on its mortgage, and after the redemption period expired without redemption, Huntington sought to gain possession of the Real Property. Huntington was thwarted in that effort, however, by various actions taken by Maurice and Hana Gorges, who continued to live in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Huntington claims that as the attorney for Gorges, Sandweiss filed this bankruptcy case for the sole purpose of delaying Huntington's eviction of Gorges and his wife from the Real Property. Sandweiss denies this, and contends that his action in filing and prosecuting this bankruptcy case for Gorges was done in good faith for a proper, legitimate purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the Sanctions Motion, Huntington seeks sanctions in the amount of the reasonable attorney fees that it incurred, not only because of attorney Sandweiss's filing of this Chapter 13 bankruptcy case for Gorges, but also because of attorney Sandweiss's filing and/or defense of two\n   <em>\n    earlier\n   </em>\n   cases. The first of these was attorney Sandweiss's filing of a Chapter 13 case by Hana Gorges (Case No. 14-42250, the \"Hana Gorges Bankruptcy\"). That case was filed by Hana Gorges on February 17, 2014 and dismissed on March 4, 2014. The second of these earlier cases was the defense of an eviction action filed by Huntington in the 41-A District Court of Michigan, Case No. US14-00927-LT (the \"Eviction Case\"). Huntington claims that as of October 12, 2015, it had incurred reasonable attorney fees and expenses in the total amount of $177,621.51, in connection with the Hana Gorges Bankruptcy, the Eviction Case, and this bankruptcy case filed by Gorges, including fees for litigating the Sanctions Motion itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Huntington seeks an order sanctioning Sandweiss in this amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court permitted the parties to conduct discovery regarding the Sanctions Motion, and then entered a final pretrial order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held an evidentiary hearing, and then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court has carefully reviewed the evidence presented in the evidentiary hearing, and the written and oral arguments of counsel for the parties. The evidence includes the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits that were admitted into evidence. The witnesses who testified are Hana Gorges, Maurice Gorges, Christ Gorges, Stuart Sandweiss, and John Schandevel. The exhibits that were admitted into evidence are Huntington Exhibits 7, 8, 21, 28, 31, 34-40, 42-44; and Sandweiss Exhibits A-E and all their subparts (except D.ii, which was not admitted into evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Opinion and the Order to follow will constitute the Court's decision on the Sanctions Motion. This Opinion states the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, the Court will deny Huntington's Sanctions Motion, and decline to sanction either Sandweiss or the Sandweiss Firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this contested matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 157(a) and 157(b)(1), and Local Rule 83.50(a) (E.D. Mich.). This is a core proceeding, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and 157(b)(2)(\n   <em>\n    O\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, this adversary proceeding falls within the definition of a proceeding \"arising under title 11\" and of a proceeding \"arising in\" a case under title 11, within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

E.D. Mich. 2009). This is a proceeding \"arising under title 11\" because it is \"created or determined by a statutory provision of title 11,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130716\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/21/#p27\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   including Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 105(a).

The December 10, 2014 settlement agreement that resolved the Eviction Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted above, the state court Eviction Case was settled by a written agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") signed on December 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties to the Settlement Agreement were Huntington, Maurice Gorges, Hana Gorges, and Christ Gorges (the son of Maurice and Hana Gorges). The Settlement Agreement was finalized and signed at the state court, on the day trial was scheduled to begin in the Eviction Case. The Settlement Agreement was signed by all of the parties and their attorneys, and was filed in the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Settlement Agreement required Gorges and his wife to pay Huntington a total of $410,000.00, in two installments, in exchange for conveyance of the Real Property by Huntington to Maurice and Hana Gorges. The first payment was \"a non-refundable payment of $20,000.00\" that had to be paid by 5:00 p.m. on December 17, 2014. The remaining $390,000.00 had to be paid by 5:00 p.m. on February 9, 2015. The Settlement Agreement provided that \"[u]pon timely receipt of the full $410,000, Huntington will execute and deliver a quit claim deed or appropriate court order vesting title for the property to Maurice and Hana Gorges (Gorges' choice).\" In the next sentence, the Settlement Agreement stated: \"If Maurice and Hana want title in the name of someone else, they can make this transfer independent of our settlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Settlement Agreement also required the Gorges parties to \"execute a consent judgment for possession\" of the Real Property, to be \"held in escrow\" by Huntington's counsel, and provided that if payment was not timely made, \"the consent judgment may be immediately filed with the court along with an application for an order of eviction (no statutory 10 day waiting period).\" The agreement also provided that \"Huntington may also immediately tender the consent judgment if [the Gorges parties] fail to timely pay the $20,000 non-refundable payment.\" If full payment was timely made, the escrowed consent judgment would be destroyed and the Eviction Case dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the sentence of the Settlement Agreement quoted above, which contains the phrase \"Huntington will execute and deliver a quit claim deed\n   <strong>\n    or appropriate court order vesting title\n   </strong>\n   for the property to Maurice and Hana Gorges\n   <strong>\n    (Gorges' choice)\n   </strong>\n   ,\" (emphasis added), the words just bolded were added by hand. In a hearing in the state court on the day the agreement was signed, attorney Sandweiss explained why these words were added, giving the Maurice and Hana Gorges the choice of receiving a quit claim deed or a court order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The agreement provides that my clients or their designees will pay the sum of $410,000 to acquire title to the property either through a Quitclaim Deed or a\n   Court Order, and we have to work out the exact things, it's going to be my client's choice as to how they want to do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The concern is with the transfer taxes, and my experience is that if there is a Court Order we can avoid paying roughly three-and-one-half thousand dollars in transfer taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   According to Huntington's appraisal, the Real Property had a value of over $500,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this value, the Settlement Agreement's purchase price of $410,000 would enable Maurice and Hana Gorges to obtain significant equity if they purchased the Real Property, even with the approximately $13,500 in real estate taxes owing on the property at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Huntington's representative, John Schandevel, testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The house had an appraised value of over $500,000. So our agreement to the $410,000 at least in my opinion was still Huntington giving up almost $100,000 in value in order to get that deal done and you know, close the case and move on.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The evidence is undisputed that when they made the Settlement Agreement and thereafter, Maurice and Hana Gorges had financial resources available to them to purchase the Real Property for $410,000. Importantly, Sandweiss had a good faith and reasonable belief of this, at all times on and after the date of the Settlement Agreement on December 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The funding available to Gorges at the time consisted of $200,000 that Krystal Gorges, the daughter of Maurice and Hana Gorges, would pay, and which she had available in an account,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   plus a loan that had been approved in the amount of up to $250,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This total of up to $450,000 would enable Gorges to pay Huntington the $410,000 purchase price under the Settlement Agreement, and to pay the real estate taxes owing on the Real Property, then in the amount of about $13,500.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The above information about these funding sources were disclosed to Sandweiss before the parties made the Settlement Agreement. And Sandweiss testified, credibly and without contradiction, that before the settlement was made he had seen proof that Krystal Gorges had the $200,000 in an account, during discovery in the Eviction Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The request by Gorges that Huntington convey title to the Real Property in the name of Krystal Gorges, rather than in the names of Maurice and Hana Gorges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   About 28 hours before Maurice and Hana Gorges were due to make the $20,000 non-refundable payment to Huntington under the Settlement Agreement (the due date being December 17, 2014 at 5:00 p.m.), they requested that Huntington agree to convey title to the Real Property in the name of Krystal Gorges, rather than\n   in the names of Maurice and Hana Gorges as provided in the Settlement Agreement. The reason for this request is unknown, and no reason was communicated to Huntington. One can speculate that perhaps Gorges and his family wanted title in the name of Krystal Gorges because she was to provide $200,000 of the funding to purchase the Real Property. And one can speculate that perhaps Gorges and his family wanted Huntington to convey title to Krystal Gorges directly, rather than have title conveyed to Maurice and Hana Gorges and then have them reconvey the property to Krystal Gorges, in order to avoid having to pay a transfer tax on a second conveyance, from Maurice and Hana to Krystal. But on the present record these things would only be speculation. No evidence was presented to explain why Gorges asked that Huntington convey title directly to Krystal Gorges, and there is no evidence that Gorges ever disclosed any such reason to Huntington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In any event, at 12:31 p.m. on December 16, 2014, Sandweiss sent the following e-mail message to Huntington's attorney:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Marc,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The Gorges family contacted me today about having the title vest in Krystal's name (as originally contemplated) as opposed to Maurice and Hana.

Huntington's attorney then stated the following in an e-mail to Sandweiss, sent at 11:29 a.m. on December 17, 2014, again refusing the Gorges' request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Stuart,\n   After I sent you the below email yesterday, I received a call from Christ. He was again asking for the settlement to be modified. I again passed the request on to Huntington.

Huntington merely stated repeatedly that it was not interested in modifying the settlement. When asked in the evidentiary hearing why Huntington had refused the Gorges's request, Huntington's representative who made the decision, John Schandevel, answered this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   It was specifically put into the settlement that the title would go back to Maurice and Hana Gorges. It was just agreed to. Given the -- the nature of our experience through the process and the potential that we didn't know what the purpose was, or what the ramifications might be of putting the title into someone else's name, we chose not to accept that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Thus, it appears that Huntington's refusal was because of some vague fear of the unknown, a fear that was not communicated to or discussed with any member of the Gorges family or the Gorges's attorney, Sandweiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As of the afternoon of December 14, 2014, therefore, the situation was this: (1) Gorges and his family had a deadline of 5:00 p.m. that day to make the non-refundable payment of $20,000 to Huntington, toward purchase of the Real Property under the Settlement Agreement, or Huntington would obtain a consent judgment of possession; (2) Maurice Gorges had the $20,000 available to make the payment that day, through his daughter Krystal having the money on hand in her account;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) for reasons unknown and not communicated to Huntington, Maurice and Hana Gorges wanted Huntington to agree to convey title to the Real Property in the name of Krystal Gorges, rather than in the names of Maurice and Hana Gorges; and (4) for reasons unknown and not communicated to Gorges, Huntington was unwilling to agree to the Gorges's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The filing of Gorges's Chapter 13 bankruptcy case on December 17, 2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Sandweiss contends, and testified, that the Gorges's request that Huntington convey the Real Property in the name of Krystal Gorges was not a request to modify the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Huntington has consistently disagreed with this contention. At first blush, at least, Sandweiss would seem clearly to be wrong. As quoted in Part III.A.2 of this Opinion, the Settlement Agreement says that upon timely payment of the full $410,000 purchase price, \"Huntington will execute and\n   deliver a quit claim deed or appropriate court order vesting title for the property to Maurice and Hana Gorges (Gorges' choice).\" Then, in the very next sentence, the agreement stated: \"If Maurice and Hana want title in the name of someone else, they can make this transfer independent of our settlement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This language clearly means that the transfer of the Real Property to anyone other than Maurice and Hana Gorges would have to be done by Maurice and Hana, by separate transfer after Huntington had transferred the property to Maurice and Hana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In his testimony, Sandweiss contended that the reference in this Settlement Agreement language to \"(Gorges' choice)\" means that Maurice and Hana Gorges had a choice as to who Huntington conveyed the Real Property to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this is not correct, as discussed in Part III.A.2 of this Opinion. As this language unambiguously means, and as made clear by Sandweiss himself on the record during the December 10, 2014 state court hearing, this language only gave Maurice and Hana Gorges a choice between receiving a quit claim deed to them for the Real Property or receiving a \"court order vesting title\" in Maurice and Hana Gorges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Huntington therefore was not unreasonable in taking the view that it would require an agreed modification of the Settlement Agreement in order for Huntington to convey the Real Property to Krystal Gorges, as Maurice and Hana Gorges requested. But the Court finds that neither was it unreasonable or frivolous for Sandweiss to disagree with Huntington's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This is so based on a somewhat different theory, which Sandweiss testified about, and which Sandweiss alluded to in one of his pre-bankruptcy e-mails to Huntington's attorney. That theory is that Maurice and Hana Gorges had a right to\n   <em>\n    assign\n   </em>\n   their rights under the Settlement Agreement to Krystal Gorges, and that such assignment would permit and require Huntington to convey the Real Property directly to Krystal Gorges. In one of his December 16, 2014 e-mails to Huntington's attorney, Sandweiss alluded to Maurice and Hana Gorges assigning their rights under the Settlement Agreement to Krystal Gorges, as a basis for Huntington to convey title to Krystal Gorges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   And during the evidentiary hearing, Sandweiss testified this way, under cross-examination by Huntington's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q ... What language in there does it - where does it specifically say that Huntington was obligated to deed the property to Krystal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A It says if Maurice and Hana want title in the name of someone else, they can make this transfer independent of our settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q So outside of the settlement agreement in other words?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A Not necessarily. That's the way you interpret it.... I said that's what I said. There's definitely - I can definitely see where there could be room for ambiguity, but I think that it gives them the right to say hey, we're going to assign our right to somebody else. And I think even - I don't even think it needs to be\n   part necessarily of the settlement agreement. I think under general contract law the party to a contract has the right to assign a part of a contract to another party, unless it's got a personal contract for services or something like that. I think that's contracts 101. But I - there was no time from when I learned of this until such time as we had - we had a four hour window there roughly to get this determined and didn't want to take a chance on being wrong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This assignment theory by Sandweiss, as a basis for his argument that an amendment of the Settlement Agreement was not required in order for Huntington to convey title directly to Krystal Gorges, was not unreasonable or frivolous. Rather, it was a reasonable, colorable theory, and Sandweiss asserted this theory in good faith. For example, it appears that under Michigan law, a purchaser under a real estate contract has the right to assign his rights under that contract to a third party, without the consent of the seller.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hull v.

He did this not because he did not have the $20,000 available to make the payment, and not because he never intended to make any payments to Huntington and just wanted to gain more time before losing possession of the Real Property to Huntington. Rather, the Court finds that Gorges filed this bankruptcy case only for the purpose of getting some additional time to try to find a resolution to the title issue, before he had to pay the non-refundable $20,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this was Sandweiss's understanding and purpose when he filed this Chapter 13 case for Gorges. As Sandweiss testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Q ... You filed Chapter 13 for Maurice in December 2014, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   A I believe December 17th, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Q ... And the purpose, although I think it's been identified by you, by Mr. -- by both Christ and -- and Maurice, one of the prime reasons was that Maurice needed the ability -- Maurice and Hana to come up with that $20,000 down stroke?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   A That was one of the prime -- and I don't know if the word is come up with it to pay it. They wanted to -- there was this issue with the title and they wanted to make sure before the money was paid that they would be able to resolve this issue. I didn't even quite understand the entire issue, but whatever it was, they said they were taking care of it. And they came -- Maurice and Christ came to me after the email from Mr. Jerabek, I think that was at -- and it was lunch\n   time on the 17th and said, okay, they don't want to change the - they don't want to deal this, what are our options. And I said well, you can go back to District Court and try and get resolution there. I said, but remember you're on a tight timetable and you only got a couple hours. I said you can move out and give up the right to -- you know, if you don't want to -- don't want to do the deal, then just move out. I said, or, if you want the -- the 60 day exemption by 108(b) then you can file Chapter 13 and then ... under 108(b) you've got 60 days to cure the $20,000 payment and work out whatever it is with the tax issues and work out whatever title issues there are. And you've got that ability to do that. So that's what they ultimately chose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Q ...

But Huntington failed to prove this theory. Rather, the Court finds from the evidence that Sandweiss filed this bankruptcy case for Gorges only to obtain more time to try to resolve the dispute with Huntington, over Huntington's refusal to convey the property directly to Krystal Gorges, and in the reasonable hope that the issue could be resolved, that the $410,000 payment would be made to Huntington before the extended deadline under \u00a7 108(b) expired, and that the Gorges family would be able to keep and stay in their home, under the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Events after Gorges filed this Chapter 13 case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On December 23, 2014, less than a week after Gorges filed this bankruptcy case, Huntington filed a motion seeking to modify the automatic stay, or in the alternative to dismiss this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Huntington's motion argued that Gorges filed this case \"in bad\n   faith, and for the sole purpose of delaying a pending eviction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gorges filed a response, through Sandweiss, objecting to the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held an expedited hearing on the motion, on January 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   During the hearing, Huntington argued, among other things, that Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 108(b) did not extend the Gorges's payment deadlines under the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, Sandweiss argued, on behalf of Gorges, that: (1) \u00a7 108(b) did extend the Gorges's deadlines for making the two payments under the Settlement Agreement, to February 17, 2015; and (2) Gorges did not file this bankruptcy case to delay an eviction, but rather in a good faith effort to use \u00a7 108(b) to obtain more time to try to resolve the title issue with Huntington, so that the purchase could go forward; and (3) if the $410,000 purchase price was not paid to Huntington by the February 17, 2015 deadline, the Court\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   grant stay relief to permit Huntington to pursue eviction in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   At the conclusion of the motion hearing, the Court ruled from the bench that \u00a7 108(b) did indeed apply, and that it had the effect of extending until February 17, 2015 the Gorges's deadlines to make the required payments under the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court declined to dismiss this case, but the Court ruled that stay relief would be granted if Gorges did not pay Huntington the full $410,000 purchase price by the February 17, 2015 deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   During its bench ruling, the Court also ruled that even\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Gorges filed this bankruptcy case\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in order to obtain more time to make the $20,000 non-refundable payment under the Settlement Agreement, that would not constitute \"any sort of improper scheme to hinder, delay, or defraud Huntington.\" This is so, the Court reasoned, because this \"is an instance of a debtor taking advantage of a provision of federal law and availing himself of a right that he has to file bankruptcy and take advantage of the federal law under Section 108(b).\" And, the Court further reasoned, \"there is nothing in the [S]ettlement [A]greement that precluded [Gorges] from doing so or that ... indicates that his having done that ... would have been impermissible or improper or fraudulent in any way.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court entered an order on January 16, 2015, granting Huntington's stay relief motion in part. The Order gave Gorges through February 17, 2015 to pay Huntington the $410,000 purchase price under the Settlement Agreement, and provided that Huntington could get an order granting relief from stay, to pursue possession of the Real Property in state court, including eviction, if the payment was not timely made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   After filing this bankruptcy case, neither Sandweiss nor any of the Gorges family made any further requests that Huntington transfer the Real Property to Krystal Gorges, rather than to Maurice and Hana Gorges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence does not disclose\n   why this is. But given Huntington's arguments in its stay-relief/dismissal motion, and the position Huntington took during the hearing on that motion, it clearly appears that any post-petition efforts by Sandweiss to discuss the title issue with Huntington would have been futile. And Sandweiss certainly would have been reasonable to think so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Ultimately, Maurice and Hana Gorges decided not to make the payments due under the Settlement Agreement, and to forfeit their right to purchase the Real Property under the Settlement Agreement. Until they made this decision, they had intended to go forward with the purchase of the Real Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   They made the decision to give up the Real Property in February 2015, and they moved out of the property on or about February 16 or 17, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   They made this decision, they say, only because the title issue was not resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sandweiss did not learn of this decision until on or shortly after February 9, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Huntington filed an affidavit stating that Gorges had not paid the $410,000 purchase price under the Settlement Agreement, and the same day, the Court entered an order lifting the automatic stay, effective immediately, to permit Huntington to pursue its rights in state court to obtain possession of the Real Property, including through an eviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Huntington recovered actual possession of the Real Property on February 27, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   On March 4, 2015, Gorges, through Sandweiss, filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss this bankruptcy case, and the Court entered an order dismissing this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Huntington then filed its Sanctions Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Part of its motion for sanctions sought a judgment against Gorges, for extensive physical damage that Gorges and others allegedly did to the Real Property before they moved out. The color photographs attached as exhibits to Huntington's Motion show outrageous damage to the home, which obviously was done deliberately by someone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a preliminary hearing on Huntington's Motion, Huntington's attorney alleged that Gorges and his family had done about $250,000 worth of damage to the Real Property before moving out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Huntington's attorney also made clear that Huntington was not seeking any monetary or other relief against Sandweiss for such damages. Nor does Huntington contend that Sandweiss in any way participated in damaging the Real Property, or that Sandweiss had any reason to know that such damage would occur. Rather, Huntington seeks only the excess attorney fees and related expenses that it says Sandweiss has caused Huntington to incur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to Gorges himself, Huntington obtained a judgment by default on April 6, 2015, in the amount of $78,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

And that case was only pending for 15 days before being dismissed by the Court. Huntington filed nothing in the Hana Gorges Bankruptcy, except a notice of appearance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Huntington\n   was not reasonably required to file anything in the Hana Gorges case before the Court dismissed the case. In any event, any sanctions relief on Huntington's Sanctions Motion must be limited to sanctions for improper conduct in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n   </strong>\n   , this Court has no jurisdiction, authority, or inclination to sanction Sandweiss or the Sandweiss Firm for Sandweiss's conduct in defending the Gorges family in the state court Eviction Case. That is a matter of concern only for the state court, not this Court. Huntington has cited no authority that supports its argument that this federal bankruptcy court may sanction an attorney for his conduct in defending a client in a state court lawsuit, particularly one that was\n   <em>\n    settled\n   </em>\n   by a consent judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court is aware of no such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   That is not to say that in deciding the Sanctions Motion in this case, the Court cannot consider evidence about the actions of Sandweiss and his clients in the Hana Gorges Bankruptcy and in the state court Eviction Case. Such evidence may be relevant to support (or rebut) Huntington's claim that\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy case was filed in bad faith and for an improper purpose. In deciding that issue, this Court has considered all such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth\n   </strong>\n   , the Court will not sanction the Sandweiss Firm, in any event, for the following two reasons: (1) because the Sanctions Motion did not seek or request sanctions against the law firm; rather, only against Sandweiss individually; and (2) because, at least with respect to sanctions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , only individual lawyers may be sanctioned; law firms cannot be sanctioned. See Part III.B.1 of this Opinion, quoting\n   <em>\n    Rentz v. Dynasty Apparel Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3332046\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/389/\">\n    556 F.3d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396 n.6 (6th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    Fifth and finally\n   </strong>\n   , the Court will not sanction Sandweiss or the Sandweiss Firm for the additional reason that Huntington has not met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any valid basis for sanctions. Whether considered under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 105(a) and this Court's inherent authority to sanction misconduct, or under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or under Federal Bankruptcy Rule 9011(b), the Court finds no grounds for sanctions. Rather, the Court finds that Sandweiss and the Sandweiss Firm did not act improperly or in bad faith, or abuse the\n   bankruptcy system, in filing and prosecuting this bankruptcy case for Gorges. Sandweiss did not \"multiply the proceedings\" in this case \"unreasonably and vexatiously,\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1927. And in the words of the \u00a7 1927 cases quoted in Part III.B.1 of this Opinion, Sandweiss's conduct in this case was not in any respect \"objectively unreasonable.\" Nor were any of Sandweiss's actions done in bad faith, or when Sandweiss \"kn[ew] or reasonably should [have] know[n] that the claim or litigation tactics pursued [were] frivolous or [would] impede the litigation of proper claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Rather, the Court's findings stated in this Opinion show that Sandweiss filed the bankruptcy petition in this case in good faith and for a permissible purpose. And the same is true for Sandweiss's other conduct in this bankruptcy case, including his defense against Huntington's stay-relief/dismissal motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Sandweiss filed this bankruptcy case to help Gorges try to resolve the title issue described in Parts III.A.3 and III.A.4 of this Opinion, and he had a good faith, reasonable, and legitimate bankruptcy-related basis for helping Gorges take advantage of the automatic stay and the 60-day extension under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 108(b) of the Settlement Agreement payment deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   And based on the facts described in Part III.A.5 of this Opinion, the Court finds that there is nothing sanctionable in Sandweiss's conduct after he filed this bankruptcy case. It is true, as the Court has found, that after filing the bankruptcy petition, Sandweiss did not make any further requests to Huntington to title the Real Property in the name of Krystal Gorges. But given the arguments and position taken by Huntington beginning immediately after the petition was filed, it was clear to Sandweiss, and is clear to this Court, that further efforts to negotiate with Huntington over this title issue would have been futile. This is clear from Huntington's stay-relief/dismissal motion filed only 6 days after the petition, and from the arguments of Huntington's counsel during the expedited hearing on that motion, held only 29 days after the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Sandweiss's conduct in defending against Huntington's stay-relief/dismissal motion was entirely reasonable and in good faith. The Court's ruling on that motion gave Gorges only until February 17, 2015 to pay Huntington the $410,000 purchase price under the Settlement Agreement, or suffer relief from stay and the resulting loss of possession of the Real Property. Sandweiss did not learn until at least February 9, 2015 that the Gorges family had decided not to pay the purchase price, and instead move out of the property. At that point, there was nothing Sandweiss reasonably could do but wait for the February 17, 2015 deadline to pass without payment, and for the resulting stay-relief order to be entered, as it was, on February 18, 2015. The Gorges family moved out of the Real Property on February 16 or 17, 2015. Very soon thereafter, on March 4, 2015, Sandweiss filed on Gorges's behalf a motion to voluntarily dismiss this bankruptcy case, and the case was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Finally, there is nothing sanctionable in Sandweiss's conduct after the dismissal of this case, in opposing Huntington's Sanctions Motion. Indeed, Sandweiss has now prevailed on that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   It is, of course, very unfortunate and terribly unjust if Gorges and/or members of his family deliberately caused extensive physical damage to the Real Property before they vacated it, as appears to be the case. Huntington has every reason to be outraged by this, and Huntington obtained a $78,000.00 default judgment against Gorges for this. But this is not a basis\n   under the law for sanctioning the Debtor Gorges's attorney, Sandweiss, in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, the Court will enter an Order denying the Sanctions Motion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Docket # 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Docket ## 42, 43.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    The Motion amended and superceded the similar motion filed by Huntington on March 6, 2015, at Docket # 46.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Docket ## 53, 57.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Huntington Ex. 31 (supplement including affidavit of attorney Marc P.

None of these cases support Huntington's argument, that a federal bankruptcy court may sanction an attorney for his conduct in a state court case. Two of these cases,\n    <em>\n     Villareal\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Royal Manor Mgt.\n    </em>\n    , involved sanctions against an attorney only for litigation conduct in the case at hand. In\n    <em>\n     Villareal\n    </em>\n    the sanction was $500.00 for the filing of the petition in that Chapter 7 case, in bad faith and for the sole purpose of delaying a foreclosure sale, although the court noted that the debtor had filed two prior Chapter 13 cases for the same purpose. In\n    <em>\n     RoyalManor Mgt.\n    </em>\n    , all of the attorney's sanctioned conduct occurred in that same bankruptcy case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-278\">\n    In the third case cited by Huntington,\n    <em>\n     Prince v. MacDonald\n    </em>\n    , the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed a sanction against two defendants, based on Michigan sanctions law, for the action by one of them in filing a bankruptcy petition on the eve of trial in the state court case, in bad faith and solely for the purpose of delaying the state court case. The\n    <em>\n     Prince\n    </em>\n    case was decided under the state law of Michigan regarding sanctions. The case therefore is distinguishable; this case concerns only the federal law of sanctions, which is discussed at length in Part III.B. of this Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
