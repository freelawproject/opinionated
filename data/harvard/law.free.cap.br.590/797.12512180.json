BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 22, 2017, Landash Corporation (\"Debtor\") filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Amy Bostic is the duly appointed Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about September 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Jason Elbert Adkins (\"Adkins\") in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, commencing this case. In pertinent part, the Complaint alleges that Adkins and a co-conspirator John Eckerd engaged in a pattern and practice of defrauding various persons and entities by enticing them to invest in the purchasing of off-the-road (\"OTR\") tires, in the form of either a loan to Debtor or Adkins or a related entity, or, as in the case of Plaintiff, co-ownership of the tires. OTR tires are massive tires used on mining, construction or industrial sites; they sell for up to $120,000 each. There is a substantial secondary market for used OTR tires. The proposed plan was that Debtor or Adkins or an associated entity would purchase tires with the financial assistance of Plaintiff, identify a buyer, and sell the tires, presumably at a profit. Plaintiff was enticed into some 40 transactions with Adkins and Debtor. However, Adkins and/or Debtor persuaded numerous others to invest in the same tires, and the tires would not be purchased, or if purchased, not sold, or would be sold but the sale proceeds not remitted to the investor. The funds received from investors would be diverted to Adkins, his co-conspirators, and related entities. Plaintiff lost approximately $12,900,000. The Complaint asserts numerous causes of action: RICO conspiracy, violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, constructive trust, conversion, avoidance of fraudulent transfers, negligence &amp; gross negligence, hindering a secured creditor, conspiracy, aiding and abetting, alter ego &amp; piercing the corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the count of the complaint asserting fraudulent transfer, relying on the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"TUFTA\"), Plaintiff alleges that Adkins fraudulently transferred assets of Debtor to Defendant. Upon motion of Plaintiff, on September 6, 2018, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order and\n   attachment (the \"TRO\"), prohibiting Defendant from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a. Transferring, lending or removing any funds from the Castro Family Trust;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   b. Destroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring, or otherwise harming or reducing the value of any of Plaintiff's or Defendants' property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   c. Misrepresenting or refusing to disclose to Plaintiff or to the Court on proper request the existence, amount, or location of any property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   d. Damaging or destroying tangible property of any Defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   e. Tampering with the tangible property of any Defendant, including any documents, that represents or embodies anything of value, and/or causing pecuniary loss to Plaintiff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   f.

Withdrawing or borrowing in any manner for any purpose from any retirement, profit sharing, pension, disability, employee benefit plan, employee savings plan, individual retirement plan, or Keogh account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   k. Opening any new savings, checking, money market, or stock trading accounts with any bank, brokerage, or financial institution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   l.

Engaging in criminal act in violation of the penal laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 21, 2018, being apprised of Debtor's bankruptcy case and recognizing that a fraudulent transfer claim is a core bankruptcy proceeding, the District Court severed the fraudulent transfer claims and transferred them to the Southern District of Ohio for referral to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 42). The Texas District Court also extended the TRO for another 14 days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 36, 38). The case arrived at this Court on September 28, 2018. Although a motion for preliminary injunction was already pending in the transferred case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1), on that same date, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion. In essence, the Motion seeks to freeze assets of Defendant to avoid dissipation of assets to which the Trustee may lay a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiff has sued Defendant under sections 24.005 and 24.006 of TUFTA. However, once a bankruptcy proceeding intervenes, a creditor may not pursue a fraudulent transfer avoidance action under state law on its own behalf unless the cause of action is abandoned or the estate settles or releases the cause of action. 10 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY P. 548.02(4), (5) (Alan J. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th rev. 2018).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

Any effort to recover this property is essentially an action to recover property that belongs to the [bankruptcy estate].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Sixth Circuit, like other circuits, recognizes that derivative standing may be available to certain creditors under limited circumstances, even in cases under Chapter 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Trailer Source, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5584356,6046694\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/231/\">\n    555 F.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (6th Cir. 2009) (\"[T]he bankruptcy court ... should be able to exercise its equitable powers to authorize a creditor to pursue recovery of fraudulently transferred property for the benefit of the estate.\"). But a creditor must first obtain court approval to proceed, and to obtain such approval, must illustrate that: (1) demand was made on the trustee to act; (2) the trustee declined; (3) a colorable claim exists that would benefit the estate; and (4) the trustee's inaction was an abuse of\n   discretion.\n   <em>\n    Canadian Pac.

Nor has Plaintiff alleged that he has derivative authority to prosecute the fraudulent transfer claims, or that the Trustee has delegated her authority to Plaintiff. Indeed, the Trustee attended the hearing, and when the Court inquired of her regarding her role, she stated only that she joins in the Motion and that she is not prepared at this time to seek to intervene or be substituted as plaintiff. She did not suggest that she wanted to delegate her authority to Plaintiff or give him derivative authority to advance claims of the bankruptcy estate, even temporarily or for a limited purpose (e.g., to prosecute the Motion). Thus, Plaintiff remains without authority and lacks standing to pursue this adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, the adversary proceeding is defective for lack of a necessary party. Plaintiff presented evidence of two streams of funds that found their way into Defendant's possession: (1) funds which were transferred from Euro Tread Corp. (\"Euro\"), and (2) funds ($372,000) that were transferred from Debtor to La Mia Bella Famiglia (\"La Mia\"), then from La Mia to Euro, and finally from Euro to Defendant. During the hearing, the Court learned that La Mia is in its own Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the Eastern District of Texas, and has its own Chapter 7 trustee. To the extent that some of the funds which Plaintiff is pursuing became an asset of La Mia, it seems that La Mia's bankruptcy trustee would be a necessary and indispensable party to resolution of this adversary proceeding, or any action brought by Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet La Mia's trustee has not been named or joined in this case. Based on this fact, Plaintiff cannot establish a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" with this adversary proceeding postured as it currently is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While the defects in this case could possibly be cured, the Court must take the case as the Court finds it. The Court cannot assume that the parties or the Trustee will proceed to resolve the various issues, particularly in light of the fact that it is not yet known whether the Trustee will have assets in the case from which to fund the costs of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Other Factors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court must also consider whether there is a threat of irreparable harm to Plaintiff, whether issuance of the injunction \"would cause substantial harm to others,\" and \"whether the public interest would be served by granting injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516208\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/612/#p615\">\n    884 F.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court is of the opinion that matters involving the bankruptcy estate and administration of the bankruptcy estate are in the public interest. Protecting a potential for bringing assets to the bankruptcy estate and preserving the opportunities for the trustee to collect judgments from avoidance actions, so that creditors may receive a dividend from the estate, promote the public interest. However, those considerations cannot outweigh the lack of likelihood that Plaintiff will be successful on the merits of the case.
