Within months of that recall, New GM recalled millions more vehicles, some for ignition switch-related defects and some for other defects. Not long after, this Court began presiding over multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") arising from, and related to, those recalls. That litigation, which involves thousands of individual claims for personal injuries and wrongful deaths as well as a massive putative class action for economic loss, is complicated in\n   its own right. But it is made more complicated by the fact that Old GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and New GM, in purchasing most of the assets of Old GM pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, agreed to assume only certain liabilities of its predecessor. The result has been parallel-and continuing-litigation in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to whether and to what extent plaintiffs may, consistent with bankruptcy law, bring claims against New GM. That litigation has yielded a number of rulings by the Bankruptcy Court, some in reference to individual cases and some with broader application. One of those rulings was certified and appealed directly to the United States Court of Appeals (which reversed in part and affirmed in part). Many others have been appealed to this Court and accepted as related to the MDL proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Opinion and Order resolves eleven such appeals. Several of those appeals concern individual cases brought against New GM and are unlikely to have broad effect on the MDL proceedings. But the others relate to rulings that apply to the putative class action or to broad swaths of the cases now pending before this Court (or both). They include appeals addressing (1) whether plaintiffs may bring claims against New GM for fraudulent concealment of the right to file a claim against Old GM in the bankruptcy proceedings; (2) whether plaintiffs may pursue punitive damages against New GM based on the conduct of Old GM; and (3) whether plaintiffs who purchased used GM vehicles after Old GM's bankruptcy can bring claims against New GM based on the conduct of Old GM. For reasons that will be explained, this Court agrees with some of the Bankruptcy Court's rulings on these issues and disagrees with others. Accordingly, it affirms the Bankruptcy Court's orders and judgments in part and vacates and remands in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The nearly decade-long procedural history leading to these appeals is, to put it mildly, somewhat convoluted. The Court need not provide an exhaustive summary of that history, but instead focuses on the developments most relevant to the issues presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 1, 2009, Old GM filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. In short order, Old GM took steps, pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, to sell substantially all of its assets, \"free and clear\" of most of its liabilities, to an entity that was owned primarily by the United States Department of Treasury (\"Treasury\") and that later became New GM. Specifically, on June 26, 2009, Old GM and the entity that later became New GM entered into a sale agreement (the \"Original Sale Agreement\"), defining the liabilities assumed by the new entity (the \"Assumed Liabilities\") to include \"all Liabilities to third parties for death, personal injury, or other injury to Persons or damage to property ... which arise directly out of accidents, incidents or other distinct and discreet [sic] occurrences that happen on or after\" July 10, 2009, defined as the \"Closing Date\" (the \"Product Liabilities\"). (15-CV-8432, Docket No. 10-1 (\"Pillars Appendix\"), at A-85). Four days later, the parties entered an amended Sale Agreement (the \"Amended Sale Agreement\"), which defined Product Liabilities more narrowly to mean \"all Liabilities to third parties for death, personal injury, or other injury to Persons or damage to property ... which arise directly out of death, personal injury or other injury to Persons or damage to property caused by accidents or incidents first occurring on or after the Closing Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-163). Notice of the\n   proposed sale was mailed to interested parties, and publication notice appeared in major national publications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    April 2015 Decision\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    529 B.R. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2015). The Honorable Robert E. Gerber, the United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York to whom the case was assigned, received and considered approximately 850 objections to the proposed sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 520-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On July 5, 2009, Judge Gerber entered an order (the \"Sale Order\") approving the terms of the Amended Sale Agreement (the \"363 Sale\").\n   <em>\n    In re General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897292\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/407/463/\">\n    407 B.R. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in February 2014, New GM disclosed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") serious defects in certain General Motors vehicles that permitted the vehicles' ignition switches to rotate from \"run\" to \"off\" too easily, disabling critical safety features of the vehicles, such as the airbags. New GM initially recalled a range of vehicles manufactured by Old GM, including certain model years of Chevrolet Cobalts and HHRs, Saturn Ions and Skys, and Pontiac G5s and Solstices. Between February and October 2014, New GM issued a total of approximately sixty recalls, relating to both ignition-switch defects and other defects. Thereafter, a slew of plaintiffs filed actions against New GM asserting, among other things, successor liability claims premised on Old GM conduct. Those claimants included-but were by no means limited to-plaintiffs claiming various harms arising from defective ignition switches in recalled GM vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   New GM sought to enjoin many of those claims by moving in the Bankruptcy Court to enforce the \"free and clear\" provisions of the Sale Order. The parties to the proceedings agreed to \"Stipulated Facts,\" adopted by Judge Gerber in August 2014. To the extent relevant here, the parties defined \"Ignition Switch\" to mean \"an ignition switch designed and/or sold by Old GM in the Subject Vehicles that may unintentionally move out of the 'run' position, resulting in a partial loss of electrical power and turning off the engine\" and defined \"Subject Vehicles,\" in turn, to include a limited list of vehicles: \"(1) 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac GS, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit (Canada), 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky vehicles; and (2) 2008-2010 Pontiac Solstice and G5; 2008-2010 Saturn Sky; 2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt; and 2008-2011 Chevrolet HHR vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    571 B.R. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572 (Bankr.

The April 2015 Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a decision entered on April 15, 2015 (the \"April 2015 Decision\"), Judge Gerber addressed New GM's motions to enforce the Sale Order with respect to two sets of plaintiffs: (1) \"Economic Loss Plaintiffs,\" defined as a subset of plaintiffs with the \"Ignition Switch Defect\" seeking damages for \"losses to consumers ... alleged to have resulted from the Ignition Switch Defect\" that were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"accident claims involving post-sale deaths, personal injury, and property damage\"; and (2) \"Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs,\" a subset of plaintiffs with the \"Ignition Switch Defect\" bringing claims \"with respect to actual accidents\" that occurred prior to July 10, 2009, the Closing Date of the 363 Sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    April 2015 Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    529 B.R. at 521-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each category was defined in reference to the term \"Ignition Switch Defect,\" which itself was defined to mean \"serious defects in ignition switches that had been installed in Chevy Cobalts and HHRs, Pontiac G5s and Solstices, and Saturn Ions and Skys ..., going back to the 2005 model year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Gerber held off on resolving New GM's motions to enforce against \"Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs,\" a category he defined as individuals who had \"brought actions asserting Economic Loss claims as to GM branded cars that\n   <em>\n    did not have\n   </em>\n   Ignition Switch Defects, including cars made by New GM and Old GM alike\" and who \"contend[ed] ... that the Ignition Switch Defect caused damage to 'the brand.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court agreed with New GM that \"most of the claims now asserted against\" the company fell within the scope of the Sale Order bar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a matter of due process, however, the Court concluded that the Sale Order bar could not be enforced against debtors of Old GM who had lacked notice \"reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances to apprise people of the pendency of any proceeding that may result in their being deprived of any property\" and who had been prejudiced by the deprivation of such notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 523, 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that because a number of Old GM engineers, senior managers, and attorneys had been aware of the defective ignition switches at the time of the 363 Sale, Old GM had a known, and unsatisfied, recall obligation by the Closing Date. Owners of GM cars with the Ignition Switch Defect were therefore known creditors of Old GM and had been entitled to-and deprived of-actual, personalized notice of the 363 Sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 525, 538, 556-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the same time, Judge Gerber found that such Plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief unless they could also demonstrate that they had been prejudiced by the inadequate notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 560-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the Sale Order's bar on successor liability claims, the Bankruptcy Court found that Plaintiffs had not been prejudiced by lack of notice because the legal arguments they raised had been made, and overruled by the Court, at the time of the 363 Sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 566-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Gerber rejected Plaintiffs' alternative argument-that public outrage and political pressure might have resulted in a modification of the Amended Sale Agreement by Old GM, New GM, and Treasury-as unduly speculative.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By contrast, Judge Gerber agreed with the Economic Loss Plaintiffs that the Sale Order was overly broad to the extent that it purported to preclude claims against New GM premised solely on New GM's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   misconduct \"and not based on any kind of successor liability or any other act by Old GM.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 527, 568-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Gerber reasoned that \"New GM would have such liability not because it had assumed any Old GM liabilities, or was responsible for anything wrong that Old GM did, but only because it had engaged in independently wrongful, and otherwise actionable, conduct on its own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As relevant here, the Court also found that \"Used Car Purchasers,\" a subset of the Economic Loss Plaintiffs, had also been denied the requisite notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concluded that Used Car Purchasers were prejudiced, however, only insofar as their predecessors in interest had been prejudiced, because \"the successor in interest to a person or entity cannot acquire greater rights than his, her, or its transferor\" and thus New GM should \"receive the same protection from Used Car Owners' successor liability claims that it had from their assignors'.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 570-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court granted leave to file late claims that were premised only on New GM misconduct rather than based on successor liability for claims against Old GM, but cautioned that \"[c]laims premised in any way on Old GM conduct are properly proscribed under the Sale Agreement and the Sale Order, and by reason of the Court's other rulings, the prohibitions against the assertion of such claims stand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2015, Judge Gerber entered judgment on the April 2015 Decision and certified the judgment for direct review by the Second Circuit (the \"June 2015 Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Pillars Decision and Denial of Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To the extent relevant here, the Bankruptcy Court next considered an argument from Plaintiff Benjamin Pillars that his claims against New GM should proceed notwithstanding the Sale Order. Pillars, the widower of Kathleen Ann Pillars and representative of her estate, brought an action in Michigan state court alleging that his wife had died as a result of a 2005 accident caused by an ignition switch defect in her 2004 Pontiac Grand Am. Significantly, although the accident occurred in 2005, before the Closing Date, the decedent did not die until 2012, well after the Closing Date. (15-CV-8432, Docket No. 11, at 2). New GM removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and filed its answer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). In both its notice of removal and its answer, New GM emphasized the \"narrow band of certain liabilities\" it had assumed in the 363 Sale, quoting the Sale Agreement as providing that the company would assume \"all Liabilities to third parties for death, personal injury, or other injury to Persons or damage to property ... which arise directly out of accidents, incidents or other distinct and discreet [sic] occurrences that happen on or after the Closing Date.\" (Pillars Appendix A-201 n.1, A-234-35). Notably, though, the language New GM quoted came from the Original Sale Agreement-not from the Amended Sale Agreement that had been approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the Sale Order. At the same time, New GM appended to its notice of removal the Amended Sale Agreement. (Notice of Removal, Ex. C,\n   <em>\n    Pillars v. General Motors LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-11360 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 14, 2015), ECF No. 1-4, at 165).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before the Bankruptcy Court, Pillars argued that by quoting from the Original Sale Agreement in its notice of removal and answer, New GM had conceded that its Assumed Liabilities with respect to Pillars's case-and his case alone-included all \"accidents, incidents\n   <em>\n    or other distinct and discreet\n   </em>\n   [sic]\n   <em>\n    occurrences\n   </em>\n   that happen on or after the Closing Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pillars Appendix A-584-92 (emphasis added) ). Pillars contended that his wife's death constituted such an \"occurrence\" and that his claims against New GM should therefore proceed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). In an oral ruling (the \"Pillars Decision\"), Judge Gerber agreed. He did not buy Pillars's argument that New GM had deliberately inserted the Original Sale Agreement language into its notice of removal and answer because \"parties can and do quite often waive defenses or arguments that they may otherwise have\" or the related contention that New GM's opposition was just \"buyer's remorse on their part now that ... the consequences of their position has [sic] become apparent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-584-85, A-589-90). Instead, Judge Gerber found that New GM's use of the Original Sale Agreement language was \"plainly\" a mistake and that the relevant question was \"who should bear the consequences of that mistake.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-595). Judge Gerber noted that \"when people answer complaints we hold people to what they say\" and remarked that New GM \"[o]bviously ... has the ability to ensure that its counsel do their jobs, and it's not too much to hold GM for the consequences of what its counsel, who is plainly an agent, did.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-595, A-605). On those bases, Judge Gerber found that New GM had judicially admitted that the Original Sale Agreement applied to Pillars's suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-605). Further, Judge Gerber interpreted the word\n   \"occurrences\" in that Agreement to include Pillars's wife's death and, thus, permitted Pillars's suit to proceed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-605;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at A-577).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the Pillars Decision, the Michigan District Court granted New GM's motion to amend its notice of removal and answer to replace the language from the Original Sale Agreement with the more limited language from the Amended Sale Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-817). New GM then returned to the Bankruptcy Court seeking reconsideration of the Pillars Decision in light of the amended pleadings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Judge Gerber denied the motion, ruling that the amended pleadings were not \"new evidence\" for which relief could be granted because the \"mistaken references to the [Original Sale Agreement] in New GM's initial pleadings were clearly discoverable by New GM prior to the July 16 Hearing, and New GM in fact had knowledge of such mistakes prior to that hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-819-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The November 2015 Imputation Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In November 2015, Judge Gerber issued another opinion (the \"November 2015 Imputation Decision\") in his capacity as the \"gatekeeper\" responsible for deciding which claims and allegations against New GM could proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    November 2015 Imputation Decision\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    541 B.R. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (Bankr.

New GM's knowledge of a particular issue or at a given point in time could not be decided in the abstract, he explained, but rather had to be evaluated in the context of individualized allegations and factual determinations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court concluded that, in cases involving Old GM-manufactured vehicles, punitive damages could generally be sought against New GM based only on New GM knowledge or conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, the Court noted that claims arising from New GM-manufactured vehicles were not covered by the Sale Order and that plaintiffs in such actions could seek punitive damages against New GM premised on either New GM or Old GM knowledge or conduct, to the extent permitted under nonbankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the Court addressed \"the propriety of particular allegations in particular complaints, as objected to by New GM,\" generally striking allegations to the extent that they sought to hold New GM responsible for liabilities it did not assume as a matter of successor liability or for punitive damages based on Old GM conduct or knowledge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 126-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Gerber also struck allegations that \"mudd[ied] the distinctions between Old GM and New GM.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perhaps most important for present purposes, the Bankruptcy Court sustained New GM's objections to \"claims alleging that New GM committed fraud in connection with\n   <em>\n    Old GM's\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy-more specifically, that if New GM had not engaged in fraudulent concealment of ignition switch defects, class members would have filed claims before the Bar Date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 133-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court opined that those claims (the \"Fraudulent Concealment Claims\") impermissibly sought \"to impose liability based, in material part, on Old GM conduct, and assert[ed] forbidden successor liability claim[s] dressed up to look like something else. And they rest[ed] on duties that do not exist under bankruptcy law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Bankruptcy Court further found that Plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims were assumed by New GM under the Amended Sale Agreement and, thus, could pass through the bankruptcy gate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 128-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In December 2015, the November 2015 Imputation Decision was memorialized in a judgment (the \"December 2015 Judgment\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-50026 (REG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2011070293\">\n    2015 WL 11070293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The Second Circuit Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Four groups of plaintiffs (the \"Groman Plaintiffs,\" Ignition Switch Plaintiffs, a handful of Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs represented by attorney Gary Peller, and Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs) appealed the April 2015 Decision directly to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals resolved those appeals in a July 2016 opinion (the \"Second Circuit Opinion\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2016). Most relevant for present purposes, the Second Circuit ruled on the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction over New GM's motions to enforce, the scope of the Sale Order and the claims it purported to bar,\n   and the procedural due process concerns addressed in the April 2015 Decision. The Circuit first confirmed that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to interpret the Amended Sale Agreement and its own prior orders and to enjoin claims against New GM that were inconsistent with the Sale Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    at 152-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Bankruptcy Court's decision interpreting and enforcing the Sale Order, the Circuit reasoned, was a proper exercise of its \"arising in\" jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Circuit then analyzed the scope of the Sale Order to evaluate which claims were barred and which fell outside its coverage. Noting that Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to sell its assets \"free and clear of any interest in such property,\" the Circuit concluded that successor liability claims like the Plaintiffs' might qualify as \"interests,\" but could only be precluded by the Sale Order if they also constituted \"claims\" that could be barred under Chapter 11 more generally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 154-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit defined a claim as \"(1) a right to payment (2) that arose before the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition\" and opined that, \"[i]f the right to payment is contingent on future events, the claim must instead result from pre-petition conduct fairly giving rise to that contingent claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). A claim could not, the Court reasoned, \"be extended to include claimants whom the record indicates were completely unknown and unidentified at the time the debtor filed its petition and whose rights depended entirely on the fortuity of future occurrences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (ellipsis and brackets omitted). Both \"practical and constitutional\" considerations require a \"minimum contact or relationship that makes identifiable the individual with whom the claim does or would rest\" before a claim can be barred in a sale pursuant to Section 363.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With those principles in hand, the Second Circuit turned to whether the Sale Order purported to bar \"(1) pre-closing accident claims, (2) economic loss claims arising from the ignition switch defect or other defects, (3) independent claims relating only to New GM's conduct, and (4) Used Car Purchasers' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Circuit found that the first two categories of claims were subject to the Sale Order bar, as pre-closing accident claims were, by definition, tort claims that arose before the 363 Sale and the economic loss claims were contingent claims that could not be brought at the time of the Sale only because Old GM had not disclosed the Ignition Switch Defect to the public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the Circuit held that the third and fourth categories of claims fell outside the scope of the \"free and clear\" provision of the Sale Order. With respect to \"independent claims relating only to New GM's conduct,\" the Circuit determined \"[t]hese sorts of claims,\" by their nature, \"are based on New GM's\n   <em>\n    post-\n   </em>\n   petition conduct, and are not claims that are based on a right to payment that arose before the filing of petition or that are based on pre-petition conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claims of the Used Car Purchasers (defined by the Circuit as those \"Ignition Switch Plaintiffs\" who purchased used Old GM cars after the Closing Date,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 151 ) were not covered by the Sale Order because those Plaintiffs \"purchased Old GM cars\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the closing, without knowledge of the defect or possible claim against New GM\" and \"[t]here could have been no contact or relationship-actual or presumed-between Old GM and these specific plaintiffs, who otherwise had no awareness of the ignition switch defect or putative claims against New GM.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Circuit affirmed (albeit on different grounds) Judge Gerber's decision\n   not to enjoin \"independent claims\" and reversed his decision to enjoin the Used Car Purchasers' claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Circuit then turned to the Bankruptcy Court's due process analysis. The Circuit found no clear error in the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that \"because Old GM knew or reasonably should have known about the ignition switch defect prior to bankruptcy, it should have provided direct mail notice to vehicle owners.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, assuming without deciding that the Bankruptcy Court correctly required a showing of prejudice, the Circuit found that it could not \"say with fair assurance that the outcome of the \u00a7 363 sale proceedings would have been the same had Old GM disclosed the ignition switch defect and these plaintiffs voiced their objections to the 'free and clear provision.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"there was a reasonable possibility that plaintiffs could have negotiated some relief from the Sale Order,\" the Court of Appeals reversed the April 2015 Decision \"insofar as it enforced the Sale Order to enjoin claims relating to the ignition switch defect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that \"many of the peculiar facts discussed apply with less force to the Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs, who assert claims arising from other defects,\" and that the Bankruptcy Court had not ruled on Old GM's knowledge of other defects, the Court of Appeals vacated the Bankruptcy Court's decision \"[a]s to claims based in non-ignition switch defects\" and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

On June 7, 2017, he issued the next decision relevant to these appeals (the \"Pitterman Opinion\"), relating to\n   <em>\n    Pitterman v.

In light of New GM's concession that the failure-to-warn claims based on the conduct of Old GM were\n   Assumed Liabilities under the Amended Sale Agreement, he permitted such claims through the bankruptcy gate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, Judge Glenn noted that Judge Gerber had previously concluded that New GM had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   assumed liability for product liability claims arising from Old GM's failure to recall or retrofit, and he declined to revisit \"this decision as a matter of contract interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    at 229-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, Judge Glenn determined that Judge Gerber had not previously ruled on the availability of failure-to-warn and failure-to-recall or failure-to-retrofit claims based solely on New GM conduct and had addressed only the extent to which \"Independent Claims\" were available to \"Ignition Switch Plaintiffs\" in his relevant decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    at 223-27, 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Glenn found that the Second Circuit's conclusion that \"truly independent claims necessarily are not 'claims' that can be barred by a section 363 sale order\" applied equally to plaintiffs without the Ignition Switch Defect, including the Pitterman Plaintiffs, and ruled that such claims could proceed so long as they were truly premised on New GM conduct alone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    at 230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent certain allegations in the Pitterman complaint impermissibly muddied the distinction between the conduct and knowledge of Old GM and those of New GM, counsel for the Pitterman Plaintiffs offered to amend their failure-to-recall and failure-to-retrofit claims to remove references to Old GM.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Bankruptcy Court struck a reference in the Pitterman amended complaint to a 2006 bulletin promulgated by Old GM, but otherwise allowed the Pitterman Action to proceed, leaving the question of whether the complaint properly stated claims against New GM under nonbankruptcy law for the District Court to\n   decide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-5970-71). The Pitterman Action then proceeded to trial before a jury, which rendered a verdict in favor of the Pitterman Plaintiffs on July 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Pitterman v.

The July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 12, 2017, Judge Glenn issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order resolving the remaining 2016 Threshold Issues (the \"July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    571 B.R. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Judge Glenn addressed whether a plaintiff must have owned a \"Subject Vehicle\" to qualify as an \"Ignition Switch Plaintiff\" within the meaning of the Second Circuit's decision. The definition of that term was critical because the Second Circuit had held that Ignition Switch Plaintiffs could proceed with their claims notwithstanding the Sale Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the Second Circuit did not reach whether plaintiffs without the Ignition Switch Defect could proceed with their claims. Instead, the Court left it to the Bankruptcy Court to determine in the first instance whether\n   <em>\n    Non\n   </em>\n   -Ignition Switch Plaintiffs could also establish a due process violation that would entitle them to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To determine the meaning of \"Ignition Switch Plaintiff,\" Judge Glenn looked to the Stipulated Facts agreed to by the parties-specifically, at the definitions of \"Ignition Switch\" (which was limited to Subject Vehicles) and \"Subject Vehicles\" set forth therein. He noted that \"[t]his Court and the parties defined the Ignition Switch Defect according to the Stipulated Facts; in other words, the Ignition Switch Defect is the defect in the Subject Vehicles that gave rise to\" the first recall by New GM (\"NHTSA Recall No. 14v047\"), and thus concluded that it was \"clear from the April [2015] Decision that Judge Gerber used the terms 'Ignition Switch Defect' to mean\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the defect in the Subject Vehicles that gave rise to NHTSA Recall No. 14v047.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572. Looking at the Second Circuit Opinion, the Bankruptcy Court further found that the Second Circuit \"framed the issue just as the Bankruptcy Court had\" and that it was \"clear from the context of the opinion ... that the Second Circuit's use of the terms 'ignition switch' and 'ignition switch defect' refer to the Ignition Switch Defect in the Subject Vehicles as defined by Judge Gerber in the April Decision and June Judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 573-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, the Bankruptcy Court addressed the extent to which \"Used Car Purchasers\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   were bound by the Sale Order and the applicability of the Second Circuit Opinion to purchasers of used GM vehicles that did not have the Ignition Switch Defect (\"Threshold Issue Three\"). Judge Glenn noted that, in the April 2015 Decision, Judge Gerber had defined \"Used Car Purchasers\" as a subset of Ignition Switch or Economic Loss Plaintiffs; \"Economic Loss Plaintiffs,\" in turn, comprised individuals claiming financial losses \"alleged to have resulted from the Ignition Switch Defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 574. Judge Gerber had found that while Used Car Purchasers, like the broader category of Ignition Switch Plaintiffs, had been denied due process by the 363 Sale, they had not been prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Glenn noted Judge Gerber's holding that \"the successor in interest to a person or entity cannot acquire greater rights than his, her, or its transferor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Glenn then described the Second Circuit Opinion as holding that Used Car Purchasers-\"individuals who had purchased Old GM cars secondhand after the \u00a7 363 sale closed\" who were \"[i]ncluded within the Ignition Switch Plaintiffs,\"\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   151 -\"had been prejudiced by the lack of actual notice of the 363 Sale, and were therefore not bound by the Sale Order.\"\n   <em>\n    July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    571 B.R. at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Judge Glenn determined that the Second Circuit had \"reversed Judge Gerber's determination that the Used Car Purchasers had not shown that they were prejudiced, but did not disturb Judge Gerber's ruling that owners of used cars cannot acquired more rights than the seller had,\" he concluded that the latter ruling was the law of the case and thus binding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    at 575, 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the Bankruptcy Court returned to the issue of punitive damages. Judge Glenn noted that Judge Gerber had ruled as a matter of contract interpretation that New GM did not assume liability for punitive damages based on Old GM's conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 575-76 (citing\n   <em>\n    November 2015 Imputation Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    541 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   108 ).

As Judge Glenn explained, any punitive damages claims against New GM based on Old GM conduct were necessarily successor liability claims, for which New GM could be held liable only to the same extent as its predecessor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 579. And, under the federal bankruptcy priority scheme, Old GM would never have been liable for punitive damages because it was \"deeply insolvent\" and could not even satisfy its higher priority claims, including general unsecured claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 580. That is, Judge Glenn concluded, punitive damages claims would have been categorically barred as a matter of bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 580.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Reichwaldt Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The final decision relevant to these appeals, entered on August 31, 2017, pertains to the complaint filed by Kaitlyn Reichwaldt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Motors Liquidation Co.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Reichwaldt Order\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268845\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/313/\">\n    576 B.R. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Reichwaldt sued New GM after the fuel tank of a 1984 Chevrolet pickup truck exploded in a 2015 impact with her own vehicle, making her a \"Non-Ignition Switch Post-Closing Accident Plaintiff.\" In Reichwaldt's complaint, she raised claims predicated on negligence and strict liability, reckless and wanton conduct, and failure to warn, and she sought compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   New GM filed a motion to enforce the Sale Order against Reichwaldt, claiming that allegations in her complaint impermissibly sought punitive damages on (1) Assumed Liabilities, for which punitive damages are unavailable, and (2) claims for which Reichwaldt impermissibly relied on Old GM conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Reichwaldt's failure-to-warn claim impermissibly sought punitive damages against New GM based on Old GM conduct and conflated the two entities and, thus, did not qualify as an \"Independent Claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268845\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/313/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268845\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/313/\">\n    at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court addresses the appeals together, where possible, and individually, where necessary.

Appeals Relating to Pillars's Claims (15-CV-8432 and 17-CV-6196)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   New GM and Pillars both appeal from decisions of the Bankruptcy Court relating to Pillars's claims. First, New GM appeals from Judge Gerber's decision holding that Pillars could pursue his claims because they fell within the definition of Assumed Liabilities that New GM included in its notice of removal and original answer. (15-CV-8432, Docket No. 10 (\"New GM First Pillars Br.\") ). Second, Pillars appeals from Judge Glenn's decision construing the meaning of \"Ignition Switch Defect\" as that term was used by the Second Circuit. (17-CV-6196, Docket No. 7 (\"Pillars Second Br.\") ). The upshot is that Pillars argues there are two independent bases to allow his claims through the bankruptcy gate. First, he argues that this Court should affirm the Bankruptcy Court's determination that New GM admitted to having assumed liability for Pillars's claims. Second, he asserts that, contrary to the Bankruptcy Court's determination, he is an \"Ignition Switch Defect\" Plaintiff, as that phrase was used by the Second Circuit, and that he has therefore already established a due process violation. Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court begins with the judicial admission question, which is unique to Pillars's case. It is well established that \"[a] pleading prepared by an attorney is an admission by one presumptively authorized to speak for his principal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Kunglig Jarnvagsstyrelsen v.

As an initial matter, judicial admissions are generally limited to admissions of\n   <em>\n    fact, see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellefonte Re Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins.

But in any event, the Bankruptcy Court made no reference to the standard for identifying a judicial admission. It did not determine that New GM's use of the Original Sale Agreement was an unequivocal, deliberate, clear, or unambiguous admission that New GM had assumed liability for Pillars's claim. In fact, the Bankruptcy Court expressly determined-despite Pillars's arguments to the contrary-that New GM's use of language from the Original Sale Agreement in the notice of removal and the answer was \"plainly\" a mistake on the part of New GM's counsel.

Thus, the Bankruptcy Court misapplied-or, more to the point, failed to apply-the standard by which courts are intended to gauge whether something is a judicial admission. Instead of assessing whether New GM had actually admitted liability for \"accidents, incidents or other occurrences\" under the governing legal standards, the Bankruptcy Court simply held that New GM should be held accountable \"for the consequences of\" its counsel's mistake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-605). That was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court's original assessment of New GM's use of the Original Sale Agreement language in the notice of removal and answer: It was a mistake rather than a deliberate or unequivocal admission that the Original Sale Agreement should apply. There is no indication that counsel for New GM intentionally or even knowingly inserted the language from the Original Sale Agreement; nor is there any plausible reason New GM might have wanted to agree to be bound by an earlier iteration of the Sale Agreement than the one eventually approved by the Court. Indeed, New GM actually attached the Amended Sale Agreement to its notice of removal, (Notice of Removal, Ex. C,\n   <em>\n    Pillars v. General Motors LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-11360 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 14, 2015), ECF No. 1-4, at 165;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pillars Appendix A-163), even as it\n   quoted from the wrong version, (Pillars Appendix A-234-35), belying Pillars's conclusory assertion that New GM might have made a tactical decision to be bound by the earlier version of the Sale Agreement. (15-CV-8432, Docket No. 11, at 8 n.4). Moreover, even if use of the Original Sale Agreement language had been \"deliberate,\" relying on the wrong version of the Sale Agreement is a far cry from unequivocally admitting that New GM had assumed liability for Pillars's accident. In fact, in the same paragraph in its answer in which New GM erroneously quoted the Original Sale Agreement, it simultaneously \"denie[d] the subject accident [wa]s an assumed liability pursuant to the Sale Order and Injunction.\" (Pillars Appendix A-234-35). In short, the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in ruling that this mistake constituted a judicial admission, and Pillars cannot pass through the bankruptcy gate on that ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Pillars's second argument-that the Bankruptcy Court erred in limiting the definition of \"Ignition Switch Defect\" to defective ignition switches found in \"Subject Vehicles\" and, thus, in excluding Pillars's claims from the Second Circuit's prejudice holding-fares no better. Judge Gerber first adopted the parties' Stipulated Facts in August 2014, and the Bankruptcy Court relied upon those stipulations in defining important terms in its myriad decisions in the bankruptcy proceedings. In the Stipulated Facts, the parties agreed that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   Subject Vehicles contained a defective \"Ignition Switch\" and limited the universe of Subject Vehicles to certain Chevrolets, Pontiacs, and Saturns-a universe that did not include Pillars's wife's 2004 Pontiac Grand Am. In its first pertinent decision in this matter, the Bankruptcy Court defined \"Ignition Switch Defect\" to mean \"serious defects in ignition switches that had been installed in Chevy Cobalts and HHRs, Pontiac G5s and Solstices, and Saturn Ions and Skys ..., going back to the 2005 model year.\"\n   <em>\n    April 2015 Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116787\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/529/510/#p531\">\n    529 B.R. at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the June 2015 Judgment, Judge Gerber similarly defined the term \"Ignition Switch Plaintiff\" to mean a plaintiff who had \"commenced a lawsuit against New GM asserting economic losses based on or arising from the Ignition Switch in the Subject Vehicles (each term as defined in the [Stipulated Facts] ).\" (Pillars Appendix A-304 n.1 (citation omitted) ). These definitions delineated the scope of the Court's rulings with respect to the Ignition Switch Defect and limited the holdings to defective \"Subject Vehicles.\" And it was these decisions that were on appeal before the Second Circuit. Because Pillars's wife's vehicle was not among the cars that could by definition have an Ignition Switch Defect according to the April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment, Pillars's case falls outside the purview of the Second Circuit's holding, and he cannot benefit directly from the Second Circuit Opinion reversing the Sale Order bar as to plaintiffs alleging an Ignition Switch Defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pillars asserts that the Second Circuit Opinion extends more broadly than the April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment it reviewed. Thus, he contends, in reversing the prejudice holding of the Bankruptcy Court and allowing certain claims to proceed, the Second Circuit swept in plaintiffs like Pillars. (Pillars Second\n   Br. 11-16). It is hard to imagine, however, that the Second Circuit would, without comment, use the same terms used by the Bankruptcy Court, but mean something materially different. And the Second Circuit gave no indication in its lengthy opinion that it was construing the relevant terms differently than the Bankruptcy Court had. Moreover, the scope of appellate review is generally delimited by the scope of the lower court's opinion; courts of appeals typically may not rule on matters or expand the record beyond the decision under review, as they have \"no jurisdiction save to correct errors.\"\n   <em>\n    Dictograph Prod. Co. v. Sonotone Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"74408\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/231/867/#p867\">\n    231 F.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 867 (2d Cir. 1956) (per curiam). Here, the April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment were restricted to Subject Vehicles, setting outer bounds for the record the Second Circuit considered and, thus, for the scope of the Second Circuit's holding, regardless of the breadth of the language the Court used in its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Taking a different tack (and perhaps a cue from his earlier success with such arguments), Pillars asserts that the Bankruptcy Court erred in refusing to hold New GM to its \"judicial admission\" that his claim is \"identical\" to those of the Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs. (Pillars Second Br. 6-11). Judge Gerber, however, did not abuse his discretion in concluding that New GM's statement-\"that Pillars,\n   <em>\n    like\n   </em>\n   the Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs, was barred from asserting claims against New GM\"-is \"not the same as stating the two sets of plaintiffs are one and the same.\"\n   <em>\n    July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    571 B.R. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). New GM's argument against Pillars's claim proceeding was not that he\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiff, but rather that the June 2015 Judgment should bar claims of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, \"like Movant, who were involved in accidents that occurred prior to the closing of the 363 Sale.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pillars Second Br. 8-9). In other words, New GM was arguing, by analogy, that the Bankruptcy Court's April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment should apply to a broader category than the Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs, a category that included Pillars; there is no basis to read its statements in context to deliberately and intentionally admit that Pillars\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiff and therefore\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   bound by those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Alternatively, Pillars points to language in New GM's briefing before this Court in an earlier appeal, in which the company argued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [T]he Bankruptcy Court confirmed on two separate occasions that any claim based on a pre-363 Sale accident-like the claims asserted by [Pillars]-cannot be asserted against New GM, and is proscribed by the Sale Order and Injunction. Specifically, the June Judgment expressly held as follows: \"Any claims and/or causes of action brought by the Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs that seek to hold New GM liable for accidents or incidents that occurred prior to the closing of the 363 Sale are barred and enjoined pursuant to the Sale Order.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Pillars Second Br. 8). Pillars asserts that this statement should be read as an admission that he\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiff. But in the quoted language, New GM again argued that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims based on pre-Closing Date accidents were barred by the Sale Order, citing the April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment as support. Taken to its logical conclusion, Pillars's argument would suggest that New GM judicially admitted that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiffs were \"Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident\n   Plaintiffs,\" which is plainly not what New GM intended. Indeed, the remainder of the paragraph to which Pillars cites reveals that New GM was merely arguing that Pillars's \"claims arise from a pre-363 Sale accident and, under the Bankruptcy Court's orders, should be barred.\" (New GM First Pillars Br. 12-13). In short, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Pillars's argument that New GM admitted that he is an Ignition Switch Pre-Closing Accident Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In short, Pillars's suit may not pass through the bankruptcy gate on the basis of either of the arguments he presents to this Court, because New GM did not judicially admit liability for his claims and his action against New GM did not arise from a Subject Vehicle containing the Ignition Switch Defect. Accordingly, the Court vacates the Bankruptcy Court's determination that New GM judicially admitted liability for Pillars's claim, affirms its conclusion that only plaintiffs with the Ignition Switch Defect in a Subject Vehicle are Ignition Switch Plaintiffs, and remands Pillars's case for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Br.\"), at 1) ) challenge the Bankruptcy Court's determination in the November 2015 Imputation Decision that their claims against New GM for \"fraud by concealment of the right to file a claim against Old GM in bankruptcy\" are not properly pleaded \"Independent Claims.\"\n   <em>\n    November 2015 Imputation Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    541 B.R. at 133-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an initial matter, despite Plaintiffs' assertions to the contrary, the Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to address the question of whether these claims were truly Independent Claims. Plaintiffs may be correct that \"the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin direct claims against New GM arising solely from its own post-Sale violations of its independent legal duties.\" (Fraudulent Concealment Pls.' Br. 3, 17-19). But that argument puts the cart before the horse. Judge Gerber correctly acknowledged that, \"on Product Liabilities Claims and Independent Claims alike, New GM may be held responsible, on claims for both compensatory and punitive damages, for its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   knowledge and conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    November 2015 Imputation Decision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    541 B.R. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question he sought to answer, however, was whether Plaintiffs' claims were truly Independent Claims, in which case they could proceed, or rather \"successor liability claim[s] 'dressed up to look like something else,' \" in which case they could not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original). He clearly had jurisdiction to answer that question and, after concluding that the claims were actually successor liability claims, to enjoin them-as those tasks involved interpreting and enforcing the Sale Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 152-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   That said, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that their Fraudulent Concealment Claims, as defined above, are properly pleaded Independent Claims that may pass through the bankruptcy gate. Put simply, the Ignition Switch and Adams Plaintiffs allege that New GM had knowledge of the Ignition Switch Defect; that it improperly concealed its knowledge of that defect, depriving Plaintiffs of notice of the defect; that it had a \"duty to disclose the Delta Ignition Switch Defect because the information was known and/or accessible\n   only to New GM who had superior knowledge and access to the facts,\" as well as \"monitoring and disclosure duties under the TREAD Act ... that required the disclosure of the defect\"; and that, because of this fraudulent concealment, Plaintiffs lacked the opportunity to timely file proofs of claims against Old GM. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 14-MD-2543, Docket No. 3356, \u00b6\u00b6 1163-84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   14-MD-2543, Docket No. 4838, \u00b6\u00b6 1135-56). Some loose language in Plaintiffs' briefing before the Bankruptcy Court aside, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   16-CV-0098, Docket No. 9-1, at A-617); 16-CV-0098, Docket No. 10 (\"New GM Fraudulent Concealment Br.\"), at 16, 19), Plaintiffs do not argue\n   <em>\n    as a matter of bankruptcy law\n   </em>\n   that New GM deprived them of notice, let alone seek on the basis of New GM's alleged concealment leave to file late proofs of claim. Instead, they contend that New GM had a duty to disclose\n   <em>\n    under nonbankruptcy law\n   </em>\n   and that, by virtue of New GM's independent breach of that duty, they suffered\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   because they could not file timely proofs of claim. That is, the mere fact that they allege a form of injury relating to the bankruptcy proceedings does not mean that they allege a duty arising from those proceedings. Whether or not Plaintiffs' theory is valid as a matter of nonbankruptcy law-a question the Court does not reach here, despite New GM's invitation to do so, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   New GM Fraudulent Concealment Br. 18-22)-the Court concludes that the Fraudulent Concealment Claims qualify as Independent Claims that may proceed. Accordingly, it vacates the Bankruptcy Court's decision to the contrary and remands for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C. New GM's Appeal of the Pitterman Opinion (17-CV-6120)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the next appeal, New GM challenges the Bankruptcy Court's determination that plaintiffs without the Ignition Switch Defect are not barred by the November 2015 Imputation Decision and December 2015 Judgment from pursuing Independent Claims against New GM as a general matter and that the Pitterman Plaintiffs assert valid Independent Claims against New GM. For substantially the reasons stated by Judge Glenn in his thorough analysis of the issue, the Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had not previously barred Independent Claims against New GM brought by plaintiffs without the Ignition Switch Defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitterman Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    568 B.R. at 224-27, 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the Court notes that the law-of-the-case doctrine is \"a discretionary rule of practice ... and does not preclude a court from reconsidering its prior opinions, especially in light of an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottish Air Int'l v. British Caledonian Grp., PLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7849882\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/152/18/#p24\">\n    152 F.R.D. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24-25 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \"[i]t is well established that ... interlocutory orders and rulings ... are subject to modification by the ... judge at any time prior to final judgment, and may be modified to the same extent if the case is reassigned to another judge.\"\n   <em>\n    In re \"Agent Orange\" Prod.

Therefore, although the Court agrees with Judge Glenn's interpretation of Judge Gerber's prior rulings on this front, Judge Glenn had discretion to revisit the decisions of his predecessor in any event. Finally, the Court agrees with Judge Glenn-and New GM does not (and, in light of the Second Circuit Opinion, cannot) really dispute-that \"truly independent claims necessarily are not 'claims' that can be by barred a section 363 sale order.\"\n   <em>\n    Pitterman Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269119\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/217/\">\n    568 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   230 (citing\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   157 ). Accordingly, the\n   Bankruptcy Court appropriately applied the analysis from the Second Circuit Opinion to the case of plaintiffs without the Ignition Switch Defect to conclude that the Sale Order cannot be read, consistent with either due process or bankruptcy law, to preclude Independent Claims predicated solely on New GM conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   That leaves the question of whether the Bankruptcy Court correctly permitted the Pitterman Plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claim to pass through the bankruptcy gate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, too, the Court agrees with Judge Glenn. As amended, Paragraph 27 of the Pitterman Plaintiffs' complaint alleges in its entirety: \"Despite information and knowledge available and known to defendant [New GM], including knowledge of numerous 'rollaway' incidents caused by the defects described herein in which numerous people, especially children, were catastrophically injured or killed, the defendant [New GM] took no steps after June 2009 to directly notify and/or warn owners or the public of these defects.\" (17-CV-6120, Docket No. 29-1, at A-27). On its face, therefore, the amended complaint alleges that New GM had independent knowledge of the alleged defect\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Closing Date of the 363 Sale and that its duty to warn arose from that knowledge; despite New GM's claims to the contrary, the amended complaint does not attempt to \"bootstrap\" the knowledge or conduct of Old GM onto purportedly Independent Claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at A-59-60). New GM may ultimately be right in arguing that, given its lack of a relationship with the Pitterman Plaintiffs and other factors, it did not have a post-sale duty to warn them. (New GM Pitterman Br. 19, 30-31). But that is a question of\n   <em>\n    nonbankruptcy\n   </em>\n   law for the Connecticut District Court to decide in the first instance (subject to appellate review). The sole question for the Bankruptcy Court-and for this Court here-is whether the allegations in the Pitterman Plaintiffs' amended complaint were sufficient to state an Independent Claim so as to proceed through the bankruptcy gate. The Court concludes that they were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

To the extent relevant here, Judge Glenn rested that refusal on two independent grounds. First, he ruled that the November 2015 Imputation Decision-in\n   which Judge Gerber held that New GM did not contractually assume liability for punitive damages claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355620\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/104/#p110\">\n    541 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   116-21 -was the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n    571 B.R. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Judge Glenn held that \"punitive damages against New GM based on Old GM conduct are not available under federal bankruptcy law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269230\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/571/565/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Plaintiffs take issue with both rulings as well as Judge Gerber's conclusion that New GM did not contractually assume liability for punitive damages pursuant to the Sale Order. The Court need not reach the merits of the contractual argument, however, as it agrees with Judge Glenn's two other rationales for barring punitive damages based on Old GM's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, the Court agrees that Judge Gerber's November 2015 Imputation Decision is law of the case. \"Under the law of the case doctrine, a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a case becomes binding precedent to be followed in subsequent stages of the same litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re PCH Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507500,11937838\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/949/585/\">\n    949 F.2d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592 (2d Cir. 1991). Notably, Plaintiffs here do not argue as a general matter that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in declining to disturb the earlier determination that New GM did not contractually assume liability for punitive damages. Instead, they contend that the doctrine does not preclude them from relitigating the issue because they were not parties to the November 2015 Imputation Decision. Plaintiffs, however, cite no precedent suggesting that a court is obligated to revisit a prior ruling on a question of law merely because certain parties did not participate in the earlier ruling or that it would be an abuse of discretion not to do so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christianson v.

Accordingly, punitive damages would never be available against a debtor, like Old GM, which was unable to repay its general unsecured claims in full.

In short, because Plaintiffs would have been unable to assert punitive damages claims against Old GM as a matter of bankruptcy law, Judge Glenn correctly concluded that there is no liability for such claims to be transferred to New GM and that those claims cannot be brought against New GM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In arguing otherwise, Plaintiffs cite only two cases:\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

(17-CV-6088, Docket No. 29, at 20). Those cases, however, do not help Plaintiffs' argument. First, neither case involved a bankruptcy, and thus neither implicated the Section 726 prioritization scheme in\n   which punitive damages are categorically unavailable against a predecessor unable to fulfill its obligations to general unsecured creditors. Second, both cases involved the \"special federal common law doctrine of successor liability\" for employment discrimination judgments, which represents a \"departure from the more limited approach of the common law generally.\"\n   <em>\n    G-K-G\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526994\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/39/740/\">\n    39 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   748 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SWP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497509\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/153/911/\">\n    153 F.Supp.2d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Successor liability for employment discrimination judgments is broader than the common law exceptions.\").

The Second Circuit distinguished between the rights of the Ignition Switch Plaintiffs (the predecessors in interest) and the Used Car Purchasers (their successors in interest) in a critical way: While the Ignition Switch Plaintiffs fell within the scope of the Sale Order (and only escaped its bar because their due process rights had been violated), the Used Car Purchasers were not subject to the Sale Order at all. With respect to the latter, the Court explained, \"[t]here could have been no contact or relationship-actual or presumed-between Old GM and these specific plaintiffs, who otherwise had no awareness of ... putative claims against New GM.\"\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For one, it compels the conclusion that the claims of Non-Ignition Switch Post-Closing Accident Plaintiffs who purchased their GM vehicles used may proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As those Plaintiffs purchased GM vehicles and suffered accidents after the Closing Date, they fall squarely within the scope of the Second Circuit's holding that the Sale Order cannot be applied to those who \"had no relation with Old GM prior to bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, although it is a closer call, the Court concludes that Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs who purchased GM vehicles used after\n   the Closing Date are also not bound by the Sale Order. It is possible that some economic losses relating to non-Ignition Switch Defects might have been incurred before the 363 Sale, and therefore it is not by definition true that the general public had \"no awareness of the ... defect or putative claims against New GM.\"\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet, as with the used car purchasers who are Post-Closing Accident Plaintiffs, the Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs who purchased used vehicles after the Closing Date necessarily \"had no relation with Old GM prior to bankruptcy\" and thus \"[t]here could have been no contact or relationship-actual or presumed-between Old GM and these specific plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court vacates the Bankruptcy Court's decision with respect to Threshold Issue Three and remands for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Reichwaldt's Appeal (17-CV-8294)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   That leaves only Reichwaldt's appeal. Beyond the arguments raised by the other Plaintiffs appealing from the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion, discussed above, Reichwaldt raises a \"narrow\" additional issue: whether \"New GM contractually assumed liability for ... punitive damages as part of the \u00a7 363 Sale in Old GM's bankruptcy.\" (17-CV-8294, Docket No 15 (\"Reichwaldt Br.\"), 2). Yet, in order to reach that \"narrow\" issue, the Court must first get past the Bankruptcy Court's determination that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and the law-of-the-case doctrine bar Reichwaldt from relitigating earlier decisions precluding the pursuit of punitive damages against New GM based on Old GM conduct. Reichwaldt asserts that she is not bound by the Bankruptcy Court's earlier holdings because she was not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings when the November 2015 Imputation Decision was issued and because she did not have adequate notice pursuant to the December 2016 Order to Show Cause that the Bankruptcy Court might address the contractual assumption argument in the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion. As discussed, however, the law-of-the-case doctrine does not turn on whether all parties to a proceeding participated in the earlier resolution of a legal issue, and the Bankruptcy Court was not required to revisit anew the contractual assumption question each time a new party joined the bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, Reichwaldt's arguments concerning her notice of the December 2016 Order to Show Cause are somewhat disingenuous. There is no dispute she received the Order. Instead, her argument rests on the fact that the Order did not expressly refer to contractual assumption of liability for punitive damages. (Reichwaldt Br. 15-19). But the primary means by which New GM could have successor liability for claims arising out of Old GM's conduct is through contractual assumption of liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Buying Ins. Servs., Inc. v. S. Kornreich &amp; Sons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651375\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/240/#p249\">\n    944 F.Supp. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (\"In general, successor liability will lie when ... there is an express or implied agreement to assume the other company's debts and obligations....\"). Ultimately, there were no magic words the Bankruptcy Court was required to use in the Order to Show Cause to put parties to the bankruptcy proceedings on notice that it would address contractual assumption of liability in the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion. Informing the parties that the availability of \"successor liability claims against New GM ... seek[ing] punitive damages\" would be decided among the 2016 Threshold Issues was sufficient. (Pitterman Appendix A-4165). That is particularly true given that the phrase Reichwaldt uses repeatedly-\"Contractual Assumption Argument\"-appears to be an invention of hers\n   rather than a term of art used by courts or parties in these proceedings. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   parties to the bankruptcy proceedings understood that the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion might revisit the Bankruptcy Court's prior determination that New GM had not contractually assumed punitive damages claims pursuant to the Amended Sale Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-CV-8294, Docket No. 16, at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Reichwaldt further argues that the 2016 Threshold Issues \"grew directly out of the Second Circuit's July 2016 opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the Bankruptcy Court's April 2015 Decision and June 2015 Judgment,\" which in turn \"had nothing to do with Non-Ignition Switch Post Closing Accident Plaintiffs and did not consider the Contractual Assumption Argument.\" (Reichwaldt Br. 16-17). But while the 2016 Threshold Issues emerged from the aftermath of the Second Circuit Opinion, the Order to Show Cause did not indicate that it was limited to issues expressly reserved by the Second Circuit for consideration on remand by the Bankruptcy Court. Indeed, the Second Circuit Opinion did not address in any way the availability of punitive damages against New GM premised on Old GM conduct or of any category of claims brought by Post-Closing Accident Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Second Circuit Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339735,4343079\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/135/\">\n    829 F.3d at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Order to Show Cause was more than sufficient to put Reichwaldt on notice that the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion might address the availability to Post-Closing Accident Plaintiffs of punitive damages claims against New GM premised on Old GM conduct. Accordingly, Reichwaldt is bound by that decision and may not separately raise her \"Contractual Assumption Argument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In any event, parties who were dissatisfied with the Bankruptcy Court's July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion were free to-and did-appeal all aspects of that decision, including the holding on contractual assumption grounds. Reichwaldt was not among those parties. As the Bankruptcy Court noted, \"Reichwaldt (despite having received notice of the December 2016 [Order to Show Cause] ) did not file any papers, appear at the hearing [on the Order to Show Cause] or appeal the decision. The\n   <em>\n    July 2017 Opinion\n   </em>\n   -including the ruling on punitive damages-is [thus]\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   as to Reichwaldt.\"\n   <em>\n    Reichwaldt Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268845\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/313/\">\n    576 B.R. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her reply brief on appeal, Reichwaldt argues for the first time that she\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   appeal from the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion, explaining that Goodwin Proctor LLP-which took the lead in challenging that ruling on appeal here-is representing her \"in the 2016 Threshold Issues Appeal along with other Butler Wooten &amp; Peak, LLP ... clients.\" (17-CV-8294, Docket No. 19, at 4). She attributes \"New GM's apparent confusion\" to \"statements made by [Reichwaldt's] counsel\" that \"counsel from Goodwin Proctor had not been representing Appellant in connection with the 2016 Threshold Issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is well established, however, that \"arguments not made in an appellant's opening brief are waived even if the appellant ... raised them in a reply brief.\"\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank v. Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969032,8964958\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/418/\">\n    412 F.3d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, given Reichwaldt's counsel's concessions and the steps she took to prosecute this appeal separately, the Bankruptcy Court's factual finding that Reichwaldt failed to appeal from the July 2017 Threshold Issues Opinion cannot be found clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Great Atl. &amp; Pac.

Notwithstanding the argument by certain Post-Closing Accident Plaintiffs and Non-Ignition Switch Plaintiffs to the contrary, (17-CV-6120, Docket No. 30, at 2 n.3), however, the appeal is not moot as to the failure-to-warn claim, even though the jury returned a verdict on it.
