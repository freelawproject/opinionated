Isis operated as a consulting business specializing in writing, implementing, and reselling accounting software for small to mid-sized companies in and around the Richmond, Virginia, area. The Debtors have been and remain the sole shareholders of Isis, with Mr. McCurnin owning 49 percent and Mrs. McCurnin owning 51 percent. In its first ten years, Isis experienced significant growth, with revenues of between $2.5 and $3 million per year and expansion to over 20 employees. Among other assets, Isis owned 80 to 100 computers, computer equipment, and a collection of office furniture, including desks, tables, chairs, cabinets, and cubicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tumlin joined Isis in 1999 as a computer programmer, writing accounting software programs. Several years later she was promoted to manager of development. Her duties expanded to include managing Isis's team of eight to nine software developers as well as several employees of Isis's affiliate, Izida, LLC, which was located in Bulgaria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tumlin became \"third in command as far as managing the business\" after the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning in 2008, Isis's revenues fell and never recovered. It faced increasing collection pressure and litigation from its creditors. In October of 2014, its former landlord filed a complaint against Isis and the Debtors, as guarantors, in the Circuit Court for Henrico County, Virginia, seeking over $150,000 in unpaid rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In late 2014, the Debtors and Tumlin \"devised a scheme to continue the business of Isis without its mounting debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January of 2015, the Debtors and Tumlin met to discuss the creation of a new business, to be owned by Tumlin, that would take over Isis's operations. Over the next several months, they created South Anna, identifying Tumlin as CEO and 100% owner of South Anna's stock. Isis's operations and employees were transferred to South Anna, which officially began operations on May 1, 2015, operating out of the same offices previously occupied by Isis. Tumlin made no capital contribution in exchange for her shares in South Anna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Isis ceased operations in June of 2015, and its registration with the Virginia State Corporation was subsequently terminated. In August, Isis defaulted on its loan with M &amp; T Bank, and in December, M &amp; T Bank filed a complaint against Isis and the Debtors in the Henrico County, Virginia, Circuit Court. By order dated February 26, 2016, the circuit court granted M &amp; T Bank judgment against Isis for $99,661.44, plus interest and late fees of $2,029, as well as attorneys' fees and costs (the \"Judgment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   South Anna solicited Isis's customers and arranged for most of them to enter into contracts with South Anna. One customer refused to execute a new contract, so South Anna continued to do work for that customer under the old Isis contract. With the former Isis employees, in their new roles as employees of South Anna, servicing the former Isis customers, South Anna became profitable immediately. From May through August, South Anna used Isis's property, including its computer equipment and furniture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   South Anna also used Isis's servicing credentials with Microsoft to service customers until it was able to obtain its own credentials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By October of 2015, the Debtors' personal relationship had deteriorated, and Mr. McCurnin left Isis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 14, 2015, South Anna paid Isis $25,000 for computer equipment that South Anna had been using since May of 2015. The value of the computer equipment \"far exceeds the $25,000 'paid' to Isis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 29, 2015, Mrs. McCurnin filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and one week later Mr. McCurnin filed his own petition, completing the \"final step in the scheme to continue Isis's business through South Anna [and] shed the personal guarantees [the McCurnins] had given to Isis's creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   On his schedules, Mr. McCurnin listed over $480,000 of Isis's debt that he had personally guaranteed, including $145,000 for unpaid rent, $117,000 owed to M &amp; T Bank, $50,000 owed to Microsoft, $50,000 owed to Wells Fargo Bank, and $25,000 owed to Windstream Communications. Mrs. McCurnin listed similar personal guaranty obligations in her schedules. Many of these creditors have filed proofs of claim in the Debtors' bankruptcies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. McCurnin listed his 49% interest in Isis as having a value of $147,000, from which the total value of Isis would be calculated as being close to $300,000. \"South Anna 'acquired' this full enterprise value for almost no consideration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 14, 2017, M &amp; T Bank executed an \"Unconditional and Absolute Assignment of Judgment\" (the \"Assignment\") wherein it assigned any and all interest in the Judgment to the Debtors' bankruptcy estates. The Assignment purports to assign \"all of M &amp; T's right, title, and interest in and to the Judgment, including all sums of money that may be obtained by means of or as a result of the Judgment.\" It further provides that the assignment is \"unconditional, absolute and without consideration\" and grants the bankruptcy estates the power and authority to \"acknowledge satisfaction or to discharge and release the Judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS AND POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n   .

The Judgment is against Isis only. The Complaint states that the Debtors personally guaranteed the debt to M &amp; T Bank; however, the Assignment does not address M &amp; T Bank's claim against the guarantors other than to state that the Trustees shall have \"full power and authority ... to use all lawful means for the recovery of the money due or to become due on the Judgment and to acknowledge satisfaction ....\" If the Assignment includes the right to collect on the guarantees, and it may be construed as such, then it is absolute and unconditional; if not, then the Fourth Circuit's fear of \"duplicative and inconsistent litigation\" would be realized by the creditor's (in this case, M &amp; T Bank's) efforts to collect the debt from guarantors (who possess indemnification rights against the principal) occurring simultaneously with the Trustee's attempt to collect the same debt from the principal. Furthermore, if M &amp; T Bank retained its rights in connection with the guarantees, then any funds recovered by the Trustees on the judgment must be credited to the balance owed pursuant to the Debtors' guarantees, for it is axiomatic that a creditor cannot collect twice on the same claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Notwithstanding the Trustees' assertion that M &amp; T Bank has a right to share pro rata in any recovery by the Trustees, it is difficult to see how M &amp; T Bank has any remaining right to recover on a claim that it has unconditionally and absolutely transferred to another party. Nevertheless, that issue is not before the Court at this time, and for purposes of the Motion, which requires that reasonable inferences be construed in favor of the Trustees, the Court will treat the Assignment as unconditional and inclusive of the right to collect from the guarantors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n    (a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer (including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) of an interest of the debtor in property, or any obligation (including any obligation to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    (A) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, indebted; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n    (B) (i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    (ii) (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    (II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    (III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor's ability to pay as such debts matured; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n    (IV) made such transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or incurred such obligation to or for the benefit of an insider, under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    To the extent a transfer is avoided under \u00a7 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Trustees are permitted to seek recovery of the property transferred from the initial transferee or any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Courts have determined that \"property belongs to the debtor ... if the transfer will deprive the bankruptcy estate of something which could otherwise be used to satisfy the claims of creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Arrowsmith v.
