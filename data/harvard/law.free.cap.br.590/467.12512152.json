Doyle, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Timothy Shannon, the debtor in a chapter 13 bankruptcy case, seeks the return of his car from the City of Chicago. The City impounded Shannon's car before he filed his bankruptcy petition. He filed a plan treating the City's claim as unsecured. The City filed an unsecured proof of claim and did not object to the plan, which was confirmed. After confirmation, however, the City refused to return the car. The City then filed an amended proof of claim asserting a secured claim instead of an unsecured claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Shannon filed a motion alleging that the City violated the automatic stay by refusing to return the car. The City responds, in effect, that it can ignore the terms of the confirmed plan because its possessory lien on Shannon's car passes through the bankruptcy unaffected. The City contends that two exceptions to the automatic stay apply: the exception in \u00a7 362(b)(3) for certain types of liens and the exception in \u00a7 362(b)(4) for governmental units enforcing their police power. The City therefore argues that it need not return the car and can demand payment of the full amount owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Neither argument has merit. First, the City is bound by the terms of the confirmed plan. The City is only entitled to payment as an unsecured creditor in this case. Second, the automatic stay requires the City to return the car to Shannon because neither exception to the automatic stay applies in this case. The City should have released the car as soon as Shannon requested it after the bankruptcy case was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shannon filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on February 15, 2018. The City seized Shannon's car sometime before he filed for bankruptcy. In his Schedule A/B, Shannon disclosed that he owns a 1997 Buick Park Avenue with 130,000 miles and worth $2,675. He scheduled the City as an unsecured creditor owed $1,645 for \"fines.\" He filed a proposed chapter 13 plan with his petition. The plan contained no provision for payment to the City as a secured creditor. Two weeks later, on February 27, 2018, the City filed an unsecured claim in the amount of $3,160 for \"parking tickets.\" Attached to the proof of claim was a list of what appear to be tickets issued on three different license plates over the course of many years, some from as far back as 1999. In April 2018, Shannon filed an amended plan that again did not provide for the City to be paid as a secured creditor. The City did not object to the plan. It was confirmed on May 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After confirmation, Shannon's counsel contacted the City to arrange for return of the car. The City refused to return the car\n   unless Shannon modified his plan to treat the City's claim as secured and pay it in full under the plan. On May 2, the City filed an amended proof of claim in which it increased the amount of its claim to $5,600 owed for \"parking tickets\" and asserted that the claim was \"secured\" by a motor vehicle. The basis for perfection stated in the proof of claim was: \"Vehicle Possessory Lien - 1997 Buick.\" The attachments were the same ones attached to the original claim and showed the same $3,160 amount due, but there was an additional page that said:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-15\">Impound Debt Fine $ 1,000 Tow $ 150 Storage $ 2,190 Total $ 2,440</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City filed a second amended claim on July 3, 2018. It asserted that $5,600 was owed for \"Fines for violations of the Chicago Municipal Code, and related fees\" and that it was secured by a possessory lien on the Buick. The claim said that the City has a lien on a motor vehicle as follows: \"Possessory Lien in vehicle plate no. AG61417.\" The asserted basis for perfection is \"possession.\" There were no attachments to this amended claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the City refused to return the car, Shannon filed a motion alleging that the City willfully violated the automatic stay by refusing to release the car. He relies on a decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals holding that the automatic stay requires a secured creditor with possession of a chapter 13 debtor's vehicle before the petition date to return the vehicle as soon as the petition is filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. GMAC, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2009). Shannon notes that the City relies on a decision of one bankruptcy judge in this district who concluded that the exception to the automatic stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3) applies to its possessory lien and permits the City to keep the car. Shannon argues that the City ignores three other decisions from bankruptcy judges in this district who concluded on various grounds that the automatic stay requires the City to return the cars of chapter 13 debtors in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The City responds to Shannon's motion for sanctions with a number of arguments. The City contends that the automatic stay does not apply because: (1)\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, (2) the exception to the automatic stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3) for certain types of post-petition lien perfection applies, and all bankruptcy court decisions holding otherwise are incorrect, and (3) the police power exception in \u00a7 362(b)(4) also applies. The City argues as well that the confirmed plan has no impact on it because the plan did not strip its lien, so the lien passed through the confirmation process unaltered. The City therefore asserts that it is free to hold the car despite the confirmed plan and can force Shannon to pay the full amount the City now claims it is owed - $5,600 - based on its pre-petition seizure of a nearly twenty-year old car worth $2,675.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To resolve this dispute, the court must first determine the effect of the confirmed plan on the City's rights. The court must then decide whether the automatic stay applies to stop the City from keeping possession\n   of the car to collect on the debt owed by Shannon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Binding Effect of Confirmed Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shannon argues that the City is bound by the terms of the confirmed plan that treats the City's claim as an unsecured debt. He asserts that the City itself filed an unsecured claim before confirmation and did not object to the plan even though it treated the City as an unsecured creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shannon seems to argue that the City has given up any rights it may have had as a secured creditor, and must therefore return the car and receive payment under the plan as an unsecured creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City responds that the plan does not contain provisions required to strip a lien so its lien was not eliminated through the confirmation process. The City therefore contends that the lien \"passed through\" the bankruptcy unaltered and that it is free to keep possession and demand full payment of the $5,600 amount alleged in the second amended claim. The City pays lip service to the principle that it is bound by the terms of a confirmed plan as every creditor is. But the City also asserts that its lien passed through the confirmation process unaltered, that it could amend its proof of claim post-confirmation because it did so before the government bar date, and that the automatic stay does not require the car to be returned. The City therefore contends that it is free to refuse to return the car until the debtor amends its plan to pay the entire amount of the amended claim as a secured claim. The net effect of the City's positions, if upheld, would allow the City to ignore the confirmation process and force a debtor to pay it in full after confirmation based on the City's possession of a vehicle no matter what the plan says.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The City is correct that its lien was not stripped off through confirmation of the plan. The national plan form used in this district requires a debtor who seeks to \"strip off\" a lien, pay less than the allowed amount of the secured claim, or avoid certain types of liens, to give the secured creditor notice of this intention in several ways. First, in Part 1 of the plan, the debtor must check one of the three boxes stating \"Included,\" which notifies the creditor that the debtor seeks to limit the amount paid on a secured claim or avoid a lien. Then, the debtor must expressly request the relief sought by completing paragraphs 3.2, 3.4 or 8 of the plan, in which the debtor must identify the creditor and the proposed treatment. If the debtor fails to check the appropriate \"Included\" box in Part 1, then the treatment of a secured creditor named in sections 3.2, 3.4, or 8 of the plan will not be effective. Finally, if the debtor seeks to strip down or strip off a lien (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pay less than the total amount owed because the value of the collateral is lower) in section 3.2 of the plan, he must serve the plan on the secured creditor in accordance with Rule 7004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3012(b), 3015(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Shannon did not check any box in Part 1 of the plan to give notice of an attempt to affect the lien of a secured creditor. He also failed to identify the City as a secured creditor anywhere in the plan. The City is therefore correct that confirmation of the plan did not eliminate its lien on Shannon's car. A lien that is not treated\n   in a plan generally passes through the bankruptcy case unaffected.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pajian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182193,5909770\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/1161/\">\n    785 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (7th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Penrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413464,6120530\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/459/\">\n    50 F.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (7th Cir. 1995) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345139\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/269/#p278\">\n    558 B.R. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This does not mean, however, that the City could ignore the confirmation process and force Shannon to amend the confirmed plan to pay the full amount it now seeks as a secured claim. Section 1327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the \"provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The City is bound by the terms of Shannon's confirmed plan, and that plan treats its claim as unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The City cannot change its treatment under the confirmed plan by simply filing an amended claim after confirmation that asserts a secured claim. Its claim must instead be treated as unsecured. The City could amend its claim post-petition to claim a higher amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That claim would then be paid as an unsecured claim at whatever percentage unsecured creditors will ultimately receive under the plan, unless Shannon objected to the amended claim. Shannon has objected to the City's amended claim in a separate claim objection. He challenges the basis for the secured claim, but he also challenges the amount claimed. Those issues will be addressed in a separate opinion. The bottom line here is that the City is not entitled to payment as a secured creditor in this case because it filed an unsecured claim before confirmation and then accepted its treatment as an unsecured creditor by not objecting to the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But that does not end the analysis. The City contends that despite the treatment of its claim as unsecured in the confirmed plan, it may keep Shannon's car and demand full payment of the amount owed because the automatic stay does not require it to return the car. The court must therefore determine how the stay operates in conjunction with the confirmed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Shannon's confirmed plan treats the City's claim as unsecured and\n   the City is bound by that plan, no plan provision requires the City to return his car. Only the automatic stay,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), could do so.

Expeditors refused to release the goods without payment, asserting that possession was necessary to retain its lien. The court concluded that Expeditors violated the automatic stay by exercising control over property of the estate. The court described the issue as follows: \"When the creditor's perfection of its security interest is dependent on possession of estate property, the question arises how the creditor can comply with \u00a7\u00a7 362 and 542 and still protect its perfected security interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"269263\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/210/823/\">\n    210 B.R. at 827-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The burden is then on the creditor to seek adequate protection of its lien interest. This permits the debtor to use his vehicle for the benefit of all creditors while protecting the lien interest of the lien holder.

This argument has no merit. Refusing to return Shannon's car unless he moves to amend his confirmed plan and pay the entire amount the City alleges he owes was an attempt to collect a pre-petition debt, whether the City demanded a lump sum up front or not. To the extent the City wanted adequate protection of its interest in the car, it had to file a motion with the court. Although the City is free to negotiate with a debtor to reach agreement on the adequate protection it will seek, it cannot decide on its own what constitutes adequate protection and withhold the car until a debtor gives it what it demands.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whiting Pools\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187085\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/198/\">\n    462 U.S. at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128466,6187085\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/103/2309/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895949,3648271\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/699/\">\n    566 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   705 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Sharon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11609079\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/234/676/#p685\">\n    234 B.R. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (6th Cir.

This argument has no merit. The two decisions address different issues. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   confronted head-on the application of the automatic stay to a creditor holding a chapter 13 debtor's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   held that the stay required the creditor to return the car to the debtor, and concluded that the debtor need not file an adversary proceeding seeking turnover.

In\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   , a chapter 7 trustee and the debtor's ex-spouse were battling over whether the debtor's interest in the marital home was property of the estate and therefore property the trustee could sell. The case involved state law property rights of spouses in a divorce proceeding filed before the bankruptcy case. The court held that under state law, any interest the debtor husband held in the property on the petition date was subject to the wife's interest that arose pre-petition under state law when the divorce petition was filed. The court reached the unremarkable conclusion that the bankruptcy estate included only the interests the debtor held under state law on the\n   petition date, nothing more. The court noted that the trustee warned that this conclusion would undermine bankruptcy policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415128,12275198\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/536/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415128,12275198\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/536/\">\n    at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The City contends that if it has to give Shannon's car back, it will lose a property right it had when the petition was filed, and Shannon will have gained one: possession. This argument confuses lien rights with ownership rights. A lien is defined in the Bankruptcy Code as a \"charge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (37).

As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Whiting Pools\n   </em>\n   squarely rejected the City's contention that a secured creditor cannot be forced to give up possession of an asset the debtor still owns on the petition date.\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   in no way conflicts with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   that the automatic stay requires a secured creditor to return a chapter 13 debtor's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 362(b)(3) - Exception to Automatic Stay for Perfection of Certain Liens\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Next, the City argues that\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   does not require return of Shannon's car because the exception in \u00a7 362(b)(3) applies in this case. Section 362(b)(3) creates an exception to the automatic stay for \"any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property to the extent that the trustee's rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section 546(b) of this title ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Section 546(b) limits a trustee's avoidance powers when a generally applicable law allows secured creditors to perfect or maintain perfection of liens against an earlier lien holder. Section 546(b)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The rights and powers of a trustee under section 544, 545 and 549 of this title are subject to any generally applicable law that -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (A) permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (B) provides for the maintenance or continuation of perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such\n   property before the date on which action is taken to effect such maintenance or continuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   These provisions work together to permit a creditor to protect its lien from the avoiding powers of a trustee in limited circumstances after a bankruptcy is filed. They apply only if non-bankruptcy law would permit the later perfection or act to continue perfection to relate back to an earlier date before perfection, making the lien effective against parties who acquired an interest in the property before the lien was perfected (i.e., a chapter 7 trustee asserting avoiding powers of a hypothetical judgment creditor under \u00a7 544(b)(1), as discussed below). The classic example is a creditor with a security interest in goods under the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") that could be perfected by filing a financing statement during a specified period after the lien was created. If the financing statement is filed in that time, perfection relates back to the date the lien was created.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grede Foundries, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754161,4183943\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/786/\">\n    651 F.3d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (7th Cir. 2011). The retroactive effect gives the creditor priority over other creditors who acquired an interest in the goods after the lien was created but before it was perfected. The exception to the stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3) permits the creditor to file the financing statement post-petition to stop a trustee from avoiding what would otherwise be an unperfected lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The City argues that this exception applies to its rights under the Chicago municipal ordinances governing the impoundment of vehicles. The City raises over $260 million per year from parking and red light ticket violations, a significant portion of its budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the City acknowledges, a number of years ago, debtors whose cars were seized and who were unable to pay the fines began to file chapter 13 bankruptcy cases. These debtors sought the release of their cars and to pay the fines over time through their chapter 13 plans. The City's initial practice was to release the cars under\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   . City Response to Amicus Brief at 1. Then, in November 2016, the City adopted an ordinance giving itself what it calls a \"possessory lien.\" The ordinance provides that any vehicle impounded by the City is subject to a possessory lien in favor of the City in the amount required to obtain release of the vehicle. Chi. Mun. Code \u00a7 9-92-080(f). The City then began refusing to return cars to chapter 13 debtors, arguing that it had a possessory lien that qualified for the exception to the stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The City never specifically articulates why \u00a7 362(b)(3) applies in this case. It cites two decisions that agree with its position on this issue:\n   <em>\n    In re Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272794\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/558/\">\n    566 B.R. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

May 4, 2018). It then generally argues that \u00a7 362(b)(3) allows a creditor with a pre-petition lien to take any act to maintain perfection of that pre-petition lien without violating the stay. It states that \"continued possession continues the perfection of that interest and thus is not a violation of the automatic say under \u00a7 362(b)(3).\" City Resp. at 4. The City never parses the specific language of \u00a7 362(b)(3), \u00a7 546(b) on which it depends, or \u00a7 544 to which \u00a7 546(b) refers, nor does\n   it explain how any specific provisions of the ordinance bring the City's actions within this exception to the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based on the citations of\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , the court assumes the City contends that its ordinance allows its lien to prime the lien of prior lienholders, at least with respect to towing and storage costs (but not the actual fines and penalties owed by the vehicle owner).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272794\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/558/\">\n    566 B.R. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the City's ordinance does not say anything about the continuation or maintenance of perfection. Second, the trustee could not avoid the City's lien interest under any circumstances so the section does not apply. The City does not keep debtors' cars so it can defend its liens against an attack by a trustee or anyone else. It keeps the cars to pressure debtors to pay the full outstanding debt despite the filing of a chapter 13 case, as it did in this case. That is exactly what\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   prohibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    City's Ordinances Do Not Fall Within \u00a7 546(b)(1)(B)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As noted above, the City adopted an ordinance in November 2016 creating a possessory lien for itself when it seized a vehicle for failure to pay traffic related fines and other charges.

First, under non-bankruptcy law a creditor with a possessory lien who gives up possession of property involuntarily does not lose its possessory lien.

Ohio 1982). If the City complied with\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   by returning the car, it would involuntarily give up possession under the equivalent of a court-ordered injunction so its lien would be preserved under nonbankruptcy law. A trustee would have no basis to \"avoid\" the lien under \u00a7 544 based on the involuntary, post-petition loss of possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The important point here is that the City's ordinance is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   what would prevent a trustee from avoiding its possessory lien. It is the law of possessory liens that would stop the trustee and preserve the City's lien despite the involuntary loss of possession. At bottom, the City's ordinance is irrelevant. Because the avoiding powers of a trustee are not limited by - or \"subject to\" - the City's ordinance regarding maintaining or continuing perfection, the City cannot rely on \u00a7 362(b)(3) to justify its refusal to do what all other creditors with possession of a chapter 13 debtor's car must do: return it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 546(b) Does Not Affect the Right to Possession\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The key concept here is that \u00a7 546(b) does not create or preserve a creditor's right to possession at all; it only sets limits on the trustee's avoidance powers. This is made clear in \u00a7 546(b)(2). It addresses nonbankruptcy laws that require seizure to perfect a lien or to maintain or continue perfection of a lien when the lien was not perfected pre-petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   When nonbankruptcy law requires \"seizure\" for a lien to be perfected (or for perfection to be maintained post-petition), but the property has not been seized pre-petition, the interest \"shall\" be perfected, or the perfection \"shall\" be continued, by issuing a notice, not by seizing the property. The notice is then sufficient to defeat any claim by a trustee asserting the rights of a judgment creditor that arose when the petition was filed. Section 362(b)(3), in turn, allows the notice to be issued without violating the automatic stay. That section operates, in effect, as a modification of \u00a7 546(b)(1)(A), which might otherwise allow a creditor to perfect a lien by seizing the debtor's property post-petition if it allowed the creditor to prime previous lien holders. It prevents the creditor from taking possession post-petition and allows the written notice to take the place of possession for purposes of any trustee avoidance action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This provision illustrates the central purpose of \u00a7 546(b) : to protect lien rights against avoidance by a trustee, not to protect rights to possession. Had Congress intended to allow creditors with possessory liens to keep possession of the collateral despite the automatic stay, it would have said so. Instead, in \u00a7\u00a7 546(b) and 362(b)(3), Congress sought only to prevent a trustee from avoiding the lien of a creditor when only the intervening bankruptcy stopped the creditor from perfecting or continuing perfection of its lien. Congress wanted to prevent creditors from losing all lien rights because of an intervening bankruptcy, not from losing their right to possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The legislative history of \u00a7 546(b) makes this abundantly clear. \"The Trustee's rights and powers under certain of the avoiding powers are limited by section 546... if an interest holder against whom the trustee would have rights still has, under applicable nonbankruptcy law, and as of the date of the petition, the opportunity to perfect his lien against an intervening interest holder, then he may perfect his interest against the trustee.\" S. Rep. 95-989, 86, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5872. There is no mention in the legislative history of \u00a7 546(b)(1)(B) of any intent to permit possessory lienholders to keep possession of collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Section 362(b)(3) Limited to Acts Necessary to Defeat Trustee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The City argues that the exception to the stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3) applies even if the City would retain its lien when it loses possession involuntarily. The City says that Congress took the question of whether the lien holder would have a common law defense to losing its lien \"off the table by simply providing that a lienholder may take any act that it is allowed to take under nonbankruptcy law to continue perfection of its prepetition lien.\" City Resp. to\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   Brief at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In fact, the opposite is true. As discussed above, Congress expressly tied any action excepted from the stay to defeating the trustee's avoiding powers. Section 546(b)(1)(B) declares that \"the rights and powers of a trustee under sections 544... are subject to\" nonbankruptcy laws allowing maintenance or continuation of perfection to relate back.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). Section 362(b)(3) then excepts from the stay any act to maintain or continue perfection but only \"\n   <em>\n    to the extent\n   </em>\n   that the trustee's rights and powers are\n   subject to such perfection under section 546(b)....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (emphasis added). The City's interpretation - that it can rely on the exception to the stay because its ordinance primes previous liens regardless of whether the ordinance creates a defense to an avoidance action - writes out of both \u00a7 362(b)(3) and \u00a7 546(b) all those words tying the acts permitted to limits on the trustee's avoiding powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In a similar vein, the City argues that the doctrine that a lien holder does not give up its lien if it loses possession involuntarily cannot be invoked by debtors because it is intended as a shield for creditors, not a sword for debtors. But it is precisely because this doctrine is a shield, in fact a complete defense, to any avoidance action that the exception to the stay does not apply. This doctrine, not the City's ordinances, is what protects the City from a trustee's avoidance action based on a loss of post-petition possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    City's Lien Preserved against Later Acquired Interests\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The City next contends that even though an involuntary surrender does not eliminate a possessory lien, the surviving lien is not effective against an intervening third party who acquires an interest in the property without notice of the lien. For this proposition the City cites only a section of Corpus Juris Secundum on \"Animals\" and a 1939 New Mexico case involving a lien on livestock. In that case, the lienholder allowed livestock to be taken from his possession \"over his objection\" but failed to do anything to protect his lien until five months later, by which time an innocent third party had purchased the property.\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568272\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/43/350/\">\n    43 N.M. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1568272\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/43/350/\">\n    93 P.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1939). The case is no help to the City. The New Mexico Supreme Court later recognized that when a possessory lien holder loses possession by force or fraud, \"the possessory lien is not extinguished even though actual possession was lost.\"\n   <em>\n    Air Ruidoso, Ltd., Inc. v. Executive Aviation Cntr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"322259\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/122/71/\">\n    122 N.M. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"322259\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/122/71/\">\n    920 P.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Here, the City would give up possession involuntarily in the context of a very public bankruptcy case. No party who acquired an interest in a debtor's car after the City surrendered it could be an \"innocent\" third party without notice of the City's lien. First, no interest in the car could be acquired while the bankruptcy case is pending. The automatic stay prohibits any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against property of the estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Any attempt to create such an interest would be void.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Magallanez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081812\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/403/558/#p561\">\n    403 B.R. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561 (Bankr.

D. Minn. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, the City's lien would be expressly preserved in the public record of the bankruptcy case, which would eliminate any potential claim to \"innocent\" status. The Bankruptcy Code requires a chapter 13 plan to preserve the lien of a secured creditor both during the pendency of the bankruptcy case and after bankruptcy if the case is converted to another chapter or dismissed without completion of the plan. Section 1325(a) governs the rights of all secured creditors in chapter 13. A plan cannot be confirmed under \u00a7 1325(a) unless one of the following conditions is met with respect to all secured claims: (1) the secured creditor consents, (2) the debtor surrenders the collateral, or (3) the plan contains certain required provisions to pay and protect the lien holder. Section 1325(a)(5)(B) requires the plan to provide that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (a) the holder of the claim\n   <em>\n    retains its lien\n   </em>\n   until the earlier of full payment of the underlying debt as determined by non-bankruptcy law or discharge, and\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    if the case is dismissed or converted\n   </em>\n   without completion of the plan,\n   <em>\n    such lien shall also be retained by such holder\n   </em>\n   to the extent recognized by applicable non-bankruptcy law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(B)(i)(I), (II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Thus, the plan\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   provide that the City's lien is preserved if the case is dismissed before the plan is completed unless the secured creditor consents to other treatment. This required provision would give notice to the world of the continued existence of the City's lien if the bankruptcy case is dismissed before the debtor completes all payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice would eliminate any possibility that a party who later acquired rights in the vehicle could claim to be an innocent third party without notice of the City's lien. In fact, it would be much easier for a third party to get notice of the City's lien through a bankruptcy case than if the City had possession, which could not be determined from a public records search or any other generally available means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The City may also give immediate notice of its preserved lien rights as soon as it learns of a bankruptcy case by filing a motion for adequate protection of its lien under \u00a7 363(e). It can assert its lien rights in the motion itself, which is a public record, and seek a court order confirming the preservation of its lien after the vehicle is returned to the debtor. This notice would eliminate any possibility of an innocent intervening creditor if a case is dismissed before a plan containing the language preserving the lien is filed. Thus, even if the City were correct that the involuntary loss of possession would not protect its lien as against intervening third parties without notice, the Bankruptcy Code provides various means that eliminate that possibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Possessory Liens Treated the Same as All Other Liens in Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The City also argues that if it gives up possession of a debtor's car, the lien is no longer possessory and therefore is an inadequate replacement for what it held pre-petition. It contends that its possessory lien would be replaced with an \"equitable judicial lien.\" The City cites no authority for its contention that it would hold an \"equitable judicial lien,\" nor does it describe the attributes of such a lien. The argument seems to assume that a possessory lien is materially different from other types of liens, and that the City cannot be deprived of that possessory right in bankruptcy. But\n   <em>\n    Whiting Pools\n   </em>\n   squarely rejected the argument that nothing can substitute for possession:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   In effect, \u00a7 542 grants to the estate a possessory interest in certain property of the debtor that was not held by the debtor at the commencement of the proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code provides secured creditors various rights, including the right to adequate protection, and these rights replace the protection afforded by possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Whiting Pools\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187085\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/198/\">\n    462 U.S. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128466,6187085\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/103/2309/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2309\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Through this argument and all of its other arguments in this case, the City is really contending that possessory lien holders get better treatment in bankruptcy than other lien holders.

In each of these decisions, the court determined that a state law permitted the creditor to come ahead of previous lien holders and that it needed to maintain possession to keep its lien. None of these decisions analyzed the language in \u00a7 546(b) and \u00a7 362(b)(3) regarding limits on the trustee's avoiding powers. Nor did they address the principle that the lien is preserved when possession is lost involuntarily, or that the Bankruptcy Code provides for the preservation of the liens after dismissal of a case without completion of the plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    No Trustee Avoidance Action In Any Event\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, the court notes that, as a technical matter, even if there were no law protecting the City from the loss of a lien (whether surrender was voluntary or involuntary), a trustee would have no avoidance action under \u00a7 544. The possessory lien would simply evaporate, and any subsequent lien holders would move up in their priority. There would be no lien to \"avoid\" under \u00a7 544. This is in contrast to a creditor who had a lien created by contract pre-petition but failed to perfect it post-petition under a nonbankruptcy law allowing the date of perfection to relate back to the date the lien was created. In that situation, the creditor would have a lien that continued to exist and the trustee could avoid under \u00a7 544 because the lien was never perfected. With a possessory lien, there would be no such remaining lien to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Thus, a trustee could not use any avoiding powers under \u00a7 544 to avoid the City's possessory lien. Since there are no avoiding powers of the trustee under \u00a7 544 that would be limited by - or \"subject to\" - the City's ordinances, the exception to the automatic stay in \u00a7 362(b)(3) does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Section 362(b)(3) is a complicated provision that invokes \u00a7 546(b), which in turn invokes \u00a7 544. The City ignores these complications and simply asserts that because its ordinance lets it prime a lien of a previous lienholder for storage and towing costs, its lien falls within this very limited exception to the automatic stay. But the City cannot shoehorn itself into any provision of \u00a7 546(b) to qualify for \u00a7 362(b)(3), an exception intended only to let parties preserve their lien rights in bankruptcy, not to retain possession of the debtor's property. As\n   <em>\n    Peake\n   </em>\n   noted, courts must construe the automatic stay broadly to achieve the goals of reorganization, and must strictly construe exceptions to the stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512047\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/811/#p833\">\n    588 B.R. at 829-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203946169\">\n    2018 WL 3946169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Grede Foundries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754161,4183943\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/786/\">\n    651 F.3d at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no other purpose to the seizure of the vehicle, which the ordinance ties directly and solely to the payment of money. Vehicles are released only upon the payment of all the money owed. It makes no difference what types of violations have been assessed against the vehicle owner. The ordinances do not distinguish between violations in which a driver has done something unsafe and violations of laws that are strictly money-raisers, like failing to pay for parking. In fact, even when a driver has done something unsafe, impounding the car does not prevent him from driving any car, it just prevents him from driving the impounded car. The City has other remedies for taking unsafe drivers off the road. This ordinance does not do that. It is intended to collect money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The City's own words reveal this intent. In a 2017 amendment to the Chicago Municipal Code that created a possessory lien in immobilized (booted) vehicles, the City described the 2016 ordinance creating the possessory lien in impounded vehicles this way: \"WHEREAS, in response to a growing practice of individuals attempting to escape financial liability for their immobilized or impounded vehicles, in November of 2016, the [City Council] amended the Municipal Code ... to clarify that the city has a possessory lien on those vehicles.\" Ordinance, transmitted to the City Council of Chicago by the Committee on Budget and Government Operations on June 28, 2017 and approved by the Corporation Counsel and Mayor Emanuel on July 7, 2017, Exhibit A to debtor's reply brief in\n   <em>\n    In re George Peake\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Barb.%2016544\">\n    18 B 16544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , dkt. no. 23. Thus, the City acknowledged that the 2016 ordinance creating a possessory lien was enacted to stop individuals\n   <em>\n    attempting to escape financial liability.\n   </em>\n   The 2017 ordinance was then expressly enacted to eliminate a \"loophole\" for booted cars because the 2016 ordinance had the \"unintended consequence that the owners of vehicles that are immobilized in place [also known as \"booted\"] but not impounded, continue to avail themselves of a loophole and thereby\n   <em>\n    avoid paying monies due to the City\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Barb.%2016544\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). By the City's own admission, the collection of fines and the impoundment process is all about money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The City's conduct in this case reflects this purpose of collecting money. The City first filed an unsecured claim seeking payment of $3,160 for \"parking tickets,\" based on a list of tickets issued to three license plates over 19 years. When Shannon demanded his car back after confirmation, the City refused because it claimed Shannon owed it money, not because of any public safety issues. The City would not release the car unless Shannon amended the plan to pay the $5,600 amount asserted in the City's May 2 amended claim for\n   \"parking tickets.\" It was not until Shannon filed his motion seeking sanctions that the City raised the police power exception. It argued that it uses impoundment as part of its scheme of \"general deterrence\" to ensure compliance with traffic laws. Only later in the City's response to an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief did it contend that Shannon's violations constitute matters related to public safety, include three speeding violations and driving on a suspended license. These allegations do not change the City's stated purpose and that impoundment is a collection mechanism for the City. The impoundment program raises hundreds of millions of dollar for the City, enough that the City Council was motivated to take action to stop debtors in bankruptcy from obtaining their cars back without paying the City in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The cases cited by the City to support its assertion that Chicago's vehicle-related laws, which generate the massive amount of fines the City collects, are about safety and welfare, not money, are not on point or persuasive. Two of the cases,\n   <em>\n    Valle v. Montgomery Co.

N.D. Ill. 1987). Its analysis is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As the City says in many ways in its briefs on this motion, it wants to keep Shannon's car to ensure that he pays the money.

Its claim will be paid as unsecured in an amount to be determined in connection with Shannon's claim objection. The automatic stay requires the City to return Shannon's car immediately. The City is free to file a motion seeking adequate protection of its lien interest. A separate order requiring the City to immediately return Shannon's car to him will be issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Shannon also filed an objection to the City's claim. He argues that the ordinance granting the City a possessory lien on seized cars is invalid based on\n    <em>\n     In re Howard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511693\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/584/252/\">\n     584 B.R. 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2018), and that the City failed to provide an itemization to support the amount Shannon allegedly owes. That objection will be addressed in a separate opinion. It is worth noting here, however, that any secured claim of the City is necessarily limited to the value of the collateral under \u00a7 506(a), in this case presumably $2,675.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The plan does not directly address the City's claim; the City is not listed in any provision of the plan. The effect of this omission is that the City's claim is treated as unsecured. Part 3 of the national plan form (Official Form 113) used in this district requires debtors to specify all secured creditors to be paid under the plan. If a creditor is not specifically listed in one of those paragraphs, it will be paid only as an unsecured creditor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure set deadlines for filing proofs of claim but not for amending them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
