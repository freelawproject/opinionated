Katz, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   On January 31, 2018, Taylor A. Bartlett (the \"Debtor\") commenced this case by filing a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\" or the \"Code\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jack E. Houghton, Jr. was appointed the Chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\") and, in April 2018, was granted leave to employ himself as counsel to the Trustee. In June 2018, the Debtor filed a motion to convert the case to one under Chapter 13. The Court granted the motion over the Trustee's opposition and the case was converted to one under Chapter 13 on July 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Presently before the Court is the \"Former Chapter 7 Trustee's and Counsel to the Trustee's Motion for Administrative Expense,\" through which the Trustee seeks fees for his pre-conversion efforts in investigating potential non-exempt assets that could be available for distribution to creditors. Although no moneys were collected or disbursed while the case was in Chapter 7, the Trustee seeks compensation, based on his hourly rate, in the amount of $7,210.00 for Trustee work, $4,480.00 for work performed as counsel to the Trustee, and $69.44 in expenses - a total of $11,759.44 - to be paid as an administrative expense in the Debtor's Chapter 13 case. The Debtor does not dispute the reasonableness of the number of hours expended by the Trustee or the hourly rate charged and does not object to the fees requested for work performed as counsel to the Trustee. But the Debtor does object to the allowance of the Trustee's fee arguing that such fees are not compensable because the Trustee did not disburse or turn over any funds to creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Section 330(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the court to award to a trustee \"reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered\" and \"reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), (B). Reasonable compensation, in turn, is to be determined by reference to the factors set forth in \u00a7 330(a)(3). Here, the reasonableness of the Trustee's requested compensation has not been disputed. However, the Debtor argues, despite the reasonableness of the compensation requested, the Court cannot, consistent with \u00a7 326(a), allow any fee to the Trustee for his work performed as Chapter 7 trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In addition to the reasonableness requirement for allowance of fees under \u00a7 330(a), a Chapter 7 trustee's fees are further limited by \u00a7 326(a), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   In a case under chapter 7 or 11, the court may allow reasonable compensation under section 330... for the trustee's services ... not to exceed 25 percent on the first $5,000 or less, 10 percent on any amount in excess of $5,000 but not in excess of $50,000, 5 percent on any amount in excess of $50,000 but not in excess of $1,000,000, and reasonable compensation not to exceed 3 percent of such moneys in excess of $1,000,000,\n   <em>\n    upon all moneys disbursed or turned over in the case by the trustee\n   </em>\n   to parties in interest, excluding the debtor, but including holders of secured claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis supplied). This limitation on a Chapter 7 trustee's fee has created a split among bankruptcy courts tasked with determining whether a Chapter 7 trustee is entitled to reasonable compensation for pre-conversion work performed in a case converted from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A majority of bankruptcy courts to address the issue have concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a literal reading of \u00a7 326(a) should apply only in fully administered cases and that in cases which were not fully administered, through no fault of the trustee, compensation should be awarded to the trustee on a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   basis when the trustee performed substantial services but did not disburse any moneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Parameswaran,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6107597\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/64/341/#p343\">\n    64 B.R. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1986).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In general, courts adopting the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   theory reason that allowing compensation discourages debtors from concealing assets, encourages trustees to diligently investigate and pursue possible assets for distribution, prevents unfair treatment of Chapter 7 trustees, and minimizes oppositions to conversions from Chapter 7 to 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   More recent written opinions, however, appear to signal a shift away from the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   position, with many courts denying Chapter 7 trustee fees in converted cases where the trustee did not disburse any funds pre-conversion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on a plain language analysis of \u00a7 326, those courts have concluded that \u00a7 326(a)\"fixes the maximum award a court may give a trustee according to a sliding scale ... relate[d] solely to \"moneys disbursed or turned over.' \"\n   <em>\n    Giger,\n   </em>\n   504 B.R. at 288 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Thus, \"however laudable or desirable it might be on fairness and good bankruptcy policy grounds to award compensation\" to a Chapter 7 trustee for work performed prior to conversion, those courts conclude that \"to do so would be inconsistent with the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\"\n   <em>\n    Evans,\n   </em>\n   344 B.R. at 454.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court agrees that \"[q]uantum meruit alone 'cannot supply a basis to award fees where the Bankruptcy Code does not otherwise permit them.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Scott,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20566441\">\n    2006 WL 566441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 n.1 (Bankr.

But the Court does not read the plain language of \u00a7 326(a) as precluding Chapter 7 trustee fees in converted cases where the trustee has not disbursed any funds. Section 326(a) is explicitly reserved for limiting trustee compensation\n   <em>\n    \"[i]n a case under chapter 7 or 11.\"\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis supplied).
