(ECF No. 13 at 2). In return, the Dales expected to receive a first priority lien on the mortgaged home; however, after Ms. Dahlin filed for bankruptcy, the Dales became ensnared in a priority dispute with Ronald J. Sommers, the Chapter 7 Trustee. (ECF No. 13 at 6). The Dales and the Trustee filed cross motions for summary judgment. These parties each claim a superior right to the insurance proceeds that Ms. Dahlin received after a fire destroyed the home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 13, 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trustee's motion for summary judgment is granted. The Dales' motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties do not dispute the material facts in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 6-9; ECF No. 14 at 2-4). This adversary proceeding is rooted in the 2012 divorce of Mark and Kathryn Dahlin. (ECF No. 13 at 6). Prior to the divorce, the Dahlins executed a Note and Deed of Trust in favor of Wells Fargo that secured the purchase of a home located at 20506 Riverside Pines in Humble, Texas. (ECF No. 14 at 2). After the divorce was finalized, Ms. Dahlin assumed sole ownership of the home and sole responsibility for making payments. Mr. Dahlin remained liable on the Note and Deed of Trust. Under the divorce decree, if Ms. Dahlin defaulted on her payment obligations, Mr. Dahlin could make any missed payment and foreclose on the home. (ECF No. 14 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This arrangement escalated tensions between the Dahlins, which culminated in Mr. Dahlin initiating the foreclosure process on the home. (ECF No. 14 at 3). Ms. Dahlin believed that she could prevent the foreclosure by paying off Wells Fargo's interest in the home, eliminating Mr. Dahlin's ability to foreclose. (ECF No. 14 at 3). To effectuate this plan, Ms. Dahlin reached out to the Dales who agreed to loan Ms. Dahlin the money needed to pay off Wells Fargo's Note in exchange for a first priority lien on the home. (ECF No. 14 at 3). Ms. Dahlin and the Dales memorialized this agreement on November 8, 2016, in a written Contract of Understanding, after which the Dales wired $188,000.00 directly to Wells Fargo to pay off the remaining balance on the Note. (ECF No. 13 at 7; ECF No. 14 at 3). However, Ms. Dahlin failed to contemporaneously execute a promissory note and deed of trust securing the Dales' interest in the home. (ECF No. 14 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 2, 2016, Wells Fargo recorded its Release of Lien in the Harris\n   County Real Property Records Office. (ECF No. 13 at 7). After wiring Wells Fargo $188,000.00, the Dales claim that they continued pressuring Ms. Dahlin to provide them with the necessary documents to secure their interest in the home. Their entreaties were ignored. (ECF No. 14 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 3, 2016, the home was destroyed by fire. (ECF No. 14 at 4). Ms. Dahlin filed an insurance claim for both the home and her lost belongings pursuant to her homeowner's insurance policy. (ECF No. 14 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Dahlin finally acceded to the Dales' demands, meeting with attorney Liza Greene on December 5, 2017, to create a Promissory Note and Deed of Trust securing the Dales' first priority lien on the home. (ECF No. 13 at 7-8). However, unbeknownst to the Dales, Ms. Dahlin also finalized the filing of her chapter 13 bankruptcy while visiting Greene. (ECF No. 13 at 7). Greene filed Ms. Dahlin's bankruptcy petition on December 5, 2016, at 4:44 p.m., before the Note and Deed of Trust were delivered to the Dales. (ECF No. 13 at 7). The Dales recorded the documents securing their lien on the home in the Harris County Real Property Records Office on December 6, 2016, one day after Ms. Dahlin filed for bankruptcy. (ECF No. 13 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Dahlin received $333,687.95 in insurance proceeds for the fire damage. (ECF No. 13 at 9). Ms. Dahlin declared this amount in her bankruptcy schedules and claimed $332,281.00 as exempt under Texas Law, a portion of which includes her homestead exemption. (ECF No. 14 at 4). Pursuant to the Court's Order, the insurance funds were deposited in the Court's registry on January 25, 2017. (ECF No. 13 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both the Dales and the Trustee claim a superior right to the insurance funds from the home fire. The Trustee claims that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) allows him to avoid the Dales' unperfected security interest in the property, which is then preserved for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 550(a)(1). (ECF No. 13 at 10-16). The Dales claim that they have both (i) a constructive trust in the funds; and (ii) a right to equitable subrogation to the lien on the property, which the Trustee cannot avoid. Because Ms. Dahlin claimed the property as her exempt homestead, the Dales allege that the proceeds of the property cannot belong to the estate.

Because that right-as of the petition date-was merely an unsecured claim under \u00a7 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Dales have no property interest in the insurance proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court then examines the question of whether the Trustee may avoid two separate, but related, liens the Dales held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the Dales held an unrecorded lien on the petition date that was represented by the lien granted in the Contract of Understanding. Because that lien was unrecorded, it is avoidable under \u00a7 544 of the Bankruptcy Code. Second, the Dales held a lien that was recorded after the petition date. That lien, voluntarily executed by Ms. Dahlin, is avoidable under \u00a7 549 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the Court addresses whether the Dales have a constructive trust in the insurance proceeds. Even if the Dales were entitled to the remedy of a constructive trust, the Trustee's status as a bona fide purchaser means his interest in the home is not subject to this alleged constructive trust under Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Equitable Subrogation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties dispute the effect equitable subrogation has on the trustee's right to avoid the lien.

(ECF No. 14 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response, the Trustee argues that the Dales abandoned their equitable subrogation argument and should be judicially estopped from bringing such a claim. (ECF No. 16 at 11-17). However, the Trustee misreads the Dales' argument, which states: \"When the Dales paid off the Wells Fargo Note, they became equitably subrogated to the rights of Wells Fargo ... the Dales' remedy was contingent upon a successful lawsuit ... there was no lien to avoid as of the petition date.\" (ECF No. 14 at 6).

There is no question that Ms. Dahlin owed a debt to Wells Fargo and that the Dales paid off that debt when they sent $188,000.00 to Wells Fargo on November 9, 2016. (ECF No. 14 at 3). Once Wells Fargo recorded its Release of Lien, it was no longer entitled to enforce its lien rights and Ms. Dahlin would receive a windfall unless the Dales' rights to the home and its proceeds were enforced.

The Trustee claims that the Dales were holders of an unsecured lien on the property on the day of the bankruptcy filing. (ECF No. 13 at 11). The Dales argue that equitable subrogation is a right \"contingent upon a successful lawsuit\" rather than a lien, and that \"there was no\n   <em>\n    lien\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   as of the petition date.\" (ECF No. 14 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As discussed earlier, equitable subrogation is a legal fiction that \"allows a party ... to step into the shoes of and pursue the claims belonging to a party with standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Frymire Eng'g,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8165809\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/259/140/#p142\">\n    259 S.W.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wells Fargo held the first lien over the property and the Contract of Understanding gave the Dales the right to \"hold first lien on the above property\" in exchange for paying off Wells Fargo's interest. (ECF No. 14-4 at 1). Based on the Contract of Understanding between Ms. Dahlin and the Dales, it appears that the Dales received a lien in exchange for paying off Wells Fargo's interest in the property. However, the Dales suggest that case law requires a payor to adjudicate their right before equitable subrogation results in a lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Dales do not have any greater right to the property in bankruptcy than they had before Ms. Dahlin filed her bankruptcy petition. The Dales filed a proof of claim in Ms. Dahlin's bankruptcy case, asserting the secured right to payment for $197,806.90. Regardless of whether the Court adopts the Trustee's view or the Dales' view, they both fall within definition of a \"Claim\" under the Bankruptcy Code:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A). (Case No. 16-36169 Proof of Claim No. 11-1 at 2). Whether the Dales have a lien that gives them a right to payment, or a right to an equitable remedy in the form of equitable subrogation, the plain language of the Bankruptcy\n   Code treats both rights as a \"claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court makes no finding regarding whether the Dales have a lien or an inchoate right to a lien that must first be recognized by a court.

Since the Dales failed to record the Deed of Trust and Promissory Note until approximately one day after Ms. Dahlin filed her bankruptcy petition, the Trustee seeks to avoid their interest in the property.

Section 544(a) states: \"The Trustee may ... avoid any transfer of property\n   <em>\n    or any obligation\n   </em>\n   incurred by the debtor ....\" (emphasis added). The entire basis of the Dales' argument ignores the second half of \u00a7 544(a) because the Trustee's strong arm power applies equally to obligations incurred by a debtor as it does to transfers made by a debtor.\n   <em>\n    Goodrich Petroleum Corp. v.

The parties agree that on November 9, 2016, Ms. Dahlin entered into a Contract of Understanding with the Dales under which they would pay off her debt to Wells Fargo in exchange for a first lien on the property. (ECF No. 14 at 3). Entering into this contract is unequivocally an obligation Ms. Dahlin incurred in favor of the Dales; accordingly, \u00a7 544 may be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, while \u00a7 544(a)(3) gives the Trustee the status of a bona fide purchaser of real property, state law dictates whether that status applies to the transaction in question.\n   <em>\n    In re Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910698\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/292/#p298\">\n    125 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (5th Cir. 1997).

This satisfies the requirements that a transfer occurred after the commencement of the case. It is undisputed that the Court did not authorize the transfer. Finally, as discussed below, upon the filing of the case, the home and ensuing insurance proceeds became property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

The plain language of the Bankruptcy Code contradicts the Dales' view of how exempt property moves through bankruptcy. Section 541(a) creates a bankruptcy estate consisting of \"all legal and equitable interests.\" Once Ms. Dahlin filed her bankruptcy petition, the property became part of her bankruptcy estate. Only after the property was incorporated into the estate could Ms. Dahlin designate it as exempt. The statute does not provide any different order for this process.

The parties' motions for summary judgment consider one issue-the extent of the Dales' interest in the property compared with the Trustee, not Ms. Dahlin's ultimate distribution.

(ECF no. 27 at 2-3). This argument is best construed as purporting that Ms. Dahlin serves as the constructive trustee while the Dales are the constructive beneficiary. (ECF No. 27 at 2). According to the Dales, when viewed as a constructive trust, Ms. Dahlin never held actual title to the property. Thus, the property and insurance proceeds could never have entered the bankruptcy estate.
