The Chapter 7 Trustee objects to Debtor's homestead exemption in the amount of $25,000.00. Debtor filed a reply on March 1, 2018 [Doc. 19]. Because there are no issues of fact and the question is solely a matter of law, the parties submitted the question on Stipulations, a Joint Statement of Issues, and briefs. [Docs. 26, 27, 29, 30.] The Chapter 13 Trustee sought permission to file an\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief because the issue before the Court will affect debtors and creditors in Chapter 13 as well as Chapter 7 cases, and the Court granted permission for the\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief. [Docs. 28, 31.] The Chapter 13 Trustee filed her\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief on August 7, 2018 [Doc. 39], making this matter ripe for the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (O). This memorandum constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Fed. R. Bankr. 7052, 9014(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND THE PARTIES' POSITIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee and Debtor stipulated the following facts. [Doc. 26.] Debtor filed the Voluntary Petition commencing this Chapter 7 case on December 27, 2017. In his Schedule B, Debtor listed an ownership interest in real property located at 1044 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee (the \"Property\"), which he valued at $145,000.00. Debtor and Pamela A. Goforth, who are unrelated by blood or marriage, own the Property \"as tenants in common for life, with the remainder to the survivor in fee,\" as evidenced by the Warranty Deed executed on March 15, 2016, and recorded the next day with the Knox County Register of Deeds. [Doc. 26-1.] As reflected in his Schedule C, Debtor has claimed an exemption in the Property in the amount of $25,000.00, specifying Tennessee Code Annotated section 26-2-301 as the statutory basis. The Chapter 7 Trustee objects to the exemption, arguing that a homestead exemption is unavailable when the ownership interest of an individual debtor in property includes a right of survivorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee and Debtor jointly defined the issues as: (1) whether\n   Debtor's survivorship interest in the Property was severed by the filing of Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and (2) whether Debtor is entitled to claim an exemption in any amount under Tennessee Code Annotated section 26-2-301 in property that he owns jointly as tenants in common for life with remainder to the survivor in fee. In support of her objection, the Chapter 7 Trustee primarily argues that when an individual debtor who holds an interest in property that includes a right of survivorship files for bankruptcy, only the survivorship interest becomes property of the bankruptcy estate. Conversely, Debtor argues that a survivorship interest in property that is not held as a tenancy by the entirety can be attached and executed on by creditors such that the Tennessee exemption applies to allow Debtor to exempt his tenancy property interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B), which authorizes an exemption \"to the [same] extent that such interest as a ... joint tenant is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Debtor alternatively argues that the filing of a bankruptcy petition severs the tenancy in common, which destroys the survivorship interest so that the property transferred to the bankruptcy estate does not include a survivorship interest. The Chapter 7 Trustee disagrees, arguing that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not automatically sever the tenancy with a right of survivorship. The Chapter 7 Trustee concedes that if the Court determines that severance occurs by the filing of a bankruptcy petition or by any action of the Chapter 7 Trustee to administer jointly-owned property, then \"Debtor would be entitled to a homestead exemption determined by a proper exemption.\" [Doc. 27, p. 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For her part, the Chapter 13 Trustee argues that \"a debtor with an interest in jointly owned property with a right of survivorship is entitled unilaterally to sever the survivorship and sell the debtor's interest in the property under Tennessee law\" so that a trustee in either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 may sell the debtor's complete interest in the jointly owned property. [Doc. 39, p. 1.] Such a sale by a trustee would effect a severance of the survivorship right so that the property to be sold would be a mere joint tenancy or tenancy in common without a right of survivorship. Thus, the Chapter 13 Trustee asserts that Debtor is entitled to whatever exemption is available to him under Tennessee law as to his whole interest in the jointly owned property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Debtor does not have a vested homestead exemption in his survivorship interest in the Real Property. He does, however, have a contingent exemption in the Real Property that may only be realized if he survives his spouse and becomes fully vested in the Real Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    In re Arwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9364695\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/289/889/#p892\">\n    289 B.R. at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As acknowledged by the Chapter 7 Trustee, however, Debtor owns the Property with Ms. Goforth as tenants in common with a right of survivorship, not as tenants by the entirety, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Arwood\n   </em>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   court held that a joint tenant has a unilateral right to sever a joint tenancy with an express right of survivorship. Inclusion of a survivorship right does not convert the joint tenancy or tenancy in common into a tenancy by the entirety, nor does it impact the particular rights of each tenant to use, exclude, and enjoy a share of the property's income. For this reason, the exemption analysis of\n   <em>\n    Arwood\n   </em>\n   is inapposite to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Also, Tennessee has long allowed levy on the whole interest of one co-tenant of a tenancy in common.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earles v. Meaders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8539246\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/60/248/#p251\">\n    60 Tenn. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251 (Tenn. 1872). Moreover, Tennessee's homestead exemption statute, which expressly applies to \"jointly own[ed]\" property,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-301\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), has been construed to apply to joint tenancies and tenancies in common.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6559052\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/42/892/#p896\">\n    42 B.R. 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1984) (\"It is illogical to deny any homestead right whatsoever in connection with a given residence where the undivided interest of a tenant in common is reached by creditors while recognizing the homestead right in a residence where the survivorship interest of a tenant by the entirety is involuntarily sold.\"). As a result, because \u00a7 522(b)(3)(B) authorizes an exemption for \"an interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant to the extent that such interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law,\" Debtor's exemption claim here is good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court construes exemptions broadly and favorably for Debtor's benefit so long as the law allows. In addition to being contrary to Tennessee law, it would be inequitable and unfavorable to debtors for the Court to find that a survivorship interest in a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship precludes application of Tennessee's homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For these reasons, the Objection to Exemption is overruled, and Debtor's $25,000.00 homestead exemption shall be\n   allowed. The Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Tennessee Code Annotated section 26-2-301(f) provides that \"an individual who has one (1) or more minor children in the individual's custody shall be entitled to a homestead exemption not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) on real property that is owned by the individual and used by the individual as a principal place of residence.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Court need not reach the question of whether the filing of a bankruptcy petition, in and of itself, effects a severance of the right of survivorship as a matter of law. The Court notes, however, that when a Chapter 7 trustee, standing in the shoes of a debtor under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) and (h), sells a debtor's interest in jointly owned property that was conveyed to the debtor and his co-owner with a right of survivorship, the survivorship interest is severed by operation of law.\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385810\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/522/392/\">\n     522 S.W.3d at 413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[U]nder the common-law doctrine of severance, when one co-tenant in a joint tenancy conveys his or her interest to a third person, the joint tenancy is severed; it becomes a tenancy in common between the third person and the remaining joint tenant, and the right of survivorship is destroyed.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
