Tucker, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties in this adversary proceeding ask the Court to decide, among other things, whether a particular obligation in a prenuptial agreement made by the Debtor, Scott R. Schubiner, is a \"domestic support obligation\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(14A), and thereby is nondischargeable in the Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Scott R. Schubiner (\"Scott\") and Shelley Zolman (\"Shelley\") made a prenuptial agreement (referred to in this Opinion as the \"Antenuptial Agreement\") in 2010, a few days before they were married. Scott later filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in 2012, and obtained a discharge. A few years later, in 2017, Scott died. A dispute then arose under the Antenuptial Agreement, which led Shelley to file an action in state probate court. In that action, Shelley sought damages of $500,000 for Scott's alleged breach of an obligation relating to life insurance, contained in the Antenuptial Agreement. Shelley's filing of that state court action, in turn, led the personal representative of Scott's probate estate, Steven P. Schubiner (the \"Plaintiff\"), to file this adversary proceeding against Shelley. Plaintiff claims, among other things, that Shelley's state court action violated the discharge injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), because Scott's alleged obligation at issue was discharged in Scott's bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This adversary proceeding is before the Court on cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings, regarding the Plaintiff's first amended complaint (Docket # 19), or alternatively, for summary judgment (Docket ## 22, 27, collectively, the \"Motions\"). The Court held a hearing on the Motions and took them under advisement. This Opinion and the Order to follow will constitute the Court's decision on the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court will consider the Motions under applicable summary judgment standards, rather than under the standard that applies to a motion for judgment on the pleadings, because the Court has considered materials outside the pleadings. These include the affidavits of Shelley and of Plaintiff, and all of the other exhibits\n   filed in support of and in opposition to the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, the Court concludes that it cannot grant summary judgment for either party on the issue of whether the alleged debt owing by Scott to Shelley under the Antenuptial Agreement is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), and therefore was not discharged in Scott's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. As a result, the Court cannot grant summary judgment for either party on the issue of whether Shelley violated the discharge injunction by filing the action in the state probate court, seeking to collect such debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court also concludes, however, that Shelley does not have any valid claim based on the Antenuptial Agreement, and the Court will grant summary judgment for Plaintiff to that extent. Finally, under the particular circumstances of this case, the Court will exercise its discretion to deny Plaintiff any monetary or other relief for the alleged violation of the discharge injunction, and will grant summary judgment for Shelley to that extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court will enter an order granting each party's motion for summary judgment in part. The Court's Order will fully dispose of this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The undisputed facts include the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Antenuptial Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 11, 2010, shortly before their marriage, Scott and Shelley entered into the Antenuptial Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement is quoted at length below. In summary, the agreement specifically defined the \"Separate Property\" of Scott and Shelley, and provided that Scott and Shelley each would retain their \"Separate Property\" during their marriage, upon any divorce, or upon the death of either of them. The agreement further defined \"Marital Property,\" as property acquired by Scott and Shelley during their marriage that was not part of the \"Separate Property\" of either of them. The agreement provided that upon a divorce, Scott and Shelley each would receive one-half of the Marital Property. Finally, the agreement provided, with certain conditions, that Scott and Shelley each would name the other as beneficiary under certain term life insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, the Antenuptial Agreement provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    RECITALS\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

Scott's and Shelley's financial positions and plans at the time of their marriage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Scott's \"Separate Property\" is listed specifically on Exhibit A of the Antenuptial Agreement, and Shelley's \"Separate Property\" is listed specifically on Exhibit B of the Antenuptial Agreement. At the time of the execution of the Antenuptial Agreement, according to Exhibit A of that agreement, Scott had a net worth of -$10,136.00. Included in Scott's list of assets were two life insurance policies: one life insurance policy from \"Electric Capital Assurance Company in the face amount of $1,000,000.00;\" and another life insurance policy from \"Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Co. in the face amount of $400,000.00.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the time of executing the Antenuptial Agreement, according to Exhibit B of that agreement, Shelley had a net worth of $808,678.62.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bulk of Shelley's assets had come from a settlement of a personal injury claim she had as a result of serious\n   injuries she suffered in a car accident in 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Shelley was a dentist at the time of executing the Antenuptial Agreement. She worked part time as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Detroit Dental School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her accident injuries prevented her from working full time at the Dental School or as a dentist in a private practice. Scott was working as an attorney for the law firm of Jacob &amp; Weingarten, P.C., earning more than three times the income of Shelley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was so even though Scott had long suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   An attorney at Scott's law firm drafted the Antenuptial Agreement, though Scott and Shelley each were represented by their own attorneys. At the time of the preparation and signing of the Antenuptial Agreement, Scott and Shelley intended to use the funds from Shelley's settlement for a down payment on a house and renovations on that house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shelley's understanding of the intent behind the life insurance provisions in Paragraph IV.4 of the Antenuptial Agreement was \"to insure that in the event of Scott's death, he would be able to provide maintenance and support for [Shelley] so that [she] would continue to live in the manner in which the two of [them] had grown accustomed and vice versa.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, \"[P]aragraph IV.4. of the Agreement was intended to make sure that in the event of either of [Scott's or Shelley's] deaths, the other would be provided with maintenance and support through insurance proceeds so that the survivor would be able to continue to live in the house and not be forced to sell it for support.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At the time the parties signed the Antenuptial Agreement, Scott had the two life insurance policies described above, which he had purchased before meeting Shelley. The beneficiary of those life insurance policies was the Scott Schubiner Revocable Trust (the \"Trust\"). The sole beneficiary of the Trust is Scott's minor daughter. Scott's father paid the premiums for the life insurance policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Events after Scott and Shelley married\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Scott and Shelley were married on February 17, 2010, six days after they signed the Antenuptial Agreement. Scott was Shelley's second husband, and Shelley was Scott's third wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scott had one minor child from a prior marriage, and Shelley had three minor children from her prior marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On the date they were married, Scott and Shelley purchased a home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, using the money Shelley had received from the settlement of her personal injury claim. They later made renovations to that home, also using funds from Shelley's settlement. In 2013, Scott and Shelley sold the Bloomfield Hills home and bought a home in Huntington Woods, Michigan. They financed the purchase of that home, and renovations to that home, with funds from Shelley's settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Meanwhile, on March 22, 2012, Scott had filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7. It was a \"no asset\" case, meaning that the Chapter 7 Trustee did not administer any assets, and nothing was paid to creditors. On July 3, 2012, the Court entered an order granting Scott a discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on August 1, 2012, Scott's bankruptcy case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On November 8, 2013, Scott terminated his employment at Jacob &amp; Weingarten, P.C., due to his multiple sclerosis. \"[A]fter a waiting period, [Scott] began receiving disability payments.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Unfortunately, Scott died unexpectedly on April 22, 2017, at the age of 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of Scott's death, Shelley had not applied for and paid for the life insurance described in Paragraph IV.4 of the Antenuptial Agreement -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"at least $500,000.00 of 30 year level term life insurance naming Scott's Revocable Trust as beneficiary.\" Likewise, Scott had not named Shelley as a beneficiary on either of his life insurance policies, as provided under Paragraph IV.4 of the Antenuptial Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The dispute in the probate court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A decedent's estate for Scott was opened in the probate court for Oakland County, Michigan (Case No. 17-376753-DE.). On July 18, 2017, Shelley filed a complaint in the probate court (the \"Probate Court Lawsuit\"), against Steven P. Schubiner, who had been appointed the Personal Representative of Scott's estate, and who is also Scott's brother and the Trustee of the Trust (Case No. 17-377846-CZ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Steven Schubiner also is an attorney, and worked at the law firm where Scott had worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Shelley's complaint in the Probate Court Lawsuit is based on Scott's unperformed obligation under Paragraph IV.4 of the Antenuptial Agreement. The complaint alleges that \"[o]n May 18, 2017, Shelley's counsel contacted Defendant [Steven P. Schubiner] and verbally conveyed Shelley's claim against the first $500,000 of Scott's life insurance proceeds; however, Defendant, while acting in his capacity as Personal Representative and Trustee, denied the claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged further that \"[o]n May 26, 2017, Shelley's counsel sent Defendant written confirmation of Shelley's claim and Defendant['s] subsequent unequivocal denial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint sought \"damages in the amount of $500,000, plus costs, interest, and allowable attorney fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint also sought the imposition of \"a constructive trust over the life insurance proceeds in the amount of $500,000\" and the prohibition of \"any use of these funds until a final order has been issued in [the Probate Court Lawsuit].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

To meet this burden, the moving party may rely on any of the evidentiary sources listed in Rule 56(c) or may merely rely upon the failure of the nonmoving party to produce any evidence which would create a genuine dispute for the [trier of fact]. Essentially, a motion for summary judgment is a means by which to challenge the opposing party to 'put up or shut up' on a critical issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   If the moving party satisfies its burden, then the burden of going forward shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidence that results in a conflict of material fact to be resolved by [the trier of fact].

However, if the evidence is insufficient to reasonably support a ... verdict in favor of the nonmoving party, the motion for summary judgment will be granted.

But there was never any deadline or reason for Shelley to file such a proof of claim, because Scott's bankruptcy case was always a no-asset case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because Scott's bankruptcy case was and is a no-asset case, and Shelley filed no proof of claim in the case, there is no reason for the Court to determine the value of what Plaintiff refers to as Shelley's \"rejection claim,\" as requested by Count III of Plaintiff's First amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will dismiss Counts I and III of Plaintiff's First amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Shelley's claim under the Antenuptial Agreement is without merit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff argues, among other things, that Shelley has no valid claim under the Antenuptial Agreement. This is based on the undisputed fact that during Scott's lifetime, Shelley never performed her obligation under the Antenuptial Agreement, in that she did not obtain life insurance of at least $500,000.00 (or in any amount) and name Scott's Revocable Trust as beneficiary. Because of this, Plaintiff argues, Scott never had an obligation under the Antenuptial Agreement to name Shelley as beneficiary under Scott's term life insurance policies. For this reason, Plaintiff argues, neither Scott nor his probate estate were or are liable for any breach of the Antenuptial Agreement. Shelley disputes this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff's no-liability argument initially was framed in this way: Shelley breached the Antenuptial Agreement, by failing to perform her obligation, and this breach by Shelley excused Scott from performing his obligation under the agreement. This argument is based on the following rule of contract law in Michigan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \"The rule in Michigan is that one who first breaches a contract cannot maintain an action against the other contracting party for his subsequent breach or failure to perform.\" However, the rule only applies if the initial breach was substantial. To determine whether a substantial breach occurred, a trial court considers \"whether the nonbreaching party obtained the benefit which he or she reasonably expected to receive.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Able Demolition, Inc. v.

She argues that her breach was not a \"substantial\" breach, because she could cure her breach, and finally did cure her\n   breach, after Scott's death, by obtaining the required life insurance and naming Scott's Revocable Trust as a beneficiary. Shelley argues it this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   \"However the rule only applies if the initial breach was substantial.\"\n   <em>\n    Able Demolition Inc. v City of Pontiac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080840\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/275/577/\">\n    275 Mich App 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20N.W.2d%20696\">\n    739 N.W.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (2007). A \"substantial breach\" is one which \"has effected such a change in essential operative elements of the contract that further performance by the other party is thereby rendered ineffective or impossible, such as the causing of a complete failure of consideration or the prevention of further performance by the other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20N.W.2d%20696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   In the present case, [Shelley's] failure to obtain the requisite life insurance for the benefit of Plaintiff did not constitute a \"substantial breach\" because it did not render further performance by Plaintiff ineffective or impossible. Furthermore, [Shelley's] breach was not material because, literally until the day she dies, she could cure the breach without negatively impacting Plaintiff's rights. Only upon either party's death (without the requisite life insurance) was it impossible for the breaching party to cure. Therefore, [Shelley's] delay in performance, did not negate her claim against Debtor's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   During the hearing, Plaintiff's argument about Shelley's breach was framed somewhat differently than as described above. At that point Plaintiff argued that Shelley's performance under the Antenuptial Agreement -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , her obtaining life insurance of at least $500,000 and naming Scott's Revocable Trust as beneficiary - was a condition precedent to Scott's obligation to name Shelley as a beneficiary under his life insurance policies. Shelley disputed this theory during the hearing, arguing that this is inconsistent with the wording of the life insurance provisions in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court concludes that the relevant wording of the Antenuptial Agreement is unambiguous, and unambiguously means that Scott's contractual duty to name Shelley as a life insurance beneficiary was never triggered. The Agreement's life insurance provisions, quoted above, state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   4. Shelley shall, as soon as practicable after the marriage, apply and pay for at least $500,000.00 of 30 year level term life insurance naming Scott's Revocable Trust as beneficiary. Scott shall assign an equivalent amount of his present life insurance policy(ies) naming Shelley as beneficiary as soon as practicable after marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Under this language, Scott's contractual duty to assign and name Shelley as beneficiary of \"an equivalent amount of his present life insurance policy(ies),\" was the duty to make such assignment and beneficiary designation of an \"equivalent amount\" to the amount of life insurance that Shelley \"appl[ied] and pa[id] for\" naming Scott's Revocable Trust as beneficiary. The amount Shelley was to \"apply and pay for\" was not specifically defined, except that it was to be \"at least $500,000.00.\" Because of this, the \"equivalent amount\" of life insurance that Scott had to assign to Shelley as beneficiary could not be known, until Shelley had first applied and paid for her life insurance. The most that could be known, before Shelley obtained her life insurance, was that the amount of Scott's life insurance obligation potentially could be somewhere in the range of $500,000.00\n   to $1.4 million, depending on how much insurance Shelley obtained. (The upper limit was $1.4 million because that was the amount of Scott's \"present life insurance policy(ies)\" at the time the parties entered into the Antenuptial Agreement.) If, for example, Shelley had obtained $800,000.00 of life insurance, Scott's life insurance obligation to Shelley would have been $800,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Thus, the actual amount of Scott's life insurance obligation to Shelley could not possibly be known until Shelley had first performed her life insurance obligation to Scott. And more importantly, Scott's only contractual obligation was to assign for Shelley's benefit an amount \"equivalent\" to the amount of life insurance that Shelley \"appl[ied] and pa[id] for,\" for the benefit of Scott's Revocable Trust. Until Shelley applied and paid for her life insurance of at least $500,000, therefore, the \"equivalent\" amount that Scott was obligated to provide for Shelley was\n   <em>\n    zero\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Shelley therefore had to perform her obligation first, before Scott's obligation to assign\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   life insurance for Shelley could ever arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Agreement required both Shelley and Scott to perform their life insurance obligations \"as soon as practicable after marriage.\" Under that language, it was not practicable for Scott to perform his obligation until Shelley had first performed her obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Shelley argues that the contract language means that Scott had an obligation to promptly name Shelley as beneficiary for $500,000.00, without waiting for Shelley to first perform, and then to increase that amount later if it turned out that Shelley obtained an amount higher than $500,000.00 in life insurance. But that clearly is not what the contract says. The contract clearly says only that Scott would assign an amount \"equivalent\" to what Shelley applied and paid for. During Scott's lifetime that amount in fact always was zero, because during Scott's lifetime Shelley never applied and paid for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   life insurance,\n   <em>\n    in any amount\n   </em>\n   . What amount that would be, if Shelley ever did apply and pay for any life insurance, was unknown to Scott, and potentially could have been anywhere from $500,000.00 to $1.4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   If the parties had intended the meaning now argued by Shelley, the contract could have said so clearly, in any number of ways. For example, it could have said that \"As soon as practicable after marriage, Scott shall assign $500,000.00 of his present life insurance policy(ies), plus any amount greater than $500,000.00 that Shelley obtains under this paragraph.\" That would have required Scott to assign $500,000.00 promptly, without waiting to see what amount of life insurance Shelley obtained. Including such language, or other language with the same meaning, easily could have been done, if this had been the intended meaning of the parties. And this is what one would expect, especially since both Scott and Shelley were well-educated people, and each of them had the assistance of his/her own separate, chosen attorney in the drafting and negotiation of the Antenuptial Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In any event, the Court's interpretation of the contract language is the only reasonable meaning that can be given. Shelley's interpretation is contrary to the unambiguous meaning of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Under Michigan law, the question whether terms of a contract are ambiguous is a question of law for the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

Based on this undisputed fact, Scott's life insurance obligation to Shelley was never triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The fact that Shelley finally obtained the required life insurance after Scott's death, as vaguely alleged by Shelley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not change this conclusion. After Scott died, he obviously could no longer change the beneficiary or beneficiaries of his life insurance to include Shelley. Nor could the personal representative of Scott's probate estate do so. Rather, upon Scott's death, the then-existing beneficiary of his life insurance policies obtained a vested contractual right under the life insurance policies to payment of the life insurance proceeds. Shelley admits this, in effect, when she argues, in her brief quoted above, that \"[o]nly upon either party's death (without the requisite life insurance) was it impossible for the breaching party to cure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   By this, Shelley necessarily implies the obvious fact that after Scott died, it was then impossible for Scott to designate a beneficiary on any life insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   By the time Shelley claims that she applied and paid for the required life insurance under the Antenuptial Agreement, Scott's death had made Scott's performance of his life insurance obligation under the Agreement impossible.

The Antenuptial Agreement is a \"property settlement agreement.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code does not define the term \"property settlement agreement\" or the term \"separation agreement.\" But the Antenuptial Agreement clearly falls within the plain meaning of \"property settlement agreement.\" The Agreement defined the respective property rights of Scott and Shelley, during their marriage, in the event of a divorce, and in the event of the death of one of them. The Agreement specifically defined the \"Separate Property\" of each of the parties, and stated that Scott and Shelley each retain their \"Separate Property\" during the marriage and in the event of divorce or death. The Agreement defined the parties' \"Marital Property\" -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , property that Scott and Shelley acquired during their marriage that was not proceeds or income from their \"Separate Property\" - and provided that each would receive one-half the Marital Property in the event of a divorce. (Necessarily, of course, the Agreement could not define in advance the specifics of such a half-and-half split of the Marital Property, because the precise property that would be acquired during the marriage was not yet known.) And the Antenuptial Agreement provided that Scott and Shelley would have no rights against each other in the event of divorce or death, except as stated in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   These provisions are clearly a settlement of property interests of the parties. So the Antenuptial Agreement is clearly a \"property settlement agreement\" as that term is used in the DSO definition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sparks v.

As described in Part II.B of this Opinion, Scott came into the marriage already having two term life insurance policies, with a total benefit amount of $1.4 million. Before the marriage, the sole beneficiary under these life insurance policies was Scott's Trust, and the sole beneficiary under that Trust was Scott's minor daughter. So Scott came into his marriage to\n   Shelley having a property interest in two term life insurance policies with a large potential value, albeit a value contingent on Scott's death occurring while these term life insurance policies were still in effect. In the Antenuptial Agreement, the parties agreed to what Shelley's interest would be (and be limited to) in Scott's $1.4 million in life insurance policies. They agreed that Shelley would be named the beneficiary under these policies for somewhere between $500,000.00 and $1.4 million in coverage, depending on Shelley first obtaining term life insurance for Scott's benefit of at least $500,000.00, the exact amount of which depended on the amount of term life insurance coverage that Shelley obtained on her own life. And they agreed that Shelley would obtain and pay for term life insurance of at least $500,000.00, with Scott's Trust named as the beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Thus, the life insurance provisions of the Antenuptial Agreement, upon which Shelley's claim is based, were part of the \"property settlement agreement\" between Scott and Shelley. In terms of defining the consideration that Scott and Shelley gave to each other in the Antenuptial Agreement, it is impossible to separate the life insurance provisions from the other property settlement provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that Shelley's claim is a debt \"established ... by reason of applicable provisions of\" a \"property settlement agreement,\" within the meaning of the DSO definition,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14A). As such, the debt is a DSO\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   it \"is in the nature of ... support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Antenuptial Agreement is not a \"separation agreement.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   While the Antenuptial Agreement is a \"property settlement agreement,\" the Court concludes that it is not a \"separation agreement,\" as that term is used in the DSO definition and in \u00a7 523(a)(15). The Antenuptial Agreement says nothing at all about separation, or about what would happen in the event Scott and Shelley were to enter into a separation during the marriage. The Agreement does not purport to define or limit what rights the parties would have during a separation -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , during a time when they were separated but not yet divorced, or during a time when they were separated and just remained separated and never got divorced. It is true that the Agreement gave Scott and Shelley each the full, continuing rights to their respective \"Separate Property\" during the marriage, and those rights presumably would have continued during a legal separation. But the Agreement did not govern what other rights the parties would have during a legal separation. Rather, the Agreement only addressed what happened in the event of a divorce or death of one of the parties. As a result, the Court cannot find that the Antenuptial Agreement is a \"separation agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Shelley's counsel argued during the hearing that the Antenuptial Agreement is a \"separation agreement\" simply because it defined rights of the parties in the event of death or divorce. This is so, Shelley's counsel argued, because death and divorce each is a form of separation. But the Court must reject this argument. Under common usage, and under Michigan family law, a separation is different from a divorce, and it is different from widowhood. Moreover, a separation agreement is an agreement entered into\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   marriage, unlike a prenuptial agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689564\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/206/481/\">\n    206 B.R. at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that because a prenuptial agreement \"was entered into by the parties in contemplation of marriage, it is clearly not a 'separation agreement' \" within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(5) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Michigan law recognizes an action \"brought ... for a separation,\" in addition\n   to an action \"brought ... for a divorce.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20552.13\">\n    Mich.

As to this latter point, the\n   <em>\n    Saulsbury\n   </em>\n   court discussed New York law, and reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   [T]he term \"separation agreement\" as an instrument for dividing marital property has broad application and is not confined to its traditional meaning or label. Prior to the recent advent of \"no-fault\" divorce in New York State, a separation agreement acted not only to distribute marital property, but additionally provided parties with a ground for divorce after the expiration of a one-year waiting period. Today, a \"separation agreement\" may be embodied in an agreement by another name, as,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an \"opting-out agreement,\" which does not provide a ground for divorce, but nonetheless acts to distribute marital property. Similarly, \"pre-nuptial agreements\" often operate in the same fashion. For this reason, the court finds that the Agreement may also constitute a \"separation agreement\" for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(15).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Arguably, at least, the\n   <em>\n    Yelverton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saulsbury\n   </em>\n   cases may support Shelley's argument in this case, that Scott's life insurance obligation under the Antenuptial Agreement was an obligation \"in connection with a separation agreement\" within\n   the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(15). But to that extent, the Court finds the reasoning of those cases to be unpersuasive, and respectfully declines to follow them.

Nor is there any other relevant label placed on that obligation.

Rather, it involved Scott's naming Shelley as beneficiary under term life insurance policies that Scott already had, and which Scott's father had paid for. It is true that the Antenuptial Agreement did not limit Scott's life insurance obligation, by ending the obligation upon Shelley's death, or her remarriage, or her becoming eligible for Social Security benefits.

As a result, the Court cannot determine, at this stage, whether Plaintiff might be entitled to any relief against Shelley for a violation of the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   But the Court is now able to determine, and now rules, that even if Shelley did violate the discharge injunction as alleged by Plaintiff, the Court will, in its discretion, decline to grant Plaintiff any monetary or injunctive relief for such violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Bankruptcy courts have authority, under their civil contempt powers, to order appropriate monetary and injunctive relief for a violation of the \u00a7 524(a)(2) discharge injunction.

As a practical matter, the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff - an order requiring Shelley to dismiss her state probate court action - is unnecessary, because Shelley now has lost on the merits of the claim she asserted in that state court action. Shelley has no viable recourse left in state court. Her only possible recourse now, to continue to pursue her claim, is to appeal this Court's summary judgment decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Nor does it make sense for the Court to hold out the possibility that it might grant monetary relief to Plaintiff, if he ultimately prevails on his claim that Shelley violated the discharge injunction. The Court's summary judgment ruling means that a trial will be necessary in order for the Court to determine whether Shelley's filing of the state court probate action was a violation of the discharge injunction. The outcome on that issue is far from certain at this point. Both parties will incur significant time and expense going forward, in preparing for and conducting such a trial. Such time and expense will be avoided by the Court's discretionary decision, now, that it will not grant Plaintiff any relief for Shelley's alleged discharge injunction violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Another important consideration is that the only monetary relief that this Court would likely consider awarding,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff established a discharge injunction violation,\n   and if the Court were to award any monetary relief at all for such violation, would be limited to the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Plaintiff in moving the parties' dispute from the state court to this court. This would be limited to the reasonable attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in seeking and obtaining the reopening of Scott's bankruptcy case and then filing this adversary proceeding. Such monetary relief likely would not include any attorney fees or expenses incurred by Plaintiff in litigating this adversary proceeding after filing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   In the grand scheme of things, such limited attorney fees and expenses likely would be relatively small. The lion's share of the Plaintiff's attorney fees and expenses no doubt has been in litigating, in this adversary proceeding, the issue of dischargeability and the related issue of whether Shelley has a valid claim. And those same fees and expenses would have been incurred by Plaintiff if Shelley had filed a nondischargeability adversary proceeding in this Court, rather than filing an action in the state probate court. If Shelley had done that, this Court would not have awarded\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   monetary relief to Plaintiff, even if Plaintiff prevailed. This is because the bankruptcy rules expressly allow a creditor like Shelley to file a nondishargeability action based on Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(5) and 523(a)(15), at any time after discharge. Under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(a), \"[a] debtor or any creditor may file a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt.\" And under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(b), such a complaint \"may be filed at any time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   It may even be filed after the bankruptcy case has been closed, which would mean, in most cases, after a bankruptcy discharge has been issued. If the bankruptcy case has been closed, Rule 4007(b) says that \"[a] case may be reopened without payment of an additional filing fee for the purpose of filing a complaint to obtain a determination [of dischargeability] under this rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   For these reasons, the maximum amount of monetary relief Plaintiff likely can obtain, if Plaintiff prevails on the dischargeability issues after a trial in this case, would be the reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in moving Shelley's claim from state court to this Court, by filing this adversary proceeding. With this now being the only thing left at stake in this case, the Court concludes that it does not make sense to allow and force the parties to incur the additional, future expense of a trial. For Plaintiff, such additional future fees and expenses likely would exceed substantially the maximum amount of monetary relief Plaintiff could recover, if Plaintiff succeeds, after trial, in showing that Scott's debt to Shelley was in fact discharged in Scott's bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   No doubt Plaintiff hoped to prevail on the dischargeability issue at the summary judgment stage. But now that he has not done so, a trial is necessary to determine that issue. Under the circumstances, and for the reasons discussed above, the Court is exercising its discretion by deciding, now, that the Court will not award Plaintiff any monetary or injunctive relief even if Plaintiff were to establish at trial that Shelley violated the discharge injunction. The Court therefore will dismiss Counts IV and V of Plaintiff's first amended complaint, and will dismiss that part of Count\n   II of Plaintiff's First amended complaint that remains after the Court's entry of partial summary judgment for Plaintiff on that count, as described in Part V.B of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
