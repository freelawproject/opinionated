Trokie (\"Debtor\" or \"Plaintiff\") filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 23, 2015. This adversary proceeding was commenced by a Complaint (\"Complaint\") filed on March 6, 2018. Debtor filed this Complaint against U.S. Bank Trust National Association (\"US Bank\"), SN Servicing Corporation (\"SN Servicing\"), Tucker Arensberg\n   PC, Brett A. Solomon, Michael C.

McDermott (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Complaint provides that US Bank holds a mortgage loan secured by Debtor's principal residence located at 5906 Shope Place, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and that SN Servicing handles the servicing of that loan. The Complaint also alleges that, on October 2, 2017, counsel for US Bank and SN Servicing filed a Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay (\"Motion for Relief\") regarding an alleged delinquency on Debtor's loan payments. Motion for Relief, 1:15-bk-05003-RNO, ECF No. 46. Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that, before and after the filing of the Motion for Relief, Debtor's counsel communicated with Defendants multiple times where she expressed concerns regarding the accuracy of Debtor's payment history account held by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In sum, the Complaint alleges that Defendants filed and pursued the Motion for Relief under knowingly faulty and false payment history records of Debtor's loan account, and in turn violated the automatic stay imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , violated the terms of Debtor's confirmed Chapter 13 Plan under \u00a7 1327(a), and violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\") under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 6, 2018, US Bank and SN Servicing (collectively, \"US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants\") filed a Motion to Dismiss (\"US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\") at docket number 8. On the same day, Tucker Arensberg PC, Kevin L. Hall, Michael C. Mazack, Kenneth J. McDermott, and Brett A. Solomon (collectively, \"TAPC Defendants\"), as counsel for US Bank and SN Servicing, filed a Motion to Dismiss (\"TAPC Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\") (collectively, \"Motions to Dismiss\") at docket number 7. Both Motions to Dismiss seek dismissal of the Complaint, with prejudice. A hearing on the Motions to Dismiss was held on July 26, 2018.

Standard of Review for a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"FRBP\") 7012(b) makes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\") 12(b)-(i) applicable to bankruptcy adversary proceedings. FRCP 12(b)(6) requires dismissal of a complaint which fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Generally, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). However, the Supreme Court heightened this pleading standard by holding that for a complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss, a claim must be more than possible, it must be plausible.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1973,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   advises that while detailed factual allegations are not required in a complaint, \"a plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Two years later, the Supreme Court went further to define \"facial plausibility\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n   inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third Circuit has also provided guidance on the differing standards regarding a complaint's alleged facts and legal conclusions at the motion to dismiss stage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court must accept all of the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true, but may disregard any legal conclusions. Second, a District Court must then determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief. In other words, a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiff's entitlement to relief. A complaint has to \"show\" such entitlement with its facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

As stated by Judge Frank:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The grant of such relief is relatively rare because it usually would contravene the purposes of the automatic stay. Nevertheless, in some cases, the hardship to the movant as compared to the hardship to the debtor may justify granting stay relief.

Therefore, I grant TAPC Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to Count II of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I also find that Debtor's Count II against TAPC Defendants should be dismissed, without prejudice. I cannot presently find that amendment of Count II against the TAPC Defendants would be futile. However, I find it necessary to raise my concern that Debtor has not, at any point in the Complaint, cited FRBP 9011, the principal purpose of which is to deter litigation abuses by imposing sanctions. Additionally, I recognize that my power to impose sanctions pursuant to \u00a7 105(a)\"should be reserved for those cases wherein the conduct of a party\n   <em>\n    or an attorney\n   </em>\n   is egregious and\n   <em>\n    no other basis for sanctions exists\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re Coquico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4169237\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/508/929/#p941\">\n    508 B.R. 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941 (Bankr.

To succeed on an FDCPA violation claim, a plaintiff must prove that (1) she is a \"consumer,\" (2) the defendant is a \"debt collector,\" (3) the defendant's challenged practice involves an attempt to collect a \"debt\" as the FDCPA defines it, and (4) the defendant has violated a provision of the FDCPA in attempting to collect the debt.\n   <em>\n    Douglass v.

In the present case, it appears the TAPC Defendants have only moved to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(6) for Debtor's failure to state that TAPC Defendants violated a provision of the FDCPA in attempting to collect a debt (i.e. the fourth prong in finding an FDCPA violation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While Debtor does not differentiate between Defendants in Count III, she does reference ten instances where Defendants allegedly violated the FDCPA, two of which are attributed to the actions of the US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants and eight of which are attributed to actions of the TAPC Defendants. Compl. 15-17, ECF No. 1. All ten of these alleged violations are supported by ample factual\n   evidence in the attached exhibits. However, as TAPC Defendants point out in their Motion to Dismiss, Debtor's Complaint fails to specify which subsection(s) of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e the Defendants allegedly violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, I will grant TAPC Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to Count III of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I also find that, with regard to Count III against the TAPC Defendants, the pleading of additional facts may nudge the claims from merely possible to plausible.

My judgment will allow twenty-one (21) days leave to file an amended complaint, and any such amendment must,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , specify (1) under what subsection or subsections a claim is being brought and (2) against which defendant or defendants a claim is being brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Count II of the Complaint, as to the US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants, pleads a plausible claim for relief, and therefore, US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to Count II is denied. Count II of the Complaint, as to the TAPC Defendants, is dismissed, without prejudice, and Debtor is given twenty-one (21) days leave to amend. US Bank and SN Servicing Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to this Court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Count III of the Complaint is denied. Count III of the Complaint, as to the TAPC Defendants, is dismissed, without prejudice, and Debtor is granted twenty-one (21) days leave to amend.
