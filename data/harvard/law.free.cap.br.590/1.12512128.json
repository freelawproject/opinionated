WOODCOCK, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A Chapter 13 debtor appeals the Bankruptcy Judge's order confirming that the automatic stay has terminated pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) and, therefore, does not prohibit creditors from taking actions against property of the estate. This appeal raises a question that has divided courts concerning the proper statutory interpretation of the inelegant language of that provision. Under the majority view, subsection (c)(3)(A) terminates the automatic stay provisions blocking actions against the debtor or property of the debtor, but property of the estate remains protected by the automatic stay; under the minority view, subsection (c)(3)(A) terminates the automatic stay in its entirety. Although neither interpretation is entirely satisfactory, the Court affirms the decision of the Bankruptcy Court because the minority view is more convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There are no factual disputes. In December 2014, the Debtor, Leland S. Smith, Jr., filed a petition under Chapter 13, but that petition was dismissed in November 2016 because he failed to make payments required by the confirmed Chapter 13 plan. On December 28, 2016, Mr. Smith filed a second Chapter 13 voluntary petition and a proposed plan.\n   <em>\n    Voluntary Pet. for Individuals Filing for Bankr.\n   </em>\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 1);\n   <em>\n    Chapter 13 Plan\n   </em>\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 3). On February 15, 2017, the state of Maine Bureau of Revenue Services (MRS) filed a claim for roughly $52,000.\n   <em>\n    Proof of Claim\n   </em>\n   (Bankr. Claim No. 3-1). On March 22, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Mr. Smith's Chapter 13 Plan.\n   <em>\n    Order Confirming Chapter 13 Plan and Setting Deadlines for Certain Actions\n   </em>\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, at a hearing on February 16, 2017, MRS sought clarification under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) of the extent to which the automatic stay had terminated.\n   <em>\n    Min. Order\n   </em>\n   (Bankr. ECF No. 19). In cases under Chapters 7, 11, and 13, \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) terminates the automatic stay \"with respect\n   to the debtor\" after thirty days if that debtor had a prior case pending within the preceding one-year period, which was then dismissed. Under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B), any party in interest may move for a continuation of the automatic stay before the expiration of the thirty-day window, but no one did so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After briefing and oral arguments, the Bankruptcy Court ruled in a thoughtful and thorough opinion on August 18, 2017, that the automatic stay had terminated and the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) does not limit the scope of the termination by preserving the automatic stay for actions against property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    Order Regarding Stay Termination Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)\n   </em>\n   (Bankr.

BAP 2014) (reaffirming\n   <em>\n    Jumpp\n   </em>\n   ) ). The majority view is that the words \"with respect to the debtor\" distinguish between the debtor and the debtor's non-estate property on the one hand, and the property of the estate on the other, such that the automatic stay only terminates with respect to the former, not the latter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Mr. Smith argues against the minority view, which is that the words \"with respect to the debtor\" do not create a distinction between the debtor and the debtor's property on the one hand, and the property of the estate on the other, such that the automatic stay terminates with respect to all three categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Rather, many minority view courts interpret the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" as drawing a distinction between the repeat-filing debtor and any non-repeat-filing spouse in a joint case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Smith argues that the meaning of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) is plain, and thus any resort to legislative history is improper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. He points out that the numerous automatic stay provisions of \u00a7 362(a) draw distinctions between actions or acts against the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the debtor's estate, invoking the principle that Congress knew how to refer to these different categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Mr. Smith contends that the minority view improperly adds the words \"property\n   of the estate\" into the provision when they do not appear there,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, or else improperly reads the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" out of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. He also claims that the words \"with respect to the debtor\" only have meaning in joint cases under the minority view, but \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) is written to apply to \"a single or joint case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

MRS suggests that the majority view's conclusion that the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" is meant to exclude certain property cannot be reconciled with \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A)'s reference to actions against \"property securing [a] debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

MRS suggests that any textual differences between \u00a7 362(c)(3) and \u00a7 362(c)(4) are insignificant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   MRS places considerable weight on \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B) and \u00a7 362(c)(3)(C), which discuss the standard for establishing that a second petition is in good faith and thus eligible for an extension of the stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. MRS argues that the majority view renders these lengthy provisions meaningless, because there will rarely be any need to file for an extension of the stay if property of the estate is exempted from termination, as most, if not all, of the important assets are property of the estate in most, if not all, cases\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, 15. MRS emphasizes that the majority view renders \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A)\"devoid of practical effect\" because everything of value to creditors constitutes property of the estate, and thus would remain protected after the thirty-day window.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. MRS argues that the majority view's \"toothless\" interpretation violates the purpose of the statute, which is to curb abuse of the automatic stay by repeat-filers, and MRS presents a legislative history it believes supports its view of the statutory purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Leland S. Smith, Jr.'s Reply Brief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Smith highlights the facts that the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" appears in \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) but not in \u00a7 362(c)(4)(A)(i), which negates the automatic stay entirely for debtors who had two prior pending cases in the preceding year.\n   <em>\n    Smith Reply\n   </em>\n   at 1-3. Mr. Smith also asserts that the minority view renders the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" meaningless in cases like this one, where the debtor is a single filer in both the instant and prior case, because there is no non-repeat-filer-spouse for the phrase to distinguish.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Smith claims the minority view's interpretation is inconsistent with other\n   provisions in the Bankruptcy Code which refer to the debtor's spouse because they show that Congress knew how to draw that distinction by using the word \"spouse\" and it chose not to do so in \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Mr. Smith also chides the minority view for frequently relying on legislative history, because it is inappropriate to rely on legislative history when the plain meaning of the text is clear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. THE DECISION OF THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Bankruptcy Judge framed the question of statutory interpretation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 362(c)(3) sits between two ends of a spectrum. At one end of this spectrum, the stay is automatic. The stay springs into effect upon the filing of a petition, and the Court has no role in its creation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This occurs when an individual files her first petition under title 11. At the other end of the spectrum, the stay is not created automatically and does not go into effect on the filing of a petition. This occurs when an individual becomes a debtor in any type of title 11 case if that individual had two or more \"single or joint cases\" dismissed within the previous year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(A).

On a debtor's first filing, the debtor has full advantage of the automatic stay. On the debtor's second filing within a year, the stay terminates in its entirety 30 days after the second case is filed, unless a motion to continue the stay is made and a hearing held within the 30-day period-but if the debtor's spouse is not a repeat filer, the spouse is not penalized. And on the debtor's third filing within a year, there is no automatic stay at all. The alternative reading of section 362(c)(3)(A) would leave no meaningful consequence for a debtor filing a second case within a year and would not advance the goal of deterring a debtor's second filing, because there are very few practical situations in which a creditor would take action against a debtor or non-estate property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Reswick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740646\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/446/362/\">\n    446 B.R. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The text of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) contemplates actions against some type of property, not merely actions against the debtor's person.

Instead of supporting the majority view, the fact that Congress did not make a property distinction at all when it used the phrase \"with respect to the\n   debtor,\" but did make such a distinction in another BAPCPA amendment, suggests Congress did not intend that phrase to distinguish between the debtor's non-estate property and the property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russello v.

Second, read literally, the triggering events for the provision occur far less frequently than any courts are willing to endorse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [Section] 362(c)(3)(A) begins by referencing \"[i]f a single or joint case is filed by or against a debtor....\" The fact is that a \"case\" does not get \"filed\" at all; a \"petition\" gets filed. Indeed, \u00a7 362(a) itself creates an automatic stay as to \"petitions\" filed under \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302 or 303. Therefore, since no \"case\" gets filed, one could argue that [ \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) ] is never applicable. Of course, we may concede that this leads to an absurd result. The point however is to show that, when dealing with a statute which is obviously inartfully worded from the get-go, it may not be wise to attribute exalted importance and meaning to each and every word. Right at the outset, we know for example that \"case\" does not mean \"case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Parsing the wording of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) further, we see even more clearly how its exact words yield a result which almost surely was not intended by Congress, albeit not literally an absurd result. First, the statute requires a case (by which the drafters meant \"petition\" as we just saw) filed by or against the debtor. Second, the statute requires that the case must be filed by \"[a] debtor who is an individual in a case....\" For a debtor to be an individual in a case in the present tense, a case must still be pending. Thus, this section literally applies only to a debtor who has a case open when a new petition is filed by or against that individual. Finally, a single or joint case of the debtor had to be pending within the preceding one-year period but was then dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Taken together, as noted by Judge Small, technically speaking \"the section only applies to individuals who have had three cases pending in one calendar year: one case that has been dismissed, one case that is still pending when the petition at issue is filed, and the new case that is before the court for determination.\" As wryly stated by Judge Small, such a circumstance is \"unlikely to occur.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Peter E.

One scholar presents a convincing case that in all ten instances, the BAPCPA drafters used the phrase redundantly, or\n   as subconscious filler. \"[I]n tallying the score between superfluous and nonsuperfluous appearances of the phrase, the score is 10-0, not 9-1 or 8-2.\" Meltzer, 86 AM.

In other words, since we know from \u00a7 308(b)(1) that \"profitability\" necessarily refers specifically to the debtor's profitability, then what possible purpose can there be for the use of the phrase \"with respect to the debtor\" in \u00a7 308(a)?
