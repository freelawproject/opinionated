Defendants, who hold bonds issued by ERS, assert that they have a valid and perfected security interest\n   in a wide range of system-related employer remittances, employee loans, and amounts held in a certain segregated account pursuant to a stipulation. Plaintiff asserts four causes of action seeking declarations concerning the scope, validity, and perfection of Defendants' asserted security interest and Plaintiff's compliance with its obligations under a certain stipulation. (Docket Entry No. 1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the \"Complaint\"). Defendants have asserted nine counterclaims seeking declaratory relief in their favor with respect to the scope, validity, and perfection of their asserted security interest, and a contention that a particular application of a statutory provision upon which Plaintiff relies would be unconstitutional. (Docket Entry No. 36, Answer and Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 225-308.) The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment in its favor with respect to each of its four causes of action. Defendants seek the dismissal of each of Plaintiff's causes of action and judgment in Defendants' favor on each of their nine counterclaims. (Docket Entry No. 91, the \"Plaintiff's Motion\" and Docket Entry No. 94, the \"Defendants' Motion.\") The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has considered the submissions of the parties carefully. For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion is granted with respect to Counts One, Two, and Four of the Complaint, and denied with respect to Count Three of the Complaint. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied with respect to all four Counts of Plaintiff's Complaint and with respect to each of Defendants' nine Counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 15, 1951, the legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\" or \"Puerto Rico\") enacted Act No. 447-1951 (codified, as amended, at 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 761 - 788, the \"Enabling Act\"). (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 1; Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 10.) The Enabling Act established ERS to administer the payment of pensions and certain other benefits for the retired employees of the Commonwealth, certain public corporations in Puerto Rico, and certain municipalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 761 (2016). As originally codified, the official English-language version of the Enabling Act denominated the retirement and benefits system as the \"Employees Retirement System of the Insular Government of Puerto Rico and its Instrumentalities.\" (Docket Entry No. 92, the \"Possinger Declaration,\" Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Enabling Act provides that ERS may both issue debt and secure such debt with the assets of ERS. On January 24, 2008, ERS issued senior and subordinate pension funding bonds (collectively, the \"ERS Bonds\") pursuant to a Pension Funding Bond Resolution (Compl., Ex. D, the \"Resolution\"). (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 4; Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   56(b) \u00b6 22.) Pursuant to the Resolution, the holders of the ERS Bonds (the \"ERS Bondholders\" or \"Bondholders\") were granted a security interest in certain \"Pledged Property.\" Specifically, Pledged Property is defined in the Resolution to include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. All Revenues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. All right, title and interest of the System in and to Revenues, and all rights to receive the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. The Funds, Accounts, and Subaccounts held by the Fiscal Agent, and moneys and securities and, in the case of the Debt Service Reserve Account, Reserve Account Cash Equivalents, from time to time held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the application thereof as provided in this Resolution and to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Any and all other rights and personal property of every kind and nature from time to time hereafter pledged and assigned by the System to the Fiscal Agent as and for additional security for the Bonds and Parity Obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5. Any and all cash and non-cash proceeds, products, offspring, rents and profits from any of the Pledged Property mentioned described in paragraphs (1) through (4) above, including, without limitation, those from the sale, exchange, transfer, collection, loss, damage, disposition, substitution or replacement of any of the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Resolution at VI-36.) The Resolution defines \"Revenues\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. All Employers' Contributions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   received by the System or the Fiscal Agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. With respect to any particular Bonds, the proceeds of any draw on or payment under any Credit Facility which is intended for the payment of such Bonds, but only for purposes of such payment and not for other purposes of this Resolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Net amounts received by the System pursuant to a Qualified Hedge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4. Income and interest earned and gains realized in excess of losses suffered by any Fund, Account, or Subaccount held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   5. Any other revenues, fees, charges, surcharges, rents, proceeds or other income and receipts received by or on behalf of the System or by the Fiscal Agent lawfully available for the purposes of this Resolution and deposited by or on behalf of the System or by the Fiscal Agent in any Fund, Account, or Subaccount held by the Fiscal Agent under the terms of this Resolution, subject to the provisions of Sections 1301 and 1303.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at VI-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Resolution is publicly available both electronically on the websites of the Government Development Bank, ERS, and the Electronic Municipal Market Access System, and in the hard copy records of ERS. (Defs.' 56(b) \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 116, \"Plaintiff's 56(b) Response,\" \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 2, 2008, ERS executed a security agreement (Compl., Ex. E, the \"Security Agreement\") in connection with the Resolution. The Security Agreement grants, for the benefit of the ERS Bondholders, \"a security interest in (i) the Pledged Property, and (ii) all proceeds thereof and all after-acquired property, subject to application as permitted by the Resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Security Agreement does not include a definition of the term \"Pledged Property,\" instead providing that \"[a]ll capitalized words not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following the execution of the Security Agreement, a series of financing statements was filed with the Department of State of the Government of Puerto Rico (the \"Department of State\"). Specifically, two UCC-1 financing statements were received by the Department of State on or about June 24, 2008 and July 2, 2008, respectively (together, the \"2008 UCC-1s\"). (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23.) The 2008 UCC-1s identify the debtor as the \"Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" (Possinger Decl., Exs. 6 and 9.) The field for the collateral description contains the following prompt: \"this financing statement covers the following types or items [of] property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the relevant response field, the 2008 UCC-1s describe the collateral as follows: \"[t]he pledged property described in the Security Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto and by this reference made a part hereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A copy of the Security Agreement is attached to each 2008 UCC-1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 26, 27.) The Resolution, which sets forth the definition of Pledged Property, is not included in the 2008 UCC-1 filings, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2013, the legislature of Puerto Rico enacted Act No. 3-2013, which amended the Enabling Act, effective July 1 of that year. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Possinger Decl., Ex. 5.) The official English-language version of Act No. 3-2013 amended Section 1-101 of the Enabling Act to provide that Puerto Rico's \"retirement and benefit system [shall] be designated as the 'Retirement System for Employees of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico' \" (\"RSE\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-101.) Throughout Act No. 3-2013's operative provisions, the names ERS and RSE are used interchangeably and seemingly inconsistently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On or about December 17, 2015, the Department of State received two UCC-3 amendment forms corresponding to each of the 2008 UCC-1s (collectively, the \"2015 Amendments\"). (Pl.'s 56(b) \u00b6 29.) On or about January 19, 2016, the Department of State received two further UCC-3 amendments, further amending the 2008 UCC-1s (collectively, the \"2016 Amendments\" and, together with the 2015 Amendments, the \"UCC-3 Amendments\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) The information in the collateral description field of each UCC-3 Amendment reads: \"[t]he Pledged Property and all proceeds thereof and all after-acquired Property as described more fully in Exhibit A hereto and incorporated by reference.\" (Possinger Decl., Exs. 7, 8, 10, and 11.) Exhibit A to\n   each of the UCC-3s provides a fulsome definition of Pledged Property, including the definitions of \"Revenues\" and \"Employers' Contributions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There is no identification of the debtor's name or identity on the Form UCC-3 associated with each of the UCC-3 Amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, the UCC-3s identify the debtor entity only insofar as Exhibit A to each of the UCC-3 Amendments refers to the debtor as the \"Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 17, 2017, certain parties, including ERS, entered into a stipulation to resolve\n   <em>\n    Altair Global Credit Opportunities Fund (A),\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC v. Garcia-Padilla\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-2696, a proceeding brought in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to lift the automatic stay imposed by Section 405 of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (\"PROMESA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202194\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Compl., Ex. L, the \"January Stipulation\" or the \"Stipulation.\") This Stipulation required ERS to deposit all Employer Contributions (as defined by the Resolution) received during the pendency of the Section 405 stay into a segregated account. (Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), (c).) Additionally, the Stipulation provides that \"[t]o the extent that ERS receives any Commonwealth central government Employers' Contributions, ... such contributions shall be retained in the Segregated Account pending further order of the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The pending motions are brought pursuant to Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Rule 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Where the parties have submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, the court applies these principles in evaluating each motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants claim that the holders of the bonds issued by ERS have a valid and enforceable security interest in all monies remitted and to be remitted by participating employers in respect of pension obligations and employee loan repayments, the funds deposited pursuant to the Stipulation, and interest earned thereon. While\n   ERS has, in litigation before the commencement of ERS's debt readjustment case under Title III of PROMESA, acknowledged that the ERS Bondholders have valid and enforceable liens in current and future employee contributions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ERS now asserts that the security interest, whatever its scope, was not properly perfected. ERS invokes section 544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is incorporated by Section 301 of PROMESA, as rendering invalid and unenforceable the allegedly unperfected security interest. Even if the claimed security interest was and remains perfected, ERS further asserts, it does not attach to post-Title III petition remittances because they do not constitute proceeds of property in which the Bondholders have a security interest. The parties also dispute the scope of the security interest, with ERS arguing that it extends, as relevant here, only to employer contribution remittances in respect of pension obligations that were actually received by ERS and does not encompass loans to employees or repayments of those loans. The Bondholders assert that the security interest is valid and perfected (or that there are at least disputed factual issues as to whether ERS is barred by waiver, laches, or estoppel from contesting the validity and perfection of the security interest) and extends to rights in future contributions as well as to employee loans and repayments of such loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court turns first to the issue of whether the Bondholders' security interest is perfected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Perfection of Security Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pursuant to Commonwealth law, security interests of the kind asserted by Defendants must be perfected by filing financing statements pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (as adopted by Puerto Rico) on the secured transactions registry maintained by the Department of State. It is undisputed here that there were six relevant filings - two in 2008 that utilized the basic UCC-1 financing statement form, and four in 2015 and 2016 that utilized the UCC-3 financing statement amendment form. ERS contends that none of these filings were sufficient to perfect the Bondholders' claimed security interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    a. The Original Financing Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the 2008 UCC-1s were not effective to perfect the Bondholders' claimed security interest because they did not contain an adequate collateral description. With respect to the UCC-3 Amendments, Plaintiff further asserts that later UCC-3 amendment filings were insufficient to cure the defects in the 2008 UCC-1 filings because the later filings did not reference the official legal name of the debtor entity, which had been changed in the interim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Puerto Rico first adopted its version of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the \"UCC\"), known as the Commercial Transactions Act of 1996 (\"Former PR UCC\"), on September 19, 1996. The Former PR UCC was in effect until January 13, 2013, when it was repealed and replaced with Puerto Rico's current version of the statute (the \"Revised UCC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act No. 241-1996;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Act No. 21-2012. The UCC generally provides a notice system for security interests that creditors may have against the assets of a debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb Co. v.

Although strict enforcement of the formal requirements of the UCC may\n   be harsh, courts have held that \"literal application of the statutory filing requirement [is necessary to prevent] the deleterious effect of undermining the reliance which can be placed upon them.\"\n   <em>\n    Uniroyal, Inc. v.

Upon consideration of the factors enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Arraiza\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that ERS is an entity that is sufficiently structured like a private business that its assets may be subject to provisional remedies, including liens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, a court would have been empowered to issue any provisional order it deemed necessary and appropriate to secure satisfaction of the judgment pursuant to Puerto Rico Rule of Civil Procedure 56.1. Specifically, and as relevant here, a court could have ordered the attachment of a lien against property of ERS as of the commencement of this Title III case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Act 66 would not have limited the ability of a court to order the attachment of a lien against the assets of ERS. Section 9141 of Act 66 is titled \"Applicability and payment plans.\" 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 9141. As relevant here, Section 9141 provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    In view of the negative impact\n   </em>\n   on the fiscal and operational stability of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the municipal governments\n   <em>\n    that the payment of a lump sum would entail, the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all final and binding judgments\n   </em>\n   , except for those related to eminent domains that, on the date of approval of this Act, are pending payment and those issued during the effective term of this Act,\n   <em>\n    whereby the agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations, municipalities, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are compelled to make a disbursement of funds\n   </em>\n   chargeable to the General Fund, the fund of the public corporation in question, or chargeable to the municipal budget, as the case may be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8787170\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/70/614/#p617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Section 9142 of Act 66 provides that \"the garnishment of funds to enforce a judgment issued against the Commonwealth is [ ] prohibited.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8787170\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/70/614/#p617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9142. By its plain terms, Act 66 addresses seizures and compulsory disbursements of funds rather than security interests in property. A court order granting a lien against the assets of a governmental entity would not be inconsistent with the restrictions imposed by Act 66, because such an order would not by itself compel the sequestration or disbursement of any funds. Accordingly, Act 66 does not restrict a judgment creditor's ability to obtain a judicial lien to secure a judgment against ERS, although it would preclude the creditor from collecting cash payments other\n   than through a payment plan consistent with Act 66's restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, the Oversight Board has met its burden of establishing that, under Puerto Rico law, a judgment creditor could have obtained a lien against ERS's assets as of the commencement of its Title III case. The Oversight Board would thus ordinarily be entitled to invoke Section 544 to invalidate Defendants' unperfected security interest. However, the Court must consider whether the principle of constitutional avoidance impedes the use of Section 544(a) in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    b. Constitutional Avoidance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should not construe Section 544(a) to invalidate liens granted prior to the enactment of PROMESA, in order to avoid raising federal constitutional concerns. (Defs.' Mot. \u00b6 35.)

However, the Court cannot invoke the canon of constitutional avoidance to subvert the clear intent of Congress. Congress enacted PROMESA in 2016 in response to the dire fiscal emergency that was then, and still is, afflicting the Commonwealth and many of its instrumentalities. Through Section 301 of PROMESA, Congress expressly incorporated Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code into PROMESA and, therefore, granted the Oversight Board a position that is superior to that of the holders of then-existing unperfected security interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Recognizing that statutes are ordinarily construed as prospective only and finding Congressional intent ambiguous based on circumstances including the pre-enactment elimination of an express retroactivity provision, the Court decided, \"in the absence of a clear expression of Congress's intent,\" not to apply the exemption provision to pre-enactment liens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6552851\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/103/407/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Unlike the context of\n   <em>\n    Security Industrial Bank\n   </em>\n   , where Congress had recently updated the law governing a longstanding bankruptcy system of general applicability that would be invoked not only soon after its enactment but by untold numbers of debtors in future circumstances yet to unfold, PROMESA was enacted specifically to enable Puerto Rico to address its current debt crisis. Construction of the exemption provision of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code as prospective was not inconsistent with the broad purpose of that legislation and did not, it appears, disable its operative provisions in a manner material to its viability as a tool for effective debt relief. Such construction of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code in the PROMESA context would, by contrast, eviscerate (directly and by implication) the availability to Puerto Rico of lien avoidance mechanisms that are core debt relief tools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   PROMESA-as the name of the statute highlights-was specifically designed for and tailored to address, first and foremost, Puerto Rico and its current financial crisis. At the time when PROMESA was enacted, Puerto Rico was burdened with billions of dollars of outstanding debt, a substantial proportion of which was purportedly secured, and had lost the ability to access the credit markets for additional financing. With these facts in hand, Congress paved a path for Puerto Rico's financial recovery and created an Oversight Board to oversee that process. The Oversight Board was charged with the responsibility of developing \"a method [for Puerto Rico] to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202121\">\n    48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (West 2017). Among its powers, Congress gave the Oversight Board the ability to investigate the \"disclosure and selling practices in connection with the purchase of bonds [previously] issued by\" Puerto Rico,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2124(o), and to utilize avoidance tools under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, a decision to interpret Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code -and, by implication, the additional avoidance powers that Congress specifically incorporated through Section 301 of PROMESA-prospectively only would render such tools unavailable for use in Puerto Rico's Title III debt readjustment process. Indeed, the incorporation of the arsenal of avoidance powers into PROMESA would have been meaningless, in addressing Puerto Rico's financial situation, if they could only be invoked in connection with debt incurred, and security interests granted, following the enactment of the statute. This is particularly evident in light of the fact that Puerto Rico did not have access to the credit markets at the time that PROMESA was enacted. The Court finds that Congress's enactment of PROMESA for Puerto Rico, inclusive of a carefully curated list of incorporated Bankruptcy Code avoidance powers, was a strong expression of intent that those powers be available for use by the Oversight Board in pursuit of its mission to effect the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt, and to establish a method for Puerto Rico to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds that Section 544(a) applies to invalidate the Bondholders' unperfected liens. Plaintiff is entitled as a matter of law to declarations that the ERS Bondholders' liens on Pledged Property, including any such asserted interests in employee loan payments, are unperfected, invalid, and unenforceable. Given that all of the Bondholders' claims of secured status are premised on the Resolution, Security Agreement, and UCC filings discussed above, it is unnecessary for the Court to parse the precise scope of the now-invalidated security interests. The Court, accordingly, grants summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff, and denies Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, with respect to Counts One and Two of the Complaint. The Court declares that any security interest held by Defendants in the Pledged Property, including alleged security interests in the Employee Loans, the Employee Loan Payments, and monies deposited pursuant to the Stipulation, is invalidated and unenforceable against ERS pursuant to Section 544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Section 552(a) of the Bankruptcy Code prevents any security interest from attaching to revenues received by ERS during the post-petition period. (Compl. \u00b6 143.) Defendants contend that Section 552(a) is inapplicable in this case for various reasons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 18-25.) Having concluded that the security interest claimed by Defendants is invalid and unenforceable against ERS by virtue of Section 544(a), it is not necessary to consider separately the post-petition effect of any such security interest. Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code is subject to the application of Section 544 because it requires the existence of a pre-petition lien. Furthermore, Section 552(b) is not operative to preserve a lien that has been avoided through the application of Section 544(a).\n   <em>\n    In re Quaal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6555769\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/40/619/#p620\">\n    40 B.R. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (Bankr.

Defendants' motion for summary judgment is correspondingly denied with respect to all four Counts and as to each Counterclaim. The Court will issue an order to show cause as to why, in light of the foregoing analysis and decision, Defendants' Counterclaims One through Four ought not to be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and why Count Three of the Complaint, and Defendants' remaining counterclaims, ought not to be dismissed as moot or otherwise for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
