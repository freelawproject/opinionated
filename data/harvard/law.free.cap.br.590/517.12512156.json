Krohn (\"Trustee\"). The appearances of counsel were noted on the record. After arguments were presented, the matter was taken under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 10, 2018, a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was filed by Lou Shamoon Gagow (\"Debtor\") along with his schedules of assets and liabilities (\"Schedules\"), his statement of financial affairs (\"SOFA\"), and other required information. (ECF No. 1). On the same date, a notice of the Chapter 7 filing was issued scheduling a meeting of creditors for June 13, 2018, and notifying creditors of the Trustee's appointment. (ECF No. 7). On the Debtor's initial Schedule \"A/B,\" Debtor listed cash in the amount of $25,000 (\"Cash\"), the source of which is identified as an \"IRA Withdraw due to IRS levy.\" Debtor separately listed a \"checking account ending #9309\" in the amount of $508.91 maintained at Wells Fargo Bank (\"WFB Checking Account\"). Debtor also separately listed an \"IRA ending 0412\" in the amount of $95.00 maintained at Edward Jones (\"Edward Jones IRA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor further listed a 10% ownership interest in an entity identified as \"4th Junction, LLC.\" He described the value of that ownership interest in 4th Junction, LLC (\"LLC\") as \"Unknown.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On his initial Schedule \"C,\" Debtor claimed the $25,000 in Cash as exempt under NRS 21.090(1)(r). He also claimed the amount in the WFB Checking Account as exempt under NRS 21.090(1)(g) and 21.090(1)(z). Debtor also claimed the amount in the Edward Jones IRA as exempt under NRS 21.090(1)(r). He also claimed the amount of $10,000 for the LLC as exempt under NRS 21.090(1)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 11, 2018, Debtor filed an amended Schedule \"C,\" in which he claimed an exemption of the Cash in the amount of $15,827.23 under NRS 21.090(1)(r), and an additional exemption of the Cash in the amount of $9,172.77 under NRS 21.090(1)(z). (ECF No. 23). No changes were made to the exemptions claimed for the WFB Checking Account, the Edward Jones IRA, and the LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 13, 2018, the Trustee filed the instant Objection with respect to the Debtor's claimed exemptions in both the Cash and in the LLC. (ECF No. 24). The Objection is supported by the Declaration of Shelley D. Krohn (\"Krohn Declaration\"). (ECF No. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 1, 2018, the Debtor filed a further amended Schedule \"C\" wherein he now claims an exemption in the Cash in the amount of $15,827.23 under NRS 21.090(1)(r), and an additional exemption of the Cash in the amount of $9,172.77 under NRS 21.090(1)(z) or in the alternative NRS 21.090(1)(r). (ECF No. 32). No changes were made to the exemptions claimed for the WFB Checking Account or the Edward Jones IRA. However, the Debtor's amended Schedule \"C\" also claims an exemption in an unknown amount for the\n   LLC under NRS 21.090(1)(bb), instead of under NRS 21.090(1)(d). On the same date, the Debtor filed his Response in Opposition to Debtor's Claimed Exemptions Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003 (\"Opposition\"), along with the supporting Declaration of Lou Shamoon Gagow (\"Gagow Declaration\").

The Trustee maintains that none of the Nevada statutory provisions asserted by the Debtor support the exemptions claimed in the Cash and the LLC. For the reasons set forth below, the court agrees with the Trustee and will sustain the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Cash.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Debtor attests that he withdrew funds from the Edward Jones IRA on February 13, 2018, and deposited the net amount of $21,906.64 into the WFB Checking Account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gagow Declaration at \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Krohn Declaration at \u00b6 10 and Exhibit \"1\" thereto.

That Nevada statute provides an exemption of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   money, not exceeding $1,000,000 in present value,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     held in\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : (1) an individual retirement arrangement which conforms with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations and requirements of section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20408\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 408A, including, without limitation, an inherited individual retirement arrangement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nev.Rev.Stat. 21.090(1)(r) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, the Trustee does not object to the Debtor's exemption under NRS 21.090(1)(r) of the funds remaining in the Edward Jones IRA. The amount of $95.00 apparently is still held in that account, and no one questions whether the Edward Jones IRA complies with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rousey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870372\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/320/#p325\">\n    544 U.S. at 322-323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870372,9017535\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/125/1561/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor does any party in interest assert that if the Cash had not been withdrawn by the Debtor and was still held in the Edward Jones IRA, an objection would not have been asserted by the Trustee. Although the Debtor's explanation that the Cash resulted from an \"IRA Withdraw due to IRS levy\" raises more questions than it answers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   no one forced him to engage in what might be described as \"reverse exemption planning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this instance, the Nevada statute expressly refers to money \"held in\" an individual retirement arrangement\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than to money \"from\" or \"for\" an individual retirement arrangement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor maintains that the exemption of the retirement funds should not be lost simply because the funds have been accessed by the individual and are no longer held in the retirement account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition at 6:7 to 8:25.

Debtor cites no decisions, however, by courts in Nevada or other jurisdictions interpreting NRS 21.090(1)(r) to apply to monies that are no longer held in an individual retirement account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the Debtor's argument ignores the plain language of the statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   it also ignores that the Nevada legislature\n   has made other exemptions available to protect the assets of a judgment debtor, including funds withdrawn from a retirement account as well as the proceeds of such funds. The purpose of allowing individuals to exempt retirement accounts and pension funds is to ensure that funds are \"set aside for the day an individual stops working.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 2246. Whether retirement occurs voluntarily or involuntarily, however, it does not come cheap and living expenses still must be met even though the debtor no longer has income from employment. Fortunately, the Nevada exemptions generally do not distinguish between individuals who are working and those who are not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once an individual stops working, nothing prevents the debtor from using his retirement funds, not surprisingly, to pay his ordinary living expenses, or to acquire other exempt property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, a debtor can acquire a personal dwelling as a homestead or increase the equity in an existing dwelling that also would be subject to the $550,000 homestead exemption under NRS 115.010(2). Or, a debtor can acquire a vehicle or increase the equity in an existing vehicle that also would be subject to the $15,000 vehicle exemption under NRS 21.090(1)(f). Moreover, a Nevada debtor can rely on the recently increased \"wildcard\" exemption under NRS 21.090(1)(z) to protect up to $10,000 of cash withdrawn from a retirement arrangement, or any other interest in personal property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Nevada's generous exemption scheme, the prospect of a judgment creditor swooping down on any cash withdrawn from an individual retirement account is more apocryphal than real.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is even less realistic in a bankruptcy context when the individual debtor also would be protected from such acts by the discharge injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the instant case, the Debtor received\n   his discharge on August 14, 2018, and any funds he could have withdrawn from the Edward Jones IRA would not have been subject to execution by his creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under these circumstances, the court concludes that the exemption provided by NRS 21.090(1)(r)(1) does not apply to the Cash that the Debtor withdrew from the Edward Jones IRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The LLC.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Debtor also attests that the LLC is a California limited liability company in which he holds a ten percent membership interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gagow Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 10; Krohn Declaration at \u00b6 11 and Exhibit \"2\" thereto. He attests that the LLC no longer operates, but receives income from collection of contracts for prior services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. As receivables are collected, Debtor apparently receives \"non-passive income\" from the LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. Debtor asserts that the monies received from the LLC are exempt pursuant to NRS 21.090(1)(bb). That Nevada statute provides an exemption for \"[s]tock of a\n   <em>\n    corporation described in subsection 2 of NRS 78.746\n   </em>\n   except as set forth in that section.\" NRS 21.090(1)(bb) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   NRS 78.746 is part of Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes that governs Private Corporations in the State of Nevada. NRS 78.030 through NRS 78.055 specify the requirements for the formation of a private corporation in Nevada. Under NRS 78.030 (1 and 2), articles of incorporation must be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of Nevada, and must contain the information specified in NRS 78.035. Under NRS 78.050(1), a corporation comes into existence only upon the filing of articles of incorporation pursuant to NRS 78.030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NRS 78.745 through NRS 78.752 govern suits brought against private corporations, as well as their directors, officers, employees, agents, and stockholders. NRS 78.746 addresses actions by a judgment creditor of a stockholder to charge the stock of a private corporation for payment of an unsatisfied judgment. Subsection 2 of NRS 78.746 contains certain limitations on the execution of a judgment against the corporate stock held by the shareholder, but the provisions of part (c) of subsection 2 makes clear that the statute only applies to a corporation that (1) has fewer than 100 stockholders at any time, (2) is not publicly traded, and (3) is not a professional corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nev.Rev.Stat. 78.746(2)(c) (1, 2 and 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, the LLC is not a corporation, but is a limited liability company. Limited liability companies have members, but not stockholders. In certain circumstances, limited liability companies may be treated as corporations,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AE Rest. Assocs., LLC v. Giampietro (In re Giampietro)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9144668\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/317/841/\">\n    317 B.R. 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Nev. 2004) (application of corporate alter ego doctrine to limited liability company), but the formation and regulation of limited liability companies typically are governed by separate statutory provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   NRS 86.011 through 86.590 [limited liability companies]. Because NRS 21.090(1)(bb) refers only to stock of a corporation described in Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, rather than a membership interest in a limited liability company described in Chapter 86 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Debtor's ten percent membership interest in the LLC is not encompassed by the language of the exemption statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes governs the formation of private corporations in the State of Nevada. There is no dispute that the LLC was formed in California, presumably in compliance with California law. Limited liability companies formed in another state are permitted to do business in Nevada,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nev.Rev.Stat. 86.5463 and Nev.Rev.Stat. 86.5483, but are required to register with the Nevada Secretary of State and comply with the statutory requirements governing foreign limited liability companies. Likewise, corporations formed in another state are permitted to do business in Nevada,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nev.Rev.Stat. 80.010 through Nev.Rev.Stat. 80.290, but also are required to register with the Nevada Secretary of State and comply with the statutory requirements governing foreign corporations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Permission to do business in Nevada, however, does not transform a foreign fictitious business entity into a Nevada entity. The express language of NRS 21.090(1)(bb) is limited to \"\n   <em>\n    stock of a corporation described in subsection 2 of NRS 78.746\n   </em>\n   .\" That description only embodies corporations formed in Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under these circumstances, the court is not persuaded by the Debtor that it should essentially re-write NRS 21.090(1)(bb) to apply to a limited liability company instead of a corporation, and to a California fictitious entity rather than a Nevada fictitious entity. As the circuit court observed in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 11,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237415\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/638/#p642\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237415\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/638/#p642\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"even a liberal construction [of an exemption] must find support in the statutory text.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court concludes that the Trustee has met her burden of proving that the exemption of the Cash under NRS 21.090(1)(r)(1) is not properly claimed.

Having received a financial fresh start through bankruptcy, a debtor can assert any exemptions allowed by state or federal law in response to collection efforts by post-bankruptcy creditors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The prospect of a judgment creditor physically removing cash from the judgment debtor's possession without a breach of the peace is unlikely.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Clark\n    </em>\n    , Justice Sotomayor observed that \"the possibility that some investors may use their inherited IRAs for retirement purposes does not mean that inherited IRAs bear the defining characteristics of retirement funds.\n    <em>\n     Were it any other way, money in an ordinary checking account (or, for that matter, an envelope of $20 bills) would also amount to 'retirement funds' because it is possible for an owner to use those funds for retirement\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073195\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2242/\">\n     134 S.Ct. at 2250\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

Section 522(b)(4)(D) addresses distributions from accounts referenced in Section 522(d)(12). Section 522(b)(4)(D)(i) provides that a distribution from a qualified retirement fund does not lose its exempt status under Section 522(d)(12) if the distribution is deposited into a similar fund or account within 60 days. As also previously mentioned at 4,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , Nevada has opted out of the federal bankruptcy exemptions in favor of those provided under Nevada law. Unlike Section 522(b)(4)(D), there is no language in NRS 21.090(1)(r) extending the duration of the exempt status of a distribution from an individual retirement arrangement. Once an individual debtor obtains a discharge of his pre-bankruptcy debts, however, the importance of a continuous exemption is minimized by the presence of the discharge injunction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Effective January 1, 2014, California adopted the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Cal.Corp.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17701.01 through 17713.13, that includes provisions governing limited liability companies formed in another state.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cal.Corp.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17708.01 through 17708.09.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Not surprisingly, the Trustee does not oppose allowing the Debtor to claim an appropriate exemption under the wildcard.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Krohn Declaration at \u00b6 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
