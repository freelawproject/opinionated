Dkt. No. 1] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendant has answered the Complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nicholas S. Gouletas' Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Complaint Objecting to Dischargeability of Debt to Plaintiff and Discharge of Debtor [Adv. Dkt. No. 7] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Answer\n   </em>\n   \"), and in so doing, has asserted as an affirmative defense (the \"\n   <em>\n    Affirmative Defense\n   </em>\n   \") that the Plaintiff \"lacks standing\" to prosecute the Complaint. More specifically, the Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff initiated the Adversary Case at the direction of a lender who lacked authority to manage the Plaintiff. The crux of the Defendant's argument is that an applicable statute of limitations prevents the lender from continuing to act in a management capacity with respect to the Plaintiff. As a result, the Defendant alleges that the Adversary Case is infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff, in turn, asks the court to strike the Affirmative Defense. The Plaintiff contends that the plain language of the applicable documents affords the lender the right to manage the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also contends that no statute of limitations has run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons set forth more fully below, upon review of the respective filings, the court concludes that the Affirmative Defense fails as a matter of law and that the Plaintiff is therefore entitled to summary judgment on the Affirmative Defense. The Plaintiff's Motion will, therefore, by separate order issued concurrently with this Memorandum Decision, be granted. The Defendant's Motion will be denied and the Affirmative Defense will be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The federal district courts have \"original and exclusive jurisdiction\" of all cases under title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Order, at p. 1, this is not actually a standing question. The Defendant does not contest the Plaintiff's standing as the real party in interest, the justiciability of the Adversary Case under Article III of the Constitution, the capacity of the Plaintiff to sue or be sued, the ability of the Plaintiff as a creditor of the Defendant to bring an adversary proceeding under section 523 or section 727 of the Bankruptcy Code or whether those claims themselves are affected by a statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There appears to be no question that the Plaintiff is entitled to bring the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead, the Defendant challenges DJV's right to manage the Plaintiff, a limited liability company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Defendant's theory is essentially the following: (1) the ten-year statute of limitations for actions on written contracts began to run on the Security Agreement in 2005, when the Plaintiff defaulted on the loan, thereby triggering DJV's remedies under the Security Agreement; (2) DJV had authority over the Plaintiff only a result of the Security Agreement; (3) once the limitations period ran the Security\n   Agreement was no longer enforceable and DJV lost the authority to manage the Plaintiff; (4) the statute ran before the Plaintiff commenced the Adversary Case; and (5) the filing of the Adversary Case is therefore infirm because the Plaintiff acted on the order of a person without authority to so direct the Plaintiff to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of His Motion for Summary Judgment [Adv.
