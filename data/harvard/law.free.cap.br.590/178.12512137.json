PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 26, 2016, the Defendant filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Compl. 5-6, ECF No. 1. The same facts are alleged in support of the Plaintiff's Count Five, asserting nondischargeability on the theory of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, and Count Six, asserting willful and malicious injury. Compl. 6-7,\n   ECF No. 1. The Defendant answered the complaint by denying most of the allegations.

Anthony consulted Mr. Cusack every month to determine how much stock should be liquidated to cover the Mesulises' monthly expenses. Tr. 2, 0:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   37. Anthony subsequently informed the Defendant of the amount to be liquidated or withdrawn from the Buell Accounts or the Sovereign Account and endorsed checks in that amount to the Defendant. Tr. 1, 1:13; Tr. 2, 0:24, 0:30. Anthony then instructed the Defendant regarding how to allocate the funds to pay for the Mesulises' expenses. Tr. 2, 0:24-25, 0:31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   38. The Defendant received between $5,000.00 and $10,000.00 each month in checks from Anthony. Tr. 2, 0:38; 41-42; Def. Ex. 7 and 8.

According to the Defendant's testimony, Anthony asked the Defendant to help bring Katherine home and assist the Mesulises with their financial affairs and medical care. The Defendant readily obliged and promised Anthony that she would do whatever was necessary to ensure that Katherine's financial, physical, and medical needs were met. Pursuant to this agreement, Anthony wrote checks to the Defendant every month to pay the Mesulises' ordinary, extraordinary and ongoing expenses, and those checks were deposited into the Defendant's People's Account. By all accounts, when Anthony transmitted, and the Defendant accepted, checks that were agreed by both parties to be used to pay the Mesulises' expenses, an express trust was created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The undisputed facts also show that the Defendant was a fiduciary of the Mesulises under Connecticut law. The Defendant's dominant position over, and relationship of dependency with, the Mesulises is manifest throughout the record. By the Defendant's own admission, she was the Mesulises' \"voice\" and \"spoke for them...in a medical capacity\". Tr. 1, 3:55. That the Defendant turned down two job promotions in order to maintain a schedule that allowed her to visit the Mesulises multiple times throughout the week demonstrates their relationship of trust and dependency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   With respect to Anthony, the Defendant testified that in addition to helping him with his finances, she occasionally provided care for him, including toileting, bathing and dressing, bringing him to his medical appointments, picking up his prescriptions, and coordinating the interviewing and hiring of the live-in aides. It is clear from the record that as Anthony advanced in age, he heavily relied upon the Defendant to meet his basic needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With respect to Katherine, the Defendant testified that following her hospitalization, Katherine was in need of consistent attention and care, and the Defendant became her \"voice\" from that point forward. Tr. 1, 3:35. Katherine's dependence upon the Defendant was further magnified following Anthony's death. The record demonstrated that as Katherine's Parkinson's disease advanced, she became increasingly physically and mentally vulnerable up until the time of her death. Katherine lost the capacity to sign for the Reverse Mortgage, and the Defendant needed to contract Mr. Fochi as power of attorney to sign on her behalf. Similarly, when Katherine could no longer write checks to pay for expenses, the Defendant testified that she wrote them for her. The Defendant alone managed Katherine's bank accounts, and the Mesulises' financial advisor consulted only with her. Undeniably, the Defendant was in a position of ascendancy and dominance over Katherine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   It is abundantly clear from the record that the relationship between the Defendant and the Mesulises was \"characterized by a unique degree of trust and confidence between the parties, one of whom has superior knowledge, skill or expertise and is under a duty to represent the interests of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Martinelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11555213\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/409/#p429\">\n    196 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, as a matter of both federal and state law, this Court holds that the Defendant was a fiduciary of the Mesulises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   2. Defalcation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Having found that the Defendant acted as a fiduciary for the purposes of Section 523(a)(4), the Court must now determine whether the Plaintiff met his burden of proving that the Defendant committed a defalcation in the course of that relationship.

While there is no evidence of actual intent or knowledge of wrongdoing, the record is replete with the conscious disregard, recklessness and willful blindness that the defalcation standard requires. The Court's findings are predicated both on the evidence presented and the Defendant's lack of credibility,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shao Ke v. Jianrong Wang\n   </em>\n   , 5:13-CV-1203-GTS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204626329\">\n    2014 WL 4626329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2014), with regard to the recklessness of her diminution of the Mesulises' assets, the extraordinary amount of monies expended by her, and the inconsistent and incredible rationalizations she used to justify the excessive expenditures of the finite monies of the aged and vulnerable people in her care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   First, the Defendant admitted that between Anthony's death on January 27, 2009 and Katherine's death on November 23, 2011, she received direct payments in the form of checks in the total amount of $305,769.36, expended $175,759.00 for Katherine's benefit, and kept the remaining $130,010.36 for herself. Tr. 2, 1:45-46, 2:45-47; Pl. Ex. G; Def. Ex. 7; Def. Ex. 9. Unsurprisingly, the Defendant was unable to produce a single receipt for any of the $175,759.00 she allegedly spent on Katherine's\n   behalf, and was otherwise unable to corroborate any of her expenditures. It was only upon this Court's urging during trial-five years after the State Court Action-that the Defendant created a compilation (the \"Compilation\"), which summarized purchases the Defendant purportedly made for Katherine's living and household expenses. Def. Ex. 7. The Compilation shows that following Anthony's death, the Defendant expended several thousands of dollars on groceries, gas, food, bills, car payments and other expenses, all of which the Defendant would have this Court believe were to or for the benefit of the aged and ailing Katherine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For example, the Defendant regularly spent several hundreds of dollars a month on groceries, and some months spent close to $2,000.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 7. By the Defendant's own admission, she went to the grocery store four to five times per week and \"bought whatever was on the grocery list\" that Harriet gave her. Tr. 2, 0:46-52; Def. Ex. 7. This list also included Harriet's own groceries-and the Defendant admittedly \"didn't question\" a single item before she made the purchases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204626329\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Looking at the Compilation, it is clear that the Defendant was spending hundreds of dollars-if not thousands-over what was necessary for Katherine's dietary or household needs. Moreover, by the Court's estimation, the amount of money the Defendant spent on groceries after Anthony's death steadily increased and peaked immediately prior to Katherine's death, at a time when her health was rapidly failing. The Defendant advanced no tenable explanation for these excesses, and it is therefore reasonable to infer that the benefits of these spending sprees benefited someone other than Katherine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Among the other reckless expenditures reflected on the Compilation were regular trips to Walmart where the Defendant routinely spent hundreds of dollars each month, purportedly on Katherine's toiletries and undergarments. The Compilation also shows recurring payments to AT &amp; T, which the Defendant testified were for Harriet's cell phone bill, and trips to Best Buy, which were for new televisions and telephones for Katherine and Harriet. The Defendant also admitted that she relied on Katherine's checks to make her regular car payments which ranged from $680.00 to $742.00 monthly, as well as car repairs for her vehicle totaling $356.27, and a vehicle trade-in payment of $3,500.00. Def. Ex. 7; Tr. 2, 2:28-29. The evidence shows that the $175,759.00 the Defendant claims to have spent on Katherine's expenses encompassed purchases that were clearly to or for the benefit of individuals other than Katherine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Defendant also testified, and her bank statements confirm, that she made incurred charges for her benefit, and that of her children. For example, the Defendant testified to making payments to Quinnipiac University for her daughter's college text books and meal plan. Similarly, the Defendant made monthly payments to a tanning salon that she testified she and her daughter visited, as well as charges at GameStop for her son. Other various payments include astounding personal charges incurred in Maine, New Hampshire, Cape Cod, Las Vegas, and Block Island, all during times that the Defendant testified she was on vacation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Furthermore, in addition to the large amounts the Defendant was already spending from the Buell Accounts and the\n   Sovereign Account, the Defendant also made frequent expenditures on Katherine's Credit Card. The Credit Card statements show regular purchases at grocery stories, Walmart, and many of the same stores the Debtor admittedly frequented for Katherine's household expenses. Pl. Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Defendant attempted to minimize the profligacy of her spending by her explanation that when he was alive, Anthony, and later, Katherine, authorized many of the purchases and intended the Defendant to use some of the funds they gave her as appreciation for her efforts. For example, according to the Defendant, the Mesulises wanted to pay for many of Harriet's expenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   because they grew to love her and desired to incentivize her to continue working for them. In a similar fashion, the Defendant claimed that the Mesulises wanted to pay for her gas and car payments because of how often she drove to their home, and gifted her richly because she was forced to spend so much time away from her family in order to care for them. These sentiments, while natural and conceivable, have been to some troubling extent exaggerated by the Defendant. While the Court credits that the Mesulises intended to \"compensate\" or \"gift\" the Defendant for her services, the Defendant's explanations are undercut both by the frequency, consistency, and extravagance of her purchases, as well as Katherine's declining physical and mental health condition during the time these purchases were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Most alarming here is that the Defendant admittedly made no effort to check the Mesulises' account balances at any point in time, or to temper her patently disproportionate excesses. The Defendant testified that she never knew the balances and did not believe it was her responsibility to ask, despite being the primary person drawing on the Mesulises' accounts, managing their funds, paying their bills, and receiving thousands of dollars' worth of gifts from them. This evidence reflects a willful blindness, recklessness and conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the Defendant's conduct would violate her fiduciary duty. That risk is of such a degree that, \"considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to [her], its disregard involves a\n   <em>\n    gross deviation\n   </em>\n   from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bullock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697045\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/267/#p269\">\n    569 U.S. at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175289,12697045\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/133/1754/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(c), at 226).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Furthermore, when asked to account for her expenditures by the Plaintiff in the probate court, the Defendant frustrated every one of the Plaintiff's attempts to administer Katherine's probate estate and wholly failed to provide him an accounting of her expenses, in violation of her fiduciary duty.

By the Defendant's own admission, she kept at least $130,010.36 of the Mesulises' funds for her and her family's benefit, and arguably availed herself of more, and gave additional amounts of money to Harriet. The second element, however, requires heightened scrutiny of the trial record. The Plaintiff's contention that the Defendant is guilty of embezzlement because \"she took funds that were entrusted to her for the ordinary and necessary care of Mesulis and...kept at least $156,000 of it for own personal use\", is unavailing, as it does not prove that she did so with fraudulent intent. Pl. Post Trial Brief at 12. It was unrefuted at trial that the Defendant expended several hours weekly caring for the Mesulises, and the Plaintiff's Administrator Report supports the same: \"[b]y all accounts Ms. Fritzson did indeed oversee and coordinate the care of the Decedent and her late husband Anthony over the years.\" Def. Ex. 4. The Defendant, unchallenged, also testified that the Mesulises intended for her to keep a portion of what they gave her as gifts or compensation. The amount, and to what extent, the Mesulises truly intended to gift the Defendant, however, remains unanswered by the trial record, and it is a close question whether the evidence in this case demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendant misappropriated any portion of the $130,010.36 with fraudulent intent, as opposed to expending the funds with a reckless disregard or willful blindness, as detailed above. Accordingly, the Plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that the Defendant committed embezzlement pursuant to Section 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   D.

Even if the Defendant knew that she was violating the Mesulises' best financial interests and nonetheless acted, that knowledge, in the absence of any additional aggravating circumstances,\n   is insufficient to show a malicious intent. Moreover, the Court credited the Defendant's unassailed testimony-albeit, mistaken and unreasonable-that she was not required to keep abreast of the Mesulises' bank accounts given that the Mesulises engaged financial professionals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Furthermore, it is evident that the Defendant was motivated to act for her own economic gain, as she had come to rely on certain of the funds given to her by the Mesulises to pay her own bills. That conclusion is supported by the Defendant's testimony that she had grown accustomed to the fiscal generosity that the Mesulises had shown her over the years. For the above reasons, the Plaintiff's claim cannot be excepted from the Defendant's discharge under Section 523(a)(6) as a debt for willful and malicious injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   F. Amount of Nondischargeable Debt\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As explained above, it is unrefuted here that the Defendant provided care to the Mesulises, and the Court credits her testimony that they intended to \"compensate\" her, at some level, for her services. During the last day of trial, the Defendant submitted into evidence a purported accounting of the time and value she expended for their care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only reliable metric of the value of the Defendant's services that entered the record came from the Defendant's expert witness, who testified to the standard industry rates of Patient Care Assistants (\"PCAs\") and Certified Nursing Assistants (\"CNAs\") during the relevant time period. Based on the rate of $12.00 per hour, with a total of 2,527 hours worked\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Court concludes that the reasonable value of the Defendant's services from January 27, 2009 to November 23, 2011 is $31,308.00. Therefore, after subtracting $31,308.00, together with $175,759.00, the amount the Defendant spent for Katherine's expenses, from the $305,769.36 received from Katherine, this Court finds that the amount of the Defendant's nondischargeable debt owed to the Plaintiff is $98,702.36, exclusive of any cognizable prejudgment interest, legal fees, costs and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   VI. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Plaintiff has met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendant committed a defalcation while in a fiduciary capacity. Accordingly, a debt of $98,702.36 is nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), and judgment shall enter in favor of the Plaintiff on Count Five of the Complaint.

The $12.00 hourly rate is particularly appropriate given the frequent doubling of caregivers and costs thereof.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
