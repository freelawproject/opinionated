On July 18, 2018, nearly two years and ten months after the closing of the case, the debtor filed a motion requesting the court to reopen this case and grant him a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11), in order to obtain a discharge, the debtor was required \"to complete an instructional course concerning personal financial management described in section 111[.]\" Under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(b)(7)(A), the debtor was required to file \"a statement of completion of the course, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form\" unless the provider of the course filed a certificate of completion of the course. No provider filed such a certificate in this case, and thus the debtor was required to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement if the debtor was to obtain a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The deadline under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(c) to file the required statement was September 8, 2015. On June 8, 2015, the clerk issued a notice of that deadline to the debtor and the debtor's attorney. However, the debtor failed to file the required statement by the deadline of September 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4004(c)(1)(H), the clerk could not grant the debtor a discharge before closing the case without the debtor first filing the required Rule 1007(b)(7) statement. Therefore, on September 9, 2015, the clerk issued a\n   <em>\n    Notice That Case May be Closed Without Discharge\n   </em>\n   , a form of notice approved by the court for use, alerting the debtor and the debtor's attorney that the original deadline had passed without the required statement being filed. The\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Accordingly, notice is hereby given that the court will close this case without the entry of the discharge unless the Certification of Completion of Instructional Course Concerning Personal Financial Management (Official Form 23) (or notification by an approved provider of completion of the required course) is filed within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this notice.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dkt. No. 15 (emphasis in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor failed to file the required statement by the new deadline of September 23, 2015, set by the\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   and failed to respond in any other manner. By the expiration of that deadline, the case was ready to close as no one had timely filed an objection under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 5009(a) to the trustee's final report certifying that the estate had been fully administered. In due course, on September 29, 2015, the clerk examined the case and entered an\n   <em>\n    Order Closing Case Without Discharge\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4006, notice was given to all parties in interest that the case had been closed without a discharge being entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Order Closing Case Without Entry of Discharge\n   </em>\n   that was transmitted to the debtor, the debtor was notified that if he desired a discharge he would need to file a motion to reopen the case, pay the full filing fee for reopening the case, and file the required certificate of completion of a financial management course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the closing of the case, two years elapsed before the debtor completed the required course. On July 18, 2018, eight months after completion of the course on November 14, 2017, and two years and\n   nine months after the case was closed on September 29, 2015, the debtor filed the motion to reopen the case. The debtor's motion recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 14, 2017, debtor completed the required education course and was told that the company would notify Counsel. Accordingly, debtor assumed that he was not required to do anything further. Unfortunately counsel received no notification that debtor completed the course. Moreover, upon debtor learning what happened, and even after the case was closed, he was once again incorrectly told that the certificate was available on the provider's website. After realizing that this was not the case, debtor obtained another copy of the certificate and forwarded it to counsel for filing with the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The motion requests that the case be reopened so that the debtor can file a certificate evidencing that he completed the required course and \"in turn receive a discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The motion does not include a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement utilizing the required form, Official Form B 423 (previously Official Form B 23). Instead, it only includes a certificate issued by BE Adviser, LLC, reciting that the debtor \"completed a course on personal financial management given\n   <em>\n    by internet\n   </em>\n   by\n   <em>\n    BE Adviser, LLC\n   </em>\n   , a provider approved pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20111\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to provide an instructional course concerning personal financial management in the\n   <em>\n    District of Maryland\n   </em>\n   \" on November 14, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without the debtor filing a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement using Official Form B 423 (or the provider of the course filing a certificate of completion of the course), Fed.

For example, a motion to reopen a case can be denied if the defense of laches applies\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n   if for any other reason cause does not exist to grant an enlargement of time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court cannot grant the debtor's motion to reopen his case due to several deficiencies, addressed below.

Failure to File a Statement of Completion of the Required Course Utilizing Official Form B 423\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because no provider filed a certificate of completion of the required course, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(b)(7)(A) required the debtor to file \"a statement of completion of the course, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form[.]\" The debtor's motion to reopen does not include a statement utilizing the required form, Official Form B 423. However, this defect readily could be cured by the debtor's filing one as a supplement to his motion to reopen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to File a Motion to Extend the of the Deadline to File an Official Form B 423\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To obtain a discharge after a case has been closed, the debtor necessarily must obtain an extension of the Rule 1007(c) deadline for filing Official Form B 423 (formerly Form B 23) as required by Rule 1007(b)(7)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dingman\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-10829,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20755279\">\n    2008 WL 755279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

E.D. Va. 2006). The debtor's motion to reopen fails to request leave to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement after expiration of the applicable deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The content of the debtor's motion to reopen suggests that the debtor failed to appreciate that at this juncture, more than two years after the closing of his case, if the debtor seeks to obtain a discharge, he must show cause why the court ought to enlarge the deadline for the debtor to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement. The debtor's motion failed to include an express request to enlarge the time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement and failed to in any way address the issue of cause for allowing the untimely filing of the Rule 1007(B)(7)(A) statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although I could deny the motion to reopen based on the debtor's failure to expressly request an enlargement of the time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dingman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20755279\">\n    2008 WL 755279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, the debtor has already paid the fee for filing a motion to reopen and the debtor would incur another fee if the debtor were to file a new motion to reopen that includes such a request. Therefore, I will allow the debtor 21 days to supplement his motion to reopen by filing with it a motion to enlarge the time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement, addressing the issue of cause for the court to grant that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Generally No Motion is Required Before the Court Grants an Extension of the Deadline for Filing a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) Statement but a Motion is Necessary in Cases of Extreme Delay.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule 1007(c) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In a chapter 7 case, the debtor shall file the statement required by subdivision\n   (b)(7) within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under \u00a7 341 of the Code .... The court may, at any time and in its discretion, enlarge the time to file the statement required by subdivision (b)(7).... Except as provided in \u00a7 1116(3), any extension of time to file schedules, statements, and other documents required under this rule may be granted only on motion for cause shown and on notice to the United States trustee, any committee elected under \u00a7 705 or appointed under \u00a7 1102 of the Code, trustee, examiner, or other party as the court may direct. Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rule 1007(c) thus provides both that the court \"may, at any time and in its discretion, enlarge the time to file the statement required by subdivision (b)(7)\" and that, with an exception of no relevance, \"any extension of time to file schedules, statements,\n   <em>\n    and other documents required under this rule\n   </em>\n   may be granted only on motion for cause shown and on notice to the United States trustee, any committee elected under \u00a7 705 or appointed under \u00a7 1102 of the Code, trustee, examiner, or other party as the court may direct.\" (Emphasis added). A Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement is one of the \"other documents required under [ Rule 1007 ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The rule's authorization for the court \"at any time and in its discretion\" to grant an extension to file a Rule 1007(b)(7) statement in particular is an exception to the general requirement of a motion showing cause for an extension to file other documents. This is made evident by the 2008 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 1007 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The amendment allows the court to enlarge the deadline for the debtor to file the statement of completion. Because no party is harmed by the enlargement, no specific restriction is placed on the court's discretion to enlarge the deadline, even after its expiration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The observation in the Advisory Committee Note \"that no party is harmed by the enlargement\" of time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement obviously addresses the extension of that deadline in an open case, not the extension of that deadline incident to a motion to reopen a case that was closed long ago. Parties\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   be harmed by the enlargement of time to file the Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement if the enlargement is granted after a long time has passed since the closing of the bankruptcy case without the filing of the statement and, therefore, without entry of a discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While a case is open and no discharge has been entered, the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) generally remains in place to protect a debtor against collection of prepetition debts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Creditors holding claims against the debtor thus usually are not free to pursue collection and are not harmed by an extension of the deadline for the debtor to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement. In contrast, when a case has been closed without entry of a discharge and the automatic stay thereby has been terminated, creditors who thereafter pursue collection of debts against the debtor and incur expenses in doing so could be harmed by the court, on the debtor's motion, reopening the case years later to allow the debtor to obtain a discharge:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   despite the creditors' efforts and expenses incurred, the creditors will be barred from collecting their debts by the newly granted discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For these reasons, after a case is closed, and especially where the case has been closed for an extended period of time, if a debtor wishes to reopen his or her case for the purposes of filing a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement in order to receive a discharge, this court, in the exercise of its discretion, requires the debtor to file a motion to reopen that includes a motion to enlarge the deadline for filing a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement that demonstrates grounds for the court to do so. In the case of a motion to reopen filed more than two years after a case was closed, the court would abuse its discretion if the court were not to require the filing of a motion showing cause for an extension of time for the debtor to take the action he or she intends to pursue by way of the motion to reopen. In this case, while the court can grant an enlargement of time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement at any time in its discretion under Rule 1007(c) without requiring the debtor to file a motion to enlarge time, in light of the debtor's extremely long delay in seeking to reopen the case in order to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement and receive a discharge, it would be an abuse of the court's discretion to grant the debtor's motion without requiring the debtor to file of a motion showing cause for granting an extension of time to file the Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In some cases, when a party files a motion to reopen it is inappropriate to simultaneously pursue the matter that the movant seeks to pursue in the reopened case. For example, this is the case when a party moves to reopen a case to file an adversary proceeding complaint or a paper commencing a Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014 contested matter. In such cases, the court should spare other parties from defending against such a matter until the movant shows that the matter has sufficient possible merit to warrant reopening the case and allowing pursuit of the matter in the reopened case. The court acts as a gatekeeper, barring reopening of a case when the matter that the movant seeks to pursue (and sets forth only as a proposed matter to be pursued) plainly would be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, when the matter being pursued is an enlargement of the time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement on a completed Official Form B 423, it makes sense for the debtor to include the request for such relief as part of the motion to reopen instead of requiring the debtor to pursue such relief only after the case is reopened. That is because the issue of reopening necessarily depends on whether cause is shown for enlarging the time to file the required Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement, and the views of other parties on whether such cause exists can assist the court in evaluating the motion to reopen. Thus, the court will deny the debtor's motion to reopen if it is not amended within 21 days to include a motion for an extension of the deadline for filing a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement or a demonstration of sufficient cause to extend the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. For Cause to Exist to Extend the Deadline to File a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) Statement Where the Debtor Failed for Over Two Years to File the Required Statement, the Debtor's Delay Must Be Due to Excusable Neglect.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ordinarily, when an extension of time is sought after a deadline has expired, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(1) provides that the court may, on motion, grant an extension only \"where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\" However, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(3) provides that \"the court may enlarge the time to file the statement required under Rule 1007(b)(7)... only to the extent and under the conditions stated in Rule 1007(c).\" As already addressed, Rule 1007(c) permits the court to enlarge the time to file the Rule 1007(b)(7) statement at any time within the exercise of the court's discretion, without the necessity of a motion to extend the deadline, and without the necessity of a showing of cause for an extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nevertheless, when a debtor seeks to reopen a case and file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement more than two years after the debtor's case was closed, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, will require the debtor to establish cause to reopen the case for that purpose, and require a showing of excusable neglect for the late filing of the Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement in order to establish such cause. A number of decisions have addressed the issue of cause for reopening a case to permit the belated filing of a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement. I will not attempt to canvass all of the various tests, but I note that the tests courts have adopted generally reflect an attempt to fit within an analysis of \"excusable neglect\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the motion to reopen is filed long after the closing of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Supreme Court addressed the issue of \"excusable neglect\" under Rule 9006(b)(1) in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Inv.

Examples of prejudice to creditors include the risk that, after the passage of almost three years, a creditor's address may have changed, and the creditor might therefore not learn of the motion and any ensuing discharge;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the possibility that, relying on the closing of the case without entry of a discharge, creditors have proceeded to pursue collection (or have prepared to pursue collection) and in doing so have incurred costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As to the second\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor, the motion fails to address the debtor's two-year delay in completing the required course (waiting until November 14, 2017, after the case was closed on September 29, 2015) and its potential impact on judicial proceedings. As to the third\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor, in failing to address the two-year delay in taking the required course, the motion offers no reason for that delay and does not address whether it was within the reasonable control of the debtor to take the course in a timely fashion. The motion to reopen addresses only the eight-month delay in filing a motion to reopen after completing the course (filing the motion with the certificate on July 18, 2018, after the debtor completed the required course on November 14, 2017), and not the delay in failing to complete the required course.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to the fourth\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor, in failing to address the two-year delay in taking the required course, the motion fails to address the issue of whether, despite his failure to complete the required course for two years, the debtor proceeded in good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I do not opine as to whether it would be possible for the debtor to obtain an extension of time to file a Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) statement if he were to attempt to correct these deficiencies in his motion, and I leave it to the debtor to decide whether to attempt to persuade the court that an extension is appropriate. Sometimes such a motion is granted even though the debtor delayed in seeking to reopen the case for years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rising\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-50123,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20393416\">\n    2015 WL 393416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Jan. 8, 2015). However, it appears that more frequently such motions are denied when the debtor has delayed for years. The debtor's motion fails to include a recitation of facts establishing excusable neglect, and does not even attempt to set forth cause for allowing compliance with Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) at this late date. However, the debtor has paid the fee for reopening the case, and I will therefore allow the debtor 21 days to file an amended motion to reopen that includes a request to extend the time to file the statement required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(b)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Give Proper Notice to Creditors of the Opportunity to Oppose the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because creditors would be affected by the debtor's receipt of a discharge, they are entitled to be heard regarding the debtor's request, at this late date, to reopen the case and to enlarge the time to comply with Rule 1007(b)(7)(A) in order to file the requisite statement and obtain a discharge. In order for creditors to have an opportunity to be heard, the creditors must receive notice of an opportunity to oppose the debtor's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Local Bankruptcy Rule 9013-1(b)(3) provides the requirements for notices of opportunity to object related to motions commencing contested matters. Ordinarily, LBR 9013-1(b)(3)(E)(ii)(III) dispenses with the requirement of LBR 9013-1(b)(3) notice of the opportunity to oppose a debtor's motion \"to reopen the case in order to file a financial management certificate and obtain issuance of a discharge[.]\" Dispensing with regular LBR 9013-1(b)(3) notice rules makes sense when the motion to reopen is filed before or shortly after the case was\n   closed. When, as here, the motion to reopen is filed years after the case was closed, there is a substantial danger of prejudice to creditors, and they should have the opportunity to be heard on the motion and therefore must receive proper notice. In that circumstance, the court will require that the debtor serve on creditors and other interested parties a notice of the 17-day opportunity to oppose the motion as required by LBR 9013-1(b)(3). Thus, in order for the court to grant the debtor's motion to reopen, the debtor must give proper notice to his creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is thus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ORDERED that the debtor's motion to reopen will be denied unless, within 21 days after the entry of this order, the debtor files an amended motion to reopen that includes a motion to extend the deadline under Fed.
