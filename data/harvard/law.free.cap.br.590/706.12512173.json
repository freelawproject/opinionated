Waites, US Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter comes before the Court for a hearing on the debtor Randy Lee Devey's (\"Debtor\") objection to the proof of claim (\"Claim\") filed by Carrie Jones Peterson and Ryan William Peterson (collectively the \"Petersons\"). The Petersons, through counsel, filed a timely response to the objection (\"Response\"). A hearing on the objection and Response was held before the undersigned, and attended by counsel for the parties and the Chapter 13 Trustee (\"Trustee\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After considering the arguments of counsel and the statements of the Trustee, together with other matters properly before the Court, the Court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, made applicable herein by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052 :\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Debtor commenced the above-captioned Chapter 13 case on November 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Prepetition, Debtor was named as a defendant in a state court lawsuit brought by the Petersons wherein they asserted various state law claims against Debtor, including breach of contract and fraud (\"Litigation\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor filed for bankruptcy before the deadline for filing a responsive\n   pleading in the Litigation. It is undisputed that as of the petition date, the Petersons' claims against Debtor were contingent and unliquidated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3. In his original schedules filed on November 14, 2017, Debtor listed the Petersons as the holders of an unsecured claim in an \"Unknown\" amount, arising from \"unsecured credit,\" as a result of Petersons suing him prepetition for \"breach of contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   4. Debtor filed his proposed Chapter 13 plan on November 14, 2017 (\"Plan\"). The Plan provided that if there were funds available after payment of all other allowed claims, general unsecured creditors with allowed claims would be paid\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   , but the Plan did not contemplate payment of 100% of general unsecured claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   5. The Petersons were served with the Plan, and filed an objection to confirmation of the Plan on December 13, 2017 (\"Peterson Plan Objection\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   6. Debtor amended his schedules on February 13, 2018 to disclose as a previously omitted asset an account receivable in the amount of $7,332.37 owed to him by the Petersons, and to claim an exemption therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   7. The Court held the continued confirmation hearing on March 12, 2018. At this hearing, the Court heard the testimony of the Petersons and Debtor, considered the evidence presented, and the arguments of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   8. On March 13, 2018, the Petersons, through counsel, filed the Claim. In paragraph 8 of the Claim, the Petersons indicated that the basis of the Claim was a \"lawsuit for breach of contract and fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Petersons, however, did not attach a copy of the contract to the Claim, nor is there an explanation for the failure to attach the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Petersons only attached to the Claim the following three (3) items:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a. \"Carrie's Paperwork,\" is a chart containing entries totaling $140,137.30, covering a period commencing October 31, 2015 and ending on May 7, 2017. The document is not signed, notarized, or otherwise attested or verified. There is no reference in the document to the terms of any contract, nor is there an identification of the property to which the entries apply. The document does not appear to be a summary of the terms of the written contract. There are no supporting invoices or other documentation attached. The total appears to include $64,900 in payments to Debtor but lists other payments to third-party merchants and vendors, including references to credit card statements. There are no credits for value received in goods and services or anything that connects those goods and services to the property which is the subject of any contract. The following information is shown but does not appear to be included, credited, or accounted for in the\n   total: \"10/28/16 Randy's Sales Agreement - 2 pages $78,736.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   b. A letter on Patterson Construction Letterhead addressed to the Petersons, \"Ref: Completion of Remodel\" (\"Patterson Letter\"). The Patterson Letter is undated and signed by \"David Summerall,\" but the letter does not identify Mr. Summerall or his capacity with Patterson Construction. The Patterson Letter does not reference Debtor, any contract between Debtor and the Petersons, or identify the property which is the subject of the quote. The Patterson Letter appears to be a quote for work to be performed on an unidentified property for a \"Base bid: of $38,175.00,\" with an estimated project duration of thirty days. There is no indication that the work was performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   c. A document entitled \"Affidavit of Attorney's Fees\" bearing the /s/ signature of the Petersons' then counsel, Naki Richardson-Bax. The document is not sworn, notarized, or offered under penalty of perjury, nor does it qualify as an unsworn declaration under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The document appears to be a form affidavit used by counsel in domestic relations cases, as it cites to two state court divorce cases, and includes language regarding \"the fact that there is no contingency of compensation in a domestic relations case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit at \u00b6 5. The document states that \"in connection with this motion,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Richardson-Bax and \"associated attorneys\" spent \"in excess of 53.9 hours,\" at the rate of $250 per hour, and support staff spent 19.1 hours at the rate of $150 per hour. The document seeks an award of $16,870.32, but does not specify the details of the work or time of performance, including whether the amount was incurred in connection with this bankruptcy case or the Litigation. The document does not disclose what portion of the $16,870.32 total is attributable to professional fees, and what portion is attributable to costs. The document also fails to identify any statute or contract provision entitling the Petersons to recover attorney's fees and does not indicate the existence or nature of any attorney's fee agreement between the Petersons and their counsel (i.e. hourly rate, contingency fee).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (collectively the \"Attachments\"). The Attachments appear to constitute a summary of alleged damages, but do not indicate the terms of any contract between the parties, including the scope of the work, duties and responsibilities of each party (including the duty to supply materials, allowances and overages, contact changes, etc.), consideration, or timing of performance. The Attachments do not indicate any intentional misrepresentations by Debtor or right to rely by the Petersons. The Attachments simply do not provide parties with sufficient information to ascertain the basis and accuracy of the Claim or the existence of the debt represented by the Claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   9. Although the Petersons have admitted in both the Statement of Dispute filed prior to the hearing and in statements at the hearing, through counsel, that the Claim is contingent and unliquidated, this is not indicated on the Claim, which actually purports to state that the Petersons are owed the sum certain amount of $195,182.70. Furthermore, there is no indication in the Claim that it is an estimated claim, although the Petersons, through counsel, stated at the hearing that the amount stated in the Claim represented an estimation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   10. March 14, 2018 was the deadline for all creditors, except governmental units, to file a proof of claim. Five (5) unsecured creditors filed claims totaling $204,143.86. The largest claimant amongst them was the Petersons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   11. On April 11, 2018, this Court entered an Order overruling the Peterson Plan Objection and confirming Debtor's Plan (\"April 11 Order\"). The April 11 Order made the following holdings, which are relevant to this Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. that \u00a7 707(b) is not applicable to Chapter 13 cases. April 11 Order at 5, n.10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. that there was no evidence that Debtor's amendments to his schedules were undertaken for a nefarious purpose. April 11 Order at 10-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   c. that the Plan was filed in good faith, and there was no convincing evidence that Debtor attempted to manipulate or abuse the Bankruptcy Code. April 11 Order at 13-14, and 15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   d. that the Petersons failed to offer any convincing evidence to indicate to the Court that Debtor was dishonest in representing the facts of his case. April 11 Order at 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   e. that the Petersons failed to offer any testimony or evidence regarding their specific issues with Debtor's work, or regarding the nature and scope of the job for which Debtor had been hired.* April 11 Order at 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   f. that Debtor's decision to file bankruptcy and not respond to the Litigation, in and of itself, is not evidence of a lack of good faith. April 11 Order at 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   g. that, although the Petersons had filed the Claim, \"a copy of [the Petersons'] contract with the Debtor is not attached to the Claim or otherwise part of the record ....\"*\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   April 11 Order at 8, n.14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   12. The April 11 Order was not appealed, and is a final Order of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   13. On April 26, 2018, Debtor filed his objection to the Petersons' Claim (\"Objection\"). Therein, Debtor challenged the Claim in the amount of $195,182.70 as unenforceable by asserting that the Claim's balance was not proper or supported, the Claim did not comply with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001, the Petersons, in fact, owed him $7,332.27, and the attorney's fees sought in the Claim have \"no legal basis for recovery.\" In his Objection, Debtor asked that the Claim be disallowed in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   14. On May 29, 2018, the Petersons filed the Response to the Objection to Claim. Therein, the Petersons argued that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   a. their debt \"is not a consumer debt;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   b. a proof of claim is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of validity and amount of the Claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   c. the Objection did not identify any specific grounds as to why the Claim should not be allowed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   d. the debt arose out of Debtor's business dealings, and was based on a pending civil suit which requested damages in excess of $150,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   e. Debtor filed for bankruptcy within two (2) weeks of being served in the Litigation and did not answer the state court complaint. It is because of Debtor's \"purposeful action[ ]\" that the Petersons' damages are unliquidated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   f. Debtor's schedules initially listed the Petersons as creditors with an undisputed claim, but then Debtor amended his schedules and changed his position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   15. Pursuant to Chambers Guidelines, the parties' Joint Statement of Dispute on the Objection to Claim was due at 10:00 a.m. on June 4, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but none was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   16. At or around 2:37 p.m. on June 5, 2018, Ms. Richardson-Bax's partner Arie Bax informed the Court that he would be taking over representation of the Petersons. Mr. Bax advised Chambers that he was seeking a continuance of the June 6 hearing, and that counsel for Debtor and the Trustee consented to his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   17. Due to the lateness of the request, the Court denied the Motion to Continue in advance of the hearing, and required the parties to appear at the June 6 hearing. The Court indicated, however, that it would consider a continuance request at the June 6 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   18. At 2:49 p.m., Debtor filed and served his Statement of Dispute and Stipulation (\"Debtor's Statement of Dispute\"). Therein, Debtor indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   a. The issue to be decided by the Court was whether the Petersons' Claim should be disallowed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   b. Debtor argued that the Claim should be disallowed because:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   i. it does not comply with Rule 3001 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ii. although paragraph 8 of the Claim alleges that the basis for the Claim is \"breach of contract,\" no contract is attached to the Claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   iii. the \"base bid\" and \"Carrie's Paperwork\" are hearsay, and the figures contained therein do not match the dollar amount on the face of the Claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   iv. nothing in the Claim connects the \"base bid\" to Debtor, or evidences a debt owed by Debtor to the Petersons;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   v. \"Carrie's Paperwork\" is insufficient to establish a debt owed by Debtor to the Petersons; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   vi. there is no legal basis for the Petersons to recover their legal fees from Debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Debtor's Statement of Dispute further indicated Debtor's consent to the Court's entry of final orders and judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   22. At 3:20 p.m. on June 5, the Petersons filed and served their Statement of Dispute and Stipulation (\"Petersons' Statement of Dispute\"). Therein the Petersons indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   a. The issues to be decided by the Court were:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   i. Whether the Petersons' Claim should be \"dismissed;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ii. \"Whether this court is the proper jurisdiction to decide the amount of the claim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   b. The Petersons' arguments were narrowed and asserted that:\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   i. \"[T]hey are not a consumer debt as established in Debtor's petition for bankruptcy as the debt to them was not a 'debt incurred by an individual primarily for personal, family, or household purpose.'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ii. \"This debt arose out of Debtor's business dealings. Debtor held himself out as a business owner who was licensed as a general contractor capable of doing major renovation work which he was not in fact licensed to do.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   iii. \"The debt owed to the Petersons is based on a pending civil lawsuit with several causes of action including Breach of Contract, Constructive Fraud, Fraud and Misrepresentation, Breach of Contract Accompanied by Fraudulent Act.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   iv. \"The automatic stay in this case should be lifted so that the parties can litigate in the appropriate court to determine the exact amount of the debt owed to the Petersons.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   c. The Petersons stated an intention to offer six (6) exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Petersons' Statement of Dispute further indicated that they did not intend to present any witnesses, and indicated the Petersons' consent to the Court's entry of final orders and judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   23. A hearing on the Objection was held on June 6, 2018. At the start of the hearing, the Court indicated it would first consider the Petersons' Motion for a Continuance. In response, Mr. Bax indicated that he was withdrawing the motion, and was prepared to proceed with the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thereafter, each attorney presented their client's respective positions and arguments, but neither party presented any witnesses, introduced any evidence, or asked the Court to take judicial notice of any matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   24. At the hearing, the Trustee advised the Court that based on the record, the allowance or disallowance of the Claim would have a material effect on distribution and on both Debtor and the general unsecured creditors who filed timely claims. Specifically, if the Claim is not allowed, the Trustee estimated that general unsecured creditors would receive 100%, and that Debtor would be in a position to complete payments under the confirmed Plan and receive a discharge on a significantly earlier date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   Whether this Court has jurisdiction and final authority to determine the allowance of the Petersons' Claim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   Whether the Petersons are entitled to a jury trial or relief from stay, demands raised at the hearing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n   </strong>\n   Whether the Petersons' Claim should be allowed or disallowed in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Court's Jurisdiction, Final Authority, Request for Jury Trial and Relief from Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In their Statement of Dispute and at the hearing, the Petersons questioned for the first time this Court's jurisdiction to decide the amount of the Claim. Although in other papers filed with the Court, the Petersons indicated that \"they no longer contest having the debts due to them included in debtor's bankruptcy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Petersons argued that they wished to have stay relief so they could return to state court and adjudicate their claims against Debtor before a state court judge and jury. The Petersons argued that a jury trial conducted in state court was the proper avenue for a determination of their Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Claim\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It is well established that the allowance or disallowance of a claim in bankruptcy is a matter of federal law that is left to the bankruptcy court's exclusive exercise of its equitable powers.\n   <em>\n    Katchen v.

In the present case, the Petersons have not filed a motion for relief from stay. The Court also finds that considering \u00a7 362 relief to allow the adjudication of the Claim in state court at such a late stage would cause significant delay and be prejudicial to case administration and to the interests of Debtor and other creditors. Finally, the Petersons made no showing of \"cause\" or other grounds for the stay to be lifted under \u00a7 362(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Consideration of the Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, a proof of claim is deemed allowed unless an objection is filed.

P. 3001(c) clearly requires that if the claim is based on a writing, \"a copy of the writing\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be filed with the claim\" unless the writing has been lost or destroyed, in which case, \"a statement of the circumstances of its loss or destruction shall be filed with the claim.\" Fed.

At the hearing on the Objection to Claim, the Petersons, through counsel, admitted that the Claim is based upon a signed written contract between the parties. However, neither a copy of the contract in question nor a statement explaining its absence was attached to the Claim as required under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c). The Rule is clear and unequivocal in this requirement, and therefore, the Petersons' failure to comply with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001 deprives the claim of\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity under Fed. R. Bankr.

However, in this case, while properly listing the debt due to the pending lawsuit, Debtor listed the debt as \"unknown,\" recognizing its contingent and unliquidated nature, and thus preserved his ability to challenge any claim. In his Objection, Debtor did just that, he challenged the amount and validity of the Claim filed by the Petersons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Second, the\n   <em>\n    Falwell\n   </em>\n   decision addressed a claim based upon an open-ended or revolving consumer credit agreement governed by an earlier version of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Falwell\n   </em>\n   highlighted the different nature of credit card transactions, and in light of the debtor's recognition\n   of the debt at issue, accepted as sufficient supporting documentation a detailed summary of credit transactions (debts and credits) over a 10-month period.\n   <em>\n    Falwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767464\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/434/779/\">\n    434 B.R. at 785-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, the version of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001 applicable in this case is different from that existing at the time of the\n   <em>\n    Falwell\n   </em>\n   decision. In December 2012, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001 was amended to add subsection (c)(3), which, for claims based on an open-ended and revolving consumer credit agreement, specifically allows an alternative to (c)(1)'s requirement to attach the writing that is the basis of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(1) (\"\n   <strong>\n    Except for [an open-ended or revolving consumer credit agreement] claim governed by [subsection (c)(3) ]\n   </strong>\n   , when a claim ... is based on a writing, a copy of the writing shall be filed with the proof of claim.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In this case, the Petersons' Claim appears to be based on a single signed written contract and is not in the nature of an open-ended or revolving consumer credit agreement, and therefore, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Falwell\n   </em>\n   does not apply, nor does the exception to the requirement to attach the contract provided by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(3). In this case, the Petersons failed to comply with the express requirements of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c), the debt is contingent and unliquidated,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Claim does not qualify as an estimated claim under \u00a7 502(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Furthermore, the Attachments to the Claim do not provide the Claim with\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of validity or amount. They are not clear or sufficient to establish the contract, the nature and scope of the relationship between Debtor and the Petersons, or to establish the validity and amount of the debt asserted. They also do not indicate any false representation, right to rely, or other information essential to a fraud claim. They do not provide Debtor, the Trustee, other creditors or the Court with sufficient information to ascertain the basis and accuracy of the Claim. They do not even identify the property to which they apply. Notably, the Petersons did not\n   attach a copy of the complaint they filed in state court or affidavits of the parties that would establish the existence of a debtor-creditor relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Attachments may be intended to summarize damages, they do not support a basis for liability or satisfy the requirements under Fed.

No arguments were advanced by the Petersons that the Attachments or Proposed Exhibits were otherwise admissible evidence, or specifically that any of the documents fell under one of the hearsay exceptions set forth in Fed.

While the Attachments may be construed as a summary of damages, they fail to demonstrate the terms of a contract, assertions of breach, any of the nine elements of fraud, or to establish a direct proximate relationship with Debtor.

The Petersons offered no testimony to explain \"Carrie's Paperwork,\" its contents, or its connection to the contract or Debtor. This Attachment does not establish the scope of work, consideration, duties and responsibilities of each party (including, for instance, the duty to supply materials, allowances and treatment of overages, contract changes, etc.), consideration, or timing of performance. There is no indication of facts which constitute a breach of performance or unjustified excuse for a failure to perform. It is insufficient to indicate that any of the alleged damages were the direct and proximate\n   result of Debtor's actions or that there were any intentional or false representations by Debtor. The Court was not provided with legal authorities or testimony to support the Petersons' assertion that the amounts contained in \"Carrie's Paperwork\" are an accurate calculation of their alleged damages, or represent a debt that is owed by Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Likewise, nothing in the record connects the Patterson Letter to Debtor, the contract or Debtor's alleged fraud.

However, if an amendment will cause undue prejudice to an opposing party, then the court should not allow it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Debtor's Objection to the Claim was filed on April 26, 2018. For more than 40 days prior to the hearing on the Objection, the Petersons knew that Debtor disputed the amount and validity of the Claim, cited the Claim's non-compliance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001, and challenged the authenticity and adequacy of the Attachments, as part of the basis for the Objection. In light of the Objection, the Petersons knew or should have known of the importance of the presentation of the written contract or its terms, and evidence to establish their Claim. Nevertheless, no request or effort to amend the Claim to\n   correct the defects was made prior to the hearing, and no request for discovery or for production of the contract was made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, the Petersons could have appeared at the hearing to testify or present evidence to establish the validity and amount of the Claim, but they did not. In fact, the Petersons' counsel withdrew the request for a continuance at the beginning of the hearing, and did not renew the request thereafter. Instead, only after the failure of proof at the hearing did counsel ask to amend the Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court denied the request at the hearing, finding the request to amend was late, and if allowed, would cause prejudice to Debtor and creditors as well as cause undue delay in the administration of the case. Debtor's reliance on the Petersons' failure to previously amend the Claim was justified in determining which party had the initial burden of proof at the hearing and in his preparation for the contested hearing. Similarly, the Petersons presented no sufficient justification for the failure to amend the Claim earlier, certainly none that would justify shifting the burden and restarting the contested hearing on the Objection and resulting delay to the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   As indicated by the Trustee, allowance or disallowance of the Claim would have a significant impact on the administration of this case, both in terms of the distribution to other unsecured creditors (who will be paid in full if the Claim is disallowed), and on the length of time and the number of payments Debtor will be required to make under the Plan before receiving his discharge. It would be inequitable and prejudicial to Debtor to give the Petersons leave to amend the Claim in the midst of an evidentiary hearing at which the Petersons bore, but failed to meet, their burden of proof. To grant them such relief would enable the Petersons' to circumvent the consequences of their evidentiary failures, and would unfairly and without notice impose a significant procedural and financial burden on Debtor. In filing and prosecuting the Objection at the hearing on the original Claim, Debtor incurred attorney's fees and costs. If the matter was restarted and a further hearing necessary, Debtor, who has relocated to California, would incur additional costs of travel, loss work and income, and attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   To grant the motion at that point would also unfairly excuse the Petersons' ignorance of the requirements of the Bankruptcy Rules and the contents of the Objection of which they had ample notice and substantially affect the timing and distribution to creditors including increasing costs to all parties. For these reasons, the Petersons' oral motion to amend the Claim was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DePugh\n   </em>\n   , 409 B.R. at 101-103 (Denying creditor's motion for leave to amend proof of claim to add missing documentation not attached to original claim, when the request to amend was made both beyond the claims bar date and a month after notice of the debtor's claim objection.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that it has jurisdiction and final authority, and that the Petersons are not entitled to a jury trial in this matter. In addition, the Petersons' request for relief from the automatic stay is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Petersons' Claim was not filed in accordance with Fed. R. Bank. P. 3001, and therefore did not qualify as\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of validity and amount of the debt. The Petersons failed to meet their burden of proving the validity and amount and thus the enforceability of the Claim. To permit the Petersons to amend the Claim at or after the hearing on the Objection would cause undue delay and be unfairly prejudicial to Debtor and creditors of the estate; therefore, the Court denied the Petersons' motion to amend the Claim at the hearing on the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   For all of these reasons, Debtor's Objection is sustained, and the Petersons' Claim is disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The Court indicated a ruling at the hearing.
