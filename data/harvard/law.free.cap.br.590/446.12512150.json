INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is the latest development in the legal saga that began almost a decade ago when Rebecca J. Beiter (\"Plaintiff\") filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since that time, Plaintiff's Chapter 13 plan was confirmed, an order discharging her debts was entered, and her case was closed, only to be reopened for the purpose of filing a class action complaint (the \"Complaint\") against her home mortgage creditor, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (\"Defendant\"). In the original Complaint, Plaintiff asked the Court to hold Defendant in contempt for violating the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") filed June 26, 2018, Plaintiff seeks to hold Defendant in contempt for violating not only the discharge injunction, but also the\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Trustee's Motion to Deem Mortgage Current\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 64) (the \"Deem Mortgage Current Order\"), and sections 541 and 1306 of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, she alleges that Defendant violated Rule 3002.1 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 170) (the \"Motion\") on July 17, 2018. Defendant urges the Court to dismiss each count of the Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed her\n   <em>\n    Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 175) (the \"Response\") on August 7, 2018. Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    Reply Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 176) (the \"Reply\") on August 14, 2018. The Court, having considered the record and the arguments of the parties, issues the following opinion and order granting the Motion with respect to Count One but denying the Motion with respect to the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

S.D. Ohio 2016) (\"A contempt proceeding resulting from a violation of an order or injunction may only be maintained in the court that issued the order or injunction that was violated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges the following facts: On or around May 25, 2004, Plaintiff executed a note and mortgage\n   (the \"Mortgage Loan\") with Defendant. On February 13, 2009, Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. Plaintiff's Chapter 13 plan was confirmed on April 28, 2009, and pursuant to the confirmed plan, payments on the Mortgage Loan were made by \"conduit\" through the Chapter 13 Trustee. In 2011, Defendant admittedly misapplied five of Plaintiff's payments, which resulted in significant errors to her Mortgage Loan account. Defendant also \"increased Plaintiff's monthly mortgage payment without notifying the Court or obtaining permission\" in January, 2014. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 45, ECF No. 162).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 13, 2014, after completion of the plan and upon motion of the Trustee, the Court entered the Deem Mortgage Current Order. The Deem Mortgage Current Order directed Defendant to adjust the Mortgage Loan balance to reflect the balance delineated in the original amortization schedule as of February 2014. It further ordered that \"[a]ny amounts in excess of that balance, including any alleged arrearages, costs, fees or interest\" were discharged. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41, ECF No. 162). On March 13, 2014, the Court entered an order granting Plaintiff a discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With the exception of one payment in July 2014-which Plaintiff eventually made-Plaintiff made all monthly mortgage payments after the Deem Mortgage Current Order and discharge were entered. Since her discharge, Plaintiff has received incorrect and inconsistent mortgage statements from Defendant every month that contained unexplained late fees and indicated Plaintiff is past due on payment of thousands of dollars on her Mortgage Loan despite having made all of her monthly payments. In October 2014, Plaintiff's bankruptcy attorney directly contacted Defendant to advise that Plaintiff had completed her Chapter 13 plan and received a discharge, and to request that her Mortgage Loan account be updated accordingly. As late as July 2015, Plaintiff's mortgage statements indicated that her Mortgage Loan account was still in \"active bankruptcy\" and not current, even though she had completed the plan and received her discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 26, 2018, Plaintiff purportedly on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, filed the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: (1) violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1306 by accumulating funds in her suspense account without notifying her, the trustee, or the Court (\"Count One\"); (2) violated the discharge injunction imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1328 by attempting to collect amounts that had been discharged through bankruptcy (\"Count Two\"); (3) violated the Court's Deem Mortgage Current Order by failing to review the original Mortgage Loan amortization schedule to ensure that the outstanding principal balance reflects the balance reflected on the original amortization schedule (\"Count Three\"); and (4) failed to comply with Rule 3002.1 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure by changing her monthly mortgage payment during the Chapter 13 case without filing a payment change notice (\"PCN\") (\"Count Four\"). Plaintiff alleges that there is a sufficient number of other similarly situated debtors that experienced similar, if not the same, violations by Defendant such that a district-wide class (the \"Class\") and subclass (the \"Deem Current Order Subclass\") may be formed to seek redress for all of the other members as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant \"misapplied 5 payments in 2011 that were correctly sent to the trustee by Plaintiff\" which resulted in the accumulation by Defendant of $236.78 in Plaintiff's suspense account. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 123, 124, ECF No. 162). Plaintiff alleges that the $236.78 was property of the estate and that Defendant failed to notify her, the Court, or the Trustee of the amount in the suspense account, in violation of sections 541 and 1306. Plaintiff asks for injunctive and declaratory relief, sanctions, disgorgement of any unlawful profits, and attorneys' fees. Defendant argues-and the Court agrees-that Count One fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Count One must be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to allege that Defendant violated a \"definite\" and \"specific\" court order.

That section provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The court may issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.

Dismiss 15, ECF No. 170). Indeed, Defendant cites numerous cases interpreting\n   <em>\n    Pertuso\n   </em>\n   as prohibiting a plaintiff from asserting class action contempt claims in an adversary proceeding. But none of the cases Defendant cites are binding on this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, reconsideration of\n   <em>\n    Beiter\n   </em>\n   is not necessary to prevent manifest injustice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant posits that Plaintiff's motion for class certification \"makes clear that she contemplates a scenario in which this Court will be required to formulate\n   individualized relief for each class member\" and that \"the individualized factual inquiry required to assess each of these claims is antithetical to class treatment of these claims.\" (Dec.'s Mot. Dismiss 15, 18, ECF No. 170). Thus, because application of class action certification rules is discretionary in contested matters, Defendant urges that whether this case is allowed to continue as an adversary proceeding is more than just a matter of form over substance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

Furthermore, it would be highly prejudicial to Plaintiff to reverse course at this stage of the case and require her to assert her contempt claims by motion-essentially starting this litigation over-because\n   <em>\n    Beiter\n   </em>\n   was decided over two years ago and the parties have already completed discovery.

The Deem Mortgage Current Order specifically directed Defendant to \"adjust its loan balance to reflect the balance delineated in the original [Mortgage Loan] amortization schedule as of the Final Payment Date.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41, ECF No. 162). It further ordered that \"[a]ny amounts in excess of that balance, including any alleged arrearages, costs, fees or interest\" were discharged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant suggests that the only harm Plaintiff could have suffered from Defendant's violation of the Deem Mortgage Current Order would have been from Defendant's attempts to collect amounts that had been discharged. Thus, Count Three \"amounts to just another way of claiming that [Defendant] violated the discharge injunction, and Plaintiff should not be permitted to pursue separate claims seeking redundant relief.\" (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 13, ECF No. 170). Defendant's argument misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The \"purpose of civil contempt is to coerce an individual to perform an act or to compensate an injured complainant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Co. L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , 552 Fed. App'x. at 413-15. In the instant case, Plaintiff is not pursuing a private cause of action; she is asking the Court to hold Defendant in contempt for violating a court order-i.e. the Deem Mortgage Current Order, which is separate from the discharge injunction. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knowingly and/or willfully failed to comply with this Court's Deem Mortgage Current Order by failing to review her Mortgage Loan amortization schedule to ensure that the principal balance was changed to reflect the principal balance illustrated in the original\n   amortization schedule. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 141, 147, ECF No. 162). Plaintiff asks for sanctions in the form of declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, disgorgement of unlawful profits, and attorneys' fees. Plaintiff has satisfied her burden under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff States a Plausible Claim for Violation of Rule 3002.1 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   One of the benefits afforded debtors who file for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code is the opportunity to cure home mortgage defaults and maintain regular mortgage payments through the plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). The ability to \"cure and maintain\" may allow a debtor to retain his or her home during bankruptcy-which a Chapter 7 debtor may otherwise be unable to do-provided the debtor stays current on Chapter 13 plan payments. Rule 3002.1 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure was adopted to \"aid in the implementation\" of section 1322(b)(5) by imposing certain notice requirements on home mortgage creditors. FED. R. BANKR.

R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(a). The rule provides in relevant part that \"[t]he holder of the claim shall file and serve on the debtor, debtor's counsel, and the trustee a notice of any change in the payment amount, including any change that results from an interest rate or escrow account adjustment, no later than 21 days before a payment in the new amount is due.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(b). If the holder of a secured claim fails to provide such notice, \"the court may, after notice and hearing,\" either prevent the creditor from presenting any omitted information into evidence or \"award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused by the failure.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant changed her monthly mortgage payment in January 2014 without filing a PCN, which resulted in Defendant \"overcharg[ing] Plaintiff's account by $69.81.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 155, 157, ECF No. 162). She also alleges that Defendant \"has a pattern and practice of changing a debtor's payment without filing the necessary notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3002.1(b)\" and asks for an award of sanctions, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 154, 160, ECF No. 162). Defendant admits that it failed to file a PCN in January 2014, but argues that it was precluded from filing pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice's United States Trustee Program. Defendant also argues that the Amended Complaint fails to allege facts that would warrant the relief Plaintiff requests. Both of Defendant's arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Attached to the Amended Complaint is a copy of an order approving a settlement between Defendant and the United States Trustee Program (\"Order Approving Settlement\"), which was entered by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for\n   the Eastern District of Michigan on March 9, 2015. The terms of the settlement required Defendant to change its policies with respect to the filing of PCNs. The settlement describes a \"moratorium\" on Defendant filing PCNs that began on November 19, 2013 and ended on October 31, 2014. The moratorium was in place at the time Defendant failed to file a PCN in Plaintiff's case. But it is not clear whether the Order Approving Settlement prohibited Defendant from filing PCNs during the moratorium because it appears that Defendant agreed to enter into the moratorium, voluntarily,\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to approval of the settlement by the Michigan bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saglioccolo v.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854743\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/226/#p228\">\n    112 F.3d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (6th Cir. 1997) (allegations capable of more than one inference must be construed in favor of the plaintiff). It is also not clear under what circumstances-\n   <em>\n    if any\n   </em>\n   -a court may excuse noncompliance with Rule 3002.1 because application of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure is mandatory in \"every case and proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149734\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/477/71/#p73\">\n    477 B.R. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2012) (\"This Court has found no provision for excusing compliance with a Bankruptcy Rule.\"). Thus, it is not clear whether the Court can excuse Defendant's noncompliance with Rule 3002.1 based on the Order Approving Settlement. The issue need not be decided for now: when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court is not concerned with whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, only whether the complaint states a cause of action that is plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stanziale v.

D. Del. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, Defendant points to Exhibit H, attached to the Amended Complaint, which shows that Defendant refunded $69.81 to Plaintiff's account in July 2015. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim should therefore be dismissed because she suffered no harm as a result of Defendant's failure to file a PCN. Again, the Court disagrees. While a lack of evidence of monetary harm is likely to be a significant barrier to sanctions ultimately being imposed against Defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 3002.1 plainly allows a court to award a debtor \"\n   <em>\n    other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused\n   </em>\n   \" by a mortgage holder's failure to file a PCN. FED. R. BANKR. P. 3002.1(i) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant admittedly failed to file a PCN during Plaintiff's bankruptcy case, which resulted in Defendant overcharging her account. Because the Amended Complaint states a plausible claim for violation of Rule 3002.1, and because Plaintiff asks not only for sanctions but also for attorneys' fees, Defendant's arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Because there is no such right, the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Pertuso\n    </em>\n    were required to file contempt proceedings in the bankruptcy court-the court that issued the discharge injunction-instead of a \"lawsuit such as this one\"-i.e. a lawsuit in the district court.\n    <em>\n     Pertuso\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174552,11172075\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/417/\">\n     233 F.3d at 421\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
