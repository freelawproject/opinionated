The Court heard oral argument on March 20, 2018 and has considered the pleadings, arguments, and supplemental authorities submitted. For the reasons stated herein, the Court denies the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157.

Navient consents to entry of final orders or judgments of the Bankruptcy Court in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 24, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a voluntary Chapter 13 case and plan, using the standard form (Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their bankruptcy schedules, Plaintiffs listed debts to \"Sallie Mae,\" described as \"educational,\" and they also listed debts to \"Great Lakes.\" (Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 1). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs did not check the box in Section V.E. of the plan indicating they had student loans. The Chapter 13 Trustee objected to the plan on several grounds, including the plan \"ma[de] no provision for debtor's non-dischargeable student loan.\" Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs filed an amended Chapter 13 plan (the \"Plan\"). This time, Plaintiffs indicated in Section V.E. of the Plan they had student loans and proposed to treat them \"as an unsecured Class Four claim or as follows: deferred until end of plan.\" Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 25. The Court confirmed the Plan on May 4, 2010. Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A total of nine proofs of claim were filed by Sallie Mae entities and Great Lakes\n   Higher Education Corp. Case No. 09-37480, Claims Register. The Great Lakes claims (Proofs of Claim Nos. 6 and 7) were subsequently assigned to Educational Credit Management Corp. and are based upon Federal Stafford Loans. At least five of the Sallie Mae claims (Proofs of Claim Nos. 25 through 29) were filed by or on behalf of Navient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court entered an Order for Discharge of Plaintiffs on March 3, 2015, granting them a discharge under section 1328(a) of Title 11, United States Code (\"Discharge Order\"). Case No. 09-37480, Docket # 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 30, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to reopen their Chapter 13 case. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed this adversary proceeding against Navient, requesting a declaratory judgment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7001(9) that certain \"Tuition Answer Loans\" held by Navient are not excepted from discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8) and were, therefore, discharged upon entry of the Discharge Order. They also seek damages for alleged willful violations of the discharge injunction by Navient pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 524.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Complaint contains general allegations concerning the history of changes to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8) and Navient's alleged efforts to deceive \"student debtors and subvert the orderly working of the bankruptcy courts ... [by] originating and servicing dischargeable consumer loans and disguising them as non-dischargeable student loans.\" Complaint, \u00b6 1. Navient seeks to strike many of these general allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Section 523(a)(8)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , as originally enacted in 1978, prohibited discharge of federal student loans during the first five years of repayment absent undue hardship but \"[t]hrough a series of amendments, which first lengthened and then eliminated the five-year non-dischargeability time frame, it has become increasingly difficult for debtors to attain discharges of their student loan debts.\" Complaint, \u00b6 9. Prior to BAPCPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Section 523(a)(8) was \"easy to apply because the exception to dischargeability was absolute. If a student loan was issued or guaranteed by the federal government, it was non-dischargeable absent a showing of 'undue hardship.' [However, t]his fueled the belief that all student loans are nondischargeable.\" Complaint, \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2005, the enactment of BAPCPA afforded\n   <em>\n    limited\n   </em>\n   protection to some private educational loan products \"to the extent that such [lending] supplemented and mirrored federal student lending: money lent to eligible students at Title IV accredited schools solely for tuition, room, board, and books ('Qualified Education Loans').\" Complaint, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Navient (formerly known as Sallie Mae or SLM Corporation) was not satisfied with the loan origination volume and restrictions associated with Qualified Educational Loans. Complaint, \u00b6 12. Therefore, Navient created new loan products that are in essence dischargeable consumer loans, deceiving student borrowers by representing to them that \"the Bankruptcy Code prohibited discharge of any loan made to any person for any educational purpose.\" Complaint, \u00b6 16 and\n   \u00b6 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The problem was made worse because Section 523(a)(8) is self-executing, and \"thus its correct application relies on the good faith and honesty of creditors.\" Complaint, \u00b6 14. \"Importantly, the discharge order does not specifically state which loans, if any, are presumptively excepted from discharge. Rather, it states that the order does not discharge some debts, including 'debts for most student loans.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs assert a creditor has the burden to prove its debt is encompassed by Section 523(a)(8) and is presumptively nondischargeable, then the burden shifts to the debtor to show undue hardship. Complaint, \u00b6 15. \"Absent an adversary proceeding, any educational debt not encompassed by section 523(a)(8) is automatically and as a matter of law discharged upon entry of the discharge order. Accordingly, it is left to the creditors to determine whether their particular educational loan is excepted from discharge by Section 523(a)(8) and, where confusion exists, seek clarity from the court. The creditor's good faith and the threat of sanctions are the only checks on compliance with discharge injunctions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiffs also make specific allegations regarding the Tuition Answer Loans held by Navient. Plaintiffs allege the Tuition Answer Program is a direct-to-consumer loan product outside the confines of the financial aid office and in excess of the school's published \"Cost of Attendance\" (\"COA\"). Complaint, \u00b6 17. From 2004-2007, Plaintiffs borrowed $107,467 in six (6) Sallie Mae Tuition Answer Loans. Complaint, \u00b6 20. The total balance of these Tuition Answer Loans is now $245,264, \"despite consistent monthly payments of more than $2,000 for several years.\" Complaint, \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Laura Paige McDaniel attended Lakeland College from 2004 to 2007. Complaint, \u00b6 22. Her COA for qualified tuition and related expenses for each year was: $5,340 in 2004, $10,650 in 2005, $6,450 in 2006, and $6,390 in 2007, as reflected on Tuition Statements issued by Lakeland College to Ms. McDaniel attached to the Complaint as Exhibit A. Complaint, \u00b6 23. Ms. McDaniel borrowed the COA in the form of federal student loans, as reflected on Federal Stafford Loan documentation attached to the Complaint as Exhibit C. Complaint, \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs borrowed an additional $107,467 through the Tuition Answer Loans, \"made outside the financial aid office and [not] for qualified education expenses.\" Complaint, \u00b6 25. Attached as Exhibit B to the Complaint are copies of loan applications and promissory notes for the Tuition Answer Loans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tuition Answer Loans were not made solely for the COA and accordingly, were not \"qualified education loans\" as defined in Section \u00a7 523(a)(8)(B). Complaint, \u00b6 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Debtors listed the Tuition Answer Loans on their Bankruptcy Schedule F. Complaint, \u00b6 27. Debtors made payments totaling $26,782 on the Tuition Answer Loans\n   during their Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Complaint, \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Navient was notified of the Discharge Order. Complaint, \u00b6 30. Instead of charging the Tuition Answer Loans off, Navient demanded payments in violation of the Discharge Order and the Bankruptcy Code. Complaint, \u00b6 32. Plaintiffs allege \"owing to [Navient's] tactics, [P]laintiffs have repaid $37,460 on these discharged debts. These payments were not made 'voluntarily' but were made solely based on Defendant Navient's material misrepresentations regarding the legal status and character of the Tuition Answer Loans.\" Complaint, \u00b6 33. Navient's \"abusive, deceptive and harassing collection efforts\" after entry of the Discharge Order \"were made knowingly and willfully in violation of this Court's discharge orders and must be sanctioned.\" Complaint, \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. NAVIENT'S MOTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Navient requests dismissal of the Complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) ( Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7012(b) ). Navient also moves to strike certain allegations as immaterial and impertinent matter under Fed.R.Civ.P.12(f) (Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7012(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Navient asserts the confirmed Plan distinguished the Tuition Answer Loans from Plaintiffs' other dischargeable unsecured debts in Class Four and treated them \"as non-dischargeable.\" Motion, p.16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Motion, p.17 (\"[i]nstead of filing an adversary proceeding to seek a discharge of their loans, Debtors amended their [P]lan to expressly provide that their [Tuition Answer] Loans would\n   <em>\n    not be discharged\n   </em>\n   along with their other unsecured claims\") (emphasis in original). Accordingly, Navient argues principles of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   prohibit Plaintiffs from reversing their earlier position taken in the Plan, in light of the finality of the Plan confirmation order and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Alternatively, Navient argues dismissal is warranted because the Complaint, on its face, establishes the Tuition Answer Loans are excepted from discharge as \"obligation[s] to repay funds received as an educational benefit\" under Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii). Through the Tuition Answer Loans, Ms. McDaniel \"received the funds that allowed [her] to attend Lakeland College. Indeed, [Plaintiffs] certified to Navient 'all of the loan proceeds ... are to pay expenses directly related to attending' Lakeland College.\" Motion, p.19 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Exhibit B, pp.6, 31, 38 of 40). Then, when they filed bankruptcy, Plaintiffs scheduled the debt as \"educational\" in nature. Motion, p.19. \"By enabling Ms. McDaniel to enroll in and attend college and support her personal decision to improve her life through higher education, the loans conferred 'educational benefits' on her and are therefore excepted from discharge in bankruptcy.\" Motion, p.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In support, Navient cites cases holding private student loans are \"obligation[s] to repay funds received as an educational benefit\" under Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii). Because the \"Debtors do not, and cannot, allege that they used their [Tuition Answer] Loans for anything but educational purposes, nothing in Debtors' Complaint allows them to avoid the same result.\" Motion, pp.22-23. Navient contends the cases that hold otherwise are badly reasoned, and those courts misapply the principles of statutory interpretation they invoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Since the Tuition Answer Loans were not discharged, Navient asserts there can be no violation of the discharge injunction. In any case, Navient argues this claim\n   should be dismissed because the discharge injunction is enforceable only through contempt proceedings and there is no private right of action for violation of the discharge injunction. Since Plaintiffs' claim must be construed as a claim for contempt, the order under which they seek contempt must be \"clear and specific.\" The Discharge Order is not \"clear and specific\" but rather, provides most student loans are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   dischargeable. Motion, p.35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Navient also moves to strike paragraph 1 and paragraphs 9 through 19 of the Complaint because the allegations set forth in these twelve paragraphs constitute a \"superfluous attack on [Navient's] character, inappropriate for a short and plain statement of the claim.\" Motion, p.37 (citations omitted). Navient contends the overblown and non-specific allegations in these paragraphs malign Navient, refer to \"pervasive, systemic wrongdoing\" and have no bearing on any issues in this case. Motion, p.38. Plaintiffs' \"allegations of nonspecific fraud perpetrated by unnamed actors using unspecified means against unnamed victims are inflammatory, unnecessary, and irrelevant\", and the Court should strike them as either a superfluous attack on character, or deficiently pleaded fraud claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

In other words, Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) catches instances of nondischargeability that other subparts of 523(a)(8) might miss, \"reinforc[ing] the broad scope of the discharge exception for student loans.\" Motion, p.26. Unlike other subsections, Navient points out that Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) requires funds to be \"received,\" so \"both a private bar-study loan and a judgment debt to a co-signor on a defaulted government-backed university loan that the co-signor paid in full would be exempt from discharge under 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) but not \u00a7 523(a)(8)(A)(i) or (B), respectively.\" Motion, pp.25-26. The Court is not persuaded by this somewhat circular argument. If the legislature intended Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) to address\n   potential liability to a co-signor, it could have done so explicitly; for example, Section 523 expressly includes separate categories of nondischargeable debt \"incurred to pay a tax to the United States that would be nondischargeable pursuant to paragraph (1)\" and \"incurred to pay a tax to a governmental unit, other than the United States, that would be nondischargeable under paragraph (1).\" 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(14), (14A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, based upon the plain language of the statute, this Court embraces the trending narrower view of Section 523(a)(8)(A)(ii) espoused in\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Crocker v.

However, that selfsame sparsity of legislative history regarding the addition of \"educational benefit\" to Section 523(a)(8) suggests the legislature did not intend to extensively expand nondischargeability\n   to private educational loans.

That neither party sought to determine the dischargeability of the Tuition Answer Loans until now does not alter whether or not the debts were discharged under Section 523(a)(8) at the time the Discharge Order was entered; thereafter they both proceeded at their own risk. Any ambiguity in the law, or uncertainty as to the injunction's applicability to the Tuition Answer Loans, is relevant to the inquiry as to whether any contempt violation, if proven, was willful. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss the claim on that basis. Whether or not the evidence at trial will support the claim is a matter for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
