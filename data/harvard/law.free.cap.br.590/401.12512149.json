The Agreement between Olivia and her father\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These adversary proceedings arise out of a pre-petition agreement (the \"Agreement\") entered into between the Plaintiff Norman Wise (\"Norman\") and the Defendant Debtor Olivia Wise (\"Olivia\"), Norman's daughter, regarding property located at 137 South Wilson Avenue, Royal Oak, Michigan 48067 (the \"South Wilson Avenue Property\"), and property located at 30515 Fairfax, Southfield, MI 48076 (the \"Fairfax Street Property\"). The Agreement was fully memorialized (according to Norman) or partially memorialized (according to Olivia) in an e-mail exchange between the parties on February 19, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that day, Olivia sent the following e-mail to Norman:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   From: Olivia Wise [mailto:omwise89@gmail.com]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Sent: Friday, February 19, 2016 9:53 AM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   To: Norman H.

The idea in entering into the Agreement was to eliminate the tax liability Norman otherwise would incur from a gain on the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property, while providing Olivia with financial support, health insurance, and a means to purchase the Fairfax Street Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Norman hoped to avoid tax liability on the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property by transferring the property to Olivia before selling it. As a result, Norman would avoid any tax liability, and Olivia would be able to avoid any tax liability by taking advantage of a homeowner's exclusion on the gain of up to $250,000, contained in \u00a7 121 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20121\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The general rule under that statute, subject to certain qualifications and limited to $250,000 for a single individual,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Gross income shall not include gain from the sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20121\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When the parties entered into the Agreement, Olivia and her two children were already living at the Fairfax Street Property. Norman had purchased that property primarily so that Olivia and her family could live in the Birmingham School District, a school district that Olivia and Norman believed would best serve the educational needs of Olivia's children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Olivia previously had lived at the South Wilson Avenue Property with her domestic partner and Olivia's children. Norman had purchased the South Wilson Avenue Property on or about September 9, 2011, for Olivia and her family to live in when they moved from California to Michigan. Norman purchased that property primarily because it was in the Royal Oak School District; a school district that Olivia wanted her children to attend at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia made no contribution to the purchase of the South Wilson Avenue Property, and lived in that property rent-free. Norman \"paid all [of] the property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums for the [South\n   Wilson Avenue Property]\" and \"also paid for approximately $50,000 in improvements to the property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Norman also paid health insurance premiums for Olivia and the children and some of Olivia's living expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On October 14, 2013, Olivia and her domestic partner separated and Olivia moved out of the South Wilson Avenue Property with her children. After Norman evicted Olivia's domestic partner from the South Wilson Avenue Property, Olivia and her children moved back into that property and lived there until June 2015, when they left permanently and moved into the Fairfax Street Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the spring of 2016, after making some renovations to the South Wilson Avenue Property, Norman listed it for sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Norman had purchased the Property for approximately $250,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Norman received an offer for over $400,000 for the property, it was clear that he stood to make a substantial gain on the sale of it. Norman's certified public accountant, Gary Davison of Davison and Associates, who had a Master's Degree in taxation, suggested that Norman and Olivia engage in the transactions detailed in the Agreement, as a way of eliminating Norman's tax liability for the gain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an e-mail Norman sent to Gary Davison and Olivia on February 18, 2016, the day before Olivia and Norman entered into the Agreement, Norman expressed his understanding of the transactions that he and Olivia would have to undertake in order for Norman to avoid a substantial tax liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   On Thursday, February 18, 2016, Norman H.

You are not a speculative investor in residential property so you would not have acquired the home but for her use. Accordingly, the house was purchased for her but you had the deed in your name without benefitting from owning the home.

LAWFUL OWNERS:\n   </strong>\n   THAT they are the true and lawful owners in fee of the property described in Commitment File No. 90001441.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    NO INTERVENING MORTGAGES/LIENS:\n   </strong>\n   THAT no other persons have any interest, in equity or otherwise, in and to property as described in Commitment File No. 90001441 and the deponents are not holding title for another in fulfillment of any trust or agreement, or for the benefit of any other person, firm, or corporation....\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   At no time during the closing did Olivia express any reservations about proceeding with the closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked why she went through with the closing despite her private reservations, Olivia gave two reasons: (1) she was concerned for the buyers; and (2) she \"figured [that] since [Norman] said everything would be okay, that we would be able to sit down and work through an agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Olivia's receipt and retention of the sale proceeds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After the closing, Norman was in Florida to conduct some business, and Olivia had agreed to meet him when he returned in a couple of days, so that Olivia could pay Norman $250,000 of the proceeds she received from the sale, and then purchase the Fairfax Street Property from him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 11, 2016, the day after the closing, Olivia received proceeds in the amount of\n   $371,789.38 from the sale of the South Avenue Property (the \"Proceeds\"), by a wire transfer into her account with Vibe Credit Union.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Two or three days after the closing according to Norman, or about a week after the closing according to Olivia, when Norman returned to Michigan and tried to collect $250,000 of the Proceeds, Olivia informed him that she had concerns about her tax liability and that he would have to meet with Chelsea Rebeck (\"Rebeck\"), an attorney she had hired, before she would give him any of the Proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to being an attorney, Rebeck also is a CPA and has a Masters Degree in tax law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Olivia testified at trial that when she told Norman that he would have to speak to Rebeck, which, according to her was on May 17, 2016, she believed that she was entitled to all of the Proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   She reasoned that if she was responsible for the tax on the capital gain from the sale, then all of the Proceeds were hers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   After Olivia's refusal to give Norman any of the Proceeds, Norman contacted his attorney Jim DeLine (\"DeLine\"), who then contacted Rebeck and made repeated demands, over roughly a 30-day period, for surrender of the Proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rebeck represented to DeLine that there were \"unexplained 'tax issues' \" and although she promised to provide Norman with \" 'calculations related to the [P]roceeds,' \" she never did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Rebeck scheduled a meeting with DeLine and others for May 24, 2016, but DeLine refused to attend any meeting with Rebeck unless and until Norman received $250,000 of the Proceeds. Olivia refused to give Norman any portion of the Proceeds, so no meeting between the parties occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Norman's state court lawsuit against Olivia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On July 27, 2016, after about a month of demands from DeLine to Rebeck to surrender $250,000 of the Proceeds, with Olivia still refusing to give Norman any of the Proceeds, Norman filed a civil lawsuit against Olivia in Oakland County, Michigan Circuit Court (the \"State Court Lawsuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint in the State Court Lawsuit contained ten counts and sought the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   A. An order of specific performance requiring [Olivia] to surrender the Proceeds to Plaintiff immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   B. An order preventing [Olivia] from spending, transferring, encumbering,\n   and/or disposing of any of the Proceeds during the pendency of this case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   C. A money judgment against [Olivia] in the amount of $371,819.38;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   D. Pursuant to [ Mich. Comp.

A full, formal accounting of the Proceeds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   F. Rescission or reformation of the Agreement to prevent a windfall to [Olivia] and return [Norman] to the status quo before the Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   G. An award of costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   H. Any other legal or equitable relief that the Court deems just and proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Eventually, on February 1, 2017, the court in the State Court Lawsuit entered an order (the \"Constructive Trust Order\") granting a motion by Norman for discovery sanctions against Olivia, based on Olivia's violation of a January 24, 2017 order compelling discovery. The Constructive Trust Order stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   IT IS ORDERED:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   A. [Norman's] motion is granted for the reasons stated on the record and in the motion.

The sale proceeds in the amount of $371,819.38 received by [Olivia] from the sale of [the] South Wilson Avenue [Property] are hereby held in a constructive trust, and [Olivia] shall, within two days after entry of this order, pay all such [P]roceeds into the court pending the final disposition of this action; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   C. [Norman] is awarded costs, including reasonable attorney fees, in the amount of $1,000, against [Olivia] and [Olivia's] attorney of record, Chelsea M.

The Default Judgment provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   IT IS ORDERED:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A. [Norman's] motion is granted for the reasons stated in the motion and on the record. A judgment on [Norman's] complaint (including count 9 - fraud) is entered in favor of Norman H. Wise against Olivia M. Wise in the amount of $371,819.38. The judgment shall accrue interest at the statutory rate until paid in full;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   B. Olivia M. Wise and all persons in active concert or participation with her are restrained and enjoined from directly or indirectly selling, liquidating, assigning, transferring, converting, loaning, encumbering, pledging, dissipating, concealing, spending, withdrawing, or otherwise disposing of any money, funds, or proceeds received from the sale of the real property located at 137 South Wilson Avenue, Royal Oak, Michigan; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   C. In addition to the costs previously awarded to [Norman, Norman] is awarded costs, including reasonable attorney fees, in the amount of $750 against [Olivia] and [Olivia's] attorney of record, Chelsea M. Rebeck, jointly and severally, for failing to appear at [Olivia's] deposition\n   and failing to attend the hearing on this motion. All costs shall be paid within 7 days after entry of this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   This order resolves the last pending claim and closes the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The other lawsuits against Olivia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In addition to the State Court Lawsuit, Olivia was a defendant in three other lawsuits filed after the closing of the South Wilson Avenue Property: (1) an eviction proceeding, by which Norman evicted her from the Fairfax Street Property; (2) a lawsuit by Olivia's former domestic partner for custody of her children (purportedly prosecuted with the aid and support of Norman) (the \"Custody Lawsuit\"); and (3) a lawsuit in which Norman sought grandparenting visitation rights (\"Grandparenting Visitation Lawsuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia retained attorneys, to act as co-counsel with Rebeck, to defend her in these lawsuits, and became responsible for attorney fees and costs as a result. As detailed later in this opinion, Olivia used a significant portion of the Proceeds for attorney retainers and for payment of attorney fees and expenses related to the lawsuits against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Olivia's transfers of the Proceeds in July and August of 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In July and August 2016, Olivia made three major transfers of the Proceeds. These three transfers resulted in a total of $330,000 of the Proceeds being withdrawn from Olivia's Vibe Credit Union Account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Olivia's purchase of the minivan with some of the Proceeds, and titling of it jointly with her mother\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   First, Olivia made transfers in order to buy a 2016 Chrysler Town and County minivan (the \"Minivan\"). On July 29, 2016, Olivia withdrew $15,000 of the Proceeds from her Vibe Credit Union Account and deposited the funds into another account with Vibe Credit Union, to serve as security for a loan Vibe Credit Union made to her to help her purchase the Minivan. That same day, Olivia also obtained a cashier's check totaling $33,000 out of the Proceeds, to help fund her purchase of the Minivan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Although Olivia bought the Minivan for herself, she had it titled jointly in both her name and her mother's name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her explanation for this joint titling of the Minivan, even though her mother had not contributed any funds to the purchase of the Minivan, varied at different times. Olivia variously testified (1) that she did it for estate planning purposes; (2) that she did it because she wasn't able to get car insurance herself; and (3) that \"given how tenuous things had become with [her] father, [she] wanted to have her [mother] on the title as well.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked to explain this last reason, Olivia stated that \"[i]f [she] were to die it would then easily transfer to her [mother].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Olivia's transfer of $32,500 to her mother\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In August 2016, Olivia transferred a total of $32,500 of the Proceeds to her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Olivia testified that this transfer was to pay for making improvements to her mother's home, so that the basement would be suitable for Olivia and her children to live in; for pre-paid rent; and for three-quarters of the household living expenses. Olivia's transfers were made in two payments - $7,500 to her mother on August 3, 2016, and $25,000 to her mother on August 26, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no initial or later allocation of the $32,500 among the three cost items which the money allegedly was intended to cover. Rather, \"[i]t was just an arbitrary amount.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia testified: \"We did not have a specific amount that we agreed on. It was just an amount that she and I agreed on.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia and her children lived in her mother's basement for about nine months (from September or October 2016 to May 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Olivia testified that she was not expecting to get any money back from the portion of the Proceeds she transferred to her mother. But in December 2016, Olivia's mother gave her $2,500 back in cash or checks, because Olivia had \"exhausted the remaining amount of money.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Olivia asked her mother for an accounting of how the $32,500 had been spent. Olivia asked for this \"several times throughout all of 2016 as well as 2017,\" and possibly even after her bankruptcy case had been filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia testified that she asked her mother for an accounting \"probably more than three times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although her mother promised to provide an accounting, her she never did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Olivia's transfer of $250,000 of the Proceeds to Rebeck's law firm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   On August 10, 2016, Olivia transferred $250,000 of the Proceeds to Rebeck's law firm, to be held in the Rebeck law firm's client trust account under a revised Fee Agreement entered into on July 5, 2016 by Olivia and Rebeck (the \"Revised Fee Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Revised Fee Agreement was the second fee agreement Olivia had entered into with Rebeck. The first fee agreement was entered on May 23, 2016. Paragraph 2 of that first agreement stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   2. Compensation and Fees. Client understands that the attorney will be compensated on an hourly or unit charge basis. The hourly/\"unit fee\" is computed as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   a. Attorney Fees. The initial payment of $1,000.00 constitutes an agreed non-refundable advance fee, which shall be payable before any services are rendered by Attorney. The\n   Client will be billed in accordance with the hourly rate/costs set forth below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   b. Hourly rate: Attorney $450.00 Legal Assistants $250.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Paragraph 2 of the Revised Fee Agreement provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   2. Compensation and Fees. Client understands that the attorney will be compensated on an hourly or unit charge basis. The hourly/\"unit fee\" is computed as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   a. Attorney Fees. Client shall deposit an additional retainer amount of $250,000.00 to be deposited in Attorney's IOLTA account.\n   <strong>\n    This amount shall be disbursed as directed by Client for the following uses: Periodic billing by Attorney for representation, payment of tax liability- currently unknown amount, and as directed by client, in writing.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   b. Hourly rate: Attorney $450.00 Legal Assistants $250.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Rebeck testified that \"[she] created [the Revised Fee Agreement] because Olivia had asked to put the [$250,000] in the IOLTA account and so [she] wanted something prepared to reflect that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rebeck testified further as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Q. This new agreement was created because Olivia requested that she wanted to put money into your IOLTA account?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   A. Yes, I created the agreement because I needed something to document the funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Q. And you had concerns about engaging in that transaction without that documentation, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   A. I didn't have concerns. I just -- it's something that I would typically do\n   <strong>\n    if I was holding money for someone\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   When asked why she had transferred a quarter of a million dollars to Rebeck's law firm on August 10, 2016, Olivia testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   That was when we finally were able to get all of the information together for me to transfer it to [Rebeck]. She had been traveling in the month of July, I had been traveling in the month of July. We finally got the transfer information to send her retainer that I had agreed to send her in July.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    The $250,000 was the amount of money that my father had hoped to receive right away\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    And I felt\n   </strong>\n   given the eviction that\n   <strong>\n    that money should be secured\n   </strong>\n   so that it could be used for taxes as well as for the lawsuit and hopefully the remainder would go to my father after we addressed all the tax issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Eventually, much of the $250,000 Olivia transferred to Rebeck's law firm was disbursed, at Olivia's direction, to pay Olivia's ongoing legal fees and expenses owed to Rebeck and other attorneys Olivia had hired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia testified: \"Ms. Rebeck and I would be sitting with the attorney and I would instruct her to cut a check to the attorney that I was engaging in for whatever case that I was being sued at the moment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rebeck also gave Olivia money\n   in the form of cash or checks from the Proceeds she was holding, whenever Olivia requested such money for her discretionary spending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   From December 2016 through April 2017, at Olivia's direction, Rebeck disbursed to Olivia, or in one case, spent for a personal item for Olivia, the following amounts, totaling $26,104.00, out of the $250,000 of the Proceeds that Olivia had transferred to Rebeck:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-167\">Date Amount \u2022 8/9/2016 $ 1,100.00 (reimbursement for laptop Rebeck purchased for Olivia) \u2022 12/22/2016 $ 204.00 \u2022 1/11/2017 $10,000.00 \u2022 1/13/2017 $ 2,000.00 \u2022 1/12/2017 $ 300.00 \u2022 2/27/2017 $ 1,500.00 \u2022 3/1/2017 $ 3,000.00 \u2022 3/3/2017 $ 2,000.00 \u2022 3/30/2017 $ 3,000.00 \u2022 4/11/2017 $ 3,000.00<sup>70</sup></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note\n   </strong>\n   : The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   When Rebeck was asked why she gave Olivia back some of the $250,000 in Proceeds that Olivia had transferred into the Rebeck law firm's trust account, Rebeck responded: \"Because [Olivia] requested that I do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

Olivia and Rebeck also attended the hearing. DeLine appeared at the hearing on behalf of Norman. Olivia's position at the hearing was that the South Wilson Avenue Property was a gift to her from her father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   DeLine argued that Olivia's own e-mail of February 19, 2016, which Olivia had failed to mention in her affidavit in support of her argument that she had a \"meritorious defense\" to the State Court Lawsuit, \"dispell[ed] any notion that [the South Wilson\n   Avenue Property] was ever a gift.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   DeLine argued further that Olivia had not shown either \"good cause\" to set aside the Default Judgment or any meritorious defense to Norman's claims in the State Court Lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   During the hearing the state court asked Allen where the Proceeds were.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exchange followed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   MS.

REBECK: Your Honor, Olivia did transfer some money to my trust account to pay for her legal fees for this case, as well as the custody cases, and there's not very much left, and I don't know how long the custody cases are gonna drag on, but the [P]roceeds were not transferred to me. She ... paid a retainer to me for all of the various cases and I've been paying the other attorneys out of my trust account at this point, so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   MS.

To this day I have no knowledge of where or what really happened with the [P]roceeds....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   MR. DELINE: Your Honor, in my conversation with Ms. Allen I asked her where is the [P]roceeds, she said \"They are - - to my knowledge they are in Ms. Rebeck's trust account.\" That's exactly what she told me on the telephone. So, today is the first time that I'm hearing that the [P]roceeds aren't there. We still don't know where they are, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   And really, your Honor, this case has been pending for months and months.

No discovery responses, ... no information as to where the money went, no documents, no information about what her defenses were to the answer to the complaint to support her affirmative defenses. Five months of time has elapsed and now the money has apparently disappeared.

The state court found that Olivia had not established good cause to set aside the Default Judgment and that there was nothing in Olivia's affidavit filed in support of her motion \"that would establish a meritorious defense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   A creditor's examination was scheduled for March 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   At that time, the Custody Lawsuit and the Grandparenting Visitation Lawsuit were still pending against Olivia. And Olivia was concerned about how the information\n   obtained in any creditor's examination would impact those lawsuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Olivia's decision to file bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   After the March 15, 2017 hearing, and after asking her attorneys whether the $371,819.38 debt arising out of the Default Judgment was a dischargeable debt, Olivia decided to file a bankruptcy case. According to Olivia, the primary reason for filing bankruptcy was to avoid having to appear at the creditor's examination, which she feared would be detrimental to her in the other pending lawsuits against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia testified that she also wanted to get a discharge of the debt she owed to her father under the Default Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Olivia's first Chapter 7 case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   On March 16, 2017, Olivia filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7, Case No. 17-43735.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was Olivia's first bankruptcy case. Olivia was represented by attorney Bert Whitehead, IV (\"Whitehead\") in filing the case. The case was filed on an emergency basis, so that Olivia would not have to appear at the creditor's examination scheduled for that same day. No schedules or statement of financial affairs were filed in Olivia's first bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   This Court dismissed Olivia's first bankruptcy case on March 27, 2017, because Olivia was ineligible to be a debtor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). That section generally requires that a debtor obtain a credit counseling briefing within 180 days before or on the date of filing a bankruptcy petition. Olivia had obtained a credit counseling briefing only after the petition date, on March 23, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    10. Olivia's second bankruptcy case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   On April 14, 2017, Olivia filed her second and currently pending Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, again through attorney Whitehead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the time Olivia filed her second case, both the Custody Case and the Grandparenting Visitation Lawsuit had been resolved in her favor, so \"the only reason left [for Olivia to file her second bankruptcy case was] to address the $371,000 [D]efault [J]udgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the time Olivia filed her second case, there was just under $34,000 of the Proceeds remaining in Rebeck's trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    11. The many false statements in Olivia's bankruptcy schedules and statement of financial affairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Whitehead had no direct contact with Olivia before filing her first or second bankruptcy cases. Olivia worked with Rebeck's administrative staff, who were not attorneys, using Rebeck's bankruptcy software, to prepare a first draft of the bankruptcy schedules and statement of financial affairs. Olivia provided the information to Rebeck's staff to include in the bankruptcy\n   papers, and worked with them to input that information into the bankruptcy software for the first draft of the papers. Whitehead then reviewed the draft, asked questions by e-mail, and suggested revisions to the draft, also by e-mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   At the time Whitehead was reviewing the draft bankruptcy papers for Olivia's second bankruptcy case, he did not know any of the following things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had entered into the Agreement with Norman regarding the transfer and sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property and the purchase of the Fairfax Street Property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   \u2022 that the South Wilson Avenue Property had been transferred to Olivia, within one year before Olivia filed her second bankruptcy case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had then sold the South Wilson Avenue Property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had received $371,789.38 in Proceeds from the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had the Proceeds deposited into her account at Vibe Credit Union;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia purchased the Minivan with a portion of the Proceeds and included her mother as co-owner on the title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had transferred $32,500 of the Proceeds to her mother;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had transferred $250,000 of the Proceeds to Rebeck to hold for her in Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   \u2022 that Rebeck had later transferred some of the $250,000 back to Olivia;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had directed Rebeck to pay other attorneys tens of thousands of dollars out of the Proceeds held in Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   \u2022 that Rebeck still had just under $34,000 remaining from the Proceeds in her law firm's IOLTA account; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   \u2022 that Olivia had an interest in the remaining funds from the Proceeds that Rebeck was holding for her in Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Whitehead did not know any of these facts because neither Olivia, nor Rebeck, nor any of Rebeck's staff had informed Whitehead of these facts. For that reason, Whitehead prepared and filed schedules and a statement of financial affairs (\"SOFA\"), in Olivia's second bankruptcy case, in which none of these facts were disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Olivia filed the original schedules and SOFA with the petition in her second bankruptcy case, on April 14, 2017. Olivia reviewed her original schedules and SOFA before they were filed, and authorized her attorney to electronically sign her name to them, under penalty of perjury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so doing, Olivia declared, under penalty of perjury, that she had read the schedules and the SOFA, that the schedules \"are true and correct,\" and that the answers in the SOFA \"are true and correct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Despite this, the schedules and SOFA were riddled with false statements. Among other things, they did not disclose any information regarding the transfer to Olivia, and sale by her, of the South Wilson Avenue Property; Olivia's transfers of\n   most of the Proceeds, including the $250,000 transfer to the Rebeck law firm, the $32,500 in transfers to Olivia's mother, or the total of $48,000 in transfers to buy the Minivan; or Olivia's interest in the remaining Proceeds in Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The schedules and SOFA also did not disclose that Olivia had transferred a one-half interest in the Minivan to her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Following are specific details of Olivia's many false statements. The numbering here is for ease of reference later in this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   1. SOFA Question 18 asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    Within 2 years before you filed for bankruptcy, did you sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any property to anyone, other than property transferred in the ordinary course of your business or financial affairs?\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Include both outright transfers and transfers made as security (such as the granting of a security interest or mortgage on your property). Do not include gifts and transfers that you have already listed on this statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   In response to Question 18, Olivia stated \"No.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   This answer was false because it failed to disclose the many transfers detailed above. For example, this answer failed to disclose that less than a year before filing bankruptcy, on May 10, 2016, Olivia sold and transferred the South Wilson Avenue Property. And such sale and transfer certainly was not in the ordinary course of Olivia's business or financial affairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   2. In response to Question 4 of her original SOFA, Olivia listed Gross income of $9,000 from January 1 of the current year (2017) until the date she filed for bankruptcy (April 14, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was false; Olivia, in fact, had $0.00 income during this time period, as is reflected in an amended SOFA she filed on June 20, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   3. In response to Question 5 of her original SOFA, which asked: \"\n   <strong>\n    Did you receive any other income during this year or the two previous calendar years?\n   </strong>\n   ,\" Olivia failed to disclose the $371,819.38 in Proceeds from the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   This made Olivia's answer to Question 5 false. And in the amended SOFA Olivia filed on June 20, 2007, Olivia listed the Proceeds under this section, in an \"[u]nknown\" amount, and stated that it was \"[u]ndetetermined whether this was income.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   4. In Schedule A/B, Question 3.1 of the original schedules, in response to the question \"\n   <strong>\n    Who has an interest in the property [listed in Question 3 (the Minivan) ]?\n   </strong>\n   ,\" Olivia stated that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   she had an interest in the Minivan, by checking the box in front of \"Debtor 1 only.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was false, because the Minivan was titled jointly in the names of both Olivia and her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   5. Olivia did not disclose in her original Schedule A/B that she had an interest in just under $34,000 in cash remaining\n   from the Proceeds, which Rebeck was still holding for her in Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account. This should have been disclosed in Olivia's responses to Questions 25, 30, 35, or 53, and because it was not, Olivia's answers to one or more of those Questions was false:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   \u2022 Question 25 requires a debtor to disclose any \"\n   <strong>\n    equitable or future interests in property (other than anything listed in line 1) and rights or powers exercisable for your benefit.\n   </strong>\n   \" In response to Question 25, Olivia stated that she had no such interest, by checking the box \"No\" and stating \"0.00\" for the current value of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   \u2022 Question 30 requires a debtor to disclose \"\n   <strong>\n    [o]ther amounts someone owes you.\n   </strong>\n   \" In response to Question 30, Olivia stated that she had no such amount, by checking the box \"No\" and stating \"0.00\" for the current value of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   \u2022 Question 35 requires a debtor to disclose \"\n   <strong>\n    [a]ny financial assets [the debtor] did not already list.\n   </strong>\n   \" In response to Question 35, Olivia stated that she had no such financial assets, by checking the box next to \"No\" and stating \"0.00\" for the current value of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was not until she filed an\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   Schedule A/B on November 22, 2017, more than 5 months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Rebeck had already transferred those funds to the Chapter 7 Trustee, that Olivia finally disclosed the $33,768.71 balance remaining of the Proceeds in her schedules. In that amended Schedule A/B, Olivia checked the box \"Yes\" and described the assets she was finally disclosing as: \"Funds held by Chelsea Rebeck, JD, P.C. as of the petition date. These funds were subsequently paid to the trustee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   \u2022 Question 53 requires a debtor to disclose \"\n   <strong>\n    other property of any kind [the debtor] did not already list.\n   </strong>\n   \" Olivia stated \"0.00\" for the current value of such property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   6. Olivia also did not disclose in her original SOFA her transfer of $250,000 of the Proceeds to Rebeck's law firm's IOLTA account, nor did she disclose her transfers to her mother totaling $32,500. Olivia answered the relevant questions in her original SOFA as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   \u2022 Question 16 asked:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    Within 1 year before you filed for bankruptcy, did you or anyone else acting on your behalf pay or transfer any property to anyone you consulted about seeking bankruptcy or preparing a bankruptcy petition?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   Include any attorneys, bankruptcy petition preparers, or credit counseling agencies for services required in your bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   In response to Question 16, Olivia stated \"Yes,\" and stated that she had transferred \"$700\" to \"Rebeck Law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia did not, however, disclose the $250,000 she had transferred to \"Rebeck Law.\" She also failed to disclose payments to the other attorneys who she had consulted regarding bankruptcy, or to GreenPath, Inc. In an amended SOFA filed on\n   June 20, 2017, Olivia listed \"Rebeck Law,\" \"Sara E. Allen,\" and \"Bert Whitehead IV\" as persons to whom she had made transfers, but Olivia did not disclose the amounts that she had transferred to each of these persons. Rather, she stated that the amounts she had paid to her attorneys were \"Unknown.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her amended SOFA filed on November 22, 2017, in response to Question 16, Olivia still stated, with regard to each lawyer or law firm listed, that the amount paid was \"Unknown.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the amounts Rebeck paid, at Olivia's direction, to the other attorneys that Olivia had hired was disclosed by Rebeck in an accounting she filed with the Court on May 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   It showed that $164,827.29 had been paid to \"Rebeck Law;\" $400.00 had been paid to \"Jenna Bommarito,\" an attorney who had represented Olivia at an eviction proceeding; $8,000 had been paid to \"Boyer, Mitzgard, Nacy;\" $10,000 had been paid to \"Eisenberg, Middleditch;\" and $5,000.00 had been paid to \"Sara Allen.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   \u2022 Question 17 asked:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    Within 1 year before you filed for bankruptcy, did you or anyone else acting on your behalf pay or transfer any property to anyone who promised to help you deal with your creditors or to make payments to your creditors?\n   </strong>\n   Do not include any payment or transfer that you listed on line 16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   In response to Question 17, Olivia stated \"No.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was false, because it did not disclose Olivia's $250,000 transfer to the Rebeck Law firm.

The Court then applied the ordinary meaning of those words, relying on dictionaries, including Webster's Third New International Dictionary, to interpret the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5979953,3784650,12439772\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/716/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   In construing \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A), the Court therefore must look to the plain meaning of words not defined by the Bankruptcy Code. In its plain meaning, the word \"or\" is most commonly \"used as a function word to indicate ... an alternative between different or unlike things, states, or actions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1585 (2002). This clearly implies that in the \u00a7 727(a)(2) phrase \"with intent to hinder, delay or defraud,\" the words \"hinder\" and \"delay\" mean something different from the word \"defraud.\" And this implies that this statutory phrase lists three\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   types of intent -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , intent to hinder; intent to delay; and intent to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Moreover, while the word \"or\" is not comprehensively defined in the Bankruptcy Code, the word's meaning is supplied in part by Code \u00a7 102(5). That section, which is titled \"[r]ules of construction,\" states that \"[i]n this title- ... 'or' is not exclusive[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). The legislative history of this provision gives an example of what this means: \"if a party 'may do (a) or (b)', then the party may do either or both.\" S. Rep. No. 95-989, at 28 (1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   This Bankruptcy Code provision implies that the phrase in \u00a7 727(a)(2)\"with intent to hinder, delay or defraud\" means any, some, or all of the three types of intent -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it means\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the following: intent to hinder; intent to delay; intent to defraud; or two of such types of intent; or all three of such types of intent. This in turn, implies that while intent to \"defraud\" is sufficient to meet the intent element in \u00a7 727(a)(2), it is not necessary. Intent to \"hinder\" and intent to \"delay\" each are sufficient intent under this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Interpreting \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A) to require in all cases an intent to \"defraud\" would in effect read out of the statute the words \"hinder\" and \"delay,\" rendering those words superfluous. This the Court cannot do. In\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Supreme Court rejected the statutory interpretation argued by the debtor in that case, holding that it \"must be rejected, for it reads [the word] 'respecting' out of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612214\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1752/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Denial of discharge based on \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   The Court finds and concludes that the Plaintiffs United States Trustee and Norman Wise have met their burden of proof for denying Defendant Olivia Wise's discharge based on \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). Specifically, Plaintiffs have met their burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Olivia's transfer of $250,000 of the Proceeds, from her credit union account to the IOLTA account of Chelsea Rebeck's law firm on August 10, 2016, was a transfer of Olivia's property, made within one year before the date of the filing of Olivia's bankruptcy petition, with intent to \"hinder, delay, or defraud\" a creditor (Norman Wise). For this reason, the Court must deny Olivia's discharge, based on \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   All of the \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A) elements are met with respect to the $250,000 transfer. First, just before Olivia made the transfer on August 10, 2016, the $250,000 was Olivia's property (\"property of the debtor\"). These funds were in Olivia's account at Vibe Credit Union, an account owned solely by Olivia, and over which Olivia had sole dominion and control. And these funds were part of the proceeds of Olivia's May 10, 2016 sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property, which property was, at the time of the sale, the sole property of Olivia (because of Norman's quit-claim deed transferring the property to Olivia). The $250,000 was part of the $371,819.38 in Proceeds from the sale of the property that were wire-transferred directly into Olivia's credit union account the day after the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Norman claimed to be entitled to payment from Olivia of $250,000 of the Proceeds, promptly after the May 10, 2016 closing of the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property. But this claim by Norman, based on his February 19, 2016 Agreement with Olivia, did not mean that the Proceeds, including the $250,000, were not Olivia's property at the time she transferred the $250,000 to the Rebeck law firm. Rather, at the time of the transfer, Norman was a creditor of Olivia's, with a lawsuit pending against her, but Norman was not the owner of the $250,000. Olivia was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   It is true that several months after the August 10, 2016 transfer, on February 1, 2017, Norman obtained order in the State Court Lawsuit which purported to impose a constructive trust on the entire $371,819.38 Proceeds. But that order did not purport to impose such constructive trust retroactively, effective as of any date prior to the date of the order. To the contrary, the February 1, 2017 order merely stated that the Proceeds \"are hereby held in a constructive trust,\" and ordered Olivia to pay the Proceeds \"into court pending the final disposition of this action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even if the state court order had purported to find or retroactively order that the Proceeds were held in a constructive trust as of August 10, 2016 or earlier (which it clearly did not), the historic fact would remain that when Olivia transferred the $250,000 on August 10, 2016, it was at that moment still her property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Olivia, in substance, has admitted that the $250,000 in Proceeds that she transferred to the Rebeck law firm was a transfer of Olivia's property. Among other ways Olivia has admitted this are these: (1) as stated in Part III.A.3 of this Opinion, Olivia testified that after the closing of the South Wilson Avenue Property the sale Proceeds belonged entirely to her, not to Norman; (2) Olivia testified specifically that the $250,000 that she transferred did not belong to her father, but rather, she said, it was \"mine;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) as described in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, in an amended Schedule A/B that Olivia filed on November 22, 2017 in her bankruptcy case, Olivia disclosed as part of her \"financial assets\" the $33,768.71 of the Proceeds that was still held by the Rebeck law firm as of the bankruptcy petition date, which were \"subsequently paid to the [Chapter 7] trustee.\" In this disclosure, Olivia referred to these funds as \"an asset of the Debtor as of the petition date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   These statements in her amended Schedule A/B are implicit admissions by Olivia that the Proceeds from her sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property were property of Olivia, not Norman. Certainly, then, the $250,000 of the Proceeds were property of Olivia when she transferred them to the Rebeck law firm on August 10, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Second, Olivia's action in moving the $250,000 from her credit union account into the IOLTA account of the Rebeck law firm was both a \"transfer\" and a \"concealment\" of those funds. It was a transfer under the Bankruptcy Code's broad definition of transfer, discussed in Part III.B.1.b of this Opinion, because Olivia transferred title, possession, and control of these funds, from Olivia's credit union account to the Rebeck law firm's trust account. Once\n   the funds were in the Rebeck law firm's trust account, Olivia no longer had title to them, no longer had possession of them, and no longer had sole and direct control of them. After the transfer, only Rebeck, through her law firm, had control of the funds, subject to the terms of the Revised Fee Agreement quoted in Part III.A.6.c of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Given the terms of that Revised Fee Agreement, the $250,000 was \"an additional retainer\" and thus, was subject to an attorney's lien to secure payment of attorney fees that Olivia incurred with the Rebeck law firm. And while Olivia could request and direct that disbursements be made from the funds, the disbursements were limited to \"the following uses: Periodic billing by Attorney for representation, payment of tax liability-currently unknown amount, and as directed by client, in writing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, while Olivia did retain some control of, and some interest in, the $250,000, it was limited by and subject to the terms of the Revised Fee Agreement. This was quite different from the sole and unfettered control and ownership of the funds that Olivia had before the transfer, when the funds were in the credit union account owned solely by Olivia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Olivia's transfer of the $250,000 in Proceeds to the Rebeck law firm not only was a \"transfer,\" but also was an act by which Olivia \"concealed\" the funds, within the meaning of \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). As discussed in Part III.B.1.a of this Opinion, concealment includes \"placing ... assets beyond the reach of creditors;\" \"placing title to property in others' names and retaining beneficial interest.\" This is what Olivia did when she transferred the $250,000 to the Rebeck law firm's trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   Third, at the time of the transfer, Norman clearly was a \"creditor\" of Olivia. The Bankruptcy Code defines the term \"creditor\" to include an \"entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(A). The term \"claim,\" in turn, is defined very broadly, to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n   (A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-343\">\n   (B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5).

Norman had, and had asserted, claims against Olivia relating to the February 19, 2016 Agreement. And as described in Part III.A.4 of this Opinion, Norman already had filed suit against Olivia on those claims, on July 27, 2016, in the State Court Lawsuit. And in fact, Norman later prevailed on all of his claims in the State Court Lawsuit, when he obtained the February 15, 2017 Default Judgment against Olivia, on all counts of his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Fourth and finally, Olivia made the $250,000 transfer (and act of concealment) \"with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" a creditor (Norman), within the meaning of \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). Olivia did this with the intent to\n   <em>\n    hinder and delay\n   </em>\n   her creditor, Norman. As discussed in Part III.B.1.c of this Opinion, that is sufficient to establish the intent element under \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). Intent to hinder means \"an intent to impede or obstruct\" a creditor or creditors, and intent to delay means \"an intent to slow or postpone\" a creditor or creditors. Put another way, \"intent to hinder or delay\" means to \"act improperly to make it more difficult for a creditor to collect a debt.\"\n   <em>\n    See Wiggains\n   </em>\n   , quoted in Part III.B.1.d of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   Olivia transferred the $250,000 to the Rebeck law firm with an intent to impede and obstruct, and an intent to slow or postpone, Norman's ability to collect the $250,000 or more that he claimed was due him from Olivia. And Olivia made the transfer with an intent to make it more difficult for Norman to collect on his claim against Olivia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   At trial, Olivia testified that when she made the transfer, the $250,000 she transferred to the Rebeck law firm was to be used primarily as a reserve of money that she could use to pay any tax liability she incurred from her sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property. At the time, according to Olivia, she and her attorney, Rebeck, were estimating that Olivia's tax liability could be $150,000 to $160,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Secondarily, the money was to be used to pay the attorney fees that Olivia incurred with Rebeck. The Revised Fee Agreement, which Olivia and Chelsea signed on July 5, 2016, reflected these two purposes as things the money could be used for, but it also allowed for the money to be disbursed, for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   purpose, \"as directed by [Olivia], in writing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   It is clear that in order to serve these purported purposes, there was absolutely no legitimate need for Olivia to transfer any of the $250,000 from her own credit union account to the Rebeck law firm's trust account. Olivia could have kept all of that money in her own credit union account, and used it to pay her tax liability, if any, when the amount of that liability became known. And, of course, Olivia could have kept all the money that she may have wanted to use for any purpose other than paying her taxes in her own credit union account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   The evidence does not show that there was any need for Olivia to pay any additional retainer to Rebeck, above and beyond the initial retainer of $1,000.00 that she had paid to the Rebeck law firm, under\n   the initial fee agreement Olivia made with Rebeck on May 23, 2016. Neither Olivia nor Rebeck testified that Rebeck had asked for, or required, any increased retainer from Olivia before the $250,000 transfer was made. Instead, both of them testified that Olivia requested to pay the $250,000 to the Rebeck law firm, not that it was demanded or requested in any way by Rebeck. And even if Rebeck had wanted Olivia to pay an increased retainer to secure payment of her fees (and there is no evidence of this), there certainly is no evidence that Rebeck would have wanted an increased security retainer in an amount anywhere near $250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Given the evidence presented at trial, there simply is no logical,\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   reason for Olivia to have paid the $250,000 to the Rebeck law firm. The Court finds that the only possible reason, and the only actual reason, for this transfer by Olivia, was Olivia's desire to do what she could to keep Norman from collecting this money. Olivia transferred the $250,000 in order to make it more difficult for Norman to collect on his claim against her, and to slow, impede, and obstruct Norman's effort to collect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   When Olivia made the Revised Fee Agreement with the Rebeck law firm, on July 5, 2016, providing for the $250,000 transfer, she knew that Norman and his attorneys had been demanding Olivia's payment of $250,000 of the Proceeds since shortly after the May 10, 2016 sale closing. When Olivia actually made the $250,000 transfer, on August 10, 2016, Norman had filed suit against her on July 27, 2016, and Olivia had been served with Norman's complaint on August 2, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   So Olivia knew when she made the transfer that Norman's lawsuit was seeking not just the $250,000, but also a judgment for the entire $371,819.38 in Proceeds. And Norman's complaint was seeking an order \"preventing [Olivia] from spending, transferring, encumbering, and/or disposing of any of the Proceeds during the pendency of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.4 of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Olivia actually admitted, in substance, that she made the $250,000 transfer to try to keep Norman from collecting this money. As quoted more fully in Part III.A.6.c of this Opinion, Olivia testified that she made the transfer because \"[t]he $250,000 was the amount of money that my father had hoped to receive right away. And I felt given the eviction that that money should\n   <strong>\n    be secured\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   By \"secured,\" here, Olivia clearly meant\n   <em>\n    secure from the possible reach of her father.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Further evidence that Olivia's intent in making the $250,000 transfer was to hinder and delay her creditor-father is that during this same period, Olivia made other large transfers of the Proceeds of the sale of the South Wilson Avenue Property, which also appear to have been designed to put the money out of Norman's reach as a creditor of Olivia. Among these are (1) in late July 2016, Olivia used a total of $48,000 of the Proceeds to fund the purchase of the Minivan, but then titled the Minivan jointly in her name and her mother's name, even though Olivia's mother, who had been divorced from Norman for years, contributed nothing toward the purchase price of the vehicle; (2) in August 2016, Olivia made two payments to her mother, from the Proceeds, totaling $32,500, purportedly related to Olivia and her children living in her mother's basement, which included several months' worth of pre-paid rent and money to pay for improvements to her mother's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parts III.A.6.a and III.A.6.b of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   The transfers, when combined with the $250,000 transfer, totaled $330,500.00, or 89% of the total $371,819.38 Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   Based on the above facts and evidence, and for the reasons stated above, the Court finds and concludes that Olivia made the $250,000 transfer with the intent to hinder and delay Norman, a creditor. Based on this, the Court will deny Olivia's discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Denial of discharge based on \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   In Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, the Court describes in detail the large number of false statements that Olivia made in her schedules and SOFA that she filed on April 14, 2017 in her second (current) bankruptcy case. In Part III.B.2 of this Opinion, the Court describes the five elements that the Plaintiffs must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, in order for the Court to deny Olivia's discharge under the \"false oath\" provision of \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A). These are the elements stated by the Sixth Circuit in the\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Initially, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   element nos. 1, 2, and 5, with respect to every one of the false statements identified by the Court in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion. Thus, the Court finds and concludes that as to every such false statement, Olivia made the statement under oath; the statement was false; and the statement related materially to the bankruptcy case (as materiality is defined by\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   As to each false statement, that leaves\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   elements 3 and 4 -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Olivia \"knew the statement was false\" and that Olivia \"made the statement with fraudulent intent.\" The Plaintiffs have proven\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   element 3 by a preponderance of the evidence, and the Court finds that with respect to every one of the Olivia's false statements identified in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, with the possible exception of those listed as nos. 19 and 20, Olivia knew the statement was false when she made it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   As to\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   element 4, the Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Olivia made\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   several of the false statements with fraudulent intent. The Court finds that Olivia made each of the following false statements with fraudulent intent: the false statements identified in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, at Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 16, 17, and 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Initially, the Court finds from the very large number of false statements that Olivia made in her schedules and SOFA, described in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, that Olivia is guilty, at a minimum, of a reckless disregard for the truth of the representations she made in those many false statements under oath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Under the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   , quoted in Part III.B.2 of this Opinion, courts \"may deduce fraudulent intent from all the facts and circumstances of a case,\" but a reckless disregard for the truth alone may raise an inference that Olivia made the false statements with fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11187536,11191482\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/679/\">\n    227 F.3d at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (\"A reckless disregard as to whether a representation is true will also satisfy the intent requirement.\").

Mich. 2005) (same, and holding that \"[a]lthough any one of the specific inaccuracies in the Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs may not by itself seem material, the cumulative effect of these misstatements gives rise to an inference in this case that Debtor knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath or account.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   In addition to the pattern and sheer number of Olivia's false statements, the following circumstances further support the Court's finding that Olivia made the false statements with fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   Olivia is a well-educated person, and is very intelligent. She is a certified public accountant, and in the past she was a\n   <em>\n    certified fraud examiner\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her past work history while living in California, Olivia worked as a bookkeeper and accountant for small businesses, and her work included preparing business property tax returns and payroll tax returns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   By her education, training, and experience, all of which have involved careful attention to detail, and given her very high level of intelligence, Olivia is not a person who could have made so many false statements in her schedules and SOFA\n   <em>\n    inadvertently\n   </em>\n   , or by innocent mistake. Nor is she someone who could have overlooked, or failed to read and understand, the questions on the forms for her schedules and SOFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   Furthermore, Olivia had ample time to supply information for her schedules and SOFA, and to review the drafts and completed versions of those forms, before they were filed with the Court. While it is true that Olivia's first bankruptcy case was filed on an emergency basis, on March 16, 2018, that case was dismissed 11 days after it was filed, before Olivia ever had to file any schedules or a SOFA. Olivia did not file her second bankruptcy case until April 14, 2018, which is also the day she filed her schedules and SOFA. So Olivia had almost a full month after she first decided to file bankruptcy, to prepare, review, and file her schedules and SOFA. And Olivia could have had even more time - an additional 14 days after the April 14, 2017 petition date - to file those documents in her bankruptcy case, if she had felt she needed more time. And Olivia had the assistance of her attorney, Bert Whitehead, IV, during that entire time, as well as the help of administrative staff at the Rebeck law firm, to help her prepare her schedules and SOFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   Olivia testified that she reviewed her schedules and SOFA before they were filed. The many false statements on those forms must have been obvious to Olivia. She could not help but notice many, if not all, of them. Yet she filed the false schedules and false SOFA with the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   The Court's finding of Olivia's fraudulent intent, in making the false statements identified above, is also supported by the fact that Olivia had a motive for making each of those false statements. All of these false statements were in the nature of Olivia's failure to disclose her assets or failure to disclose the large transfers of money or other assets that Olivia made during the one year before she filed bankruptcy. Several of the transfers were made to Olivia's mother. And, as the Court has found, a very large transfer ($250,000) was made by Olivia with the intent of hindering and delaying a creditor (her father, Norman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Given all of this, Olivia likely wanted to shield the assets involved, and shield herself and her mother, from scrutiny by a bankruptcy trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   Another fact that strongly supports the Court's finding of fraudulent intent is that Olivia knew the true, undisclosed facts that made her statements false when she made them, with the possible exception of the false statements described at Item Nos. 19 and 20 in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion. In other words, Olivia knew that her false statements were false when she made them. And this raises a strong inference that Olivia made the false statements with fraudulent intent, rather than merely as inadvertent errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   One specific example of this is Olivia's failure to disclose that the Rebeck law firm was holding funds in its client trust account that belonged to Olivia. Of the $250,000 that Olivia transferred to the Rebeck law firm's trust account on August 10, 2016, there was almost $34,000 left as of the April 14, 2017 petition date. Olivia admitted at trial that those funds were hers, and that she was aware that the Rebeck law firm was still holding funds of hers, when she filed her bankruptcy schedules and SOFA on April 14, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olivia also testified that when she filed her schedules and SOFA, she did not know how much of the funds were left in the Rebeck law firm trust account,\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that she \"was not thinking about\" those funds when the schedules were prepared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   This last bit of testimony is simply not credible. When Olivia filed her false schedules and SOFA on April 14, 2017, she had been reminded\n   <em>\n    very recently\n   </em>\n   about the funds she had in the Rebeck law firm trust account. First, as described in Part III.A.7 of this Opinion, Olivia attended the hearing in the State Court Lawsuit on March 15, 2017, and therefore was present when her attorneys Sara Allen and Chelsea Rebeck told the state court judge that there were still funds from the Proceeds being held in the Rebeck law firm's trust account. And as described in Part III.A.6 of this Opinion, soon after the March 15, 2017 state court hearing, Olivia asked for and received disbursements from the Rebeck law firm trust account, on March 30, 2017 and on April 11, 2017, each time in the amount of $3,000.00. Olivia requested and received these disbursements very shortly before she filed her false schedules and SOFA, in which she failed to disclose anything about her funds in the Rebeck law firm trust account. The April 11, 2017 disbursement to Olivia, in fact, occurred only 3 days before Olivia filed her second bankruptcy case and her false schedules and false SOFA, on April 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   At trial, Olivia argued that she did not make the many false statements with fraudulent intent, but rather because of innocent mistakes and because of her stress and emotional turmoil. Olivia also complained that the bankruptcy software that she worked with at the Rebeck firm was difficult to use. The Court finds that these arguments are not persuasive, and are not supported by credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Olivia may well have had a good deal of stress and emotional turmoil, at times, during the year or so before her bankruptcy. But there is no credible, persuasive evidence that Olivia's stress or emotional turmoil actually prevented or hindered Olivia from filing truthful, accurate schedules\n   and SOFA. Moreover, during the month or so before the filing of Olivia's second bankruptcy case on April 14, 2017, Olivia had plenty of time and opportunity to work with her attorney and prepare her schedules and SOFA, and to prepare them accurately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds and concludes, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that Olivia made false oaths satisfying all of the\n   <em>\n    Keeney\n   </em>\n   elements under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A), including fraudulent intent, with respect to all of the false statements identified in Part III.A.11 of this Opinion, at Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 16, 17, and 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Based on this, the Court will deny Olivia's discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
