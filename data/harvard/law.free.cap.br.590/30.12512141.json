Trust, dated June 28, 2017, converting Debtor's Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 proceeding (the \"Conversion Order\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Conversion Order, Docket Entry 1, at ECF pp. 3-10.) For the reasons that follow, Debtor's appeal is DISMISSED and the Bankruptcy Court's Conversion Order is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the full facts and extensive procedural history of this case and summarizes only those facts and history pertinent to the pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 9, 2015, Debtor filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court, seeking bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"). (Conversion Order at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Pet.,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 1.) Debtor's bankruptcy filing followed a contentious\n   divorce action in New York Supreme Court, County of Suffolk (the \"State Action\"), filed by Stephen S. Vaccaro (\"Vaccaro\"), Lynch's former husband. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 38437-10.) Vaccaro is a creditor in the bankruptcy case, in which much of the proceedings concern monetary and property interest disputes arising from the divorce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

(Conversion Order at ECF p. 3.) On June 7, 2016, Debtor filed her first Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, to which a creditor, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") objected on June 17, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Conversion Order at ECF p. 3.) By Bankruptcy Court order, dated July 13, 2016, Debtor was required to obtain approval of a disclosure statement by September 14, 2016 and to obtain confirmation of a plan of reorganization by November 7, 2016. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 4.) The Bankruptcy Court's order noted that Debtor's failure to comply with either deadline would constitute cause for immediate conversion of the case to Chapter 7 or dismissal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without a hearing. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 4.) On August 12, 2016, Debtor filed an amended Chapter 11 plan and disclosure statement to which Vaccaro, as a creditor, and Wells Fargo objected. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During a September 14, 2016 hearing, Debtor requested additional time to seek confirmation of a plan and advised the Bankruptcy Court that she wished to mediate her disputes with Vaccaro.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Conversion Order at ECF p. 4.) By amended order, dated September 19, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court extended Debtor's time to obtain approval of a disclosure statement to December 7, 2016 and plan confirmation to February 6, 2017, noting that any failure to comply with those deadlines would constitute cause for immediate conversion of the case to Chapter 7 or dismissal, without an additional hearing. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 7, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order assigning to mediation all disputes between Debtor and Vaccaro, including disputes related to their pre-petition matrimonial action. (Conversion\n   Order at ECF p. 5; June 28, 2017 Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") Hr'g Tr., Docket Entry 17, at ECF pp. 22-88, 37:5-9.) The Bankruptcy Court allowed Debtor to use estate property to fund matrimonial counsel to assist in that mediation. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 5.) On December 7, 2016, Debtor and Vaccaro advised the Bankruptcy Court that settlement efforts continued, and therefore, on January 13, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court further extended Debtor's deadline to file an amended disclosure statement and obtain approval of the plan. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 5.) The final deadlines for Debtor to obtain approval of a disclosure statement and plan of reorganization were set to June 16, 2017 and July 24, 2017, respectively. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 5.) The amended order, like the prior orders, provided that any failure to comply with those deadlines would constitute cause for immediate conversion of the case to Chapter 7 or dismissal without a further hearing. (Conversion Order at ECF pp. 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 21, 2017, Vaccaro filed a letter stating that the mediation did not result in a settlement. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) During a scheduled status conference on March 22, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court advised Debtor that the deadlines to obtain approval of a plan and disclosure statement would not be extended again. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At a May 10, 2017 hearing, the Bankruptcy Court advised the parties that it did not appear that the plan Debtor had filed had a substantial likelihood of being confirmed, and that given the objections to the plan and disclosure statement it was not likely that Debtor would be able to meet the deadlines to obtain confirmation and approval of the disclosure statement. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) The Bankruptcy Court also expressed concerns about the continued accrual of costs of administration and the deficit at which the estate was operating each month. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") directing Debtor to appear for a hearing on May 22, 2017 to show cause why the case should not be converted to Chapter 7, or in the alternative, dismissed. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) In accordance with that order, on May 17, 2017, Debtor filed an outline of an amended plan of reorganization. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) Both Debtor and Vaccaro filed their separate responses to the OSC on May 19, 2017. (Conversion Order at ECF pp. 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the May 22, 2017 hearing, Debtor and Vaccaro reached a settlement and stated its terms on the record. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.) At the Bankruptcy Court's direction, two days after the hearing, Debtor filed a term sheet (the \"Term Sheet\") outlining the agreed upon settlement terms, including that Vaccaro would vote in favor of a plan of reorganization that contained the terms of the parties' settlement. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 6, 2017, Debtor filed a motion pursuant to Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Rule 9019\") seeking authorization and approval of the settlement. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.) Eight days later, on June 14, 2017, Debtor filed a notice of withdrawal of her Rule 9019 motion. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.) That same day, Debtor also filed an amended disclosure statement, a second amended Chapter 11 plan, a motion to approve the adequacy of the amended disclosure statement, and a motion to shorten the time for creditors to consider approval of the disclosure statement. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 15, 2017, Vaccaro filed an objection to Debtor's motions arguing that\n   Debtor showed no basis to shorten the notice period, the amended plan did not incorporate the terms of the agreement set out in the filed Term Sheet, and the amended disclosure statement could not be approved by the June 16, 2017 deadline. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.) On June 21, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court set a hearing for June 28, 2017 on the Rule 9019 motion and on Debtor's motion to limit notice. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 8.) On June 26, 2017, Vaccaro filed a limited objection to the Rule 9019 motion that Debtor sought to withdraw, contending that it contained terms that were not part of the proposed settlement to which the parties had agreed at the May 22 hearing or in the signed Term Sheet. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the June 28, 2017 hearing, the Bankruptcy Court noted that it could not hear the Rule 9019 motion as Debtor had withdrawn it. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 41:16-17.) It also acknowledged that the amended plan did not incorporate the terms of the agreement Vaccaro and Debtor had reached. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 41:25-42:2.) Additionally, the United States Trustee (\"Trustee\") stated that Debtor's amended disclosure statement was not in a form which could be approved under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , since it lacked any significant financial information and the amended plan did not appear to be confirmable. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 8.) Further, the Bankruptcy Court stressed that no agreement had been reached for a modification of the loan owed to Wells Fargo, which was then over $700,000 in arrears, even though the bankruptcy case had been pending for more than eighteen months. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 8; OSC Hr'g Tr., 16:2-17:7; 31:8-25.) The Bankruptcy Court also emphasized that it had been consistent and clear that if Debtor could not efficiently administer the estate by the court-imposed deadlines, the case would be converted or dismissed. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 45:11-18.) Finally, it noted that conversion of the case served the creditors more than dismissal because it would allow assets to be liquidated to pay creditors. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 45:1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Therefore, \"based on the long history of this case, given the inability of Debtor to obtain approval of a Disclosure Statement and confirmation of a Plan of Reorganization as required by prior Orders of this Court, given unreasonable delays by Debtor which are prejudicial to creditors, and, given the conversion of this case to chapter 7 is in the better interests of creditors than dismissal,\" the Bankruptcy Court ordered conversion of the case from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 pursuant to Section 1112(b)(4)(A),(E) and (J). (Conversion Order at ECF pp. 8-9.) R. Kenneth Barnard (\"Barnard\") was appointed as the Chapter 7 trustee over Debtor's estate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 458.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Debtor filed a Notice of Appeal of the Conversion Order on July 13, 2017. (Notice Appeal, Docket Entry 1, at 1-2.) She filed her brief on February 13, 2018, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br.), and Barnard as Chapter 7 Trustee of the estate filed a brief in opposition on March 15, 2018. (Barnard Opp., Docket Entry 15.) Debtor submitted her reply on March 30, 2018 (Appellant's Reply, Docket Entry 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions of a bankruptcy court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which provides in relevant part that \"[t]he district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals ... from final judgments, orders, and decrees; ...

The Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there was cause to convert or dismiss the case pursuant to Section 1112(b)(4). Its finding of cause was not based on clearly erroneous or insufficient factual findings or on an erroneous view of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The evidence before the Bankruptcy Court clearly supports its decision. Among other things, the Bankruptcy Court found that Debtor initially failed to timely file a disclosure statement and plan of reorganization after it granted her numerous extensions of time in which to do so. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 36:17-37:4.) Further, it found that the disclosure statement and plan that Debtor eventually submitted on June 14, 2017 was unlikely to be approved. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 22:13-24.) Thus, the Bankruptcy Court noted that it would have been impossible for Debtor to obtain confirmation of the plan by the court-imposed deadline of July 24, 2017. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 23:12-17; 42:12-21.) Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court found that the plan submitted was not consistent with the settlement agreement Debtor had reached with Vaccaro.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (OSC Hr'g Tr., 22:16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee's findings further support the Bankruptcy Court's Conversion Order. At the June 28, 2017 hearing on the OSC, the Trustee noted that Debtor's proposed plan was not confirmable for numerous reasons, including because \"[t]he disclosure statement is incapable of being determined by the Court as containing adequate\n   information as it contains not one bit of financial information that would be required for a creditor to determine if it should vote for or against or object to the plan.\" (OSC Hr'g Tr., 22:19-24.) Additionally, the Trustee stated that \"[t]he plan that is presently on file ... would make [ ] it almost an impossibility for the plan that's being proposed now to be confirmed and to allow for the distribution of creditors.\" (OSC Hr'g Tr., 23:12-17.) The Trustee stressed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [I]n a year and a half, other than in essence what has been forced to occur based upon the Court's decisions, nothing else has really happened in the case. The issues revolving around the matrimonial case, the equitable distribution issues have not been resolved.... So overall, we've been a year and a half and very little has been accomplished. The creditors deserve to be paid. There are assets that exist that would provide sufficient monies to pay them ... So we believe that it's in the best interest of creditors to convert the case, allow a trustee to come in.... I do believe that the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee and the conversion is more economically consistent than would be the appointment of a Chapter 11 operating trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (OSC Hr'g Tr., 23:21-24:25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of the above, the Bankruptcy Court's order converting Debtor's Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 proceeding was not an abuse of discretion. The Bankruptcy Court ordered conversion principally because of its concern that the value of the estate was being diminished and the proposed reorganization plans appeared to have little chance of succeeding. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 30:16-31:7; 41:4-44:22.) The Bankruptcy Court emphasized that eighteen months into the bankruptcy case, \"there [was] no agreement for repayment of or modification of the Wells Fargo mortgage nor does the estate have adequate unencumbered funds to secure those substantial arrears which now appear to exceed $700,000.\" (OSC Hr'g Tr., 41:11-15.) The Bankruptcy Court also noted that there were more creditors in the case that were not afforded the opportunity to object to or approve the Rule 9019 motion, as Debtor withdrew it. (OSC Hr'g Tr., 41:17-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, in light of Debtor's inability to obtain approval of the disclosure statement and confirmation of a plan as required by prior court orders and Debtor's series of delays that were prejudicial to creditors, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that converting the case to Chapter 7, rather than dismissal, would be in the best interest of the creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (OSC Hr'g Tr., 44:14-22.) The foregoing makes clear that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there was ample cause for conversion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(A),(E), and (J).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Notice and a Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under Section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the court may convert a case only \"after notice and a hearing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

(Appellant Br. at 33-35.) This argument rests upon a flawed factual premise inasmuch as the Bankruptcy Court provided notice and hearings to Debtor on multiple occasions. First, at a hearing held on July 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court warned Debtor that \"[i]f [she] is not able to obtain confirmation of a plan by November 7th the Court will convert the case to Chapter 7 unless the debtor shows cause why even after being unable to obtain confirmation dismissal is better for her creditors.\" (July 13, 2016 Hr'g Tr.,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 268, 47:1-5.) Further, in three orders memorializing extended deadlines in which Debtor was to obtain approval of a disclosure statement and confirmation of a plan of reorganization, the Bankruptcy Court noted that \"any unexcused failure to comply\" with those deadlines \"shall constitute cause for immediate conversion of the case to chapter 7 or dismissal.\" (July 16, 2016 Order,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 257, at 2; Sept. 19, 2016 Am. Order,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 284, at 2; Jan. 13, 2017 Am.

Additionally, at a hearing held on May 10, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court warned Debtor that it did not appear that the current plan had a substantial likelihood of being confirmed or that Debtor would likely meet the deadlines set out in the January 13, 2017 Order. (May 10, 2017 OSC,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, Docket Entry 408, at 5.) The Bankruptcy Court also \"expressed concerns for the continued accrual of costs of administration and the deficit at which the estate [was] operating each month.\" (May 10, 2017 OSC,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , Bankr. No. 15-74795, at 5.) That same day, the Bankruptcy Court entered an OSC, \"to show cause why this case should not be converted to a case under Chapter 7, ... or in the alternative dismissed\", and scheduled a hearing date for May 22, 2017. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.) Debtor subsequently filed a plan summary and response to the OSC, and Vaccaro filed a statement in support of the OSC. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the May 22, 2017 hearing, the Bankruptcy Court allowed the parties to mediate, which resulted in a settlement agreement memorialized on the record. (Conversion Order at ECF p. 7.) However, as noted, Debtor pulled out of that agreement by withdrawing her Rule 9019 motion on June 14, 2017. (Conversion Order at ECF pp. 7.) Finally, the Bankruptcy Court held a final hearing on the issue of conversion on June 28, 2017, when it noted that it had been \"consistent and clear that if the debtor could not efficiently administer the estate by the deadlines previously set, the case\n   would be either converted or dismissed.\" (OSC Hr'g Tr., 45:15-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, Debtor was provided with ample notice and numerous hearings prior to the conversion of her Chapter 11 case, which satisfied Section 1112(b)'s notice and hearing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The order appealed from is AFFIRMED and Debtor's appeal is DISMISSED.

Following Debtor's failure to comply with the court's equitable distribution order and her mismanagement of Harbor Drive, the state court found Debtor in contempt for obstructing the sale of that property. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 294.) Debtor commenced her bankruptcy action in order to stay the impending sale of Harbor Drive. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; Appellant's Br., Docket Entry 14, at 3.) Following a Bankruptcy Court order concerning the auction and eventual sale of Harbor Drive, Debtor and the purchaser of that property appealed to this Court. (Index Nos. 16-CV-0074, 16-CV-0415, 16-CV-1475, 16-CV-1476.) Judge Bianco dismissed the appeals, ruling that they were statutorily moot.

(Appellant Br. at 17-27.) Debtor contends that \"the same deprivations and incorrect rulings which deprived Debtor of utilizing Bankruptcy Code sections 362 and 543, and the proper use of Code section 363, with regard to the Harbor property repeated throughout the rest of the case resulting in additional adverse rulings that prevented Debtor from having any fair opportunity of reorganization, and led to the Bankruptcy Court's erroneous decision to convert her case to one under Chapter 7.\" (Appellant's Reply at 16.) Thus, Debtor contends that it was the Bankruptcy Court's own mishandling of the Chapter 11 case that led to conversion. However, these issues were fully adjudicated on a prior appeal to this Court,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lynch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272735\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/290/#p292\">\n     566 B.R. 290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     aff'd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Frank v.

(OSC Hr'g Tr., 44:3-5.) Emphasizing that Bankruptcy counsel represent the estate, not Debtor individually, the Bankruptcy Court expressed its reluctance to allow Debtor to terminate counsel and hire a fourth set of Chapter 11 counsel.

However, the Court need not address the issue of equitable mootness as it finds that the Bankruptcy Court's Conversion Order was not an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
