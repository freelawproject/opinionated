Section 5000A(a) contains the ACA's individual mandate and provides that, \"for each month beginning after 2013\", all \"applicable individual[s]\" must have \"minimum essential coverage\"-which is to say, health insurance coverage as defined in \u00a7 5000A(f). \"If a taxpayer who is an applicable individual\" fails to comply with the individual mandate \"for 1 or more months, then,\" subject to certain exemptions not relevant here, \u00a7 5000A(b)\"impose[s] on the taxpayer a penalty\", referred to as a \"[s]hared responsibility payment\". \u00a7 5000A(b)(1) ; see also \u00a7 5000A(e)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (describing those individuals \"with respect to\" whom \"[n]o penalty shall be imposed\").

Section 507(a)(8) affords priority status to \"allowed unsecured claims of governmental units\" but \"only to the extent that such claims are for\" taxes, customs duties, or penalties of a kind specified in that paragraph. One kind of tax so specified is \"an excise tax on ... a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return, if required, is last due, under applicable law or under any extension, after three years before the date of the filing of the petition\". \u00a7 507(a)(8)(E)(i).

CM-ECF Doc. No. 36, at 11; CM-ECF Doc. No. 41, at 4. The debtors reply that the shared responsibility payment is not a tax, much less an excise. They characterize the shared responsibility payment as \"a penalty for failure to obtain health insurance\". CM-ECF Doc. No. 31, at 1. If that characterization is correct, the portion of the IRS's claim attributable to the debtors' outstanding obligation under \u00a7 5000A is not entitled to priority.

The taxes at issue in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   are thus not analogous to the shared responsibility payment imposed for\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   purchasing health insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Case like\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , which address payments imposed for electing an alternative course of engaging in an allowed activity, should be understood to set the outer marker for exactions that give rise to a priority claim for an excise. \"Because priorities grant special rights to the holders of priority claims, priorities under the Code are to be narrowly construed.\" 4\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 507.01 (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J.

As the previous discussion explains, only by embracing an expansive construction of \"excise tax\" can one conclude that the shared responsibility payment is such a tax.

Even if the IRS could prove that these debtors purposefully\n   <em>\n    chose\n   </em>\n   not to obtain health insurance coverage-which it has not done-it offers no definition of \"transaction\" that reasonably encompasses an individual's unilateral and solitary decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"Transaction\", like \"tax\" and \"excise\", is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, so the court must look to other sources to determine the term's ordinary meaning.
