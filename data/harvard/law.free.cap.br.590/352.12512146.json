The\n   <em>\n    Law Solutions\n   </em>\n   Hearing involved UpRight Law and Law Solutions-two of the Petitioners in the instant case-seeking a stay of a practice revocation. Petitioners assert that the district court, on an appeal from a privilege revocation issued on a very similarly factual and procedural basis as here, held that \"the monetary harm and temporary suspension of the firm from filing cases for a\n   period of 90 days constituted an irreparable injury.\" Stay Br. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Petitioners' interpretation of the\n   <em>\n    Law Solutions\n   </em>\n   Hearing is disingenuous. First, while the court \"agree[d] with UpRight that the 90-day suspension ... is the only portion of the Order that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   result in irreparable harm,\" the court did \"not find this element weighs heavily in favor of UpRight.\"\n   <em>\n    Law Sols.\n   </em>\n   Tr. 63-64 (emphasis added). Moreover, the court noted that the reputational injury was \"temporary\" because the privilege revocation was temporary and because UpRight could ultimately win the appeal and vindicate itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. Accordingly, the court found that \"while UpRight is likely to suffer some irreparable harm, this factor does not weigh heavily in favor of UpRight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. Because UpRight failed to satisfy the other three factors-like this court, the\n   <em>\n    Law Solutions\n   </em>\n   court found that UpRight did not show a strong likelihood of success on the merits-the court denied the stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court holds that the monetary damages Petitioners may incur as a result of refunding attorneys' fees do not constitute irreparable harm. Moreover, while there may be slight irreparable harm to Petitioners' reputation, it could be cured if the court ultimately rules in Petitioners' favor and vacates the Practice Revocation. Accordingly, Petitioners have failed to satisfy the second\n   <em>\n    Hilton\n   </em>\n   factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
