The merits of the appeal are fully briefed. Also before the Court is\n   the Reorganized Debtors' motion to dismiss the appeal (D.I. 31) (\"Motion to Dismiss\") on the basis of equitable mootness. For the reasons set forth below, the appeal meets the criteria for equitable mootness, and the Court rules in the alternative that the Confirmation Order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The appeal arises from Debtors' plan of reorganization, pursuant to which secured creditors, who would not receive 100% recovery on their secured claims, made a gift to general unsecured creditors, who would otherwise receive no distribution under the Bankruptcy Code's priority scheme, in order to enable the Debtors to reorganize. Even though unsecured creditors would receive no distribution absent the gift, Appellant has appealed the Confirmation Order based on the fact that the plan placed general unsecured claims of the same priority into separate classes and provided disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant facts are uncontested. In the months leading up to the bankruptcy filing, Debtors struggled with liquidity and negotiated with certain creditors toward a prepackaged plan of reorganization. On April 28, 2017, Debtors commenced a prepetition solicitation of votes on the negotiated plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 14). On May 1, 2017, Debtors commenced their chapter 11 cases (\"Petition Date\"), at which time Debtors had approximately $500 million in secured debt and an uncontroverted value of approximately $302.5 million. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 14 at Art. VIII). On the Petition Date, Debtors filed an initial plan of reorganization, which was amended on June 21, 2017 (B.D.I. 366) (\"Plan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Reorganized Debtors, to ensure that the Debtors' businesses remain viable and positioned for growth, the Plan eliminated approximately $500 million of funded debt through the conversion to equity of certain 12.5%/10% senior secured second lien notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"), the Debtors' 9.875% unsecured senior notes due 2018 (\"2018 Notes\"), a term loan facility provided for under the term loan agreement dated April 15, 2016 (the \"Term Loan Facility\"), and a $12.5 million senior secured, super-priority debtor in possession term credit facility (the \"DIP Term Loan Facility\"). Significant concessions by senior creditors\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   funded gifted distributions to holders of out-of-the-money general unsecured claims under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Reorganized Debtors argue that the Plan treated unsecured creditors in distinct ways based upon their respective legal rights, their importance to the ongoing operation and the profitability of the Debtors' businesses, and the practical limitations impeding the Debtors' ability to provide such creditors with a recovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 37 at 8; 7/21/17 Hr'g Tr. 60:1-62:5). Creditors holding claims derived from the purchase of 2018 Notes, which were classified in Class A6, received a combination of stock and cash by virtue of the gifted distributions from senior creditors, with an aggregate recovery to holders in Class A6 valued at approximately 4-6%. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/21/17\n   Hr'g Tr. at 30:23-25). In contrast, trade and certain other creditors related to the Debtors' business and operations (\"Trade and Business-Related Claims\"), classified in Class A7, B7, and C7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were reinstated under the Plan, and, therefore, holders of such claims were entitled to receive a 100% recovery by virtue of the gifted distributions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 14 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Class A6 voted to reject the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Plan was nonconsensual, Debtors had the burden of \"show[ing] that the plan meets the additional requirements of \u00a7 1129(b), including the requirements that the plan does not unfairly discriminate against dissenting classes and the treatment of the dissenting classes is fair and equitable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Exide Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057965\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/303/48/#p58\">\n    303 B.R. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (Bankr. D. Del. 2003). These requirements were addressed in the Debtors' confirmation brief and declaration in support. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 302, 338).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant, who held approximately $450,000 of the 2018 Notes that had been classified in Class A6, objected to confirmation of the Plan (B.D.I. 290) on the grounds that (i) Appellant would receive a distribution of less value than certain of the Debtors' other unsecured creditors who also held unsecured claims (i.e., Trade and Business-Related Claims); and (ii) the classification scheme contemplated in the Plan was improper. Appellant was the sole objector to confirmation of the Plan. (7/24/17 Hr'g Tr. at 3:24-4:3). At the confirmation hearing on July 21, 2017, Appellant made arguments and examined and presented witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/21/17 Hr'g Tr.). Appellant offered no evidence to controvert assertions with respect to the existing debt and value of Debtors' businesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057965\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/303/48/#p58\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Following the evidentiary hearing and argument on July 21, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court took the matter under advisement and made a bench ruling via telephonic hearing on July 24, 2017, overruling Appellant's objection and confirming the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/24/17 Hr'g Tr.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court made the specific finding that \"[u]nsecured creditors, including among others, trade creditors and holders of 2018 [N]otes are out of the money because they sit behind over $500 million dollars of secured debt in the company that has an uncontroverted value of approximately $300 million dollars.\" (7/24/17 Hr'g Tr. at 4:4-10). Addressing Appellant's classification objection, the Bankruptcy Court determined that separate classification of trade creditors and noteholders was reasonable on the basis that trade creditors were critical to the success of the reorganized debtors. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:5-6:24). Addressing Appellant's unfair discrimination objection, the Bankruptcy Court determined that, while the disparate treatment of Class A6 gave rise to a rebuttable presumption of unfair discrimination (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:12-14), that presumption was rebutted because Class A6 is \"indisputably out of the money and not, otherwise, entitled to any distribution under the bankruptcy\n   code's priority scheme and provided further that the proposed classification and treatment of the unsecured creditors fosters a reorganization of these debtors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:24-9:3). The Bankruptcy Court determined that its decision was consistent with leading cases governing the issue of gifting (9:14-12:12) and rejected Appellant's argument that the gift was from estate property, violated the absolute priority rule, and thus the Plan was not \"fair and equitable.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Bankruptcy Court overruled the objection, confirmed the Plan (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:24-14:5), and further held that any request for a stay of the Confirmation Order beyond the 10-day period included therein \"would serve no purpose\" as a stay was not warranted. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:19-15:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on July 25, 2017. (D.I. 1). Contemporaneously, Appellant filed an emergency motion for stay of the Confirmation Order pending appeal (D.I. 3) (\"Stay Motion\") and a related motion for expedited consideration (D.I. 4). On August 3, 2017, the Court denied the Stay Motion on the basis that Appellant was unlikely to succeed on the merits of the appeal and had failed to establish irreparable harm absent a stay. (D.I. 20). On October 16, 2017, Debtors filed the Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 31). The parties have fully briefed the Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 31, 32, 36, 40) and the merits of the appeal (D.I. 29, 37, 41). On May 14, 2018, the Court held oral argument on both the Motion to Dismiss and the merits of the appeal. (D.I. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CONTENTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant raises the following issues on appeal: (i) whether the Bankruptcy Court erred by concluding that the Plan did not discriminate unfairly in finding that the \"gift\" under the Plan made by secured creditors to unsecured creditors providing varying levels of claim recovery did not constitute unfair discrimination under \u00a7 1129(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code ; and (ii) whether the Bankruptcy Court erred by concluding that the Plan properly classified 2018 Note claims separately from other general unsecured claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 22 at \u00b6 1-3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to equitable mootness, Reorganized Debtors argue that the Plan has been substantially consummated. Reorganized Debtors assert that, if I agree with Appellant that the Plan unfairly discriminated against and/or improperly classified Class A6 claims, correcting those errors would require a wholesale reversal of the Plan, restoration of the Reorganized Debtors' estates to the\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   prior to the Effective Date, and disgorgement of the gifted distributions, which is not possible as a practical matter and which would necessarily harm third parties who reasonably relied on plan confirmation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 31 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Appellant, this argument fails, as \"[t]he Debtors can easily pay [him] the full amount of his claim if his appeal is successful\" as such \"additional recovery by [Appellant] does not present a risk of fatally scrambling the Plan; nor does it present a risk of significant harm to third parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 36 at 1, 12). Appellant urges the Court to use its remedial powers to fashion the relief he proposes: an order directing Reorganized Debtors\n   to pay 100% of Appellant's claim, plus several months' interest, so he may \"receive the same treatment of holders of general unsecured creditors in Class A7.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to the merits, Appellant argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in concluding that the Plan did not improperly classify Class A6 Claims separately from other general unsecured claims. Appellant argues the separate classification was motivated \"solely for the discriminatory purpose of not having to pay holders of the 2018 Notes Claims in full.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 29 at 14; 31-35). Appellant argues that even if the Plan's separate classification of general unsecured claims was proper, the Plan unfairly discriminates in its treatment of 2018 Note claims, and that the Bankruptcy Court erred in its application of the Markell test (discussed below). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18). Appellant argues that the Bankruptcy Court failed to properly consider whether Debtors had rebutted the presumption of unfair discrimination and relied instead merely on gifting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18). Appellant argues that such a gift cannot rebut the presumption of unfair discrimination under the Markell test, and that the entire concept of gifting has been flatly rejected by the Third Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Conversely, Reorganized Debtors argue that Appellant relies on cases that prohibit the use of gifts in contravention of the absolute priority rule, which is not at issue in this appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 37 at 14). \"That body of law prohibits the gifting of a distribution from a senior class of creditors in a manner that skips over an intermediary junior class of dissenting creditors - \"vertical gifting\" - because it violates the strict requirements of the absolute priority rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The distribution in this case concerns unequal gifts by a secured creditor to two classes of junior creditors - horizontal gifting - which is not foreclosed under Third Circuit law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). According to Reorganized Debtors, courts in this circuit have held that such a horizontal gift is not unfair discrimination against the class that does not receive the larger gift when (i) the creditor that does not receive the larger gift is not entitled to a distribution under a plan, and (ii) no class junior to the creditor receives a distribution under the plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). Debtors argue that confirmation of the Plan is consistent with controlling caselaw on the issue as well as the legislative history of \u00a7 1129(b), which makes clear that unfair discrimination is not an absolute rule, but is instead evaluated case by case from the dissenting \"class's own perspective.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 595, 1st Sess. 417 (1977) ). Finally, the Reorganized Debtors contend that the Bankruptcy Court correctly concluded that the Plan's classification complied with legal standards in this circuit, which permit separate classification of trade and bondholder claims based on their legal attributes. Reorganized Debtors argue the uncontroverted record supports the Bankruptcy Court's finding that separate classification of Trade and Business-Related Claims serves the rational purpose of fostering the Debtors' reorganization. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a final judgment of the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). In reviewing the bankruptcy court's determinations, this Court \"review[s] the bankruptcy court's legal determinations\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   its factual findings for clear error and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Trans World Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1299600,1344577\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/124/\">\n    145 F.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (3d Cir. 1998) (noting that both the Third Circuit and the district court \"exercise the same standard of review\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Appeal Meets the Criteria for Equitable Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \" 'Equitable mootness' is a narrow doctrine by which an appellate court deems it prudent for practical reasons to forbear deciding an appeal when to grant the relief requested will undermine the finality and reliability of consummated plans of reorganization.\"\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   , 799 F.3d at 277. A court assesses equitable mootness through the application of \"prudential\" considerations that address \"concerns unique to bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149417,3503795\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/161/\">\n    690 F.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (3d Cir. 2012). The Third Circuit's recent decisions have synthesized the test for equitable mootness as \"proceed[ing] in two analytical steps: (1) whether a confirmed plan has been substantially consummated; and (2) if so, whether granting the relief requested in the appeal will (a) fatally scramble the plan and/or (b) significantly harm third parties who have justifiably relied on plan confirmation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n    799 F.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re SemCrude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696620,6051821\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/314/\">\n    728 F.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (3d Cir. 2013) ). Reorganized Debtors, as the proponents of an equitable mootness dismissal, \"bear[ ] the burden of overcoming the strong presumption that appeals from confirmation orders of reorganization plans - even those not only approved by confirmation but implemented thereafter (called 'substantial consummation' or simply 'consummation') - need to be decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Appellant concedes that the Plan has been substantially consummated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 36 at 12 (conceding that \"the Plan has been substantially consummated\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 44 at 17:20-18:2). The record supports this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If it is established that substantial consummation has occurred, the next step for a court considering equitable mootness is to \"look to whether granting relief will require undoing the plan as opposed to modifying it in a manner that does not cause its collapse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    SemCrude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696620,6051821\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/314/\">\n    728 F.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Granting Appellant Higher Individual Recovery than Class A6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellant apparently does not seek revocation of the Plan and the imposition of a new chapter 11 plan in its place. (D.I. 44 at 17:19-18:2). Although Appellant's confirmation objection sought denial of Plan confirmation only, Appellant argues \"that does not mean that the only relief available after the substantial consummation of the Plan is a complete unwinding of the Plan and a return to bankruptcy for the Debtors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 36 at 13). Rather than apply equitable mootness and dismiss his appeal, however, Appellant contends that the Court should exercise its remedial powers and fashion relief in a way that would not upset the Plan -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"by ordering payment of his claim in full\" so Appellant may \"receive the same treatment as the holders of general unsecured creditors in Class A7.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Third Circuit instructs that the \"starting point is the relief an appellant specifically asks for.\"\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n    799 F.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The only specific relief Appellant proposes is \"full recovery\" which is a much higher individual recovery than other holders of claims in Class A6. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 44 at 23:22-24:9) Thus, in considering available relief to cure unfair discrimination, the Court's \"starting point\" is an order directing Reorganized Debtors to \"provide [Appellant] with the same treatment as general unsecured creditors - payment of 100 cents on the dollar plus interest\" - as compared with the 4-6% recovery provided to other members of Class A6. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Appellant, \"because no bondholder other than Mr. Hargreaves filed a timely objection to the Plan, there is no danger that paying Mr. Hargreaves would require additional payments to any other bondholder.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) That such relief would result in disparate treatment of Appellant's claim as compared with all other bondholder claims in Class A6 - precisely the issue that predicates the appeal - is of little concern to Appellant and of much concern to the Court.

Having placed the 2018 Noteholders in the same class, Reorganized Debtors argue, it would violate \u00a7 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Court to provide Appellant alone with a full recovery. Section 1123(a)(4) requires that \"a plan shall ... provide the same treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class, unless the holder of a particular claim or interest agrees to a less favorable treatment ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201123\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).

However, the gifted distributions were funded by the collective, agreed concessions of various senior lenders, and the Court cannot order those creditors to supplement a gift made voluntarily.

Assuming Appellant is successful on appeal, however, it is unclear what other practicable relief I may grant at this point. To meet their burden, the Reorganized Debtors assert that there is no practicable relief that can be granted with respect to the unfair discrimination and improper classification arguments at issue in this appeal that would not collapse the Plan and harm third parties who justifiably relied on plan confirmation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 31 at 12-18; D.I. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Debtors argue that to address the unfair discrimination issue, the only possible remedy would be to provide equal recoveries to all unsecured creditors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 31 at 13). Reorganized Debtors argue that they do not have $40 million in cash that would be required to pay claims of former holders of the 2018 Notes in full. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Even if sufficient cash were available, there would be no practical way to distribute it, according to Reorganized Debtors, as the 2018 Notes were cancelled under the Plan, and the indenture trustee for the 2018 Notes discharged of its duties and obligations under the governing indenture. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). As Reorganized Debtors lack sufficient cash to pay bondholders in\n   full, the only other relief would be to recover funds and balance recoveries among general unsecured creditors. In\n   <em>\n    Tribune,\n   </em>\n   the Third Circuit noted that \"if funds can be recovered from third parties without a plan coming apart, it weighs heavily against barring an appeal as equitably moot, both in our Court and other circuits.\"\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n    799 F.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reorganized Debtors argue that this is not such a case. According to Reorganized Debtors, ordering disgorgement and recovery of the gifted distributions, and redistributing those distributions evenly among Classes A6 and A7, \"would involve a massive, and likely impossible, disgorgement exercise:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Although it is possible to conceive of a disgorgement scenario to recover all Gifted Distributions that had been provided to all unsecured creditors in order to redistribute them among former holders of Class A6 Claims and General Unsecured Claims, such a recovery effort would be virtually (if not actually) impossible to accomplish. The exercise would involve seeking the disgorgement of Reorganized Nuverra Common Stock, which is freely trading on NYSE American. Courts in this Circuit have recognized that there is no practical way to retrieve distributions from public security holders ... It is for that reason that the Third Circuit has \"most frequently found that a plan could not be retracted when the reorganized debtor issued [publicly] traded debt or securities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (D.I. 31 at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    One2One,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357343\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/428/#p436\">\n    805 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   436 ) ). Additionally, Reorganized Debtors assert that a disgorgement of payments from customers and vendors who have continued doing business with the Reorganized Debtors \"would irreparably damage [those] relationships ... and disrupt ongoing operations, jeopardizing stakeholder recoveries:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The Reorganized Debtors operate in a variety of remote areas where the vendor base is limited, and many are small businesses. [F]ailing to pay vendors in some of these locations would have led those vendors to refuse to do business with the Reorganized Debtors, creating significant operational problems in areas where those vendors are not replaceable. [A] disgorgement exercise that involves the clawback of payments to vendors and suppliers would in turn lead to the loss of credit, vendors, and suppliers, which would cause significant harm to all stakeholders, especially senior creditors who own the Reorganized Debtors' equity and depend on the success of the Reorganized Debtors' businesses to achieve a recovery in these cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 32 at 8, \u00b6 14 (affidavit of CRO) ). Thus, disgorgement would require the claw back, not only of cash payments made to hundreds of individual creditors, but also the claw back of stock that is trading on the national stock exchange, and which now may be held by third parties who purchased those securities in the ordinary course. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ). This case is therefore unlike the\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   case in which the Third Circuit suggested disgorgement as a possible remedy.\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339626,4330015\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/272/\">\n    799 F.3d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To address the improper classification issue, Reorganized Debtors argue that the only possible remedy would require \"having the Reorganized Debtors go back into chapter 11 in order to develop an amended plan that classifies all unsecured claims in the same class and provides all creditors in the single class with the same treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 31 at 16-17). Reorganized Debtors argue that, having repaid the DIP Loans on the Effective Date, they no longer have access to liquidity to fund a second trip through chapter 11, which makes a forced liquidation through chapter 7 a likely outcome. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). \"If the Reorganized Debtors were forced to re-enter bankruptcy to revise their plan, I believe liquidation is a likely possibility, given that the Reorganized Debtors lack financing for a second Chapter 11 case, and had an extremely difficult time obtaining financing for the case they just emerged from.\" (D.I. 32 at 8, \u00b6 15 (affidavit of CRO) ). As with the remedy of providing equal recovery to general unsecured creditors, reclassifying the claims to balance distributions and to achieve the same result would \"require undoing the plan as opposed to modifying it in a manner that does not cause its collapse,\" and would result in harm to third parties who have justifiably relied on the Plan.\n   <em>\n    SemCrude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696620,6051821\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/314/\">\n    728 F.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court recognized the overall harm to the Debtors and other third parties that may result on appeal: \"the consequences of an adverse ruling on appeal of a reversal of this confirmation order on appeal, frankly, the risks lie with the other constituents in this case, not with [Appellant] ...\" (7/24/17 Hr'g Tr. at 14:24-15:3). The Court is unable grant Appellant higher individual recovery than other members of his class within the confines of the Bankruptcy Code.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   , the bankruptcy court applied the Markell test to a plan that involved classes that benefitted from differing treatment, receiving an increase in their recovery of between 47.8% and 53% on a dollar basis, which was caused by the forced sharing of a \"Disputed Allocation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962380\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/472/223/#p242\">\n    472 B.R. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record is clear that unsecured creditors are entitled to nothing under the Bankruptcy Code's priority scheme, and an increased distribution to unsecured creditors holding Trade and Business-Related Claims does not diminish the distribution to holders of claims in Class A6. If holders of Trade and Business-Related Claims did not receive this increased recovery, the surplus distribution would revert to secured creditors, not holders of claims in Class A6. As Appellant and his class were not entitled to a distribution in the first place, providing a greater distribution to a different class of unsecured creditors does not alter the distribution to which Appellant is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Appellant argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred by failing to address whether the two bases for rebuttal specifically mentioned by Markell were satisfied. Rebuttal of the presumption is discussed briefly by Markell:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The unfair discrimination in these situations is only presumptive. The plan proponent may overcome the presumption based on different percentage recoveries by showing that a lower recovery for the dissenting class is consistent with the results that would obtain outside of bankruptcy, or that a greater recovery for the other class is offset by contributions from that class to the reorganization. The presumption of unfairness based on differing risks may be overcome by a showing that the risks are allocated in a manner consistent with the prebankruptcy expectations of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Markell, 72 Am. Bankr. L.J. at 228.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   In either case-disparity of recovery or disparity of risk-the plan proponent\n   can rebut the presumption of unfairness by proving that the difference in treatment is attributable to differences in the prepetition status of the creditors. In the case of a difference in the present value of the recovery, the presumption may also be overcome by a demonstration that contributions will be made by the assenting classes to the reorganization, and that these contributions are commensurate with the different treatment. In such cases, while discrimination exists, it is not unfair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 250. Appellant argues that if the Bankruptcy Court had considered Markell's bases for rebuttal, neither prong would have been met here, as (i) ad unsecured creditors would be entitled to exactly the same percentage recovery outside of the Plan, and (ii) there is no proof that the holders of [Trade and Business-Related Claims] will infuse any new value into the reorganization.\") (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 29 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   While Appellant argues these are the \"only\" bases for rebutting the presumption of unfair discrimination (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16), neither Markell nor any of the cases cited by Appellant suggest any limitations on the case-specific facts and circumstances which might rebut the presumption of unfair discrimination. As Reorganized Debtors correctly argue, \"the Markell test is not the only basis for rebutting a presumption of unfair discrimination, and the Bankruptcy Court was not required to evaluate these bases for rebuttal ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 37 at 23). As noted above, Markell did not address a situation where, as here, the classes in which disparate treatment was occurring both were receiving their recoveries solely on account of a gift from a senior class. A reading of Markell does not support the limitations on the Bankruptcy Court's analysis that Appellant asserts, nor would such limitations be consistent with the Bankruptcy Court's broad discretion to consider case-specific facts in the context of plan confirmation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Genesis I\n   </em>\n   , a case with virtually identical facts, the court found the presumption of unfair discrimination was rebutted in the horizontal gifting context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genesis I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499998\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/591/#p612\">\n    266 B.R. at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Third Circuit has yet to mandate application of the Markell test in determining whether a plan discriminates unfairly, and Markell's useful analysis is not exhaustive of the facts and circumstances that may rebut a presumption of unfair discrimination. Under the facts of this case, the holders of Class A6 were not harmed by the disparate recovery provided to Trade and Business-Related Claims, and ad unsecured creditors did significantly better than they would have outside of chapter 11 or under a plan of liquidation. To the extent the Bankruptcy Court did not specifically address the Markell bases for rebuttal in its bench ruling, Appellant cites no case law in support of such a limited, formulaic application. The Bankruptcy Court's analysis is consistent with the Markell analysis undertaken in\n   <em>\n    Genesis I\n   </em>\n   .

Claims in Class A6 (2018 Note Claims) are legally distinct in nature from claims in the other classes of general unsecured claims. Creditors in Class A6 derive their claims from the 2018 Note indenture, a single debt instrument governing the 2018 Notes. In contrast, the holders of claims in Classes A7, B7 and C7, containing Trade and Business-Related Claims, all have claims that arose in connection with the Debtors' business operations, not indentures or similar financial instruments, including certain contingent litigation claims related to the Debtors' operations and businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Reorganized Debtors further cite decisions by \"[n]umerous courts [that] have held that separate classification and treatment of trade claims is acceptable if the separate classification is justified because they are essential to a reorganized debtor's ongoing business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant disputes this argument, arguing that the separate classification was motivated \"solely for the discriminatory purpose of not having to pay holders of the 2018 Notes Claims in full.\" (D.I. 29 at 14). However, Appellant's only argument in support of discriminatory purpose is circular: essentially, that the separate classification otherwise \"makes no sense.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). \"The origin of a given unsecured claim has nothing to do with whether a business reason exists for providing that claim with better treatment going forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellant's argument regarding discriminatory purpose is unavailing. The Bankruptcy Court's decision rested on its finding that the separate classification of trade creditors from noteholders fosters the reorganization. This finding is supported by the record, including Debtors' CRO's confirmation hearing testimony that the separate classification and treatment of the Trade and Business-Related Claims was necessary (i) to \"preserve what little trade credit the company did have remaining,\" (ii) because the businesses are typically operated in smaller towns with limited vendors, and (iii) because not paying any particular vendor would likely tarnish the reputation of the Debtors and harm relationships with other current or future potential\n   vendors.
