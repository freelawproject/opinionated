Cary.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case examines the permanence of an exemption claim in proceeds resulting from the sale of the debtor's homestead in a converted chapter 7 case in a jurisdiction with a temporal limit to its homestead proceeds exemption, also known as a \"vanishing\" exemption. The applicable exemption for Maine debtors who seek to protect the proceeds from the sale of their homesteads requires that the proceeds be reinvested in a residence within six months of the sale. Here, Mr. Rockwell filed for chapter 13 relief, received proceeds from the sale of his house during the pendency of the chapter 13, but failed to reinvest all of the proceeds in a new residence before he converted his case to one under chapter 7 and before six months passed from the date of the sale. The chapter 7 trustee lodged an objection to Mr. Rockwell's claim of exemption pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b) and a trial was held on May 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the trustee's objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2001, Mr. Rockwell bought the real estate and buildings located at 24 B Street, South Portland, Maine. When he filed for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on August 19, 2015, he owned the property and resided there. On his bankruptcy schedules, Mr. Rockwell claimed he was entitled to an exemption of $47,500 of equity in the property pursuant to the Maine homestead exemption statute, 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1). This court confirmed Mr. Rockwell's chapter 13 plan of reorganization in November 2015 and his plan anticipated that he would pay the holder of the first mortgage on that property directly and would retain the B Street property. However, by December of 2016, Mr. Rockwell sought permission to sell the B Street property for $160,000 and contribute any non-exempt proceeds of the sale to his chapter 13 plan. At the hearing on the motion to sell the B Street property, the chapter 13 trustee, in his words, \"mildly\" voiced his concerns about the sale price but expected the court to grant the motion to sell as being a proper exercise of Mr. Rockwell's business judgment. On January 12, 2017, the court entered an order authorizing Mr. Rockwell to sell the B Street property and to pay from the proceeds of the sale (1) his ordinary and customary closing expenses, (2) the balance due to U.S. Bank, and (3) to contribute any non-exempt proceeds of the sale to his chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The closing for the sale of the B Street property occurred on March 6, 2017, and after the payment of the closing costs and the first mortgage obligation, the amount of $51,682.87 remained and was distributed between Mr. Rockwell ($47,500) and the chapter 13 trustee ($4,182.87). The chapter 13 trustee never objected to Mr. Rockwell's exemption claims and on August 7, 2017, Mr. Rockwell converted his case to\n   one under chapter 7. As of the conversion date, Mr. Rockwell had spent $18,806.23 of the cash proceeds of the sale, leaving a balance of $28,693.77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon conversion, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure permitted the chapter 7 Trustee an opportunity to object to Mr. Rockwell's exemption claims, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1019(2)(B), 4003(b), and on December 4, 2017, he did so after the court granted his motion to enlarge the time to file such objections, to which Mr. Rockwell consented. Mr. Rockwell resided at the B Street property until September 2017, when he established his residence at 25 Bancroft Court, Portland, Maine, which was owned by Lorraine H. Flint. Mr. Rockwell has never held an ownership interest in the Bancroft Court property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Positions of the Parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The chapter 7 trustee objects to Mr. Rockwell's exemption claim on the basis that Mr. Rockwell failed to reinvest the cash proceeds from the sale of his B Street property in a new residence within six months of the sale of the property, as required by 14 M.R.S.A.\u00a7 4422(1)(C) which provides: \"That portion of the proceeds from any sale of property which is exempt under this section shall be exempt for a period of six months from the date of receipt of such proceeds for purposes of reinvesting in a residence within that period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the temporal limits of the Maine exemption, the chapter 7 trustee argues, the cash proceeds lost their exempt status when Mr. Rockwell failed to reinvest in a residence in a timely manner. Therefore, these funds must be delivered to the chapter 7 trustee to be administered under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Rockwell counters that the chapter 7 trustee's objection must be overruled because (1) the vanishing nature of the six month rule of 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(C) runs counter to the Code, (2) the objection disregards controlling First Circuit authority, (3) Mr. Rockwell's right to a homestead exemption was fixed on the date he filed for bankruptcy relief, and (4) Mr. Rockwell's investment of proceeds into the Bancroft Court property is protected under 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(C), notwithstanding his admission that he has no ownership interest in that property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no specific controlling authority from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on the exact issue presented in this case and there is no uniform approach among the courts to vanishing state law homestead proceeds exemptions in bankruptcy. To address the issue here this court must examine (1) the effect the bankruptcy filing has on the debtor's property, (2) whether the conversion in this case is of any consequence, and, most importantly, (3) how courts treat vanishing exemptions in chapter 7 cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Under Maine's homestead exemption, Mr. Rockwell can protect up to $47,500 in real or personal property that he or his dependents uses as a residence. 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(A). It also allows the proceeds from the sale of exempt property to retain its exempt status for six months for purposes of reinvesting in a residence. 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon filing for bankruptcy relief, Mr. Rockwell claimed the full $47,500 exemption in his B Street property in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(a) and 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(A). He then proposed a chapter 13 plan which was premised, in part, upon his retention of the B Street property. Time passed, and circumstances changed for Mr. Rockwell. He sought court permission to sell the B Street property and, after the chapter 13 trustee weighed in over the treatment of the non-exempt portion of the sale proceeds, this court approved the sale by a final, non-appealed order. The closing occurred, and the chapter 13 trustee accepted $4,182.87 in funds as being the non-exempt component of the sale proceeds while Mr. Rockwell received $47,500 as exempt proceeds. A little over five months after the sale of the B Street property, Mr. Rockwell converted his case to one under chapter 7 and the chapter 7 trustee was appointed to the case. At no time during the chapter 13\n   portion of the case did the chapter 13 trustee challenge the exempt status of the $47,500 proceeds. However, four months after conversion, and after the six-month time limitation in 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(C) expired, the chapter 7 trustee objected to Mr. Rockwell's exemption in the cash proceeds. He asserts that in keeping with the specific wording of 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4422(1)(C), the passage of more than six months after the sale of the B Street property transformed the exempt cash proceeds into non-exempt assets which must be included in the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Effect of Conversion from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When Mr. Rockwell converted his case, he brought other Code sections into play. Section 348(a) provides that the conversion of a case from one chapter to another under the Code does not change the date of the filing, the case commencement, or the order for relief for purposes of the converted case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   So although Mr. Rockwell converted his case to chapter 7 in 2017, the 2015 filing date is the appropriate time to use to determine his rights to exempt proceeds. It is also an important date in the determination of the extent of the property of the bankruptcy estate in the converted case.\n   <em>\n    In re Tracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6101826\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/28/189/\">\n    28 B.R. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 n. 1 (Bankr. D. Me. 1983). Section \u00a7 348(f)(1)(A) provides that so long as the debtor does not convert a case in bad faith, \"property of the estate in the converted case shall consist of property of the estate, as of the date of filing of the petition, that remains in the possession of or is under the control of the debtor on the date of conversion.\" Bad faith is not alleged here, therefore, prior to considering the issue of exemptions, property of Mr. Rockwell's chapter 7 estate included the property he scheduled in his chapter 13 filings which was still in his possession upon conversion. When Mr. Rockwell filed his chapter 13 case in 2015, he owned his residence but when he converted his case to chapter 7 in 2017, only $28,693.77 of the proceeds from the homestead's sale remained in his control and only this amount was, before considering exemptions, property of the chapter 7 estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That leaves the ultimate question: whether the $28,693.77 is exempt property or whether Mr. Rockwell's failure to reinvest it within six months of the sale date caused its protective status to evaporate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Vanishing Exemptions in Proceeds in Chapter 7 Cases.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Courts differ in how vanishing exemptions in homestead proceeds are addressed in the chapter 7 context.

However, courts disagree over the scope of the snap-shot; over what exactly the snap-shot captures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Some hold that the snap-shot rule requires that exemptions to which the debtor is entitled in homestead proceeds must be determined by examining the exact scope of the exemption as of the time of the bankruptcy filing and if, post-petition, the debtor fails to reinvest the proceeds within the time frame permitted by the state exemption, the exemption expires. Thus, the snapshot is a partial one and not everything is fixed precisely as of the filing date. From this perspective, the proceeds must lose their exempt status if not reinvested in the relevant statutory period and then would be available to the chapter 7 trustee to administer.\n   <em>\n    In re Zibman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949944,1950007,9466807\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/298/\">\n    268 F.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2001) provides an example of this view. There, the chapter 7 debtors sold their residence two and one-half months before filing for bankruptcy relief. They did not reinvest the cash proceeds from that sale in a residence within six months as required by the Texas exemption law.

Thus, the debtor must reinvest all of the proceeds in a residence or she would lose her exemption in them.
