The bankruptcy resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and creditors losing tens of millions of dollars. The Committee filed an adversary proceeding with a 78 count Complaint alleging fraudulent transfers, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court conducted a five day trial and received hundreds of exhibits, numerous deposition transcripts and over 300 pages of the parties' proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The parties involved in the adversary proceeding are: the Plaintiffs, which is the Committee acting on behalf of the Debtors; and the Defendants, Comvest Group Holdings, LLC; Comvest Investment Partners III, L.P; Comvest Haggen Holdings III, LLC; Comvest Haggen Holdings IV, LLC; Comvest Advisors, LLC; Haggen Property Holdings, LLC; Haggen Property South, LLC; Haggen Property North, LLC; Haggen Property Holdings, LLC; Haggen Property Holdings II, LLC; Haggen SLB, LLC; and individual defendants John Caple, Michael Niegsch, Cecilio Rodriquez, John Clougher, William Shaner, Blake Barnett and Derrick Anderson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Committee and the Defendants litigated the adversary proceeding earnestly and thoroughly, but civilly and courteously. Both sides were very well represented by their lawyers, whose advocacy was outstanding. The Court nonetheless must name the winner and the loser based upon the evidence presented and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Individual Defendants made every effort to make the Project a success and that the risk they took is what a capitalist society encourages and its legal system protects. The Defendants also argue that the Committee's legal theories shifted and that the Committee did not bring a single creditor to the trial to support its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Committee argues that there is nothing wrong with risk-taking but here the Defendants structured the Project to place all of the risk on the OpCo creditors while, at the same time, protecting their investment. The Defendants did so by structuring the Project using OpCo's and PropCo's. The OpCo's were the operating stores which filed for bankruptcy, and the PropCo's held the real estate assets and they did not file. As a result, the OpCo's\n   sustained all of the injuries and their creditors will be unpaid, while the PropCo's were left largely unscathed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Committee formulated a strong case that (1) Haggen was unprepared for the Project, (2) the OpCo were undercapitalized, and (3) Comvest structured the Project to provide for all of the risk at OpCo, while PropCo would succeed regardless of the success of the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Project failed for a number of reasons which the Court discusses below. However, the Court does not share the Committee's view that the Defendants were so cavalier in planning and effecting the Project that they were grossly negligent or that there was anything inherently wrong with the OpCo-PropCo structure. Indeed, no creditor of the OpCo's appeared in court or gave deposition testimony complaining about the debacle. The Project failed but not because the Defendants did not care if it succeeded. Moreover, it is not uncommon for parties who are planning a transaction to make certain that they are protected in the event the transaction fails. Such protection from adverse results is one of the reasons for forming a corporation or other entity - to limit personal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is unnerving that the Project failed in a matter of months and certainly the Court had questions about how it happened. It turns out that the people in charge, the Individual Defendants, to some degree were not prepared. They were not, however, grossly negligent and they certainly meant for Haggen, Holdings and the OpCo to succeed. The Committee made a strong case but, at the end of the day failed to establish gross negligence or self-dealing or the existence of any fraudulent transfers. The Committee did establish that the leases between Spirit and GIG, and the OpCo's, were above the market rate, but there is no liability. The Committee failed however, to establish the remaining counts of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A brilliant jurist once wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, to allege that a corporation has suffered a loss as a result of a lawful transaction, within the corporation's powers, authorized by a corporate fiduciary acting in a good faith pursuit of corporate purposes, does not state a claim for relief against that fiduciary no matter how foolish the investment may appear in retrospect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Gagliardi v.

Ch. 1996). The case involved allegations of mismanagement and, as the quoted material makes clear, the Court of Chancery, under the helm of Chancellor William T. Allen, dismissed the complaint.\n   <em>\n    TriFoods\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that fiduciaries who enter into \"foolish\" transactions but who are acting in good faith are protected. The facts in the Haggen's case illustrate managers and companies who in retrospect acted foolishly but who the Court finds are not liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction And Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

Specifically, defendant CGH, a Comvest entity, purchased its majority stake in Haggen, Inc. through two newly-formed limited liability companies, Holdings and Acquisition, which it formed for that purpose. Thus, in January 2011, CGH formed Holdings and acquired 80% of the membership interests of that entity with the Haggen family obtaining the balance of the membership interests, and at about the same time, CGH also formed Acquisition. Holdings solely owned the membership interests in Acquisition, and Acquisition owned all of the stock of Haggen, Inc. PTO \u00b6 32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    20. Over the next four years, under Comvest's direction, Haggen closed a number of unprofitable stores. As of the end of 2014, Haggen operated 18 grocery stores and one pharmacy on a profitable basis.

In the summer of 2014, Caple learned that the FTC required Albertson's and Safeway to divest a substantial number of stores as a condition to the closing of their proposed merger and identified this as an opportunity for Comvest. On August 13, 2014, Comvest submitted its initial indication of interest to acquire 22 stores in Washington and Oregon. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 104:25-105:18; PX 4; PTO \u00b6\u00b6 34, 46. Comvest originally focused on Washington and Oregon because those were the states in which Haggen operated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    22. On September 15, 2014, the Deal Team informed the IC that the number of stores being considered had increased from 22 to approximately 43, and all were located in Washington and Oregon.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    PX 4.004\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    PX 8.002. The IC was also informed that the appraised value of the real estate associated with those 43 stores exceeded the proposed purchase price by $56 million. The Deal Team described the proposed transaction as \"transformational\" but noted that it also \"provide[d] integration execution risk (i.e., Haggen's current infrastructure will need to absorb 43 additional stores).\" Trial Tr. (10/16) at 106:2-8; 106:25-112:17; PX 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    23. Several weeks later, Comvest was informed by Albertson's representatives that Comvest would also have to bid on stores located in California to remain competitive. The Deal Team informed the IC of this development and noted that, although the execution risk would increase as Haggen entered new markets, they believed the proposed transaction was \"too juicy\" to pass up, in part, because of the value of the owned real estate associated with the stores.

On November 3, 2014, the Deal Team informed the IC that, among other things, \"Albertson's has asked us to take 16 additional stores in Nevada and Arizona,\" nine of which were situated on fee-owned real estate and two of which were subject to ground leases. The IC was also told that Albertson's was \"adding these stores to our deal for no additional purchase price because it makes their lives easier,\" and that the appraised value of the real estate associated with the stores in Nevada and Arizona was $56 million.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    25. The Deal Team also included certain projections described as \"downside scenarios.\" Clark and Marrero focused their attention on the value of the real estate. In particular, both Clark and Marrero sought assurances from Caple about the value of the \"underlying real estate (in downside scenarios)\" because, according to Marrero, \"that affects [the] decision tree more than anything.\" Trial Tr. (10/16) at 119:22-123:6, 296:9-298:6; Clark Tr. at 116:20-117:10, 117:20-119:2; DX 79; PX 9. Indeed, Clark acknowledged that the \"potential to acquire real estate with underlying value\" was one of the \"key components\" to Comvest's deal thesis. Clark Tr. at 109:25-111:14; PX 26.005.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    26. A month after Clark and Marrero sought assurances as to the value of the real estate, the Deal Team requested authority from the IC to submit Haggen's final bid, and submitted a \"deck\" in advance of the meeting. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 123:12-15; PX 30. In the deck, and at the meeting, the Deal Team told the IC that the \"all-in purchase price of $430M\" would be funded with the proceeds from the Sale Lease Back Transactions and the ABL, and would yield, among other things, residual real estate with an appraised value of $118 million, all of which would be transferred to the PropCo Entities. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 123:16-126:19; PX 19.004.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    27. Several weeks later, before Haggen closed on the first store, Falk and Niegsch conferred on, among other things, the economic benefits that Comvest expected to reap from the real property. Specifically, and consistent with the representations set forth in the December deck, Niegsch confirmed for Falk that the PropCo Entities would have (a) unencumbered real estate appraised at $117 million, and (b) annual rental income of $13 million from the OpCo Entities (pursuant to the PropCo Leases), all for Comvest's ultimate benefit.

Comvest knew in September that the initial proposal to acquire just 43 stores in Washington and Oregon states where it was already operating presented significant integration risks because Haggen was going to need to integrate the Albertson's and Safeway stores \"into our chain and rebrand them. So there was an awful lot to do to get that done.\" According to Caple, \"infrastructure,\" included employees, software and IT systems, union and vendor relationships, purchasing and distribution processes, and back office operations. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 112:18- 114:4; PX 8.003. Caple knew that these integration risks would increase as stores continued to be added.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     at 119:10-17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    29. Less than six weeks before the signing of the APA, certain of the Individual Defendants and Comvest's advisors identified substantial transaction risks and potential downside scenarios, including:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    \u2022 \"sales growth/banner conversion would have no benefit at all\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    \u2022 \"no labor savings at all, ever\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    \u2022 \"store expenses are up some, 5%, 10% from base case\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    \u2022 While the Haggen brand may bring positives, it \"isn't going to overwhelm the customer at first.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    \u2022 \"We are fighting headwinds like eliminating the Von's card and fuel programs; not small takeaways.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    \u2022 \"We are eliminating banners that have a presence for years, and while somewhat tarnished, still maintain a loyal customer base.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    PX 157.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    30. Separately, in December, SuperValu raised concerns to Comvest and Haggen about \"logistics/slotting,\" the process whereby decisions are made concerning the assortment of products that would be put on the shelves. SuperValu advised them that \"[a]ssortment decisions must be made by Haggen immediately\" or there would be \"[r]isk to customer experience and out of stocks.\" PX 273.004.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Pricing Risks Were Identified\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    31. The pricing risks were among the most significant risks that were identified to the Defendants. The evidence establishes that Defendants were specifically advised prior to the execution of the APA that if Haggen failed to execute its pricing strategy, it would likely suffer a loss of customers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    32. On October 6, 2014, shortly after ATK was hired, Caple told Hooper that there \"seems to be a huge capability gap around pricing at Haggen.\" Trial Tr.

On October 15, 2014, after having been alerted to the issue, ATK identified \"pricing\" as one of the \"Key Decisions/Issues To Be Addressed\" and advised Comvest and Haggen to \"maintain\" existing prices in the short-term in order to \"minimize changes for [the] consumer.\" PX 211.010. Hooper advised Haggen that if Haggen did not maintain existing prices, particularly for \"like items,\" Haggen was likely to lose customers. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 146:22-147:17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    34. ATK was terminated by early December.

Comvest and Haggen apparently thought they could \"outsource\" the pricing logistics to SuperValu. Trial Tr. (10/19) Tr. at 35:16-25; PX 72-0027. This assumption proved problematic because, among other reasons, (a) SuperValu had no prior relationship with Safeway, and (b) Comvest and Haggen decided to keep the legacy stores running on their own independent platform thereby preventing the integration of all three parts of the newly-formed enterprise. SuperValu (Collison) Tr. at 40:9-13, 41:21-42:6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    36. The logistics of training everyone on the various information systems created additional risks. SuperValu, for example, had to train all of the Safeway employees as well as approximately 130 merchants (the corporate-level managers that make \"item and price and promotion decisions and assortment decisions.\").\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     at 43:7-44:25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

When the very first store opened, there were considerable pricing problems that resulted in multiple \"shelf tags\" for the same items; this created a laborious, complex set of issues that required determinations to be made as to which tag was the correct one, and then match that tag with the \"point of sale system.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     at 51:9-54:11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The evidence shows that Haggen and Comvest (a) provided the FTC with a business plan and a set of projections (that did not include a \"downside case\" or a \"real bad downside case\" showing Haggen with barely any liquidity), and (b) participated in one in-person meeting with the FTC that lasted two to three hours. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 224:3-22; DX 72, PX 318.

Comvest and PNC had a long-standing relationship that preceded the Albertson's Acquisition, with PNC already having extended credit to \"five or six\" of Comvest's portfolio companies.

On August 30, 2014, Niegsch wrote to PNC about Haggen's potential acquisition of stores from Albertson's and Safeway and emphasized that \"[g]iven the dynamics, we are going to be able to pick up the stores and some valuable real estate for a very attractive price.\" Niegsch expressed interest in \"upsizing our current ABL facility and putting some leverage on the real estate.\" PX 366.004.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    43. By October 2014, the Albertson's deal had expanded to include certain California stores and PNC was asked to lead a\n    $150 million underwriting for a revolving, asset- based loan. PNC was advised that Comvest planned to take out a $61 million term loan against the fee-owned real estate, with $50 million of the proceeds used to finance a \"Comvest Dividend payable at closing.\" PX 367.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    44.

PNC (Goldstein) Tr. at 74:3-77:3; PX 369. These Committees approved the proposed transaction and provided six \"business justifications\" for the loan including the profitable nature of the deal to PNC, PNC's \"extensive history with Comvest,\" and the fact that the loan was to be a \"fully-secured, fully-monitored, revolver-only facility.\" PX 369.004.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    45. Although PNC ultimately approved the loan, PNC's underwriters considered Haggen's proposed $180 million ABL risky and assigned it a \"risk rating\" of 12B. According to PNC, the numerical part of the risk rating is an assessment of the probability of the prospective borrower's default with \"1\" being the least likely and \"14\" being the most likely to default. The alphabetical part of the risk rating is an assessment of PNC's loss in the event of default or, stated another way, PNC's perception of the quality of collateral, with \"A\" being the most secure (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , cash collateral) and \"G\" being the least secure (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , unsecured).

The opportunity to purchase the real property at such a substantial discount to market provided Garrison with the financial incentive to proceed, and the strategy of selling the real property individually over a nine-month period mitigated substantially all of the risks identified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    VII. Comvest's New Corporate Structure\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    54. The Committee contends that all of the claims at issue arise, in the first instance, from Comvest's decision to create a \"PropCo/OpCo\" structure in connection with the Albertson's Acquisition. To be clear, there is nothing illegal, improper or unfair about the utilization of a PropCo/OpCo structure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    55. The Committee contends that Comvest's adoption of the PropCo/OpCo structure in this case was problematic for at least the following reasons: (a) the structure was adopted on the eve of, and in connection with, a \"transformative\" transaction (b) the transaction involved an eight-fold increase in the number of Haggen's stores, including Haggen's expansion into three new states where Haggen had no prior name recognition, customer affinity, or reputation, (c) the transaction was fraught with substantial execution risks,\n    (d) the OpCo Entities were inadequately capitalized from the outset and remained so, and (e) Comvest devised the PropCo/OpCo structure with the specific intent of securing the economic benefits of the real estate for itself, whether the transaction succeeded (by leveraging the real estate to pay dividends to Comvest, and creating $13 million in annual cash flow from the rent due under the PropCo Leases and subleases), or failed (by placing the real estate beyond the reach of the OpCo Entities' creditors, Comvest intended to provide itself with \"downside protection\" in the event of a \"disaster\" or \"liquidation\" scenario).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    56. The parties agree on certain basic facts. From the time of Comvest's investment in Haggen in 2011 through December 1, 2014, the equity owners of the enterprise (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Comvest and members of the Haggen family, through HHI) owned the membership interests in Holdings, which owned all of the membership interests in Acquisition, which owned all of the common stock in Haggen, Inc. as follows:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    PTO \u00b6 55.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    57. On the eve of the Albertson's Acquisition, Comvest caused Haggen to create ten new entities within a new \"PropCo/OpCo\" structure:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    58. The evidence establishes that Comvest created this structure with the intent of keeping the assets and liabilities of the PropCo Entities separate from the assets and liabilities of the OpCo Entities. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 147:19-148:6. Caple admitted that the effect of the PropCo/OpCo structure was to prevent the PropCo Entities' assets (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the real estate) from being used to satisfy claims made against the OpCo Entities. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 292:17-294:4. Clark expressed the same view, testifying that he knew the real estate assets would be transferred to the PropCo Entities and would be unencumbered, and that there would be \"no link directly between\" the PropCo Entities and the OpCo Entities. Clark Tr. at 122:10-123:14, 125:11-126:6, 127:2-128:21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    59. Comvest was intent on placing as much of the real estate as possible into an entity or entities that creditors of the operations could not reach. This topic came up on November 20, 2014, when Barnett, who needed to know the names of the entities for purposes of executing various contracts, asked Niegsch about the status of the \"legal entity structure.\" Trial Tr. (10/17) at 163:16-24; PX 29. Niegsch told Barnett that he was unsure, but if \"we have to take the [BofA deal advocated by Albertson's/Cerberus], we could probably keep this structure, but it would mean nothing from a silo-'ing' of assets and liabilities perspective.\" PX 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    60. At trial, Niegsch admitted that (a) the \"structure\" he was referring to was the PropCo/OpCo structure, (b) his reference to the \"siloing\" of assets and liabilities \"was to the structure that [Comvest] was pursuing that would have separated the operating assets and liabilities from the real estate assets and liabilities,\" (c) if Comvest took the BofA deal it \"wouldn't have a structure where the operating company had the operating assets and liabilities, and the real estate company had the real estate assets and liabilities,\" and (d) the effect of the PropCo/OpCo structure was that \"the property assets couldn't be used to satisfy the OpCo liabilities and the OpCo assets couldn't be used to satisfy the PropCo liabilities.\" Trial Tr. (10/17) at 44:7-46:2, 164:19-165:11 (cross-collateralization would permit the lender to foreclose on all assets in the event of default); PX 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    VIII.\n    <em>\n     The Transactions Were Interrelated And Dependent\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Holdings' Rights to Acquire Real Estate Were Transferred to PropCo Entities and SLB Entities Through the Contribution Agreements\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    61. With the corporate structure in place, Comvest executed on its strategy of the transfer of real estate assets from Holdings to the PropCo Entities and the SLB Entities through the use of the Contribution Agreements. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 62:20-63:8; PTO \u00b6 65.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    62. Holdings was the sole Haggen party to the APA and had the exclusive right to acquire, among other things, the real property assets, including fee-owned property and ground leases. PX 263. Haggen acquired the stores on a rolling basis. As the stores were acquired, Anderson signed Contribution Agreements whereby Holdings transferred its right to acquire specified stores to a PropCo Entity (if it was a fee owned property that was not included in an SLB transaction) or to an SLB Entity (if it was a fee owned property that was included in an SLB transaction). Trial Tr. (10/17) at 258:21-260:4; PTO \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; PX 263; PX 89-PX 103.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    63. Holdings received nothing in exchange for the transfers of its right to acquire the real property assets to the PropCo Entities and the SLB Entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Trial Tr. (10/16) at 126:20-127:25; Trial Tr. (10/17) at 260:16-20; 261:6-8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The SLB Transactions\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    64. Haggen financed the Albertson's Acquisition by using a substantial portion of the acquired real estate in two sale leaseback transactions pursuant to which (a) Holdings transferred its right to acquire certain fee owned properties to one of the SLB Entities pursuant to the Contribution Agreements (b) the SLB Entities then sold those fee-owned properties to the SLB counterparties (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    Garrison and Spirit) and (c) the sales proceeds were initially paid to the SLB Entities and most was then used to pay Albertson's purchase price; and the financial obligations under the SLB Leases were not assumed by the SLB Entities that received the money, but were placed on the OpCo Entities. Thus Haggen affiliates (the SLB Entities) received the proceeds from the SLB transactions. Another group (the OpCo Entities) assumed the obligations in the form of the SLB Leases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The SLB Transactions with Spirit\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    65.

PTO \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    67. An affiliate of Spirit, Spirit SPE HG 2015-1, LLC, as landlord, entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Operations, as tenant, as of February 12, 2015, with respect to certain of the other Spirit SLB Properties (together with any amendments thereto, and the Spirit Lease, the \"Spirit Master Leases\").

Haggen also entered into a Sale Leaseback Transaction with Garrison.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Garrison understood that Comvest was the majority equity owner of Haggen and negotiated the Sale Leaseback Transaction with Niegsch. Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 13:3-11. Garrison also understood that completion of the Sale Leaseback Transaction was dependent on Haggen's closing on the APA with Albertson's. Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 23:11-25:5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    69. On December 4, 2014, Holdings and Garrison executed a \"Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions\" (together with any amendments thereto, the \"Garrison SLB Agreement\"). PTO \u00b6 75; Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 25:6-18; PX 481. The Garrison SLB Agreement governed the \"sale\" part of the SLB transaction. Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 108:22-109:3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    70. Pursuant to the Garrison SLB Agreement, the SLB Entities sold 19 parcels of real estate (and improvements) located in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington (the \"Garrison SLB Properties\") for approximately $134.4 million. PTO \u00b6\u00b6 76. According to Garrison, Haggen determined which specific properties were included in the set. Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 36:21-37:8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    71. On February 17, 2015, Garrison, as landlord, and OpCo South and OpCo North, as tenants, entered into the Garrison Lease, as amended. The Garrison Lease set forth the terms by which the OpCo Entities leased each of the Garrison SLB Properties following Garrison's acquisition of them from the SLB Entities. PTO \u00b6\u00b6 82-84; Garrison (Rosenthal) Tr. at 107:13-109:3, PX 482.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    72. The SLB Transactions yielded $358.8 million. As intended, the proceeds were used to pay Albertson's (which included payment for all of the fee owned properties subject to the SLB Transactions as well as the twenty-eight remaining fee owned properties that were transferred free and clear to the PropCo Entities), with the residual proceeds of $50 million going to the OpCo Entities. PTO \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, 87.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    73. In exchange for the $50 million in SLB proceeds, the OpCo Entities assumed all of the massive long-term obligations under the SLB Leases.

James Howard offered expert testimony on the Committee's behalf concerning whether the SLB Leases were above market. Howard's ultimate conclusion was that the lease rates in the SLB Leases were above market. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 218:25-220:12. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Howard was a credible witness, his methodology is generally accepted, and the bases for his opinions were reasonable. The Court therefore credits Howard's opinions as set forth herein and finds that the SLB Leases were above market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    75. Howard is well-qualified to offer expert opinions concerning commercial real estate leases, particularly those concerning supermarkets. Howard has over 35 years of relevant experience, including 27 years working on behalf of lenders in the real estate and special assets/workouts fields. As the market manager for Wachovia Bank's West Florida lending division, Howard oversaw loans of over $500 million to retail developers related to grocery stores. Since 2008, Howard has been advising retail developers as a Senior Managing Director of GlassRatner Advisory &amp; Capital Group LLC. Based on his knowledge and experience, the Court concludes that Howard is qualified to offer his expert opinions concerning fair market rent. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 215:6-17, 216:9-217:1; PX 166.080-089.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    76. Howard was first retained in April 2017 and was asked to examine the master leases related to the SLB Transactions and compare them to what he \"would expect to see in the market at the time that the transaction transpired.\" Trial Tr. (10/19) at 214:19-24, 217:16. Howard assembled a team to assist him, and together they gathered and reviewed documents in connection with the preparation of a written report.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     at 217:20-218:18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    77. Howard's methodology was a classic \"comparable transaction\" analysis. After reviewing the Garrison CIM and Spirit confidential memorandum, Howard and his team used various databases to establish a \"market rent\" in each relevant geographic market. Howard and his team also visited each of the properties that was subject to the SLB transactions and conducted physical inspections to assess particular characteristics. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 220:13-221:13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    78. Howard compiled various schedules that included his \"comparable transactions.\" The primary sources for Howard's comparable transactions were Duff &amp; Phelps (commissioned by Spirit), Garrison, and CoStar. Howard focused on supermarkets (excluding all non-grocer tenants), eliminated smaller stores, and broke his\n    \"comps\" down by geographical area. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 221:17-227:3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    79. Howard's ultimate conclusions are that the SLB Leases were, in the aggregate, (a) $3.55 million above market on an annual basis, and (b) $17 million above market over the life of the leases. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 227:4-229:15; PX 166 (tables 11 and 11(a) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    80. Defendants offered the expert testimony of John Satter to rebut Howard's conclusions. Satter's principal criticism was that Howard did not provide for an annual rent escalation clause. This is a significant point because all of the SLB Leases were subject to annual rent increases. On cross-examination, however, Satter was forced to admit that Howard had reviewed each of the 79 third-party leases that Albertson's assigned to Haggen as part of the Albertson's Acquisition, and not a single one contained an annual rent escalation clause. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 266:14-268:1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    81. In light of the sound methodology employed, and the reasonableness of Howard's decision not to include an annual rent escalation clause, the Court finds that Howard's opinions are credible, and the SLB Leases were above market to the extent determined by Howard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The PropCo Leases/Rents\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    82. Simultaneous with the transfer of the fee-owned real estate to the PropCo Entities pursuant to the Contribution Agreements, Comvest caused the PropCo Leases to be executed pursuant to which the OpCo Entities were required to pay rent to their corporate cousins, the PropCo Entities. Notably, when the stores subject to the PropCo Leases were owned by Albertson's, they paid \"nominal rent\" of about $100 per store per year - a peppercorn - \"[j]ust enough so that we have some consideration.\" Albertson's (Beckstrom) Tr. at 16:8-18:22, 22:23-23:7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    83. The Court finds, as a matter of fact, that the PropCo Leases did not result from arm's length negotiations. Comvest unilaterally decided the terms of the PropCo Leases and directed Akerman to prepare them, and Anderson signed all of the PropCo Leases on behalf of both the \"landlords\" and the \"tenants.\" Trial Tr. (10/17) at 63:9-21, 261:13-24; PX 692-703. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 253:14-20, 254:14-21, 262:22-264:1. However, the Committee stipulated that the rental rates were not above market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Subleases (Ground Leases)\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    84. As with the Contribution Agreements and the PropCo Leases, Comvest also dictated the terms of the subleases between the PropCo Entities and the OpCo Entities pertaining to the ground leases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    85. According to Niegsch, at the time of the Albertson's Acquisition, Albertson's had a number of third-party ground leases. Comvest transferred the ground leases to the PropCo Entities and caused the OpCo Entities to enter into \"subleases\" at \"market rates\" with the PropCo Entities, pocketing the difference between the actual rent due under the ground leases and what Comvest determined the market rent to be. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 64:10-65:12. Each of the stores subject to a ground lease was forced to take a rent increase. Prior to the Albertson's Acquisition, the stores subject to the ground leases did not pay any additional \"rent\" to any Albertson's affiliate. Albertson's (Beckstrom) Tr. at 25:4-22, 27:7-31:25. Here, again, the Committee stipulated that the leases were at market rates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Comvest's Domination Of The Transactions And Terms\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    86. Caple admitted that Comvest: (a) controlled the Haggen enterprise, (b)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    structured the Albertson's Acquisition, (c) determined to pursue the SLB transactions, (d) made the decision to enter into each applicable agreement, (e) authorized Caple, as Manager, to enter into the APA, (f) approved the PropCo Advance in August 2015, (g) approved the commencement of these bankruptcy cases, and (h) decided which Haggen entities would file for bankruptcy and which would not.

Defendants have repeatedly asserted that Comvest contributed nearly $200 million into the Albertson's Acquisition, comprised of the legacy stores with an alleged value of $100 to $140 million and an \"equity investment\" of $50 million.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    , e.g., Hearing Tr. (9/26/17) at 26:24-27:2; Def. Trial Br. at 1, 2, 4, 29-30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Value Of Comvest's Interest In The Legacy Stores Was $26.5 million\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    88. As part of the Albertson's Acquisition, Comvest \"contributed\" the legacy stores by placing Haggen, Inc. on the \"OpCo\" side of the new corporate structure. Defendants contend that the value of the legacy stores was $100 million. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 50:21-51:7, 96:20-97:2; Def. Trial Br. at 1, 4, 29. At trial, Caple asserted that the Haggen legacy stores were worth between $100 to 140 million. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 269:17-21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    89. The best evidence of the value of Comvest's equity interest in the legacy stores is Comvest's contemporaneous communications to its investors. Comvest reported to its investors that as of December 31, 2014 (the time of the Albertson's Acquisition) Comvest's equity interest in Haggen was worth $26.5 million. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 274:20- 276:7; PX 636.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Comvest Never Intended To Make An \"Equity Investment\"\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    90. Comvest contends that it made an \"equity contribution\" of $50 million in the OpCo Entities in connection with the Albertson's Acquisition.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Trial Tr. (10/16) at 67:9-10; Def. Trial Br. at 1, 29. While Comvest \"invested\" (and lost) $50 million, the evidence conclusively establishes that Comvest did not intend to make an \"equity investment\" of any kind; rather, Comvest believed it was really making a short-term \"bridge loan\" at the insistence of the sellers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    91. Comvest did not believe that Haggen needed a $50 million \"equity investment\" to capitalize the OpCo Entities; rather, Albertson's and Cerberus insisted that Comvest put the money in and keep it there until Albertson's was paid in full, which Comvest expected to occur within 30 days after the closing of the last store in June. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 128:21-129:14, 131:6-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    92. On December 3, 2014, when seeking approval of the Haggen bid, the Deal Team told the IC that even though Comvest was putting in $50 million, it would \"have no risk outside its basis\" because (a) half the money would be used to pay back an existing Haggen loan that Comvest had guaranteed (thereby eliminating a potential $25 million obligation), (b) the balance was expected to be repaid to Comvest in the form of a tax distribution later in the SLB and conversion processes, and (c) Comvest was also contemplating making\n    dividend distributions equal to its \"investment\" by selling ground leases and leveraging the PropCo Entities' real estate. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 129:15-133:13, Trial Tr. (10/17) at 142:10-18; PX 19.004, 19.012 (setting forth Comvest's \"Real Estate Strategy Between Sign and Close/Comvest Dividend\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    93. At trial, Caple admitted that $20 million from the proceeds of Haggen's preexisting loan was used to pay Comvest a dividend. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 129:15-130:25; PX 19.004. In other words, half of Comvest's $50 million \"equity investment\" was used to pay off a $25 million loan previously taken out by Haggen, Inc. that was guaranteed by Comvest, and where most of the proceeds ($20 million) was previously used to pay Comvest a dividend.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    94. On January 27, 2015, before Haggen closed on the first Albertson's store, Falk sought confirmation that its \"investment\" would be risk-free and quickly recovered. Niegsch assured Falk that Haggen did not need Comvest's $50 million \"to fund this transaction,\" but the Deal Team agreed to it because Cerberus required it. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 46:3-13 PX 33.001. Comvest characterized the so-called \"equity investment\" as a \"bridge loan\" because as the Deal Team told the IC in December Comvest intended to quickly recover the $50 million as soon as it could.

After UBS and terminated negotiations, Comvest asked PNC to provide an overadvance to the OpCo Entities. But PNC knew at the time that the OpCo Entities had no unencumbered assets, were running out of liquidity, losing money, and had laid off hundreds of employees. PNC also knew that Haggen was looking to sell assets to generate liquidity and avoid running out of cash, that sales in the grocery stores were off by well more than 20% relative to projections, and that Haggen\n    had fared poorly on other financial metrics.

On August 3, 2015, PNC imposed a $2.5 million \"availability block\" thereby restricting that portion of the borrowing base from being available to Haggen.

The Committee asked Flaton to assess the facts and circumstances surrounding the PropCo Advance and evaluate whether the transaction \"looked more like a debt transaction or an equity transaction\" and whether it was \"inappropriately disguised as a loan and instead should be recharacterized and treated as an equity contribution.\" Trial Tr. (10/18) at 144:8-12; PX 118 at 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-257\">\n    142. Flaton has been a managing director at Zolfo Cooper, the Committee's financial advisor, for four years. During her time at Zolfo, Flaton has provided financial advisory and management services to debtors, creditors, and committees. Prior to joining Zolfo Cooper, Flaton spent approximately six years at Lazard Freres, where she served as a managing director advising public and private companies, creditors, and equity holders in\n    complex restructurings. Before that, Flaton spent, collectively, approximately thirteen years at Credit Suisse/Credit Suisse First Boston (1995-2006) and Citibank (2006-2008), working in lending, finance, and risk management. In sum, Flaton has spent over thirty years in the fields of banking and finance, including positions in leveraged finance, lending, capital markets, and risk management, with a specialization in financial restructuring.

Flaton's ultimate conclusion is that the PropCo Advance \"looked more like an equity transaction than a debt transaction.\" More particularly, Flaton stated that, in her opinion, based on her extensive experience in analyzing loans, debt exchanges, debt refinances, distressed company situations and equity/capital raises:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n    [D]espite how the PropCo Loan was documented and recorded in OpCo's financial statements, I believe the facts and circumstances that existed at the time the PropCo Loan was made, including OpCo's financial condition, strongly indicate that an independent third party lender would not have provided additional financing to OpCo on the same or similar terms to the PropCo Loan such that the PropCo Loan was more representative of a equity contribution than a loan.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-261\">\n    Trial Tr.

In reaching her conclusions, Flaton utilized the eleven-factor\n    <em>\n     Roth Steel\n    </em>\n    test and evaluated the facts and circumstances that existed at the time the PropCo Advance was made \"from the perspective of a restructuring, finance and investment banking professional.\" Trial Tr.

In order to analyze the PropCo Advance in context, Flaton reviewed certain documents and events, including: (a) \"very early... internal memos and e-mails saying that there was a liquidity problem,\" (b) the refusal by third parties, including UBS and PNC, to extend credit (UBS refused to lend against the PropCo real estate, and PNC refused to provide an \"overadvance\"), and (c) PNC's July 28, 2015, declaration of a default under the ABL and (d) Comvest's refusal to lend directly to the OpCo Entities due to concerns about \"equitable subordination.\" Trial Tr. (10/18) at 150:1-151:24; PX 118 at 16. Flaton explained how these events related to her opinions:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n    A: Well, again, I was asked to look at a transaction which occurred in August [2015]. And the question really was, is this a transaction that a third party independent lender, would they make a loan, a piece of debt into this type of a situation. So it's important to understand the condition of the company that's being lent into and some of the facts around it and the trajectory. And it's all besides being, you know, not great, sales were down and I think they were substantially off their budget from EBITDA to the tune of I think $80 million in this July [2015] timeframe. It was all happening very quickly. So, you know, you've had an acquisition of stores, but it literally did not transpire from day one the way it was meant to.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-265\">\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 151:25-152:15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-266\">\n    147. Flaton also analyzed the series of steps required to get the $25 million from Citibank to the OpCo Entities: (a) Citibank\n    agreed to advance $25 million to a newly-formed entity, Property Lender (wholly-owned by Comvest, at Citibank's insistence), secured by a guaranty from Comvest, (b) Haggen Property Lender then agreed to advance $25 million to the PropCo Entities, taking a lien on the PropCo Entities' real estate, and (c) Comvest then caused the PropCo Entities to agree to advance $25 million to the OpCo Entities, taking a second lien on the OpCo Entities' assets in return. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 152:16-154:8; PX 118 at 17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-267\">\n    148. With that background, Flaton analyzed the PropCo Advance in the context of the eleven\n    <em>\n     Roth Steel\n    </em>\n    factors. The Court will discuss Flaton's testimony and opinion in the \"Conclusions of Law\" section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-268\">\n    XIV.\n    <em>\n     Comvest's IC Expected The Real Estate To Be Unencumbered And Available For Comvest's Benefit In A \"Disaster Scenario\"\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-269\">\n    149. The IC members \"were not happy about\" having to use the PropCo Entities' real estate to fund the OpCo Entities' liquidity shortfall. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 177:1-19. The evidence shows, and the Court concludes, that when it approved the Albertson's Acquisition, the IC relied on, among other things, the Deal Team's assertions that the real estate assets would (a) be transferred to PropCo Entities and remain unencumbered; which (b) would, among other things, provide Comvest with substantial downside protection \"even in complete disaster/liquidation scenarios.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-270\">\n    150. The Court's conclusions in this regard are based on PX 20, PX 45, PX 190 (collectively, the \"Clark/Marrero E-mails\"), and PX 189. During the relevant time, Clark was a managing director at Comvest and a member of the IC. Clark Tr. at 8:9-9:22. Clark was not named as a defendant in this action and did not testify live. The Court has, however, admitted into evidence and reviewed Clark's videotaped deposition.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    196.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    151. From the outset, Comvest focused on the valuable real estate available in a potential deal with Albertson's. In that regard, prior to approving Haggen's entry into the Albertson's Acquisition, the IC was expressly informed that, among other things: (a) Haggen was acquiring substantial real assets significantly below the appraised value;(PX 23, PX 26, and PX 30) (b) the real estate would mitigate the operational risks (Trial Tr. (10/17) at 56:19-58:19; PX 30.006) (c) by transferring the real estate to the PropCo Entities and shielding it from the operational risks, Comvest would be protected in a \"downside scenario\" (PX 20.002) and (d) Comvest would make \"multiples of [its] money\" even in downside scenarios (PX 45.002, PX 190.001).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-272\">\n    152. By June 2015, Haggen faced substantial challenges and the issues concerning the protection afforded by the real estate came to the fore. On June 16, 2015, the Deal Team informed the IC that, among other things, even though the conversion process was not complete, same stores sales were down 20 to 25% and Haggen faced a liquidity shortfall. At around that time, Clark believed that Haggen could fail. Clark Tr. at 40:8-41:6. To address Haggen's liquidity shortfall, the Deal Team proposed leveraging the PropCo Entities' real property to support the OpCo Entities. Clark Tr. at 23:18-24:7, 25:18-26:9, 30:4-31:4; PX 16.004, 015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-273\">\n    153. The Deal Team's proposal struck a nerve with the IC because it contradicted what they had been led to believe. Caple recalled that \"a number\" of IC members\n    specifically told him that \"they were under the impression that Comvest could still get its money back in Haggen through the real estate, even in a disaster scenario\" with the OpCo Entities. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 177:20-24;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/16) at 177:25-179:7 (showing Caple recalled Clark telling him that he was \"under the belief that the underlying real estate value was money good in a disaster scenario\"). Caple's recollections in this regard are consistent with an e-mail that Clark sent to Marrero on July 14, 2015. Clark's e-mail stated, among other things, that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n    \u2022 PropCo/Downside\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n    \u2022 Under the impression/belief that the underlying real estate value was money-good in a disaster scenario\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n    \u2022 News to Michael [Niegsch] and us that PropCo value seems encumbered\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n    \u2022 ABS payable\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n    \u2022 SLB guarantee\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n    \u2022 Relied on this downside protection when approving the deal\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-280\">\n    Clark Tr. at 97:24-98:15; PX 20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-281\">\n    154. A few weeks later, Clark and Marrero collaborated on a more expansive version of Clark's e-mail. On Sunday, August 2, 2015, Clark and Marrero took turns wordsmithing a set of \"observations\" concerning Caple. Clark Tr. 72:15-76:22, 77:25-79:10; PX 190. Marrero then reorganized certain of the issues and presented the final document to Falk the following day. The issues set forth in these documents were the subject of numerous discussions among IC members. Clark Tr. at 64:14-65:23, 67:8-68:4, 69:11-16, 69:19-71:6, 80:3-20. The version that Marrero presented to Falk stated, among other things, that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n    \u2022 We must avoid IC discussion from being a \"sell job\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n    \u2022 IC relied on strong assertions that we would make multiples of our money on Haggen in even complete disaster/liquidation scenarios.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n    \u2022 We must carefully lay out [a] \"likely case\" as well as a \"downside\" case reflecting negative outcomes and the quantification of these financially\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n    \u2022 Guarantees and ABS Liabilities at Holdings not understood by the IC and/or Deal team.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n    \u2022 We should not rely on [Deal] Team's \"best thinking\" but rather show sensitivities with thoughtful assumptions on both upside and down.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-288\">\n    PX 45 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-289\">\n    155. Every member of the IC except Caple agreed with the substance of these communications. Nevertheless, after the Deal Team was unable to obtain a loan from unrelated third parties, Comvest's IC begrudgingly authorized the PropCo Entities to make the PropCo Advance, with certain IC members warning that they would not likely consent to the use of the PropCo Entities' assets again. PX 42.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez's Failure to Recall is not Credible\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-291\">\n    156. At trial, Rodriguez was unable to recall participating in any discussions or communications concerning the Clark/Marrero e-mails. The Court is highly skeptical that Rodriguez was able to recall details of conversations that preceded the Albertson's Acquisition, but was unable to remember any aspect of the critical (and more recent) discussions that took place in the summer of 2015 while Haggen was melting down and the IC was being asked to leverage the PropCo Entities' real estate to support the OpCo Entities. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 114:5- 120:23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-292\">\n    157. Rodriguez's complete failure to recall anything about these discussions is particularly concerning because Clark testified that Rodriguez was directly involved in addressing the issues raised in the Clark/Marrero e-mails. According to Clark:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n    \u2022 The Clark/Marrero e-mails were \"prepared in conjunction\" with Falk and Rodriguez for the purpose of giving Caple \"feedback\" (Comvest (Clark) Tr. at 61:16-62:7)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n    \u2022 Clark believed that Falk and Rodriguez met with Caple to discuss the observations on PX 45. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 69:11-16)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n    \u2022 Rodriguez, Falk, Marrero, and Clark discussed the substance of PX 45 in various combinations and subsets of groups in August 2015 (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 70:9-71:6) and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n    \u2022 Clark spoke with Rodriguez about the issues set forth in PX 190, and believed that \"a version of this document was shared with [Rodriguez] as well.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 80:3-20).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    158. Based on Clark's testimony, the Court finds that Rodriguez's failure to recall discussing any aspect of the Clark/Marrero e-mails was not credible. Consequently, the Court will draw a negative inference with respect to all of Rodriguez's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    XV.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Blame Of Others\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    159. The Defendants contend that Haggen failed for three reasons: pricing issues, supply issues, and unfair competition. Defendants also contend that there were three -- and only three - culprits: Willard Bishop, SuperValu, and Albertson's. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 82:16-87:10; Trial Tr. (10/17) at 9:1-10; Def.

Defendants contend that Willard Bishop contributed to the pricing problems that led to Haggen's demise. Neither Haggen nor Comvest took any steps to hold Willard Bishop accountable for the damage it allegedly did with respect to pricing issues other than to discontinue working with them. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 9:11-13, 9:24-10:13; Trial Tr.

Neither Haggen nor Comvest took any steps to hold SuperValu accountable for the damage it allegedly did with respect to the pricing and supply issues (other than to have \"lots of discussions\" with them). Trial Tr. (10/17) at 10:14-11:13. Indeed, as Barnett admitted, neither Haggen nor Comvest ever withheld payment from SuperValu, negotiated a reduction in the amounts due to SuperValu, or commenced an action against SuperValu.

PX 117. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, SuperValu was released from \"any\n    and all claims, demands, causes of action or sums owed, foreseeable or unforeseeable, which are based on conduct or inaction that occurred before\" the closing of each store.

Specifically, Haggen complained of (a) \"Improper Transfer of Inventory out of Purchased Store(s),\" (b) \"Overstocking and Understocking of Inventory\" (Haggen identified one store, acquired on February 26, 2015, where the inventory was allegedly so low that Haggen was forced to purchase approximately $208,000 of inventory to \"help refill the store,\" and another store where a bakery manager was allegedly instructed to \"purchase and/or bake 2 times her normal inventory levels\" thereby causing Haggen to purchase unneeded baked goods at that store, as well as other similar issues concerning inventory), (c) \"Failure to Advertise in the Ordinary Course of Business\" (describing as \"intentional misconduct\" discrete problems relating to advertising that lasted a week. FTC (Frangie) Tr. at 142:3-23, 148:14-149:9); Albertson's (Cummins) Tr. at 38:21- 39:14, 40:25-45:14), and (d) \"Misuse of Confidential Information and Failure to Use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Preserve Existing Relationships\" (alleging that Albertson's \"substantially increased their advertising and marketing in the stores being acquired, and that Albertson's did so \"based upon their knowledge of the Store Closing cadence\" (Trial Tr. (10/16) at 301:1-20) ). PX 266. Haggen also notified Albertson's for the first time that it would \"not make further payments of the Inventory Purchase Price\" under the APA until Haggen completed its investigation and the matters \"have been satisfactorily resolved.\" Trial Tr. (10/16) at 163:12-22; PX 266.006. According to Albertson's, Haggen had therefore not raised any issues concerning the pricing of inventory, and had not availed itself of the dispute resolution procedures in Section 6 of the APA, at any time prior to the date of the Demand Letter. Albertson's (Ewing) Tr. at 166:7-21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    166. Albertson's asserts that, far from engaging in \"anti-competitive\" conduct, Albertson's extended considerable courtesies to Haggen and made best efforts to cooperate during the store conversion process, including participating in weekly (or more frequent) meetings. Albertson's (Crandall) Tr. at 109:15-112:15, 161:13- 164:9, 60:17-62:12; Albertson's (Cummins) Tr. at 19:10-21:15, 45:25-47:20. The Court also notes that Albertson's met with the Monitor on a regular basis, and submitted \"Compliance Reports\" to the FTC, to report on the\n    progress of the conversions and address all issues concerning Haggen. Albertson's (Williams) Tr. at 141:15-159:23, 136:4- 16, 136:25-137:22, 160:6-176:12, 177:18:183:2; PX 598-610.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-310\">\n    167. The uncontroverted evidence shows that, at the time the Demand Letter was sent, Haggen faced a liquidity shortfall and knew that it would be unable to pay Albertson's approximately $43 million when it became due in July 2015. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 161:25-163:4, 164:3-24; PX 18.003. Indeed, the Deal Team virtually admitted that the Demand Letter was pretextual in their July 2015 report to the IC, writing:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n    Assuming the [Albertson's] inventory payments and conversion capex payables can continue to be delayed, the latest daily liquidity model shows Haggen getting very close to negative liquidity at the beginning of August and then going negative on August 21. If Haggen misses its plan targets or needs to begin paying off its delayed one-time payables it will hit negative liquidity sooner.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-312\">\n    PX 18.03.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-313\">\n    168. The uncontroverted evidence also shows that (with the exception of the issue concerning the advertising described above) no one from Haggen or Comvest complained to the FTC or the Monitor about Albertson's allegedly anti-competitive conduct until mid-July, and even those complaints came as a result of inquires placed by the FTC that were prompted by news reports concerning employee layoffs at Haggen. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 12:20-13:18; Trial Tr. (10/19) at 38:21-39-24, 127:20-23, 128:21-129:2, 198:16-199:23; FTC (Frangie) Tr. at 137:25-146:12 (although Haggen's counsel identified numerous reasons for Haggen's struggles, including that \"the Haggen brand and format did not seem to be catching on in California,\" only one of which was the \"significant competitive response\" from Albertson's).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-314\">\n    169. On July 17, 2015, less than three weeks after receiving the Demand Letter, Albertson's sued Holdings in the Superior Court of the State of California, Case No. BC 588598 (the \"Albertson's Action\"). Trial Tr. (10/16) at 165:7-166:6; Trial Tr. (10/17) at 11:22-13:1; PX 306. Albertson's asserted claims for breach of contract, anticipatory breach of contract (repudiation), fraud, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, all in an effort to recover the $43 million that was then due or about to become due. PX 306.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-315\">\n    170. On September 1, 2015, just six days before the Petition Date, Haggen filed a responsive action against Albertson's in which it sought $1 billion in damages (\"Haggen's Action\"). PX 613.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-316\">\n    171. Albertson's Action and Haggen's Action were resolved in the subsequent bankruptcy where the Court approved the Settlement Agreement. PX 117. The Settlement Agreement effectively embodied a \"walk away.\" Pursuant to its terms (a) Albertson's was obligated to pay $5.75 million into a creditor trust, (b) Albertson's was to receive an unsecured claim against Holdings in the amount of $8.25 million, and assign such claim to the creditor trust, and (c) the parties exchanged mutual general releases. PX 117.004-009. Comvest acknowledged its belief that this was a \"fair and equitable resolution to the billion dollar lawsuit that was brought.\" Trial Tr. (10/17) at 13:19-15:2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-317\">\n    172. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the pricing, supply and anti-competitive issues allegedly caused by Willard Bishop, SuperValu, and Albertson's were not the primary cause of Haggen's demise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-318\">\n    XVI.\n    <em>\n     Comvest's Projections\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Comvest's Projections Were Wrong\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    173. Prior to the Albertson's Acquisition, Comvest prepared projections of Haggen's future financial performance. These projections formed the predicate for determining the OpCo Entities' liquidity needs and capitalization. In the final version of projections presented to the IC, Comvest's \"base case\" assumed that Haggen would enjoy same store sales growth of 4.9% in the first year leading to earnings of $78.2 million. Based on these projections, Comvest underestimated the OpCo Entities' liquidity needs. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Comvest's \"base case\" was wrong and the overly optimistic assumptions caused the OpCo Entities to be undercapitalized from their December 2014 inception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    174. Comvest's industry consultant, ATK, created the 4.9% same store sales growth rate that was incorporated into Comvest's base case. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 106:14-16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    175. During his direct examination, Hooper testified that ATK's same store sales growth rate was based on certain objective data, \"net promoter scores\" and \"word clouds,\" case studies, and the erroneous assumption that Haggen's supermarket \"resets\" would occur during or prior to store conversions. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 106:14-113:17. The data that ATK relied upon included factors such as industry growth, population growth, and inflation, and its own generalized belief \"that the business could grow based on the strength of the brand and the strength of the proposition.\" Trial Tr. (10/20) at 105:18-24, 106:23-107:3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    176. ATK also relied on \"net promoter scores\" that showed Haggen's customers in Washington and Oregon had a positive view of the grocery chain. According to ATK, a \"net promoter score\" is a consumer survey designed to measure the strength of a brand because it shows \"the loyalty and the connection of the relationship that the consumer has with the brand.\" Trial Tr. (10/20) at 107:12-14, 108:4-8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    177. Finally, Hooper testified that ATK's same store sales growth rate was also based, in part, on the assumption that Haggen's \"resets\" would occur during or prior to the conversions, an assumption that ATK specifically advised Haggen would have a significant impact on expected sales growth. PX 107.024. The Court heard considerable testimony about the meaning of \"resets\" and \"conversions.\" The Court need not determine the precise meaning of these terms because the evidence shows that Haggen did not complete any \"resets\" prior to store conversions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    178. At trial, Caple admitted that total store resets were not supposed to occur as part of the conversion process because the stores came stocked with inventory that Haggen had to sell before it could do resets. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 150:24-151:24. Shaner also admitted that the \"decision was made to not do the reset\" until later in 2015, and observed that resets \"are extraordinary, literally moving tens of thousands of products takes about a week and that is in consideration of doing nothing else in the store.\" Trial Tr. (10/19) at 13:22-15:15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    179. The evidence shows that the scope and timing of the Project had no precedent: an 18-store chain expanding eight-fold by acquiring 146 stores spread out over five states (including three where Haggen had no prior market presence), and where entrenched competition would remain. The entire transaction (the scope of which changed over time from an initial 22 stores in Washington and Oregon in\n    late August 2014, to ultimately 146 stores in five states by November 2014) was negotiated in less than four months; Haggen had just several months to develop conversion plans, hire hundreds of workers and managers, and create the \"infrastructure\" necessary to run a business of this magnitude; and Comvest and Haggen willingly agreed to acquire and convert all of the stores in just 120 days (which the FTC extended to 150).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    180. David MacGreevey, an expert who testified on behalf of the Committee, presented a compelling analysis of \"comparable\" transactions showing that the Albertson's Acquisition was far greater in size, and was to be completed in a substantially shorter time frame, than any recent \"comparable\" transaction. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 36:6-37:11; PX 106.018. Even Shaner admitted that he had never seen a transaction of this magnitude. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 39:25-40:6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    181. Based on Hooper's testimony, Comvest's projections failed to take into account and were inconsistent with the actual pre-Albertson's Acquisition results of the Haggen legacy stores and the stores being acquired from Albertson's and Safeway. The evidence shows that sales at the legacy stores contracted in each of the four years from 2010 through 2013, before growing, but by only 0.5% in 2014 (when Comvest claims it engineered a turnaround at Haggen). Sales for the targeted stores also contracted or rose modestly (less than 2%) until 2014. PX 19.017; PX 26.008; PX 632.011. Notably, these historical results were attained without any of the risks that Haggen faced. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 115:16-117:6; Trial Tr. (10/17) at 142:19- 145:24; DX 79.006; PX 8.004. The Court is unable to reconcile the historical sales results, achieved without any of the foreseeable transactional or execution risks that Haggen confronted, with Comvest's projected base case 4.9% same store sales growth rate in the year immediately after the closing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    182. On October 31, 2015, ATK circulated another set of projections, including an \"upside case,\" a base case, and a \"downside case.\" The assumptions in the upside case were modified to assume even stronger same store sales growth in the second and third years. PX 157.005. On cross-examination, Shaner initially testified that he no longer had \"heartburn\" after receiving ATK's revised projections, and that he couldn't recall whether he agreed with the concerns expressed by Genser. Shaner was forced to recant that testimony after seeing that he, and Genser, and Barnett all expressed considerable concerns about ATK's later set of projections:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n    \u2022 Genser stated, among other things, that he did not \"believe the downside case [was] draconian enough\" and that \"year one could be worse that [sic] what is presented and it never bounces back.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n    \u2022 Barnett expressed the view that \"the downside is not a good representation of just how far 'down' could be, and therefore does not accurately represent both the Branding risk (SoCal) and Executional risk (both). My concern is that ATK presents, and therefore legitimizes the 'worst case,' which we know is not really the worst case.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n    \u2022 Shaner wrote: \"I am strongly in Ira and Blake's camp. There are so many moving parts, and so much turmoil to manage through, that I think it's only prudent to be keenly aware of the potential downside risk scenarios ... [w]e are eliminating banners that have a presence for years, and while somewhat tarnished, still maintain a loyal customer base ... I believe in the Haggen\n    brand's ability over time, [but] the challenges to sales and ebitda in years 1-2 are significant.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-333\">\n    Trial Tr. (10/19) at 24:22-29:5; PX 157.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-334\">\n    183. In essence, Shaner maintained the very same concerns that he told Barnett had caused \"heartburn\" just days before Shaner was forced to admit that (a) he believed Haggen faced \"significant challenge[s]\" to sales and EBITDA during the first two years, and (b) that what he \"foresaw back in October [2014] was exactly what happened. Sales and EBITDA in year one were just a disaster.\" Trial Tr. (10/19) at 29:6-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-335\">\n    184. In response to the concerns expressed by Genser, Shaner, and Barnett, Niegsch claimed to have prepared a \"real bad downside case\" showing the operating companies \"barely\" having any liquidity after \"cutting down Capex and G &amp; A and stretching payables for more breathing room in that scenario.\" PX 157.003. Niegsch relied on the \"real bad downside case\" to dismiss the substantial concerns that ATK's \"downside scenarios\" did not sufficiently take into account the transaction and execution risks, yet Niegsch could not identify the \"real bad downside case,\" and could not recall ever presenting it to, or discussing it with, the IC (or anyone else). Trial Tr. (10/17) at 136:24-139:24; Trial Tr. (10/19) at 101:13-18; PX 625.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-336\">\n    185. While the Court never saw Niegsch's \"real bad downside case,\" the evidence shows that Comvest's downside scenarios never showed the OpCo Entities losing any money. Trial Tr. (10/16) at 295:11-296:1. Indeed, prior to the time it approved Haggen's bid, the IC was never presented with a scenario that showed the OpCo Entities earning less than $40 million per year. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 62:7-12. Thus, although the Deal Team's downside projections assumed same store sales would decline by 5% in the first year (PX 19.026), the Deal Team changed other assumptions that mitigated the impact of the projected loss of sales such that Haggen still showed profits of almost $50 million in the first year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-337\">\n    XVII.\n    <em>\n     The Court Accepts As Credible MacGreevey's Opinion That The OpCo Entities were Insolvent and Undercapitalized\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-338\">\n    186. David MacGreevey offered expert testimony on the Committee's behalf concerning whether the OpCo Entities were insolvent and undercapitalized on the date of the APA (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , December 10, 2014), and each day thereafter through the Petition Date. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 5:14-19. MacGreevey did not opine on the solvency of the PropCo Entitites or Holdings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    187. MacGreevey's ultimate conclusion is that the OpCo Entities were insolvent and undercapitalized as of the date of the APA and each day thereafter. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 7:19-8:2. For the reasons set forth below, while the Court finds that MacGreevey was an able witness, the Court does not credit his opinion and finds that the OpCo Entities were not insolvent and undercapitalized at the signing of the APA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    188. MacGreevey is well-qualified to offer his expert opinion on issues of insolvency. He has spent more than fifteen years in the restructuring and finance arenas, including more than seven years in the restructuring group at Duff &amp; Phelps (and its predecessor, Chanin Capital Partners), and two years in the Restructuring and Special Situations practice of Macquarie Capital, before joining Zolfo Cooper LLC (\"Zolfo Cooper\") in 2011. MacGreevey has represented creditors and creditors' committees in a wide variety of cases and industries and has advised stakeholders on strategic transactions, including restructurings, mergers and acquisitions, and capital\n    raises. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 5:20-6:6; PX 106.064.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-341\">\n    189. MacGreevey testified that working with projections and forecasts of future financial performance, including developing and critiquing projections, business plans, and liquidity forecasts, is one of his and Zolfo Cooper's \"key competencies.\" MacGreevey has performed these services across a wide array of industries, including retail. While MacGreevey has some experience in the grocery sector (in particular, as advisor to the creditors' committee in A &amp; P, a prior bankruptcy case), he does not hold himself out as an expert in that industry. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 6:7-7:5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    190. MacGreevey was asked to render his opinions in early 2017. A team of professionals at Zolfo Cooper assisted MacGreevey. Together, they gathered and reviewed information and spent \"hundreds of hours\" on the project. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 10:23-12:8; PX 106.067-71. Ultimately, MacGreevey prepared a written report setting forth his opinions, the methodologies utilized, and the bases for his opinions. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 8:12-9:4; PX 106.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    191. Comvest's base case incorporated ATK's 4.9% same store sales growth rate. In contrast, MacGreevey's base case assumed that same store sales would contract by 8.6% in the first year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    192. Multiple parties reviewed OpCo's financials including the same store sales growth projections developed by ATK. These parties included the Deal Team, the Haggen management team, the IC, multiple lenders, the Sale Leaseback Counterparties, SuperValu, the FTC, and Unified Grocers. None of these parties ever argued that ATK's same store sales growth projections for OpCo were unreasonable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/16) at 218:9-25, 219:18-220:1, 223:4-24, 233:4-9 (Caple); Trial Tr. (10/17) at 89:21-90:7, 98:22-99:4, 99:20-100:15 (Niegsch).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    193. The basis for MacGreevey's assertion that Haggen should have projected negative 8.6% same store sales growth as opposed to positive 4.9% same store sales growth is that MacGreevey believes that Haggen should have applied ATK's \"pre-renovation\" projection numbers rather than \"post-renovation\" projection numbers. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 56:19-57:10. MacGreevey did not develop his own numbers, but chose from a table in an ATK spreadsheet that had pre-renovation and post-renovation projections.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 49:14-22. ATK used the post-renovation numbers rather than the pre-renovation numbers in developing their same store sales projections.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 57:21-58:5. Hooper testified that, based on his conversations with Haggen and Comvest as well as his review of the capital expenditure budget, it was appropriate to project the post-renovation benefit for OpCo. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 119:6-24 (Hooper).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    194. Hooper also testified as to multiple other reasons it was reasonable to project positive same store sales growth for OpCo. These reasons included, among others:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n    \u2022 Net Promoter Score: ATK performed a consumer survey of over 1,000 people to determine Haggen's net promoter score. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 109:20-21; 110:21-111:2 (Hooper); DX0072-0013. Haggen's high net promoter score in comparison to the net promoter score for Albertson's and Safeway gave ATK confidence that the brand could and would be successful. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 109:22-110:8 (Hooper);\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-348\">\n    \u2022 Word Cloud Surveys: ATK also performed a \"word cloud\" survey on over 1,000 people to see what words they associated with shopping at Haggen, Albertson's and Safeway.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 112:16-18. The word cloud survey supported the thesis that Haggen could keep the Albertson's and Safeway customers who cared primarily about price and location while also attracting the Haggen customers who also cared about freshness, local products, organic products, and other key words.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 111:16-112:15.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-350\">\n    \u2022 Case Studies: ATK also analyzed prior grocery store conversions in the form of case studies to support their projection that OpCo would experience positive same store sales growth. i\n    <em>\n     d.\n    </em>\n    at 112:19-113:17. Based on a review of the case studies, ATK placed Haggen on the top half of its two-by-two grids signifying ATK's view that renovations were being performed prior to the banner conversion.\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 119:6-24.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-351\">\n    195. MacGreevey relied in significant part on a series of capital expenditure ranges contained in a chart provided in an ATK presentation indicating a certain capital expenditure range associated with a \"refresh,\" a \"minor remodel,\" and a \"major remodel.\" Trial Tr. (10/18) at 21:18-23:13, 63:24-64:10 (MacGreevey); DX0041-0002. Those ranges, however, were not produced by ATK. Hooper testified that instead those ranges were provided by \"the storyteller\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    the people that ATK interviewed-from Winn Dixie who observed the store conversions in that case study. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 113:18-115:10 (Hooper); DX041-0002. And the Winn Dixie case study qualified as a \"store reset/remodel\" according to ATK's own analysis. DX0041-0009.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-352\">\n    196. Hooper testified that the plans to \"Haggenize\" the stores would fit within his view of a renovation. Trial Tr. (10/20) at 119:6-24 (Hooper). Thus, Hooper disagreed with MacGreevey and believed that post-renovation rather than pre-renovation numbers should be used in projecting same store sales growth.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-353\">\n    197. The Court finds that it was reasonable for Haggen and Comvest to rely on the same store sales projections developed by ATK. The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that Haggen intended to and did perform renovations at the acquired stores prior to reopening those stores under the Haggen banner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-354\">\n    198. MacGreevey also made an adjustment to \"fix\" certain operating costs rather than leave those costs variable as in the Management Base Case. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 75:14-78:4 (MacGreevey). If MacGreevey's adjustment to projected same store sales growth is rejected, then MacGreevey admits there is no impact to his adjustment to \"fix\" certain costs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 75:14-76:23 (MacGreevey). One of the costs MacGreevey determined should be 100% fixed was labor costs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 76:24-78:4 (MacGreevey). Shaner, Clougher and Hooper, all of whom (unlike MacGreevey) have extensive grocery experience, each testified that labor costs are not fixed in the grocery industry. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 93:2-14 (Shaner), 188:5-189:12 (Clougher); Trial Tr. (10/20) at 103:19-104:11 (Hooper) (\"Q. In grocery is labor a fixed cost or a variable cost? A. Labor is commonly understood to be very variable.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-355\">\n    199.

They seek to \"avoid\" transfers from Holdings to PropCo, but avoiding those transfers will not result in any additional money going to the OpCo creditors. The Committee alleges a breach of fiduciary duty claim, but the duties and the allegations do not match, especially when Holdings has always been solvent. The Committee seeks to add substantive consolidation (as a makeshift alter ego theory) on other claims to rearrange the corporate structure. Yes, the bankruptcy happened very quickly, despite Defendants' efforts and the rapidity of the business failure was shocking. The Committee challenged the events but fell short of proving fraud. One of the reasons for incorporating in Delaware is its well-established respect for the corporate form.

The Committee challenges these fundamental tenets of Delaware law, asking the Court to disregard Holdings' separate existence and distribute its assets to creditors of its subsidiaries, OpCo. This runs counter to the well-established rule that \"parent and subsidiary corporations are separate entities, having separate assets and liabilities....

The\n    <em>\n     Owens Corning\n    </em>\n    court announced a hard and fast rule that substantive consolidation was never allowed where creditors were aware of and relied on the debtors' corporate separateness.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8930497,8936874\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/195/\">\n     419 F.3d at 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that substantive consolidation is not available where creditors can prove \"they are adversely affected and actually relied on debtors' separate existence.\"). The\n    <em>\n     Stop &amp; Go\n    </em>\n    court, on the other hand, applied a very different standard, in which substantive consolidation was favored where the creditors understood the\n    separate corporate nature of the debtors.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118452\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/49/743/\">\n     49 B.R. at 750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he Court cannot find that the defendants were ignorant of the relationship of the companies.\").

One \"fundamental ground rule\" is that courts must limit \"the cross-creep of liability by respective entity separateness\" because \"the general expectation of state law and of the Bankruptcy Code, and thus of commercial markets, is that courts respect entity separateness absent compelling circumstances.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 211.

The Committee, however, has stated that its alleged entitlement to substantive consolidation flows from the Debtors and Defendants supposed prepetition disregard for corporate separateness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 111 at 19 (\"Ultimately, for the PropCo Entities to be consolidated, the Committee must show that, prepetition, they disregarded corporate separateness so significantly that their creditors relied on the breakdown of entity borders and treated them as one legal entity.\").

This is consistent with the experience of the Haggen management team, who all testified that (a) trade creditors never ask whether a grocery store owns real estate before extending credit, and (b) a trade creditor has never refused to extend credit to a grocery store on the basis that the grocery store does not own any real estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr.

Unified Grocers, who ultimately did $13-14 million of business per week with the OpCo Entities, actively sought a guarantee from the PropCo Entities on its extension of credit to the OpCo Entities, was denied, and made the business decision to extend credit to the OpCo Entities anyway.

The pro forma financial statements do not identify any real property and have a substantial line item for \"rent expense.\" As such, these creditors had in their possession financial statements from the OpCo Entities showing that \"OpCo\" did not own the real property upon which the stores operated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-376\">\n    In the Court's summary judgment ruling, it explained that \"[t]he Committee will have the opportunity at trial to prove what creditors did not know and relied upon,\" and that \"[a]fter trial, the Court will be in a better position to determine the creditors' recovery rights.\" D.I. 136 at 8.

In addition, almost none of the badges of fraud are present here. The transfers of the right to acquire real property to the PropCo Entities were not concealed. The deeds conveying the property from Albertson's property-holding companies to the PropCo Entities, Spirit, and GIG were publicly recorded.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , DX0219; DX0232; DX0250; DX0251; DX0268. Holdings was not under threat of suit when the transfers were made. The transfers were not for substantially all of Holdings' assets, as it continued to own the valuable membership interests of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Holdings did not \"abscond\" indeed, it is willing and able to pay all of its creditors. Holdings received equivalent value for the transfers because the property was placed in its wholly- owned subsidiaries. And finally, Holdings has at all times been solvent. Simply put, there is no evidence of an intent to defraud. The evidence showed Defendants intended to build and grow a business.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-406\">\n    The Committee did not prove that the use of the OpCo/PropCo legal structure was intended to defraud creditors. The Committee has stated that the OpCo/PropCo structure \"is what's on trial\" here, but admitted that these OpCo/PropCo corporate structures are not themselves improper. Trial Tr.

(10/18) at 184:14-19 (Flaton) (calling \"OpCo/PropCo structures\" \"fairly common\" in the \"business world\"). The Committee has not cited a single case in which maintaining a preexisting OpCo/PropCo structure amounted to a fraudulent transfer. The Court believes there are none.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-407\">\n    But even if there was an actual attempt to defraud the OpCo Entities' creditors, that would still not provide the basis for a claim alleging fraudulent transfer by Holdings to the PropCo Entities. The statutory text is clear:\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    only allows courts to avoid transfers made with an intent to defraud the transferor's creditors,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Holdings.

The law could not be clearer: Section 548 limits claims for fraudulent transfer to transfers that harm the transferor's creditors, not the creditors of some other entity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-408\">\n    The Committee's case theory is ultimately that Comvest undercapitalized the OpCo Entities. Even if intentionally undercapitalized, that would not have given rise to a claim for fraudulent transfer. Intentional undercapitalization has a number of remedies at law and equity, but a legal claim for fraudulent transfer is not one of them. Section 548 requires a \"transfer.\" There is no such thing as a claim for fraudulent non-transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-409\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Holdings' Solvency at the Time of the Transfer\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-410\">\n    It is the Committee's burden to prove that Holdings was insolvent at the\n    time it made the transfer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re EBC I, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5548390\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/380/348/#p354\">\n     380 B.R. 348\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 354 (Bankr. D. Del. 2008). Here, there is no evidence that Holdings was insolvent. And the Committee cannot seriously contend that Holdings is insolvent now, as its whole theory of the case is premised on recovering value from Holdings' equity and using it to pay the OpCo Entities' creditors. Instead, in its Opposition Brief to Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the Committee argues that if the Court grants the separate relief of substantive consolidation, then Holdings would be rendered insolvent and its claims for constructive fraudulent transfer could proceed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 111 at 28. This argument fails for three reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-411\">\n    First, substantive consolidation \"eliminates constructively fraudulent transfer avoidance claims\" among the consolidated entities.\n    <em>\n     In re Bauman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284413\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/535/289/#p301\">\n     535 B.R. 289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 301 (Bankr.

Here, there was no devastating effect on the transferor, because Holdings-not the OpCo Entities-was the transferor and Holdings transferred the real property downstream to wholly-owned subsidiaries (the PropCo Entities). This means that the property was not transferred outside the reach of any Holdings creditor because the value of the real property sat at Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiaries. The property likewise was not transferred outside the reach of the OpCo Entities' creditors, because it was never available to them in the first place. The Committee has not and cannot show that Holdings was insolvent at any point in time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-431\">\n    This case is also distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Mervyn's\n    </em>\n    because the Committee is not seeking to unwind all of the transfers. There is no claim asserting that any of the payments to Albertson's were fraudulent, and there is likewise no claim seeking to unwind rent payments to Spirit or GIG. The Committee alleges that the OpCo Entities paid above market rent to both Spirit and GIG, but has not sued them or sought to avoid the transfers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-432\">\n    The relief that the Committee seeks is thus simultaneously too broad and too narrow. It seeks to \"unwind\" transfers that never occurred and to recover property for the OpCo Entities' estates that they never owned in the first place. The Committee is also seeking to unwind only half of the transaction, collapsing and unwinding internal transfers to wholly-owned subsidiaries, while leaving the related payments and transfers to Albertson's, Spirit, and GIG in place. This has no support in the law and is unlike anything that took place in Mervyn's.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-433\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Mervyn's\n    </em>\n    , the Court ruled that it was appropriate to \"collapse\" the transaction, so that Target could be treated as a transferee even though the transfer of the real property took place after Target sold Mervyn's Holdings.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n     at 497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Instead of focusing on one of several transactions, a court should consider the overall financial consequences these transactions have on the creditors.\"). Because the Committee is not asserting any claims against Albertson's, such collapse is not needed here.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But, importantly, even if the Court did collapse the transfers in this case, that does not mean that any of the claims for fraudulent transfer survive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-434\">\n    Collapsing a transaction is not the same thing as a finding of fraudulent transfer; it is merely a tool to allow the Court to view the overall economic effect of a transfer.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    After a court collapses a transaction, it still needs to apply traditional fraudulent transfer rules to see if there was any fraudulent transfer.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    If the transactions here are collapsed, the result is a simple transfer of real property from Albertson's (the original transferor) to PropCo (the ultimate transferee). Collapsing the transactions does not save the Committee's claims because at no intermediate step of any of the transactions did OpCo ever have any interest in the real property. That is a clear difference from\n    <em>\n     Mervyn's\n    </em>\n    , in which Mervyn's LLC had owned the real property for years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-435\">\n    In addition, the Court may only collapse the \"transaction.\" The collapse doctrine does not allow the court to collapse separate entities, or pierce the corporate veil, or disregard the corporate form.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798726\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/488/#p492\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    To collapse \"entities\" under Delaware law, a plaintiff must satisfy the stringent veil piercing elements, something the Committee has not even attempted to do here.\n    <em>\n     Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v.

As discussed above, the transferor in this case is Holdings. The OpCo Entities' creditors do not have standing to sue on behalf of Holdings and avoiding the transfers in question would provide no benefit to Holdings' creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-437\">\n    Finally, the procedural posture of this case is different from the procedural posture in\n    <em>\n     Mervyn's\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Mervyn's\n    </em>\n    resolved a motion to dismiss filed by Target, the former owner of Mervyn's LLC. Here, the Court has the benefit of the evidence presented at trial.

D.I. 1 at Counts 20-38.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    OpCo North\n    and South did not own any real property, and therefore these leases were necessary for the operation of OpCo North and South's grocery stores. Moreover, the Committee has stipulated that the rental payments and obligations were market. Accordingly, the Committee has failed to show that these rental obligations under the PropCo Leases were constructively or actually fraudulent. In addition, the Committee has failed to provide any cognizable evidence of damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-440\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The PropCo Leases Were For Reasonably Equivalent Value\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-441\">\n    The Committee cannot meet the burden to prove a constructive fraudulent transfer because the OpCo Entities' rental obligations under their leases with the PropCo Entities were at market rates. Under Section 548(a)(1)(B) and its state law analogues, it is an essential element of a constructive fraudulent transfer claim that the transfer is not for reasonably equivalent value.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(B). The Committee bears the burden of establishing this element.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Key3Media Grp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943268\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/336/87/#p94\">\n     336 B.R. at 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Throughout its Complaint, the Committee alleged that these rent payments were \"above-market,\" but discovery has not proved this theory. The Committee has now stipulated in the Pretrial Order that \"Plaintiff will not offer any evidence that the rents paid by Operations and the OpCo Entities to the PropCo Entities were above-market.\" D.I. 142 at 21. Paying fair market rent for access to real property that the OpCo Entities needed to operate their business is a textbook example of reasonably equivalent value. That should be the end of the inquiry for the constructive fraudulent transfer claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-442\">\n    In light of these facts, the Committee now argues that, while the rents were market, the OpCo Entities \"did not receive reasonably equivalent value for their incurrence of long-term lease obligations as they were incapable of sustaining ordinary course business operations in the leased locations beyond a few months.\" D.I. 111 at 38. The Committee analogizes its argument to offering a dying patient a 10-year car lease.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    9/26/17 Hr'g. Tr. at 61:22-62:6. But this analogy shows the defect in the Committee's argument. The leasehold estate given to the OpCo Entities had value, just as the right to use a car has value. And the Committee has stipulated that the monthly rent due under the lease was reasonably equivalent to that value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-443\">\n    Further, the OpCo Entities assumed many of the PropCo Leases in the larger bankruptcy because the leases were in the best interest of the Debtors' estate. This assumption bars the Committee's fraudulent transfer claims with respect to these leases as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Network Access Solutions., Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915856\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/330/67/#p76\">\n     330 B.R. 67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 76 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005). In order to approve this assumption, the Court found that the assumption of these leases was \"in the best interest of the Debtors,\" and this finding is now the law of the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Order Authorizing The Debtors To Assume Certain Unexpired Leases, Case 15-11874, D.I. 1716 at 1 (\"[T]he relief requested in the Motion and provided for herein is in the best interest of the Debtors.\"). It would not have been a \"sound exercise of [debtors'] business judgment to assume the [leases] if it was not receiving equivalent value for the payments it was making under the agreements.\"\n    <em>\n     Network Access Solutions\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915856\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/330/67/#p76\">\n     330 B.R. at 76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Even if the Committee's claim is limited to the rejected\n    leases, the Committee failed to offer evidence as to what the value of those leases was, and whether or not it was reasonably equivalent to the rent due under those leases. This evidentiary failure resolves these claims in Defendants' favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-444\">\n    Finally, the Committee conflates its available remedies. The Committee is seeking to recoup the monthly rents actually paid by the OpCo Entities. D.I. 142 at 52 (Committee seeks to \"recover all amounts paid under the PropCo Leases.\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    But this cannot be the case, because in exchange for these payments the OpCo Entities actually received the right to operate, and did operate, on the real property. At most, the Committee's available remedy would be to avoid the future rent payments for the rejected leases. The future rent payments already form the basis of the PropCo Entities' lease rejection claim, which the Committee seeks to disallow in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 1 at Count 76.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-445\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Actual Fraudulent Transfer Claims\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-446\">\n    To support a claim of actual fraudulent transfer, the Committee must prove that the PropCo Entities signed the PropCo Leases with an \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" the OpCo Entities' creditors.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To be clear, the OpCo Entities did not own real estate so the PropCo Leases were necessary to operate their business for those 28 stores, and the Committee has stipulated that the PropCo Leases were at (or below) market. The Committee has failed to prove their constructive or actual fraudulent transfer claims based on rent payments owed under the PropCo Leases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-447\">\n    V.\n    <em>\n     BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY CLAIMS AT HOLDINGS (COUNTS 66 &amp; 68).\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-448\">\n    The Committee alleges in Counts 66 and 68 that Comvest (as the controlling shareholder) breached its fiduciary duty to Holdings and that Holdings' Managers breached their fiduciary duty to Holdings. D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 669, 689-693. These are legally and factually unsupported. First, Holdings was solvent and therefore all the fiduciary duties were to act in the interest of Holdings' equity-not, as the Committee claims, its creditors and subsidiaries. Second, the Committee's allegations are, for the most part, challenging arm's length transactions with third parties, and such conduct is protected by the Business Judgment Rule.\n    <em>\n     Sinclair Oil Corp. v.

Finally, the Committee is seeking damages sufficient to make every single creditor at every level of the Haggen corporate structure whole, yet it made no effort to present any evidence of this hypothetical amount. The Committee did not disclose any evidence of damages in discovery, it did not present any such evidence at trial, and now there is nothing in the record to support its damages request.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-449\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard For Breach Of Fiduciary Duty\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-450\">\n    Delaware courts recognize that a parent company does not owe fiduciary duties to its direct or indirect subsidiaries.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Trenwick Am.

There is no evidence that Comvest had any financial interest in Albertson's such that Comvest could be accused of owning an interest in the entity that was on the other side of the transaction. The evidence shows that Cerberus-another private equity firm-owned Albertson's, and that Cerberus made several demands on Comvest in order to complete the deal, including requiring Comvest to make a $50 million infusion into Holdings. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 48:17-49:3 (Niegsch). Likewise, there is no evidence that Comvest (or any other party) stood on both sides of the leases between the OpCo Entities and Spirit/GIG. Spirit and GIG are both sophisticated third parties.

But this is simply not true. It was Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries that were parties to the contribution agreements and the OpCo/PropCo leases. The transfers among Holdings and its subsidiaries benefited Haggen's other shareholders, the Haggen family, to the exact same extent they benefitted Comvest.

Likewise, the evidence showed that the OpCo/PropCo structure was instituted for sound business purposes that fall squarely within the scope of the Business Judgment Rule. The Committee failed to present any evidence that Comvest and Holdings' Managers intentionally acted with any purpose other than what was in Holdings' best interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-477\">\n    The evidence showed that the Defendants expended their best efforts and did all they could to work for Haggen's success. When the stores experienced pricing issues or supply issues, Comvest gathered its Deal Team and Management Team together to address those issues. It was \"all hands on deck.\" Trial Tr. (10/17) at 242:4-243:1 (Barnett). They spent extensive time with Supervalu and Willard Bishop, who had been hired to prevent these very pricing issues from happening, to come up with a plan to address the problems, all in an effort to enable Holdings' OpCo subsidiaries to succeed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402527\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/911/362/#p369\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Clougher and Shaner both testified that they thought the pricing issues had been addressed, only to find new pricing issues pop up at the next store.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-478\">\n    When faced with sufficient evidence of improper conduct by Albertson's, whether by design or in reality, Comvest and Holdings' Managers took steps to remedy the situation. They withheld more than $40 million in payments owed to Albertson's and then filed a lawsuit against Albertson's. While in hindsight they might have taken different actions that could have resulted in different outcomes, Delaware law will not \"impose retroactive fiduciary obligation simply because [the fiduciary's] chosen business strategy did not pan out.\"\n    <em>\n     Trenwick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8466013\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/906/168/#p173\">\n     906 A.2d at 173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In the Albertson's Acquisition, Comvest saw two distinct businesses-a grocery store operation and a real estate business-with two distinct time horizons that had two distinct business plans. Indeed, the corporate structure was set up in a way that Comvest and Holdings' Managers believed would maximize the effectiveness of both OpCo and PropCo, all for the benefit of Holdings. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 90:8-92:7 (Niegsch).

Because the claim is limited to Caple's actions at the Holdings level it fails for many of the same reasons that the nearly identical claim against Caple in his role as a Manager of Holdings failed. The Exculpatory Provision limited Caple's fiduciary duties as a manager of Holdings to the duty of loyalty and a lack of bad faith. At trial, the Committee failed to distinguish Caple's actions as a manager of Holdings from any action he took as an officer of Holdings. In such a situation, Delaware law allows the officer/manager to invoke the exculpatory clause that otherwise mentions only a manager.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Arnold v.

As such, in his capacity as an officer of Holdings, Caple can only be liable for a breach of the duty of loyalty and for acts in bad faith.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-489\">\n    The Committee presented no evidence that Caple was on both sides of the Albertson's Acquisition or that he personally benefitted from the transaction. Thus, there is no evidence that he breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty to Holdings. Nor is there any evidence that Caple acted in bad faith at any point as an officer of Holdings. Caple, like everyone at Comvest and Haggen, relied on the subject matter expertise of the numerous advisors they hired. The rationale for the OpCo/PropCo structure was explained at trial, there were two different businesses with two different business plans and two different time horizons. The evidence showed that Caple did not intentionally abandon any of his duties to Holdings. To the contrary. Caple spent enormous time and effort trying to make Holdings successful. While in the end it did not prove successful, to fulfill his fiduciary duties Caple needed only to act reasonably, not perfectly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-490\">\n    Caple was also a director of Haggen, Inc.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 142 at \u00b6 24. Haggen, Inc.'s Restated Articles of Incorporation contain an exculpatory provision in Article 8, which states as follows: \"A director of this corporation shall not be liable to this corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a Director.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DX0638. This provision limited Caple's fiduciary duties to the duty of loyalty and an absence of bad faith. The Committee failed to present any evidence that as a director of Haggen, Inc., Caple received any personal benefit from the Albertson's Acquisition or from the creation of the OpCo/PropCo structure while a director of Haggen, Inc. As such, the Committee failed to prove Caple breached his duty of loyalty to Haggen, Inc. As explained above, when Haggen, Inc. and the other OpCo Entities (OpCo North and OpCo South) experienced problems, Caple did not abandon his duties. He, Niegsch and the entire management team had \"all hands on deck\" meetings in an effort to help Haggen, Inc. survive. In the end, they were unsuccessful.

He \"remembered\" very few of the facts about the Project which the Court finds to be highly unlikely and disturbing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-493\">\n    Rodriguez occupied nearly all of the same positions as Caple. In addition to being a manager of Holdings, Rodriguez was also an officer of Holdings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 142 at \u00b6 25. The Committee failed to present any evidence at trial that distinguished Rodriguez's actions as a manager of Holdings from his actions as an officer of Holdings. The Exculpatory Clause therefore applies to Rodriguez's actions as an officer of Holdings. As such, in his capacity as an officer of Holdings, Rodriguez can only be liable for a breach of the duty of loyalty and for acts in bad faith. The Committee presented no evidence that Rodriguez was on both sides of the Albertson's Acquisition or that he personally benefitted from the transaction. Nor is there any evidence that he acted in bad faith. When the OpCo Entities needed money to meet payroll, Rodriguez was instrumental in allowing the PropCo Entities to loan $25 million to the OpCo Entities in an effort to make the entire Holdings' enterprise successful. Thus, Rodriguez did not breach his duty of loyalty or act in bad faith.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-494\">\n    Rodriguez was also a director of Haggen, Inc.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 142 at \u00b6 25. He is therefore covered by the exculpatory provision in Article 8 of Haggen, Inc.'s Restated Articles of Incorporation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DX0638. This provision limited Rodriguez's fiduciary duties to a duty of loyalty and an absence\n    of bad faith conduct toward Haggen, Inc. The Committee failed to present any evidence that as a director of Haggen, Inc., Rodriguez received any personal benefit from the Albertson's Acquisition or from the creation of the corporate structure while a director of Haggen, Inc.

The Exculpatory Clause therefore applies to Clougher's actions as an officer of Holdings.

Yet, the Committee presented no evidence that Clougher was on both sides of either the Albertson's Acquisition or the Challenged Transactions or that he personally benefitted from either. Thus, there is no evidence he breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty to Holdings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-497\">\n    Nor is there any evidence he acted in bad faith. The Committee presented no evidence that Clougher intentionally acted at any time with the purpose of anything other than advancing the best interest of the Holdings enterprise. Nor did the Committee present any evidence that Clougher acted in conscious disregard of his duties to Holdings. Clougher testified he spent hundreds of hours in the weeks leading up to the Albertson's Acquisition meeting, planning and testing various models and business plans to ensure that Holdings could be successful. After signing the APA, Clougher spent countless hours preparing for and then executing the store conversions. He also worked very hard trying to make the Holdings enterprise succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-498\">\n    Under the Business Judgment Rule, an officer's actions need only be reasonable and realistic, not perfect.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lyondell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7332232\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/970/235/#p243\">\n     970 A.2d at 243\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

For example, Clougher relied on ATK's projections for same store sales. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 154:13-18 (Clougher) Clougher testified that he believed that the projections were reasonable. Clougher's belief that the projections were reasonable was based upon the time and effort he spent on the business plan in the months leading up to the APA Signing Date and the presentations to the FTC.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4112875\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/528/30/#p51\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    PNC Bank had also provided an untapped $210 million ABL facility to the OpCo Entities to operate their business. Moreover, the OpCo Entities would have access to a $50 million equity infusion from Comvest. Further, the OpCo Entities were expected to receive, and ultimately did receive, approximately $50 million in excess proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-500\">\n    The record shows extensive evidence that Clougher made every effort to work for Haggen's success both before and after the acquisition of the new stores. He retained an experienced management that worked tirelessly on the conversions. Clougher testified that after the FTC awarded Haggen the stores, he and the rest of the Haggen Management Team spent extensive time and energy preparing to \"Haggenize\" each store and to hire the necessary staff. Clougher, Shaner, Barnett\n    and Anderson all testified that the changes in the stores had the effect that they hoped-they looked and felt like the legacy Haggen stores.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-501\">\n    Clougher also retained both SuperValu and Willard Bishop to make sure that the new Haggen stores properly priced the products. The evidence showed that once pricing problems arose, Clougher, Shaner, and other Haggen management worked hard to solve the pricing problems that arose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-502\">\n    In sum, the trial proved that Clougher relied on reasonable projections from industry experts to ensure that OpCo was adequately capitalized. He worked with both experienced Haggen management and outside experts and had sound reasons for concluding that the OpCo companies would succeed. The Committee presented no evidence that Clougher was grossly negligent in reaching that conclusion. All the Committee has done is point to the ultimate failure of OpCo and argue post hoc that there must have been some improper conduct, but this is the exact sort of hindsight challenge that the Business Judgment Rule prohibits.\n    <em>\n     Cede\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7361491\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/634/345/#p361\">\n     634 A.2d at 361\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-503\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     William Shaner's Fiduciary Duties\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-504\">\n    Like Caple, Rodriguez and Clougher, Shaner was both a manager and an officer of Holdings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 142 at \u00b6 29. The Exculpatory Clause therefore applies to Shaner's actions as an officer of Holdings. Shaner was also a director of Haggen, Inc., and so is entitled to the protection of the exculpatory provisions contained in Haggen, Inc.'s Articles of Incorporation. As such, in his capacity as an officer of Holdings, Shaner can only be liable for a breach of the duty of loyalty and for bad faith acts. The Committee presented no evidence that Shaner was on both sides of the Albertson's Acquisition or the Challenged Transactions, or that he personally benefitted from either.

After the APA Signing Date, Shaner spent countless hours preparing for and then executing the store conversions. He also worked very hard trying to make the Holdings enterprise successful. Shaner further sold his house in Missouri, abandoned other lucrative business opportunities, and moved out to California to make the enterprise successful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-506\">\n    Like Clougher, the evidence is that Shaner sought expert advice, and personally worked hard with Haggen management to make the company a success. Shaner was aware of ATK's projections for same store sales growth and believed that they were reasonable. Shaner testified that he believed that OpCo South did not need to own the real estate to be successful. Shaner described the tremendous efforts spent converting the stores. OpCo South personnel took over the stores at 12:01 a.m. on the day each store closed and then quickly launched many workers to convert the Albertson's stores into a Haggen store. Shaner testified that he felt they had accomplished the task with all of the stores, accomplishing that \"wow\" factor they had hoped to get. Trial Tr. (10/19) at 65:3-66:16\n    (Shaner).

Like the other officers, directors, managers, PNC, Spirit, GIG and the FTC, Barnett believed that ATK's same-store sales projections were reasonable. The Committee offered no evidence to show that Barnett's reliance on these projections, even if flawed, was unreasonable. The Committee presented no evidence that Barnett received any personal benefit from the Albertson's Acquisition or that he stood on both sides of the transaction. The Committee presented no evidence that Barnett believed that OpCo North or Haggen, Inc. needed access to the real estate or the liquidity therefrom in order to make the operations a success. The Committee offered no evidence that Barnett put the interests of any entity ahead of Holdings, Haggen, Inc., or OpCo North. Summarily, the Committee offered no evidence to rebut the presumption that Barnett's actions were reasonable and in the best interest of the companies of which he was an officer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-509\">\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Derrick Anderson's Fiduciary Duties\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-510\">\n    Anderson was an officer of Holdings, OpCo North, OpCo South and Haggen, Inc.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 142 at \u00b6 30.

The Committee likewise presented no evidence that Anderson intentionally abandoned any of this duties or took any action that put another entity ahead of the interests of the companies of which he was an officer. The undisputed evidence at trial showed just the opposite. Anderson had been a long-standing Haggen employee who visited various stores as they were converted and made an effort to ensure that the conversion process, including the onboarding of new labor unions, occurred efficiently and effectively. In an effort to ensure the effective implementation of the conversion process, Anderson had agreed to make himself available to sign the necessary paperwork that the company's lawyers advised him to sign, as well as to effectuate the various licensing paperwork that sometimes required him to be fingerprinted at different points throughout the process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-511\">\n    There was no dispute that the various Debtor and non-debtor entities needed to execute numerous documents in order to effectively convert the Albertson's stores to Haggen stores. Anderson testified that there were literally hundreds of documents to sign, and that often he was the only person consistently available to ensure the necessary legal documents were signed. There is likewise no dispute that he only signed the papers that had first been reviewed and approved by Haggen's lawyers. The Committee did not present any evidence that Anderson signed any document that had not been fully vetted by Haggen's lawyers.

Ch. 2009) (noting that the plaintiffs \"cannot use a claim for unjust enrichment to extend the obligations of a contract to [defendants] who are not parties to the contract.\"). The Committee is effectively arguing that there was a benefit to the PropCo Entities that would increase the equity owned by Holdings which would increase the share of the equity owned by Comvest. The Committee has also alleged that Comvest \"will unjustly benefit from [the] PropCo Entities' claim relating to the PropCo Advance [i.e. PropCo Loan].\" D.I. 144 at 37. This loan and the resulting claims in the bankruptcy were governed by the PropCo Loan Agreement (DX0416), an express, written contract. The existence of express contracts defeats Count 73.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-540\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Separately, The Committee Cannot Satisfy The Elements Of Unjust Enrichment.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-541\">\n    The Committee in its Trial Brief promised to prove that Comvest was unjustly enriched by its \"scheme to establish the PropCo/OpCo structure and impose the intercompany PropCo Leases on the OpCo Entities.\" D.I. at 144 at 37. Even setting aside the fatal flaw that this entire \"scheme\" was governed by written, express contracts, the Committee still failed to prove the necessary elements of unjust enrichment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-542\">\n    First, the OpCo Entities suffered no \"impoverishment\" by Holdings' decision to place the real estate assets in the PropCo Entities through an OpCo/PropCo structure. Unjust enrichment is meant to \"restore\" a party to \"to a previous position\" by \"restoring the very property that the claimant gave up\" or \"a money equivalent.\" Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 1 (2011). Because the OpCo Entities never possessed\n    the real estate assets, the Committee cannot ask the Court to \"restore\" the OpCo Entities to a position where they owned the real estate. In addition, because the OpCo Entities never owned the real estate, they had no reasonable expectation of \"compensation\" by Holdings' decision to place certain assets in the PropCo Entities rather than in the OpCo Entities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Moses\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012577167\">\n     2014 WL 12577167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-543\">\n    Second, the decision to use a PropCo/OpCo corporate structure is a common business practice, and therefore it is not unjust or unfair to the OpCo Entities. More generally, unjust enrichment cannot be used as the Committee seeks to do here to create an \"obligation of a parent\" corporation \"to stand by for the life of its 'child' to be sure it is always profitable.\"\n    <em>\n     Opus East\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4112875\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/528/30/#p51\">\n     528 B.R. at 103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-544\">\n    Third, the OpCo Entities' agreement to pay fair market rent under the PropCo Leases does not create an unjust enrichment. After substantial discovery, the Committee has stipulated that \"Plaintiff will not offer any evidence that the rents paid by Operations or the OpCo Entities to the PropCo Entities were above-market.\" D.I. 142 at 21. In other words, the OpCo Entities paid fair market rent under the PropCo Leases for access to land they needed to operate the stores. That is the definition of a fair market transaction with no enrichment or impoverishment, let alone an unjust enrichment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nemec\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291820\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/991/1120/#p1130\">\n     991 A.2d at 1130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-545\">\n    Fourth, the Committee's assertion that the OpCo Entities' leases with Spirit and GIG resulted in a benefit to the SLB Entities does not meet the elements of unjust enrichment. As an initial matter, the contemporaneous documents and parties to the transaction agree that the Spirit/GIG Leases were arm's length negotiations. The Court accepts the testimony of the Committee's Expert, Howard, that the rents charged by Spirit/GIG were above market. But, the Committee is not suing Spirit or GIG. At best, the Committee's legal theory is that the OpCo Entities may have provided some benefit to GIG and Spirit. However, GIG and Spirit are not defendants here and they owe no duty to the OpCo Entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-546\">\n    Finally, the Committee's assertion that Comvest was unjustly enriched through the Albertson's Acquisition is unfounded because Comvest lost money on the transaction. Comvest invested $50 million in equity, it placed its valuable portfolio company (Haggen, Inc.) within reach of the OpCo Entities' creditors, and it contributed the $49 million in excess proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions to the OpCo Entities. There cannot be a claim for unjust enrichment when the defendant lost money in the transaction. In sum, the Committee has not proven the elements of unjust enrichment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-547\">\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Evidence To \"Value\" The Alleged Enrichment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-548\">\n    The Committee's alleged damages for unjust enrichment are unsupported and bear no connection to the unjust enrichment theories it posits. According to the Pre-Trial Order, the Committee is seeking \"the net equity value of Holdings (after the payment of all claims other than to equity holders) (Count 73)\" and \"the value of the assets currently owned by each of the PropCo Entities and the SLB Entities (Counts 74 and 75).\" D.I. 142 at 52. In other words, the Committee is claiming that the entire value of PropCo is somehow an unjust benefit that was bestowed upon it by the OpCo Entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-549\">\n    To recover under unjust enrichment, the plaintiff has the \"burden\" to \"show the value of his or her services.\"\n    <em>\n     Strong\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20632\">\n     83 Cal.Rptr.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    635-36 ; 66 Am.

Ch. July 31, 2017). The court held that the plaintiff failed to carry its \"burden of establishing an unjust enrichment\" because \"the proper calculation of damages\" is not the value of the entity to which it provided services but \"the fair market value of the [plaintiff's] services minus the [amount] they were paid.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203500241\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Committee's theory has the same flaw. Rather than seeking the precise value of the benefit (i.e. assets or services) provided by OpCo, the Committee is simply seeking the full value of the PropCo Entities (or the net value minus Holdings' creditors). Accordingly, with respect to the Committee's evidence of damages, they have not \"carried their burden.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203500241\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-550\">\n    <strong>\n     IX.\n     <em>\n      THE RECHARACTERIZATION CLAIM (COUNT 71)\n     </em>\n     .\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-551\">\n    The Committee seeks to recharacterize the $25 million PropCo Loan into equity.

The evidence is clear that the parties intended the PropCo Loan to be secured debt as shown by the written agreements and their treatment of the loan.

Therefore, the PropCo Entities could not \"make advances in proportion to their respective stock ownership\" because they owned no equity. But the OpCo Entities and the PropCo Entities had common indirect ownership by Holdings and Comvest. Accordingly, this factor is mixed: a narrow interpretation of the factor favors debt (since PropCo Entities owned no stock in the OpCo Entities), but a broader interpretation could potentially favor a characterization of equity (due to common, indirect ownership).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-584\">\n    <em>\n     Factor 7 - The security, if any, for the advances\n    </em>\n    : The OpCo Borrowers pledged all of their assets as security pursuant to the Loan Agreement.

But the PNC Revolving Loan Agreement did not prevent the OpCo Borrowers from pledging their collateral to the PropCo Lenders. This is clear from the Forbearance Agreement where PNC agreed to forebear the \"Event of Default\" but there was no change to the security status of the PropCo Loan. DX0427-0005-6 (allowing the \"Liens\" under the \"PropCo Special Advance\" and \"Initial Provisional Funding\" to no longer be an \"Event of Default\").

Admittedly, the PropCo Lenders were not \"outside lending institutions\" and, given the time constraints, the OpCo Entities were not able to find an outside lender.

Indeed, he was proven right by the eventual sale of the assets where the sale exceeded the PNC ABL plus the PropCo Loan amount. Trial Tr. (10/17) at 113:21-115:4 (Niegsch). The choice not to pursue outside lenders was due to \"the speed that it needed to get a loan.\" Trial Tr. (10/16) at 185:4-186:25 (Caple). Flaton did not perform any analysis of whether a reasonable outside lender would have made a loan directly to OpCo, especially if OpCo had had more time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 218:3-13 (Flaton). Accordingly, Flaton's opinion is little more than a recitation of the factual record. The OpCo Entities did not have time to pursue new outside lenders and educate them regarding the value of the OpCo Entities' unencumbered collateral. Defendants will admit that it is unlikely that a lender would have loaned unsecured money to the OpCo Entities in August 2015. But it is reasonable to believe that a lender would have offered, like the PropCo Lenders, a secured loan where the unencumbered assets were more than sufficient to cover the amount of the loan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-588\">\n    <em>\n     Factor 9 - The extent to which the advances were subordinated to the claims of outside creditors\n    </em>\n    : This factor only supports the Committee if there was \"subordination of advances to claims of all other creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     AutoStyle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9469401,9467287\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/726/\">\n     269 F.3d at 752-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Among other factors, these courts evaluate the \"certainty of payment in the event of the corporation's insolvency or liquidation.\"\n    <em>\n     SubMicron\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556397\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/448/#p457\">\n     432 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    456 n.8 ;\n    <em>\n     Liberty Brands\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204792053\">\n     2014 WL 4792053\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5. The \"certainty of payment\" factor cuts straight to what a lender cares about when making a loan, especially in a distressed situation. In the seven-factor test, this \"certainty of payment\" factor effectively replaces the more amorphous\n    <em>\n     AutoStyle\n    </em>\n    factors of capitalization, whether outside lenders would have lent, and source of repayments. Given the unencumbered collateral at the OpCo Borrowers available to the PropCo Lenders, the \"certainty of payment\" factor would weigh heavily in favor of treating the PropCo Loan as debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-593\">\n    Another factor is the \"presence or absence of voting rights\" because equity is frequently associated with voting rights in the company.\n    <em>\n     SubMicron\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556397\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/448/#p457\">\n     432 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    456 n.8 (3d Cir. 2006) ;\n    <em>\n     Liberty Brands\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204792053\">\n     2014 WL 4792053\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5.

Accordingly the lack of voting rights suggests that the PropCo Loan is debt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-594\">\n    Another factor frequently cited by courts to evaluate intent is how the parties accounted for the advance on their financial statements and accounting records.\n    <em>\n     SubMicron\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556397\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/448/#p457\">\n     432 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    457 (citing numerous facts to support debt characterization including \"1999 notes [that] were recorded as secured debt on SubMicron's 10Q SEC filing and UCC-1 financing statements.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Liberty Brands\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204792053\">\n     2014 WL 4792053\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (\"Sunflower loan was at all times denominated as 'Loan Payable to Sunflower' on the Debtor's books.\").

At its core, the PropCo Loan is the type of rescue financing that courts aim to preserve. The PropCo Loan fits the characteristics of a rescue financing as described by Flaton: the PropCo Loan was \"made by non-traditional lenders,\" it was \"secured by collateral,\" and it \"is subordinate to the existing debt on the structure.\" Trial Tr. (10/18) at 199:4-24 (Flaton) (describing characteristics of a typical rescue loan). Moreover, Flaton testified that based on her experience the PropCo Loan was \"good for OpCo's creditors\" and that she would have advised them to accept the money:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-599\">\n    Q. And you agree that the additional $25 million in capital into this failing situation was a good fact for OpCo's creditors. Isn't that correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-600\">\n    A.

As Flaton testified, \"freefall bankruptcies can be destructive of value\" and such a freefall could cause the Debtors' creditors to suffer. Trial Tr. (10/18) at 221:8-19 (Flaton). From a practical standpoint, the PropCo Loan provided much needed liquidity that was used in part to pay OpCo's creditors while ultimately allowing for an organized descent into bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-604\">\n    Courts have frequently worried that an overly aggressive recharacterization regime could deter good-faith rescue financing for struggling companies.\n    <em>\n     In re Dornier Aviation (N.

An overly aggressive recharacterization regime could eliminate efficient, good-faith rescue financing to the detriment of creditors. In addition, going forward it could nudge corporations\n    into specific jurisdictions to avoid recharacterization risk. Regardless, it would be an \"unhealthy deterrent\" to punish the PropCo Lenders for stepping in and protecting value at the OpCo Borrowers-to the benefit of OpCo's creditors-through rescue financing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-605\">\n    IX.\n    <em>\n     THE COMMITTEE's EQUITABLE SUBORDINATION CLAIMS (COUNTS 69, 70, AND 77).\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-606\">\n    The Court should also reject the Committee's claims to equitably subordinate the $25 million PropCo Loan or any proofs of claim filed (or to be filed) by the PropCo Entities (the \"PropCo Proofs of Claim\") to the claims of the unsecured creditors (Counts 69 and 77).

The Committee alleges that the \"Challenged Transactions\" constituted inequitable conduct. None of the Challenged Transactions were inequitable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-619\">\n    The Committee defined the \"Challenged Transactions\" as (1) the creation of the OpCo/PropCo corporate structure, (2) the downstream contributions of the right to acquire real property from Holdings to the wholly- owned PropCo and SLB Entities, (3) the sale-leaseback transactions with Spirit and GIG, and (4) the imposition of above-market leases on the OpCo Entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-620\">\n    First, the Committee admitted repeatedly in this case that there is nothing wrong with creating an OpCo/PropCo corporate structure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Trial Tr. at 50:6-7 (Feinstein) (\"There is nothing, per se, wrong about the PropCo and OpCo structure.\"). Second, as described above, there is nothing fraudulent or inequitable about a corporation contributing value to its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The Committee has not demonstrated, for example, that Defendants engaged in any conduct that would constitute fraud, illegality, or breach of fiduciary duty. The evidence adduced at trial shows that the OpCo Entities were not undercapitalized at the outset of the Albertson's Acquisition. The case law is also clear that undercapitalization of the debtor at the time it entered into a secured loan with a lender does not constitute inequitable conduct,\n    absent something more.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Filtercorp, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11774936,11781587\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/570/\">\n     163 F.3d 570\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 583-84 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that the insolvency of the debtor at the time it entered into secured loan transactions with claimants, standing alone, is insufficient to require subordination of claimants' claims). The Committee has not shown, much less alleged, that the OpCo Entities were mere instrumentalities or alter egos of either the PropCo Entities or Comvest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-622\">\n    Ultimately, just as with so many of its other claims, the Committee's complaint is that \"[f]rom the outset this transaction was set up in such a way that it was going to benefit Comvest whether, you know, heads I win tails you lose.\" Trial Tr. (10/20) at 88:7-10 (Feinstein). The evidence clearly shows that the PropCo Entities did not engage in any inequitable conduct.

The Committee's position as to this element is two-fold: if the PropCo Loan \"is allowed as a secured claim,\" then (a) the OpCo Entities' creditors will be harmed \"because there will be $25 million (plus interest) less to satisfy their claims\"; and (b) it \"will confer an unfair advantage to the PropCo Entities by ratifying Comvest's decision to use the Debtors' assets under dire circumstances to try to protect its own equity investment.\" D.I. 144 at 31. The evidence does not support either position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-625\">\n    The unsecured creditors were not injured by the PropCo Loan. Indeed, the evidence shows that they were the primary beneficiary of it. The PropCo Loan directly resulted in the infusion of $25 million in the OpCo Entities in August 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DX0416; Trial Tr. (10/18) Tr. at 197:18-20 (Flaton). That money was used to make payroll and to pay then-existing obligations to the very same unsecured creditors that the Committee represents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 166:5-8 (Flaton) (\"This in fact was used for working capital and paying payroll.\"). The PropCo Loan was also a condition precedent for unlocking $20 million of additional liquidity: as part of the Forbearance and Intercreditor Agreements, PNC provided an additional $20 million of availability under the PNC Revolver.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 198:15-19 (Flaton). These funds, $45 million in total, reduced the OpCo Entities' debt and were designed to give the OpCo Entities time to execute a turnaround plan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/17) at 108:5-109:2 (Niegsch). The evidence also shows that, absent the PropCo Loan, the OpCo Entities would have descended into a freefall bankruptcy, which would have destroyed value and left the unsecured creditors worse off.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/17) at 117:6-16 (Niegsch); Trial Tr. (10/18) at 220:23-221:25 (Flaton). As a result, the unsecured creditors benefited from this additional working capital; they were not harmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-626\">\n    The Committee's own expert agrees that the unsecured creditors were better off because of the PropCo Loan than they otherwise would have been. During cross-examination, Flaton admitted that, from the perspective of the OpCo Entities' creditors, it was a good thing for the OpCo Entities to receive the proceeds of the PropCo Loan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 197:24-198:3 (Flaton). She further admitted that had she been advising the OpCo Entities, she would not have advised them to turn down the PropCo Loan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial\n    Tr. (10/18) at 198:4-7 (Flaton). Flaton also testified that, in her view, the PropCo Loan was better than market, as nobody else would have made a loan to the OpCo Entities on as good of terms as the PropCo Loan.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. (10/18) at 217:21-218:2 (Flaton). In other words, not only did the OpCo Entities' creditors benefit from the additional liquidity in the short run, they did so on terms that were favorable to them over the long run.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-627\">\n    The PropCo Loan also did not confer an \"unfair advantage\" on the PropCo Entities vis-\u00e0-vis the OpCo Entities. The PropCo Loan was an attempt to rescue the OpCo Entities. Had that attempt been successful, the OpCo Entities' creditors would have benefitted tremendously from a healthy grocery brand that would have been able to pay its creditors. Comvest would also have been a beneficiary of that success, but to say that Comvest's attempt to \"protect its own equity investment\" constitutes an \"unfair advantage\" is to ignore the benefits that the unsecured creditors would have reaped. The Committee's argument also ignores the short term benefits that the unsecured creditors reaped as a direct result of the PropCo Loan. As discussed above, there are important policy reasons to encourage loans from insiders to companies in dire straits, as insiders are often a company's last best chance to avoid a bankruptcy filing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AutoStyle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9469401,9467287\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/726/\">\n     269 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    747 ;\n    <em>\n     Mid-Town Produce\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"489035\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/599/389/#p392\">\n     599 F.2d at 392\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-628\">\n    Importantly, this is not a case where the PropCo Entities improved their priority position vis-\u00e0-vis other creditors on an existing debt on the eve of bankruptcy. Courts often equitably subordinate attempts by insiders to improve their recovery on existing debts through the last minute taking of a security interest. For example, in\n    <em>\n     State Street Bank\n    </em>\n    , the court found inequitable conduct and harm to creditors when an insider-noteholder implemented a plan in conjunction with a debtor's management to convert its preexisting debt to secured status and obtain priority over other creditors.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285910\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/520/29/#p74\">\n     520 B.R. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    82 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Le Caf\u00e9 Cr\u00e8me, Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11487863\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/244/221/#p236\">\n     244 B.R. 221\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 236 (Bankr.

Prior to that loan, the PropCo Entities had not extended any debt to the OpCo Entities.
