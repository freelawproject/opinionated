Naranjo (the \"Debtor\"), that certain life insurance proceeds she received postpetition are exempt and should be excluded from her bankruptcy estate. The Debtor bases her claim on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038.2-3122\">\n    Va.

In his objection (the \"Objection\"), the Trustee argues that the Debtor's interest in the proceeds at issue is not covered by \u00a7 38.2-3122(B) because the Debtor was not \"dependent on\" the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the Objection on March 21, 2018. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court directed counsel to submit additional memoranda on the question of whether the Debtor should be considered a \"person dependent on ... the insured\" within the meaning of the \u00a7 38.2-3122(B). Having considered the evidence and the oral and written argument of counsel, the Court will overrule the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the general order of reference entered by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on August 15, 1984.

In December of 2016, the Debtor's mother passed away. Thereafter, the Debtor's father expressed a desire to move out of the assisted living facility. Because he was incapable of living on his own, he asked the Debtor if he could live with her, but the rental house in which the Debtor was living at the time was not large enough. The Debtor and her father therefore rented a different house, with each signing the lease. In July of 2017, the Debtor's father left the assisted living facility and moved into the rental home with the Debtor. The Debtor agreed to be her father's fulltime caregiver in exchange for compensation of $1,500 per month plus payment of the Debtor's half of the rent and utilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From each of the two paychecks the Debtor received from her father, taxes, Medicaid, and social security were deducted. While she was living with her father, the Debtor kept her expenses separate from those of her father. The Debtor was not claimed as a dependent on her father's tax return. Her father did not include the Debtor in the will he executed July 16, 2017, instead leaving one-fourth of his estate to each of the Debtor's three siblings and one-eighth of his estate to each of the Debtor's two children. He followed this same distribution allocation with respect to his Individual Retirement Account with Wells Fargo Advisors, a decision documented in an \"IRA Change of Beneficiary and Indemnification\" form executed on August 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor's father passed away on August 16, 2017, four days after the Debtor filed for a petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor was a beneficiary under two life insurance policies insuring the life of her father, receiving a total of $15,261.58 (the \"Life Insurance Proceeds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 29, 2017, the Debtor filed amended schedules in which she claimed an exemption in the Life Insurance Proceeds. The Trustee has objected to the exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Debtor's financial status during 2016 and 2017, the relevant time period, was as follows. During 2016, the Debtor had two part-time jobs. One of the Debtor's jobs ended in November of 2016, and the other job ended in February of 2017. The Debtor's 2016 tax return shows an adjusted gross income of $18,105, which includes earned income of $10,771 and unemployment benefits of $7,560. In addition, the Debtor's father gave her cash gifts of $13,000 in 2016 and $13,000 in 2017, and he had contributed to her financially since her divorce in 2009. The Debtor testified that the $13,000 gift amount had been chosen for tax purposes. She was unemployed between March and July 2017 and was receiving unemployment benefits. She served as her father's caretaker in July and August of 2017. At the time she filed this chapter 7 case, the Debtor's father was paying the majority of her expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After her father's death in August of 2017, the Debtor was unable to obtain employment. During that time, her father's estate continued to pay the Debtor's share of the monthly rent because, according to the Debtor, her father had guaranteed her share. In November of 2017, the Debtor accepted a job with the AARP Foundation for which she received minimal compensation; her gross income was $486 in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate comprised of \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

E.D. Va. 2009). In this case, therefore, the Trustee has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that \u00a7 38.2-3122(B) is inapplicable to the Debtor's claimed exemption.\n   <em>\n    In re Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202576783\">\n    2012 WL 2576783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , No. 11-37343-KRH at *1 (Bankr. E.D. Va. July 3, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Trustee argues that the Debtor is not entitled to claim an exemption in the Life Insurance Proceeds under \u00a7 38.2-3122(B) because she was not a \"person dependent on\" her father at the time of his death. Section 38.2-3122(B) provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In no case whatsoever shall any protected insurance item be liable to execution, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process in favor of any creditor of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) The person whose life is insured by the related policy or contract;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) The Person who can, may or will receive the benefit of that protected insurance item, provided that such a\n   person is the insured or owner of the contract, deposit, indemnity, policy, or settlement, or the spouse or the intended spouse of, a dependent child of, or any other person dependent on, the insured or owner of the contract, deposit, indemnity, policy, or settlement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) The person who owns the related contract, deposit, or policy; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (4) The person who effected the related contract, deposit, or policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038.2-3122\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-3122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B). The Trustee does not dispute the fact that the Debtor was receiving money from her father; rather, he argues that the facts demonstrate the relationship was not one of dependency but instead that of an employer and employee. In support, he relies upon the fact that in July of 2017, the Debtor entered into an agreement with her father under which he would leave the assisted living facility and live with the Debtor, who would provide full-time care for him. In exchange for this care, her father paid the Debtor $1,500 per month plus payment of the Debtor's half of the rent and utilities for the home they had leased together. The Trustee points out that the Debtor, both prior to working for her father and thereafter, was capable of employment and in fact had held other jobs. He further notes that the Debtor's father did not claim her as a dependent on his tax return nor did he include her in his will or as a beneficiary of his Individual Retirement Account with Wells Fargo Advisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtor contends that the Life Insurance Proceeds should be exempt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038.2-3122\">\n    Va.

Although they maintained separate bank accounts, Kelm occasionally put money into the debtor's account. The debtor worked only two weeks over a period of two years and stayed home the rest of that time to take care of Kelm, who had cancer. Kelm paid the household expenses. The court found that the debtor and Kelm \"were living as a family unit and, as such, they were mutually dependent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716533\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/348/475/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716533\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/348/475/\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After applying this test to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Dry\n   </em>\n   , the court overruled the trustee's objection to the debtor's claim of exemption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6494008\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/133/460/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6494008\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/133/460/#p465\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Dry\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor argues that she was supported financially by her father, either directly or indirectly, at the time of his death and that she reasonably relied on his support. She contends that the Court should apply the same test that the court applied in\n   <em>\n    Dry\n   </em>\n   to Virginia's statute and overrule the Trustee's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Title 38.2 of the Virginia Code, which is comprised of chapters dealing with insurance, contains no definition of \"dependent\" applicable to \u00a7 38.2-3122(B). The Court is aware of no case law or legislative history addressing what the Virginia legislature\n   specifically intended by extending the statute's protection to \"any other person dependent on ... the insured.\" Nevertheless, this case turns on how the phrase \"dependent on\" should be interpreted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Trustee contends that the Court should apply the statutory definition of \"dependent\" found in Title 34 of the Virginia Code entitled \"Homestead and Other Exemptions.\" Title 34 contains\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2034-4\">\n    Va.

A provision included in the statute states that\n   <em>\n    \"[f]or the purposes of this section\n   </em>\n   , 'dependent' means an individual who derives support primarily from the householder and who does not have assets sufficient to support himself ....\" Va. Code Ann \u00a7 34-4 (emphasis added). This Court has interpreted the word \"primarily\" in that provision to require that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   more of the dependent's support needs must be paid for or supplied (possibly in kind, such as a roof over the dependent's head or food on his or her table) by the party claiming the exemption than from any other source....

Lexis. 566 at *8 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Feb. 18, 2005). There is nothing in \u00a7 38.2-3122, nor anywhere else in Title 38.2 of the Virginia Code, indicating that the Legislature intended to incorporate \u00a7 34-4's definition of \"dependent\" into its insurance provisions. In fact, by its own language, \u00a7 34-4's definition of \"dependent\" applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to the homestead exemption. Nevertheless, even if the Court were to accept the Trustee's contention that \u00a7 34-4's definition is applicable, the burden remains on the Trustee to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Debtor, at the time of her father's death, did not derive her support primarily from her father or that she had sufficient assets to support herself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Another Illinois bankruptcy court that had previously addressed the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dry\n   </em>\n   , after lamenting the legislature's failure to define \"dependent\" for purposes of the statute, found that the debtors in its case qualified as \"dependents\" of their minor son where they claimed an exemption in the proceeds of a wrongful death action arising from his death.\n   <em>\n    In re Rigdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6494008\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/133/460/#p465\">\n    133 B.R. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 (Bankr. S.D. Ill. 1991). The court held that in the absence of a statutory definition, it should apply the plain meaning of the word \"dependent.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Since neither Congress nor the Illinois legislature has deemed it necessary to define \"dependent\" for purposes of the issue before the Court, the Court concludes that the ordinary and common meaning of the word will suffice. It should be noted that the purpose of the exemption statutes is to give the debtor enough property and income to subsist and obtain a fresh start .... With this in mind, the Court holds that a \"dependent,\" for purposes of \u00a7 12-1001 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, is an individual who is supported financially, either directly or indirectly by another, and who reasonably relies on such support. This is a broad definition, and a factual finding of dependency will thus\n   have to be made, after a hearing, on a case by case basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6494008\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/133/460/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6494008\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/133/460/#p465\">\n    at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The principals espoused by the court in\n   <em>\n    Rigdon\n   </em>\n   , that the purpose of an exemption statute is to give the debtor property and income to subsist and gain a fresh start, that in the absence of a statutory definition one should apply the plain meaning of a word, and that a factual finding of dependency is typically made on a case by case basis, apply in this case. And, again, whether the Court applies the narrower definition of \"dependent\" advocated by the Trustee or a broader definition such as that adopted in\n   <em>\n    Rigdon\n   </em>\n   , the burden of proof rests upon the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This Court has recognized that \"under the Bankruptcy Code and Virginia law, exemption statutes should be liberally construed in favor of the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bowman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421579\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/899/\">\n    582 B.R. at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows that most courts interpreting the term \"dependent\" have done so in a fashion that is consistent with the liberal construction to be accorded exemption statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meler v.

Therefore, a finding that the Debtor was supported by her father, either directly or indirectly, and reasonably relied on his support, will result in the allowance of her exemption in the Life Insurance Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this case, it is significant that a parent and child relationship existed between the Debtor and her father rather than solely as employer and employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the Debtor was no longer a minor, she lived with her father and relied upon him as the sole source of all of her financial needs, directly and indirectly, before his death. Similar to the facts in\n   <em>\n    In re Dry\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor and her father were living as a family unit and were mutually dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Debtor had been receiving financial support from her father since her divorce in 2009 including gifts of $13,000 in both 2016 and 2017, amounts that exceeded the Debtor's earned income for both years. When her father passed away in August of 2017, the Debtor's source of income and sustenance ceased. For the remainder of 2017, she was only able to earn a total of $486. The Life Insurance Proceeds in the amount of $15,261.58 approximates the amount of the annual gifts the Debtor had been receiving from her father but would no longer receive due to his death. The evidence supports a finding that the Debtor reasonably relied upon her father's financial support and that the Life Insurance Proceeds would be the primary source of subsistence available to the\n   Debtor after his death as well as her only significant means to a fresh start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even under the definition of \"dependent\" set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2034-4\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 34-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the definition he advocates is applicable, the Trustee has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Debtor did not derive her support primarily from her father or that she has assets sufficient to support herself. The Trustee failed to present evidence of any meaningful future source of income for the Debtor and offered no evidence of the Debtor's assets other than to demonstrate that she was not a beneficiary under her father's will and IRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The cornerstone of the Trustee's argument is that because the Debtor and her father created an \"employer-employee\" component to their shared dependency for the two months preceding her father's death, the Debtor could not be considered \"dependent on\" her father. Ordinarily, an employee who is, in a sense, dependent on his or her employer for income will not satisfy the criteria necessary to claim a dependency exemption under \u00a7 38.2-3122(B). However, the Court will not adopt a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that prohibits a finding of dependency whenever there is any evidence of an employer-employee relationship. Instead, the Court will examine the facts in each case. In this case, the existence of the employer-employee arrangement between the Debtor and her father is insufficient to carry the Trustee's burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Trustee has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Debtor was not dependent on her father at the time of his death and therefore ineligible to exempt the Life Insurance Proceeds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038.2-3122\">\n    Va.

By permitting a debtor to retain sufficiency (sic) property to maintain a minimum standard of living, he retains his status as an independent economic unit thereby increasing the chances of rehabilitation....
