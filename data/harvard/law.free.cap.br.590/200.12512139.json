The Avoidance Actions represent thirteen of the remaining adversary proceedings commenced by the Trustee to avoid and recover pre-Filing Date fraudulent transfers from initial and/or subsequent transferees. Nine of the Avoidance Actions were commenced in November or December 2010 and four were commenced in April or June 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Like many bankruptcy trustees, the Trustee utilized Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure to obtain discovery from third parties, including certain of the Defendants in the Avoidance Actions, before commencing his adversary proceedings. In 2009 and 2010, the Trustee served Rule 2004 subpoenas requesting the production of documents on Defendants ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (presently known as The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V.) (\"RBS\") (\"RBS Subpoena\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Royal Bank of Canada (\"RBC\") (\"RBC Subpoena\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and served two Rule 2004 subpoenas for production of documents on the predecessor to the parent company of Natixis Financial Products LLC (\"Natixis\") on July 28, 2009 (\"Natixis Subpoena I\") and on August 26, 2010 (\"Natixis Subpoena\n   II\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee also deposed a Natixis officer pursuant to Rule 2004 in October 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg Declaration\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Regina Griffin in Further Support of the Trustee's Omnibus Motion for Court Order Authorizing Limited Discovery Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1)\n   </em>\n   , signed Nov. 20, 2017, at \u00b6 8 (ECF Doc. # 16927).) Finally, the Trustee served a Rule 2004 subpoena on Equity Trading Portfolio Ltd. (\n   <em>\n    See Letter of Regina L. Griffin\n   </em>\n   , dated Feb. 23, 2018, at 3 n. 1 (ECF Doc. # 17283).) Armed with the fruits of his Rule 2004 pre-litigation discovery, the Trustee commenced over 1,000 adversary proceedings to avoid and recover fraudulent transfers. (\n   <em>\n    See Trustee's Fifth Interim Report for the Period Ending March 31, 2011\n   </em>\n   , dated May 16, 2011, at \u00b6 6 (ECF Doc. # 4072).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Progression of Fraudulent Transfer Law in BLMIS Adversary Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The nine Avoidance Actions commenced in 2010 pled claims to avoid and recover fraudulent transfers under New York and/or federal bankruptcy law. These included claims asserted against initial transferees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 550(a)(1) and/or claims against immediate or mediate transferees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The four Avoidance Actions commenced in 2012 were limited to claims to recover avoidable transfers from immediate or mediate transferees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The need for expedited discovery, according to the Trustee, is the product of changes in the law resulting from a series of decisions issued by the District Court in the BLMIS cases. Ordinarily, an initial transferee may defend a fraudulent transfer action brought under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 548(a) by showing that he received the transfer in good faith and for value.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).
