Summit Credit Union (\"Summit\") filed this adversary proceeding seeking to declare a judgment against Goldbeck nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), and (a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summit moved for summary judgment with supporting affidavits. Defendant opposes the motion. He submitted an affidavit of counsel attaching three exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant is a physical therapist and athletic trainer. Hoping to expand his practice, he formulated a plan to build his own facility (the \"Facility\"). In support of that project, Defendant worked with the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater to prepare a feasibility study for a fitness facility in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The study concluded there was an opportunity for a new training center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bolstered by the study, Defendant began soliciting investors and lenders. In the fall of 2014, Defendant met with James Holden (\"Holden\"), a Summit Vice President, and Jason Herlitzke (\"Herlitzke\"), the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") contact at Summit. In December 2014, Defendant sent the feasibility study, a business plan, and some projections to Summit. The next month he told Summit a local economic development authority had agreed to make a loan for equipment for the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By August 2015, discussions with Summit and the SBA were proceeding in earnest. Defendant provided a signed \"General Building Specifications and Cost Estimate\" dated April 27, 2015, to Summit\n   for a 47,800 square foot facility at a cost of $2,234,343.90. Defendant and Summit negotiated and eventually agreed to terms to finance the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties anticipated and arranged for the financing to be in the form of an SBA loan. Defendant consulted with Business Lending Partners (\"BLP\"), a private non-profit organization that services and processes SBA 504 loans. Defendant represented he had already bought some equipment and stated it cost $50,000. The month after, Defendant said the equipment would cost about $150,000 and he factored that amount into his Projected Opening Balance Sheet. He again produced a construction budget asserting the \"total construction cost\" would be about $2.5 million. He said he was putting together a list of the existing equipment. He also gave Summit final plans and specifications for the building. The plans show a complete, usable building. Defendant admits nothing in the plans \"indicates that the construction costs identified ... are for anything other than a completed building.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   References to a second phase of construction appear in the emails between Defendant and Summit. The references begin with an indication that Defendant will \"have the option to purchase 5 more acres ... whenever that time comes.\" The precise details of phase 2 are not defined, although there are references to basketball and tennis courts and another 90,000 square feet of construction. It appeared phase 2 was to consist of an expansion of a by-then fully completed facility. As noted in his exchange with BLP, Defendant anticipated he would buy additional equipment when he had the budget to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To minimize its risk, Summit required Defendant to rent out some of the Facility and procure a signed lease before the execution of the loan. Summit also wanted an assignment of rents to support payments as they came due. Defendant told Summit that Watertown Regional Medical Center (\"WRMC\") intended to lease space in the Facility. In August, Defendant sent Summit a lease between the Facility and WRMC purportedly signed by WRMC (the \"WRMC Lease\"). The loan was then closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after the execution of the loan, Defendant emailed Summit about financing for phase 2. By then, the project was already $500,000 over the budget presented to Summit. Defendant asserted he needed another $805,000 for the land purchase for phase 2. Defendant suggested that the interest in the project had been overwhelming and he \"would need more equipment to handle [the new members'] needs.\" In response, Holden expressed shock the project was over budget and advised Defendant to \"get phase 1 completed, financially stable, and then look at the next phase.\" By October, Defendant had secured a $600,000 line of credit from a \"high school classmate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Toby Krause (\"Krause\"), sole proprietor of T. Krause Custom Builders, LLC, was the contractor for the project. Defendant knew Krause from previous construction projects and from high school. Krause saw the plans and specifications from the architects. Before preparing a budget, Krause obtained bids from subcontractors. Based on the bids, the cost to construct a finished facility approached $5 million. He then prepared a budget and contract that Defendant signed. The contract was not in an amount based on the bids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2015, Krause prepared the cost estimate. It said the actual cost would be $2,770,707.90. Krause testified that the budget submitted to Summit was for only\n   about half of the construction cost. According to Krause, Defendant instructed the budget should be for half the cost. The estimate did not include finish materials inside. Krause testified that Defendant was aware of that fact. Krause, with Defendant, also prepared an actual budget reflecting the genuine cost of the project. In the late summer or fall of 2015, before construction began, that new construction contract and budget were prepared and signed but not given to Summit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant used the estimate and agreement of $2,770,707.90 when he applied for the Summit loan. He explained that he would be saving money because of his relationship with many subcontractors. Even so, he knew this price was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September, Defendant knew a final construction contract was needed to close the loan. Defendant gave Summit a signed contract with Krause. It said the cost was \"not to exceed $2,570,000.00.\" The contract conveyed it was for the construction of a completed facility per the plans and specifications previously submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The loan closed. Simultaneous with the execution of the loan, Defendant's company, Xcel Sports Complex, LLC, and Summit entered into a Construction Loan Disbursement Agreement (\"Disbursement Agreement\") with Fidelity Land Title, Ltd. (\"Fidelity\"). Under that agreement, financing for the project would flow through Fidelity under the terms defined in the Disbursement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A later cost estimate dated November 30, 2015-after the parties signed the loan-projected the cost would be $4,548,185. Krause testified the estimate given to Summit applied only to half the project. He also agreed that nothing in that estimate would reveal it applied to less than the whole project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   John Graf, the former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of WRMC, is the person whose signature seems to appear on the WRMC Lease. Graf acknowledges in an affidavit that there were some discussions with Defendant about the possibility of a lease for medical office space. He denies signing the supposed WRMC Lease and confirms he authorized no other person to sign his name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By March 2016, Defendant's delicately built house of cards finally collapsed. Defendant admitted the \"reality is the current budget is $4,913,139 ... we need another 2 million dollars to finish the building.\" Debtor confessed the original budget he provided during the loan negotiation was inaccurate. He declared the total cost \"was always 4.9 Million, since the day we signed the papers. As soon as I asked about more money, and you reacted the way you did, I knew the best way to handle it was to keep the project going and address it later.\" Aff. of David M. Pelletier, Ex. B22, ECF No. 14, Attachment 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant casts blame on Summit for the ordeal. His argument is his email from March 2016 saying that he \"was lead [sic] to believe that anything else [he] needed for funds ... would not be a problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at B23. No support in evidentiary form is provided for this argument. Around the same time, Defendant withdrew funds directly from the loan account in violation of the Disbursement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In late 2016, Summit foreclosed on the Facility and obtained a judgment for money due under the loan. The state court entered an order in favor of Summit on all its claims and awarded a judgment to Summit against Debtor for $2,488,218.12. At foreclosure, the property sold for $900,000, leaving a deficiency of $1,645,856.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff contends Goldbeck presented the budget with an intent to deceive. Plaintiff also argues he forged the signature on the WRMC Lease to induce Summit to execute the note. Defendant argues he did not intentionally mislead Summit or forge the WRMC Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standards for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Defendant Knowingly Submitted A False Construction Budget\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant repeatedly represented the total cost of the project would be between $2 and $2.5 million. In November 2014, he asked Holden to estimate the interest rate on a $1.7 million loan. In January 2015, Defendant requested the loan amount be $2.5 million so he \"would definitely have all the working capital we need.\" In April, Defendant emailed Holden, Herlitzke, and Engel saying, \"final construction costs attached.\" The attached document contains an itemized list of costs totaling $2,770,707.90. Nowhere in any of those exchanges did anyone-including Defendant-suggest the $2.7 million encompassed less than the finished and operating facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant admits the $2.5 million construction contract represented only half of the cost of the project. His brief argues that Summit understood from the beginning that the entire project would cost about $5 million. He argues phase 1 consisted of building the exterior and phase 2 would finish the \"build-out\" and the interior. Nowhere, however, does he submit any evidence to support those arguments. Defendant knew the $2.5 million loan would produce only a building shell, which presumably would be unusable for any profit-generating purpose. There is nothing in the record, however, that intimates Summit knew Defendant would need another $2.5 million to finish the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While there was discussion of the SBA loan cap of $5 million, there is no evidence Summit or the SBA were aware the cost of phase 1 would in any way approach that number. The discussion of phase 2 was only for the potential of more land for an expansion. Defendant concedes nothing indicated\n   funds beyond the loan amount would be needed for a completed building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant's argument is unsupported by any evidence. Frankly, it makes no sense. First, Defendant admitted he intentionally misrepresented the total construction cost before the parties executed the loan. Second, he admits providing a budget to Summit for a project cost of $2.5 million. Third, he admits the budget was not the actual cost of a completed facility. His March 2016 email confirms the actual budget \"was always 4.9 Million, since the day we signed the papers.\" In fact, he goes on to admit he misrepresented the construction cost with intent to procure the loan, writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Honestly, you both freaked out on me when I asked about needing more money for the project, so I showed you a version that was under significantly, so you wouldn't start yelling again....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   As soon as I asked about more money, and you (Holden) reacted the way you did, I knew the best way to handle it was to keep the project going and address it later, which is what I'm doing now....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   I'll send you the budget and numbers I gave the other bank. I'd be happy to take out a separate loan for the 2 million, if you would approve it, at whatever fair rate you would offer. We need to get the project finished. That's how we're going to get through this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Aff. of Pelletier, Ex. B22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    2. Defendant Intended to Mislead Summit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because direct evidence of fraudulent intent is rarely available, disputes under section 523(a)(2)(A) often are fact intensive, time consuming, and require an elevated level of scrutiny by the finder of fact. This is an exception to the typical case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant admits he knew the total cost of construction was higher than $2.5 million when he signed the loan. He concedes he failed to disclose the actual total cost to Summit out of fear it would refuse to finance the project. He acknowledges that, all along, he intended to reveal the final cost only after Summit had expended substantial funds on the project. Defendant apparently knew or hoped that once Summit disbursed $2.5 million, it might be his hostage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant's interpretation of the transaction makes no sense from the standpoint of commercial reasonableness. Under the loan, Summit's security was a first priority lien on the Facility and its land. An appraiser's report prepared by the SBA in June 2015 concludes the value of the undeveloped property was $120,000. It would have made little sense for Summit to invest $2.5 million to construct an empty building with no commercial use on a plot of land with\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   value relative to the loan amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Herlitzke instructed Defendant to get phase 1 finished and financially stable before he embarked on phase 2. Defendant did not respond that phase 1 would only result in an empty shell building. He continued to let Summit believe the $2.5 million loan would result in a completed facility capable of generating income from rent and membership fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant zealously argues Summit intentionally structured the transaction as two separate loans to get around the dollar limit set by the SBA. There is, however, no evidence in the record to support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The SBA authorization also anticipated the initial loan would result in a completed\n   building. It stipulates $2,225,500 would be used \"to construct a building\"-not a building shell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    3.

There is no material dispute over whether Defendant misrepresented the total cost of construction-he did. There is also no dispute that Defendant made the misrepresentation with an intent to deceive-again, by his own admission, he intended the deceit. He presented a project budget, plans, and a lease on which Summit relied in making the loan. His continued use of the false information was certainly intended to foster a continued false picture of the project and its costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There are no genuine disputes of material fact. There is an absence of evidence to support Defendant's opposition. Plaintiff has established that Defendant violated section 523(a)(2)(A) and is entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    4. The WRMC Lease\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff raises an alternative theory under section 523(a)(2)(A) that Defendant forged the signature on the WRMC Lease. Mr. Graf attests he signed no lease. He says he told Defendant in early 2017 that WRMC was not interested in leasing any part of the Facility. Defendant merely submitted a copy of the purported lease through an affidavit of counsel. He submitted no affidavit himself about the lease. There is no support in the record for any conclusion that Graf signed the lease. Defendant submitted no evidence to suggest when or how he obtained a document purporting to bear a signature by WRMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It troubles the Court that Defendant does not recall whether he met any person to sign the lease. He does not recall whether he met with the hospital, although he said WRMC \"agreed to get it finished up\" and that he was meeting with them to have the lease signed. He also said he didn't believe he met John Graf at any point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For purposes of summary judgment, the Court cannot conclude whether there was a forgery. As a result, it cannot grant Plaintiff's motion on this alternative theory. The evidence, however, suggests there was no WRMC Lease. That may, with further evidence, also support a conclusion that Defendant misrepresented facts about the WRMC Lease to Summit. It is not, however, necessary for the Court to reach a conclusion on this alternative theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    False Financial Statements Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(B)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Section 523(a)(2)(B) excepts from discharge debts for obtaining money, property, or services through the use of a false financial statement.

It appears Summit relies on the broader interpretation of \"financial condition\" and argues the misleading balance sheet constitutes a false statement about an asset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Summit's argument stretches the meaning of \"financial condition\" further than even the broadest definition in existing case law. The projected costs of construction say nothing about Defendant's net worth or whether he owned an asset. And the Facility was not even built and there was no asset to own. The projected balance sheet was merely a forecast about future potential and thus not a representation of fact about financial condition. Summit failed to establish the required elements under 523(a)(2)(B) for summary judgment.

It seems several courts group \"willful\" and \"malicious\" together in a totality of the circumstances type of approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant's repeated misrepresentations to Plaintiff are straightforward evidence\n   of malice. Although Defendant had no personal animus toward or any reason to target Summit, he knowingly lied to Summit about the cost of the project. He repeatedly misrepresented the cost for a completed building to be about $2.5 million when he knew that figure was closer to $5 million. Defendant gave Summit a business plan projecting the total cost to be around $2 million, and he knew that was wrong. The project's balance sheet also identified the \"Cost of Construction\" at $2.52 million. Defendant had bids from subcontractors showing the total budget would be closer to $5 million before he presented the cost of the project to Summit. Defendant lied when he submitted a budget for a completed facility knowing the budget would only result in a shell of a building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendant decided to lie when asked about needing more money for the project. Rather than submit an accurate budget, he admits he \"showed [Summit] a version that was under significantly.\" He knew more money was needed to construct the Facility. Defendant made the decision to inform Summit the true budget was closer to $5 million only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Summit had loaned around $2.5 million and much of the money had been disbursed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant had to have known his intentional misrepresentations were certain to financially injure Summit. Failure to complete the project would leave Summit with an incomplete, unusable building incapable of generating any revenue to repay the loan and of insufficient value to secure the loan. Defendant signed the April Contract and gave it to Summit knowing it contained language for completion of a 47,800 square foot facility when, in fact, that was untrue. The uncontroverted testimony of Krause is that Goldbeck told him to prepare a budget for only about one-half of the construction costs. Krause knew Goldbeck was giving that budget to Summit. Defendant had bids from subcontractors confirming a cost almost double the budget. He ignored or concealed those bids in dealing with Summit. The false amount used in the construction contract was the amount Defendant instructed Krause to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Trying to put a different spin on the facts, Defendant suggests Summit granted the loan to finance the construction of an unfinished building. He has produced no evidence in support of that suggestion. Defendant surely knew the $2.5 million loan was for a\n   <em>\n    completed\n   </em>\n   building, as the parties agreed rents from tenants would serve as collateral for the loan. A half-completed building generates zero revenue. He also concedes he knew additional money would be required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendant went so far as to tell Summit the budget represented\n   <em>\n    savings\n   </em>\n   because of his good relationships with subcontractors. He submitted financial projections based on a completed facility knowing the loan would be insufficient to complete the Facility and generate any returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   When told more financial support and a lease for part of the Facility were needed to close the loan, Defendant submitted a lease. Based on the record, it was not really signed by the tenant-to-be. There is evidence suggesting he may have forged a lease to induce Plaintiff into extending the loan. The signature on that lease is of questionable authenticity and the alleged signor submitted an affidavit stating he did not sign the lease or instruct anyone to sign it on his behalf. Whether forged or not, the building as constructed was not complete and would not have been ready for a tenant to occupy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant covered up his misrepresentations with more misrepresentations, creating\n   a delicate house of cards built on one lie after another. Defendant's behavior was abhorrent from the start, as all along he intended to \"keep the project going and address [the falsified budget] later.\" As expected, Summit was left with a half-completed building incapable of generating revenue to repay the loan and a debt of $2.5 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   These facts represent more than mere inadvertence, negligence, or recklessness. Defendant was too sophisticated for this to constitute one big misunderstanding, as Defendant's brief suggests. In communicating with Summit, Defendant referenced \"what many businesses do,\" showing knowledge of industry practice. Defendant possessed enough overall awareness by retaining subcontractors and other professionals to help him prepare an appraisal, a feasibility study, a budget, a business plan, and other required documents. Defendant said he could secure additional funding from third parties when trouble with Summit began to brew. Defendant fully appreciated the situation. Instead of acting honestly, he chose to invent a budget for something he knew could not be built for the amount he used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The entirety of the evidence goes against Defendant's claim of mistake. Defendant knew exactly what he was doing by intentionally withholding material information that would jeopardize his dream project from coming to fruition. There was no oversight or accidental behavior involved, and not a shred of evidence suggests Defendant exercised good faith or possessed honest intentions. He knew his honesty would have likely resulted in the loan not being made. His entire course of conduct was to deceive and defraud Summit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After spending around $425,000 of his own money on the project before closing the loan, Defendant had every incentive to get the loan closed by any means necessary, including lying. Defendant strung Summit along on a ride of deceit and trickery, only to pull the rug out from under Summit and reveal the actual cost months after the loan closed and Summit had disbursed most of it. Virtually no evidence suggests Summit had any reason to believe the budget of $2.5 million was for a half-completed building or the signature on the lease was anything but genuine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, Defendant has articulated no rationale, excuse, or justification for his deceit. Defendant's seemingly sincere belief the Facility would benefit the community does not change the fact that he entered into a project knowing at the outset it was overbudget and would not produce the returns anticipated by Summit. Defendant exercised complete bad faith throughout the negotiations and later events. Defendant is not the \"honest but unfortunate debtor\" for which the discharge was intended. Instead, he hoped to trap Summit into a Hobbesian choice of either lending more money or face trying to foreclose on a half-built structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    3.
