J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ACn\">Appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The record before us reveals that when apprehended by police officers at 1:00 <em>A. </em>m. on July 6, 1962, defendant was seated iCbehind\u201d the steering wheel in the driver\u2019s seat of his automobile, parked by the curb on Broadway, a public street in the City of Paterson near the tracks of the Susquehanna Railroad. The car\u2019s motor was running.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In order that it might be unqualifiedly clear that the sole issue raised by defendant for resolution on this appeal was whether the proofs established that he was guilty of operating his automobile within the purview of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:4-50 and <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39 :1-1, defendant concedes that, while intoxicated, he had entered the automobile, had turned on the ignition of the ear and started the motor. He challenges the legality of his conviction in the County Court on the single ground that the case was barren of any proof that, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, he had actually <em>driven </em>the automobile; specifically, that there was no evidence that, while intoxicated, he had <em>moved </em>the car in any direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Defendant\u2019s aforesaid conviction followed a hearing in the municipal court at which he refrained from testifying and from presenting any affirmative evidence. On appeal to the County Court (on a trial <em>de novo </em>based on a transcript of the stenographic record taken in the municipal court <em>(B. B. </em>3:10-10(a)), the conviction was affirmed. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The proofs reveal that a police officer testified that on his arrival at the place where defendant\u2019s car was parked as aforesaid, defendant \u201cwas sitting in his automobile and a private citizen was standing next to him.\u201d Defendant was the only occupant of the ear. The proofs contain no identification of the \u201cprivate citizen\u201d other than that the officer subsequently testified that the \u201cprivate citizen\u201d was a \u201cpublic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>official.\u201d The person in question was not called as a witness and his non-appearanee as a witness was unexplained. Instead, over objection by defendant\u2019s counsel, the police officer testified that \u201cthe citizen advised ns that Mr. Sweeney fell asleep on the railroad tracks.\u201d Following the assertion by counsel that such testimony should be stricken as \u201chearsay.\u201d the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u201cThe Co out : That\u2019s right. Did this gentleman [defendant] hear it?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">The Witness : Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The Court : In your opinion was he able to comprehend ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">The Witness: He could hoar well enough. Whether he was able to comprehend, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">The Court : I will admit it subject to later striking out. In other words, this conversation was in his presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">Mr. Segreto : I still say it\u2019s hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">The Court: I\u2019ll permit it subject to connection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">The police officer then related that he asked defendant to \u201cget out of the car and shut off the motor\u201d; that defendant alighted from the car but failed to \u201cshut the motor off,\u201d so the officer did so; that defendant on leaving the car \u201cfell to the pavement\u201d; that the officer \u201csmelled a strong scent of alcohol\u201d; and that defendant, answering affirmatively the officer\u2019s inquiry as to whether \u201che had been drinking,\u201d stated that he had consumed \u201cthirty or forty beers.\u201d Defendant was unable to walk unassisted. The officer placed him \u201cunder arrest as a drunken driver\u201d and transported him by patrol wagon to police headquarters, where he was examined by a doctor at 1:20 a. m. The physician determined that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and so testified. The physician, detailing the results of his examination of defendant, stated that he was \u201cpale,\u201d his \u201ceyes were red and inflamed\u201d; he was \u201cin a comatose, excited condition\u201d; he was \u201cvery incoherent at times\u201d; he was \u201cunable to stand up\u201d except by holding \u201conto the table\u201d and \u201cstaggered and fell several times\u201d during the course of the examination. The doctor added that defendant said that he had imbibed \u201c20 to 30 beers a day\u201d for a period of \u201cthree to four days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Following the presentation of the foregoing testimony, defendant\u2019s counsel moved \u201cfor dismissal\u201d on the ground that the State had failed to produce any proof of defendant\u2019s \u201coperation of the vehicle.\u201d Counsel conceded that there was \u201cabundant evidence of intoxication\u201d but stated that there was no \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d of \u201cthe operation of the vehicle.\u201d During the course of the colloquy between the magistrate and counsel, the former emphasized the significance, as he viewed it, of the testimony presented on behalf of the State that defendant was found alone in the car in an intoxicated condition, seated in the driver\u2019s seat behind the steering wheel and with the motor running. The record then reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201cMe. Segeeto [defendant\u2019s counsel] : In view, your Honor, of the fact that the defendant was found in the motor vehicle parked by the curb with <em>the motor </em>running, on <em>that </em>ease, may we put the defendant on to meet that particular issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">The Court : I don\u2019t say that that\u2019s the only issue before me now. I say as far as your particular motion to have this man dismissed because nobody saw him driving a car, I say as far as that particular part of the case is concerned, in my opinion, the law is that the presumption is that a man behind the wheel with the motor running is guilty, and he may refute that. He has a right to. You can call him. Why not? If you want to call him, why not? If you can show that he did not start the car, that somebody did, you can refute the contention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">When the magistrate then stated that he might delay his decision for a week, defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cUnder the circumstances our testimony would be 'that he [defendant], in fact, did turn the key on. So you can dispose of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The magistrate denied the motion for dismissal, no testimony was presented on defendant\u2019s behalf, and he was adjudged guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On appeal the County Court, reviewing the record of the municipal court, held that the responses which defendant had made to the police officer and to the doctor, as revealed by their testimony, convinced it that defendant comprehended the aforesaid statement made by the unidentified person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the presence of the police officer and defendant \u201cwith reference to the defendant having been on the railroad tracks.\u201d The County Court then held that the statement was made \u201cunder such circumstances\u201d - and by \u201csuch a person\u201d as \u201cnaturally to call for a reply if the defendant did not intend to admit the statement.\u201d The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cThis statement can bo reasonably understood to mean that the defendant was found behind the wheel with his car on the railroad tracks, even though at the time the police arrived, his car was parked by the curb with the motor running. From that statement by this person as repeated by the police, a legitimate inference may he drawn that the defendant had driven the car onto the railroad tracks and that the police subsequently found him behind the wheel parked at the curb with the motor running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">On this basis I find there is sufficient evidence that the defendant operated the car and it is admitted that the defendant was intoxicated at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The County Court then declared that the affirmance of the conviction was justified for a further reason which it expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cAnother ground on which a conviction may be rested in this case is under the Motor Vehicle Act; 89:1-1, \u2018Operator means a person who is in actual physical control of a vehicle\u2019; under 39:4-50, \u2018A person who operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Was this defendant an operator? Admittedly he was seated behind the wheel of his car and was in actual physical control of his car with the motor running. I think this makes him an operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Must the car actually go into motion to start the operation? I think not. I think the defendant is in actual physical control as soon as he goes behind the wheel with the motor running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">From that point on, if the defendant is intoxicated, he is in a condition to do harm to himself and others, which is the policy that 39:4-50 is intended to penalize.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">We are in accord with defendant\u2019s contention that the County Court (as well as the municipal court) erred in holding that defendant\u2019s conviction might justifiably be based on the testimony of the police officer that the aforesaid statement, referable to defendant\u2019s presence on the railroad tracks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>was made by an unidentified person in defendant\u2019s hearing. Not only does the applicable decisional law render nugatory such inconclusive proofs as were here relied upon to establish defendant\u2019s guilt by an inference of assent to be drawn from his alleged silence, but the evidence itself did not encompass the elements necessary to render defendant\u2019s alleged silence of any probative significance under the circumstances. The prerequisites for the admissibility of such testimony have been delineated clearly in our State, and the doubtful value of the evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence in the face of an accusatory statement made while he is under arrest or in custody has been emphasized. <em>State v. Butler, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>166, 181-184, <em>certiorari </em>denied 362 <em>U. S. </em>984, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>1074, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1019 (1960); <em>State v. Davis, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>536, 546-547 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960); <em>Greenberg v. Stanley, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>485, 497-499 (1959); <em>State v. Kobylarz, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>250, 256-261 <em>(App. Div.), </em>certification denied 24 <em>N. J. </em>548 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Tested by the principles enunciated in the cited cases, it is clear that the aforesaid testimony on which the municipal court and the County Court rested their respective judgments should not have been admitted or relied upon for several reasons: (a) there was no substantial proof that defendant was able to comprehend the utterance of the bystander; in fact, the justifiable inference is to the contrary; (b) there was no proof that the defendant remained silent following the making of the statement; (c) the utterance by the unidentified person was neither incriminatory nor accusative in import with reference to the specific charge under scrutiny; it did not on its face concern the question of defendant\u2019s intoxication or his operation of a motor vehicle. It is unreasonable and illogical to hold that the testimony by the police officer that an unidentified private citizen advised that defendant \u201cfell asleep on the railroad tracks\u201d produces a legitimate inference leading justly to a conclusion that defendant had driven his automobile to a point on the railroad tracks, there fell asleep, and later awakened and drove his car to its aforesaid parked position on Broadway; (d) as noted, the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>identified person was not called as a witness, and the record is barren o\u00ed any proof showing that the person speaking possessed personal knowledge to support his statement. In fact, there is nothing revealed to suggest that the remark was not a gratuitous observation made by someone unknown to defendant. We conclude that, not only was there no justification for holding that defendant\u2019s conviction may be bottomed on his alleged silence following the utterance of the foregoing statement, but the testimony itself should have been excluded by the court on defendant\u2019s objection thereto-.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Although for the aforesaid reasons we determine that the challenged evidence was admitted erroneously, we conclude that its admission was not prejudicial since we determine that defendant\u2019s conviction was proper for the reasons hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We have heretofore noted that the County Court projected an alternative basis for its adjudication of defendant\u2019s guilt. It held that the fact that defendant was \u201cseated behind the wheel of his car and was in actual physical control of his car with the motor running * * * makes him an operator.\u201d We observe that, supplementing the foregoing circumstances, there are present in the record (a) the uneontradicted fact that defendant was alone in the automobile when found by the police; (b) the aforesaid concession of defendant\u2019s counsel at the hearing before the magistrate that defendant turned \u201cthe key\u201d; and (e) the comparable concession before us o-n the -argument of the appeal that defendant had entered the automobile, turned the ignition key and started the motor. Both of these statements were made by counsel in order that no doubt would exist as to the precise basis of his contention, <em>i. e., </em>that to justify a conviction under the statute in question there had to be proof that the automobile had been \u201cput into motion\u201d by defendant while he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Stressing the absence of any direct evidence in that regard, and contending that no- legitimate inference might be drawn in support thereof, counsel contended that reversal of the conviction was unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Defendant\u2019s counsel, sharply critical of the County Court\u2019s aforesaid reasoning, contends that it constitutes \u201ca strained and artificial construction-of the statute\u201d and is contrary to the law expressed in pertinent decisions by this State\u2019s appellate tribunals. He asserts that all such decisions demonstrate a search by the court \u201cfor evidence from which a motion of the vehicle may be found or inferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In resolving this appeal we find that it is unnecessary, for the reasons hereinafter stated, to determine whether the proofs justify an inference that defendant in the instant case, while intoxicated, moved the automobile by driving it from one place to another under the power of the motor machinery, an issue which was under consideration in the following decided cases: <em>State v. Guerrido, </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>505, 510 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960); <em>State v. Damoorgian, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>108, 114 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1958); <em>State v. Witter, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 5 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>304, 305\u2014306 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>State v. Baumgartner, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>348, 350 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>State v. Elliott, </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>432, 435 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We direct our attention to the question whether the statutory reference to the operation of an automobile, while the operator is intoxicated, envisions only a situation in which the vehicle is actually driven by a person, that is, moved from one place to another by bim, or whether the word \u201coperates\u201d includes and is descriptive of the act of setting in motion the operative machinery of the vehicle. While this precise issue has not been the subject of adjudication in this State, we note that the authorities in other jurisdictions are not in complete accord as to the construction that should be placed upon tbe word \u201coperates\u201d in comparable statutes. Annotation, 47 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>570 (1956). We feel that those cases which attribute a broader connotation to that word represent tbe more reasonable approach. The broader connotation, which we hereby adopt, is to ascribe to the word \u201coperates\u201d a meaning not limited to the movement of the vehicle itself. <em>State v. Webb, </em>202 <em>Iowa </em>633, 210 <em>N. W. </em>751, 752 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926); <em>Commonwealth v. Uski, </em>263 <em>Mass. </em>22, 160 <em>N. E. </em>305, 306 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1928); <em>People v. Domagala, </em>123 <em>Misc. </em>757, 206 <em>N. Y. S. </em>288 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1924). <em>Cf. State v. Ray, 4 N. J. Misc. </em>493, 496, 133 <em>A. </em>486 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The acts of the defendant in the instant case clearly demonstrate physical control of the automobile and the operation of its machinery. The turning of the automobile\u2019s ignition switch and the starting of its motor was an operation of the car connected with its use and presence upon the highway. Moreover, such an act justifies the inference that defendant intended to take the next step in the operation of the car\u2014to put the vehicle into motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In <em>State v. Webb, supra. </em>210 <em>N. W. </em>at <em>p. </em>752, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cThe defendant in the ease at bar testified that he had started the engine and it was running. This is one of the necessary elements in the operation of a car. In other words, he could not have put his car in motion without having first started the engine, and the starting of the engine therefore is the first step in the operation of a car. We are disposed to hold \u00ab * * that the defendant was \u2018operating\u2019 his car, within the meaning of the statute. The real danger that this statute seeks to protect against is from the possible results from a drunken condition of a driver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">We hold that defendant\u2019s acts, while intoxicated, in entering the automobile, turning on the ignition, starting and maintaining the motor in operation, and remaining in the driver\u2019s seat behind the steering wheel, where he was found by the police, justify his conviction as the operator of the automobile. In an intoxicated condition, he was, for all practical purposes, then in control of a dangerous instrumentality.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
