Pieretti, </em>72 <em>N. J. Super. </em>184 (1962), except that we do not join in that part of his decision relating to collateral estoppel by judgment (at <em>pages </em>192-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Defendants Pieretti call attention to the fact that the trial judge failed to consider their contention that their present business operations constitute no more than \u201ca valid intensification of their valid pre-existing non-conforming use/\u2019 Our reading of the lengthy record convinces us that these operations are not merely an intensification of a use predating the adoption of the Bloomfield zoning ordinance of 1930. The proofs clearly demonstrate that the Pieretti enterprise constitutes an invalid enlargement of the business beyond all reasonable limits\u2014an enlargement deliberately and brazenly pursued in the face of repeated complaints to municipal officials by neighbors, municipal court proceedings, and the warning signals raised in <em>Pieretti v. Johnson, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>576 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945), and <em>Pieretti v. Mayor and Council, etc., Bloomfield, </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>382 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Defendants rely heavily on <em>Moore v. Bridgewater Twp., </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), and claim it is controlling in the particular circumstances of this case. <em>Moore </em>is inapposite; it involved a wasting or diminishing asset, namely, a quarry. Its holding must be considered as strictly limited to such an asset. The Pieretti soda bottling operation does not, of course, fall into that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
