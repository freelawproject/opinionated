J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9C\">In this appeal E. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. (\u201cMacy\u201d hereinafter) seeks a review of a decision of the Division of Tax Appeals rejecting its complaints against revision by the Division of Taxation of its reported net worth for purposes of the Corporation Business Tax Act <em>(N. J. 8\u25a0 A. </em>54:10A-1 <em>et seq.) </em>for the privilege years 1956, 1957 and 1958 (base years ending December 31, 1955, 1956 and 1957, respectively). The resulting deficiency assessments for the respective years in question were $4,816.79, $6,524.09 and $7,167.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The statute referred to is a corporation franchise tax act, enacted by <em>L. </em>1945, c. 162, and applicable both to foreign corporations transacting business in this State, like Macy, and domestic corporations. Basically, it imposes a tax measured by a low rate against the taxpayer\u2019s book net worth. The act contains allocation formulae for corporations which maintain regular places of business outside New Jersey, but no problem is presented with relation thereto in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The reassessments by the Division of Taxation disputed in this case involve three items: (a) a substitution of \u201cEifo\u201d in the place of \u201cLifo\u201d costs (both terms are explained hereinafter) in determination of inventory values; (b) a revision downward of bad debt reserves; and (c) a disallowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>deduction for debt owing from a wholly-owned subsidiary, Garden State Plaza Corporation, a New Jersey corporation. Incidental to the dispute over revision of inventory valuations is the alternative contention of Macy that if its Lifo-based inventory valuations are to be revised, there should at the same time be deducted from its net book valuations certain claims listed as assets in its books for refunds of federal income taxes based upon the asserted right to use the Lifo method for income tax purposes for six income tax years preceding 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Certain other attacks upon the action of the Division of Taxation and upon the tax statute, only incidentally affecting the meritorious questions mentioned above, have been made' by Macy. All of these matters are considered in the course of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I. Inventories</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Macy\u2019s franchise taxes were required to be assessed upon the basis of its books as of the end of a calendar or fiscal year. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:10A-4(d)- For the tax years, here in question, 1956, 1957 and 1958, Macy\u2019s books reflected merchandise inventories, at the close of the pertinent fiscal years, as follows: July 30, 1955, $41,376,258; July 28, 1956, $47-926,103; and August 3, 1957, $55,340,189. However, Macy\u2019s annual reports (not its tax returns), in showing these figures under \u201cCurrent Assets,\u201d and describing them as \u201cMerchandise inventories at Lifo cost, as determined under the retail inventory method, which is less than market,\u201d appended footnotes which stated that the said figures were, respectively, $11,893,487, $12,517,651, and $13,277,806 \u201cless than they would have been if the first-in, first-out principle had been applied in determining cost.\u201d The \u201cfirst-in, first-out principle\u201d mentioned is commonly described as Fifo, by contrast with Lifo, meaning the \u201clast-in, first-out principle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">These terms, according to the expert proofs in this case and standard accounting texts, have the following meanings. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ventory costs are determined periodically in merchandising businesses for two principal purposes: (1) reflection of merchandise inventory as an asset on the balance sheet as of a given date; and (2) reflection of profits or net income during specific earnings periods, since closing inventories are instrumental in determining cost-of-goods-sold expense of both the current and subsequent earnings periods to be matched against revenues of such periods. However, where large quantities of items are bought and sold by a business during an accounting period it is not feasible to price inventory at the actual historical cost of each item. But since the prices paid for the merchandise in various lots of specific categories are known, the cost of closing inventories is frequently determined by artificial but convenient assumptions as to relation of identity of goods sold and goods remaining to goods purchased. One such assumption is Eifo, another, Lifo. Eifo assumes that the goods first purchased were first sold; Lifo, that the goods last purchased were first sold. Erom a balance sheet standpoint, Eifo has the advantage of attributing more recent costs to the closing inventory on hand, thereby affording a more realistic picture of current asset values; from an income or profit reflection standpoint, however, Lifo has the advantage of matching current revenues with current costs, thereby furnishing a more accurate picture of true business earnings or losses, as distinguished from market appreciation or depreciation of inventory values, during the earnings periods in question. Accounting theorists who favor the Lifo method describe it as based not on presumptions as to the flow of goods but rather as to the flow of costs. Where costs are stable over the respective periods involved, the stated advantages do not materialize. See <em>Amory and Hardee, Materials on Accounting (3d ed. </em>Herwitz and Trautman 1959), <em>pp. </em>176-178, 193\u2014 211; <em>Finney and Miller, Principles of Accounting (4:th ed. </em>1951), <em>pp. </em>360-368; <em>Hills, Law of Accounting and Financial Statements </em>(1957), <em>pp. </em>191-192; <em>Wixon and Cox, Principles of Accounting </em>(1961), <em>pp. </em>687-691; <em>R. H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. v. United States of America, </em>255 <em>F. 2d </em>884 (2 <em>Cir., </em>1958), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>cert. </em>denied 358 <em>U. S. </em>880, 79 <em>S. Ct </em>119, 3 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>110 (1958). The use of the Lifo system can result in current inventories reflecting \u201cvalues\u201d in terms of costs incurred years earlier. <em>Wixon and Cox, op. cit., supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>691.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">There are other systems for pricing inventory recognized as acceptable from the standpoint of sound accounting principles, such as average cost, weighted average cost and specific identification, but these do not bear upon the issues herein. Two other matters discussed in the evidence in this case also appear not to be directly material to determination of the precise issue before the court. The first is that inventory costs, within the Lifo principle, are arrived at by Macy by the \u201cretail inventory method\u201d; tire second, that all sound inventory accounting, including Macy\u2019s method, aims to reflect \u201ccost or market, whichever is lower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the letter of reassessment from the Corporation Tax Bureau of the Division of Taxation to the taxpayer readjusting the values for the years in question, the treatment of inventory is explained as follows: \u201cInventory reserve is disallowed inasmuch as the Bureau deems inventory values to be the most recent cost to the date of the Balance Sheet.\u201d The readjustment made was to substitute the Eifo figures as shown in the footnotes of the annual reports for the Lifo figures shown on the balance sheets. The representative of the Bureau testified that the determination was that the Eifo valuations were \u201ca closer approximation of the fair value of the inventories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Resolution of the dispute here presented requires construction of the statute. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:10A\u20145 imposes a franchise tax computed upon that portion of the \u201centire net worth\u201d of the corporation allocable to this State multiplied by the applicable rates. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:10A-4 defines \u201cnet worth\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201c(d) \u2018Net worth\u2019 shall mean the aggregate of the values disclosed by the books of the corporation for (1) issued and outstanding-capital stock, (2) paid-in or capital surplus, (3) earned surplus and undivided profits, (4) surplus reserves which can reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>expected to accrue to holders or owners of equitable shares, not including reasonable valuation reserves, such as reserves for depreciation or obsolescence or depletion, and (5) the amount of all indebtedness owing directly or indirectly to holders of 10% or more of the aggregate outstanding shares of the taxpayer\u2019s capital stock of all classes, as of the close of a calendar or fiscal year. However, if in the opinion of the commissioner, the corporation\u2019s books do not disclose fair valuations the commissioner may make a reasonable determination of ihe net worth which, in his opinion, would reflect the fair value of the assets carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with sound accounting principles, and such determination shall be used as net worth for the purpose of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The act was changed in certain respects, effective beginning with the year 1959, <em>L. </em>1958, c. 63, but the definition of \u201cnet worth\u201d was not altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Since merchandise inventory is an asset entering into the aggregate of components (1) through (4) of the foregoing listed constituents of \u201cnet worth,\u201d Maey does not contend that a lawful redetermination of inventory would not result in a proper recomputation of the tax base. But it does challenge the lawfulness of the re determination of inventory here made.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Expert accountancy testimony on both sides at the hearing before the Division of Tax Appeals was in agreement that both Elfo and Lifo were accepted methods of determining inventory costs for a retail merchandising business such as Macy\u2019s, \u201cin accordance with sound accounting principles.\u201d The expert for the State testified that under the Lifo method the inventory is valued \u201cat the costs that were prevalent at the time that the Lifo cycle commenced, which would be in the most distant past * * *. They would be the ancient or former costs rather than the current costs.\u201d In essence, the expert for the taxpayer was in agreement as to this. In the opinion of the State\u2019s expert the determination of the taxing authorities to utilize the Eifo valuations in this case was a \u201creasonable determination reflecting the fair value of the inventory assets carried on the books of the corporation,\u201d and one \u201cin accordance with sound accounting principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The opinion of Macy\u2019s expert was that \u201cthere is only one balance sheet in accordance with sound accounting principles\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>for a particular corporation, and, in the case of Macy for the years involved, those were the statements submitted to the Division of Taxation under certification by the corporation\u2019s auditors. He explained that the footnote references in the annual reports to Eifo costs were \u201cto help financial analysts to compare businesses.\u201d He testified that \u201cmechanically, because of the way you compute Lifo, you do know what Eifo is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In sustaining the position of the Division of Taxation, the opinion of the Division of Tax Appeals states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201cNo witness has testified that the determination of respondent is not fair value. Indeed, the witnesses all agree that Rifo method more closely approximates market value than the Lifo method. Market value usually is deemed to be fair value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Macy formulates its argument on this appeal by assuming that, the reassessment by the Division of Taxation is based on the foregoing expression of rationale by the Division of Tax Appeals, <em>i. e., </em>that it equates \u201cfair value\u201d of inventory with \u201cmarket value.\u201d It then attacks that equation by contending, on the basis of legislative history, that the Legislature did not intend to permit the Tax Division Director to use market value as a basis for establishing \u201cfair valuations\u201d of the assets \u201cin accordance with sound accounting principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUkZ\"> But the flaw in this attack is that the evidence shows that the Corporation Tax Bureau of the Tax Division did not purport to revalue inventory on a \u201cmarket value\u201d basis, but rather, as indicated above, on the basis of Macy-supplied Eifo figures determined to-be preferable because representing \u201cthe most recent <em>cost </em>to the date of the Balance Sheet\u201d (emphasis added). Eor reasons to be stated hereinafter, it is our view that the intent of the act is to require whatever \u201cfair valuations\u201d are arrived at by the Director to be consistent with sound accounting principles, and that such principles would preclude <em>raising </em>balance sheet inventory costs, whether Lifo or Eifo, to market value. So far as the opinion of the Division of Tax Appeals implies the contrary, we disagree with it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(Distinguish the correctness in accounting theory of <em>reducing </em>inventory costs to market, as noted above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Thus, the real issue presented is whether the statute permits the Tax Division Director to revise a taxpayer\u2019s inventory asset valuations for franchise tax purposes from Lifo to Pifo costs in such circumstances as here shown, or whether the taxpayer\u2019s decision to operate on a Lifo basis for general accounting purposes compels the Director to accept its Lifo inventory costs as conclusive of \u201cfair value\u201d in assessing the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The genesis of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945) is found principally in the general dissatisfaction with the then existent laws for the <em>ad valorem </em>taxation of intangible personal property. Those required the local taxing district in which the principal office of a corporation was located to tax all of its intangible personal property of whatever nature, subject to stated exemptions, and at general local tax rates. Literal enforcement of the law would have involved prohibitive tax burdens, and unfair enrichment of the taxing district involved. Although the tax act was therefore generally ignored, the threat and occasional actuality of enforcement created a fear of \u201ctax lightning.\u201d See <em>Duke Power Co. v. Somerset Co. Board of Taxation, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>481 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>431 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940); <em>Duke Power Co. v. State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>449 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943), affirmed 131 <em>N. J. L. 275 (E. &amp; A. </em>1944). This situation led to the creation in 1944 by legislative joint resolution of a Commission on Taxation of Intangible Personal Property. That body submitted a report March 26, 1945, which, among other things, recommended the abolition of taxation of intangible personal property as such and the imposition on all corporations of-a corporation business tax, conceived as a franchise tax, measured basically by net worth allocable to New Jersey in lieu both of the former <em>ad valorem, </em>taxation of intangible personal property and of the then existing franchise tax based upon capital stock issued and outstanding. The Commission defined its concept of \u201cnet worth\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>for purposes of the proposed new franchise tax as \u201cthe average fair market value of a taxpayer\u2019s total assets minus his total liabilities\u201d <em>(p. </em>62).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The bill introduced in the Legislature to implement the recommendation of the Commission, which ultimately was enacted as the statute now before us <em>(Assembly No. </em>395, introduced March 27, 1945), defined \u201cnet worth\u201d as \u201cthe fair market value of a taxpayer\u2019s total assets less liabilities (in the determination of which the commissioner may consider book value, earnings value and the aggregate market of a corporation\u2019s capital stock) plus <em>* </em>* Among the stated purposes of the bill, as recited in the \u201cStatement\u201d annexed thereto, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201c(1) to establish a simple and defensible tax on corporate business in lieu of an <em>ad valorem </em>tax on intangible personalty and the present capital stock tax, as part of the program recommended in the Report of the Commission on Taxation of Intangible Personal Property (March 26, 1945) to eliminate \u2018tax lightning\u2019 on intangibles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">However, as reported out of committee <em>(Assembly Minutes, </em>April 6, 1945, <em>p. </em>687), and enacted into law, the definition of net worth underwent a marked change, embodying substantially what we find in <em>section </em>54:10A~4(d), as quoted above. There is no extrinsic evidence as to the reason for the elimination of the reference to \u201cfair market value.\u201d The only variance in the act as enacted by <em>L. </em>1945, c. 162, from the present language (effected by amendment, <em>L. </em>1947, c. 50), is that, as originally enacted, the provision read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cHowever, if in the opinion of the commissioner, the corporation\u2019s books do not disclose fair valuations the commissioner may <em>require any additional information which may he necessary for </em>a reasonable determination of the net worth which, in his opinion, would reflect the fair value of the assets carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with sound accounting principles, and such determination shall be used as net worth for the purpose of this act.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Erom a consideration of all the foregoing, it is apparent that, as finally enacted and as the act stood in relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tax years in question, the Legislature was concerned with providing a relatively simple and administratively feasible formula for measuring the value of the exorcise of the corporate privilege in this State. It chose to do so by using basically the taxpayer\u2019s net book worth rather than becoming enmeshed in the complexities and administrative difficulties attendant upon true value or market value appraisal of assets for that purpose, a technique more characteristic of <em>ad valorem </em>property taxation than of franchise taxation. As stated in <em>Household Finance Corp. v. Director of Div. of Taxation, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>353, 358 (1962), in reference to the analogous Financial Business Tax Law (1946), N. <em>J. S. A. </em>54:10B-1 <em>et seq.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThat the tax is assessed upon a portion of net worth does not mean that it is an <em>ad valorem </em>assessment upon any of the underlying properties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> Proceeding from these premises, we are called upon to determine, at least for the purposes of passing upon what the Tax Division here did, the ambit of its authority to make \"a reasonable determination of [the taxpayer\u2019s] net worth\u201d which would reflect \"the fair value of the assets carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with sound accounting principles.\u201d Unless this enabling provision is sheer surplusage, an hypothesis we will not entertain unless no other is reasonably inferable from the legislative language, <em>Abbotts Dairies v. Armstrong, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>319, 327, 328 (1954), the face of <em>section </em>54:10A-4 conveys the thought that the net worth of the assets appearing on the books of a particular corporate taxpayer may represent something other than \"fair valuations\u201d thereof, and that the Tax Director may in such case, in assessing the franchise tax, revise the book figures to reflect \"fair value of the assets,\u201d providing, however, that his resulting readjustment of the figures is \u201cin accordance with sound accounting principles.\u201d If, as Maey argues, \u201cfair value\u201d in the statute simply means \"value as disclosed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>books of the corporation maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles, consistently applied,\u201d the draftsmen of <em>section </em>54:10A-4(d) as it now reads wrote most deviously. The natural method of expressing the latter concept would have been simply to say that \u201cnet worth shall mean the aggregate of the values disclosed by the books of the corporation, maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles, for (1) issued and outstanding capital stock, (2) * * . *,\u201d etc. The entire last sentence of (d) becomes a dead letter under Macy\u2019s hypothesis. We reject that postulate because we conceive a meaningful purpose in that last sentence, and, as already stated, we are bound, if reasonably possible, to seek and find significance in legislative language rather than to conclude for sterility therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Abstractly, the term \u201cfair value\u201d has no fixed meaning; it generally takes color from the context in which used or applied. In terms of constitutional and statutory requirements for the taxation of real property at true value (generally understood as market or exchange value), for example, courts have sometimes equivalently referred to the standard as \u201cfair value.\u201d <em>Plainfield v. State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>407, 408 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941). The same equivalence of meaning has been entertained in passing upon the fair value to be credited a mortgagor on a deficiency claim after foreclosure. <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Ritz Holding Co., </em>126 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>148, 149 <em>(Ch. </em>1939). See also <em>Jamouneau v. Local Government Board, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>281, 293 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We have recent evidence of the legislative capacity to write a tax statute wherein the taxpayer\u2019s book values are accepted as representing presumptively the taxable \u201cfair value\u201d of the property, subject to administrative regulation by uniform rules for the determination and reporting of factors entering into book values, such as costs and depreciation. <em>L. </em>1960, <em>c. </em>51; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:4U2.29 (dealing with the <em>ad valorem </em>taxation of tangible personal property used in business). Compare the provision in the same statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>54:4^9.1) for taxation of tangible personal property not used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>in business, as based upon designated percentages of \u201cthe fair value thereof, which shall be the fair market value thereof,\u201d and for the taxation of tangible household property and personal effects, at designated percentages of \u201cfair value,\u201d defined as \u201cthe value thereof for each household if offered for sale as a single lot.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:L-9.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The circumstance that the 1945 Legislature failed to define \u201cfair valuations\u201d in the Corporation Business Tax Act with the precision that a later Legislature did in relation to an entirely different kind of tax statute, but only by implication from the context of the act, will not justify the court in confining itself to the alternatives of meaninglessness or unconstitutional vagueness of standard, as in effect argued by Macy in this case. The court can and should look for clarification of meaning of statutory standards where discernible from the whole of the specific or cognate statutes. See <em>Ward v. </em>Scott, 11 <em>N. J. </em>117, 123 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We are not called upon here to explore and delineate the whole potential range of applications of the standard, \u201cfair value of the assets carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with sound accounting principles,\u201d in the act under construction. We have but to determine whether a reasonable and rational interpretation of the phrase, in the light of the purposes and objects of the act as a whole, permitted the Division of Taxation to do what it here did in relation to readjusting the values of inventories. We decide that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Of the two generally recognized principal purposes of financial statements under sound accounting, reflection of income and reflection of current worth, <em>Finney and, Miller, Principles of Accounting, op. cil., supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>1, the statutory section here involved is obviously concerned with the second, not the first. And since reporting of net worth under the act is made as of the <em>close </em>of the taxpayer\u2019s annual accounting period next preceding the commencement of the tax year for which the tax is payable, a selection of asset valuations more proximate in time to that date would appear reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>preferable, as against older valuations, if selection of either is consistent with sound accounting principles. At the least, we are not disposed as a court to quarrel with the expert administrative judgment that the recent rather than the older costs are the \u201cfair valuations,\u201d within the intent of the act. The alternative Pifo and Lifo inventory values in this case, under the evidence adduced, both represented the taxpayer\u2019s costs or market, whichever was lower, and the use of either was therefore in accordance with sound accounting principles. Since the Pifo costs reflected a time or times substantially closer to the close of the respective accounting periods applicable to the tax years in question than would Lifo costs, the Division of Taxation was not arbitrary in concluding that they provided the more realistic and the more reasonable reflection of current net worth of the corporation insofar as inventory is concerned, and thus the fair valuations thereof. The remoteness of Maey\u2019s Lifo costs in relation to the respective assessing dates here involved is cogently reflected by the substantial stated differences between its Lifo and Pifo figures, indicative of the conceded fact that the periods of time involved represented an era of rising costs. Under the circumstances, the Division of Taxation could properly regard the Lifo figures as not constituting \u201cfair valuations\u201d for the specific purpose at hand. In short, we conclude that a fair judicial effort to apply a sensible construction to the legislative authorization to the Division of Taxation to fix a \u201cfair value of the assets carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with sound accounting principles,\u201d must produce accord with the interpretation by the Director of his statutory powers and with the exercise thereof in this instance as to Macy\u2019s inventories. <em>Cf. National Tube Co. v. Peck, </em>159 <em>Ohio St. </em>98, 111 <em>N. E. 2d </em>11 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1953), where the statute failed to <em>give </em>the tax commissioner <em>any </em>power to readjust reported book values, but required him to accept them if he found the corporation\u2019s report \u201ccorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>II. The Lieo IIefctstd Clam</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Macy showed on its books as an asset for each of the franchise tax years here in question a $9,018,699 federal income tax refund claim for the six income tax years ending January 1947. The claim against the United States was based on the contention that Macy\u2019s taxable income for those income tax years should have been permitted to be computed by using the Lifo method of costing closing inventories. On May 12, 1958 there was an adverse decision as to the 1942 claim, <em>R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States of America, supra, </em>and on December 11,1961 as to the 1943-1947 claims, <em>R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States of America, </em>202 <em>F. Supp. </em>206 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1961). An appeal pends as to the latter claims. Both decisions were based on failure to make timely election under the federal tax regulations to use Lifo for income tax purposes for the income tax years involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Macy never claimed before the Director or the Division of Tax Appeals that the valuation of its assets should be reduced for franchise tax purposes by elimination of the Lifo refund claim because that claim had no value, or less value than the figure stated on its financial statements as of the dates thereof, nor does it so claim on this appeal. Its sole contention below and here is that it is inconsistent and therefore \u201cinequitable\u201d to retain the claim of income tax refund as an asset for franchise tax purposes at the same time that the Division of Taxation has readjusted its franchise tax obligations for 1956-1958 by rejection of Lifo in favor of Pifo inventory costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We find the argument without merit. There is no incompatibility at all, either in logic or fairness, between treating the income tax claim as the asset Macy\u2019s books showed it to be and at the same time concluding that the fair value of the inventories, as such, was represented by their Pifo costs for the franchise tax years here in question. The fact that the refund claim against the Government on account of 1942-1947 income taxes was based upon an asserted right to meas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ure <em>taxable income </em>by the Lifo method has no relevance whatever to the Tax Division\u2019s determination that the fair value of Macy\u2019s inventories as <em>components of net worth </em>for 1956-1958 franchise tax purposes was represented by Eifo rather than Lifo costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">III. Bad Debt Reserves</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Macjr\u2019s accounts receivable were reported less reserves for doubtful accounts of 3.48% for 1956, 3.1% for 1957 and 2.72% for 1958. The Tax Division 'adjusted these reserves uniformly to 2.5% of receivables on the ground that \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s past experience with respect to bad debts\u201d indicated the 2.5% to be \u201ca reasonable reserve\u201d for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The proofs indicated that Macy\u2019s ratios of actual write-offs of uncollectible accounts to gross receivables for the respective ye'ars in question were 1.9%, .9% and 1.24%. The average for the three years was approximately 1.1% as against the 2.5% allowed by the Tax Division in its readjustment. Average write-offs for five-year periods preceding the tax 3&lt;-ears in question did not exceed in percentages the write-off ratios for the tax years here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"> We have considered the argument addressed against the Tax Division\u2019s action and find ourselves in disagreement. The most relevant criterion, although concededly not the only one, in the establishment of a reasonable reserve for bad debts, is the history of recent actual write-offs. <em>Allied Building Credits, Inc. v. Bowers, </em>170 <em>Ohio St. </em>334, 164 <em>N. E. 2d </em>562 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1960); <em>S. W. Coe &amp; Co. v. Dallman, </em>216 <em>F. 2d </em>566 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1954). We cannot find any arbitrariness in the administrative determination that 2.5% would constitute a reasonable reserve for bad debts, reflecting the fair value of the accounts receivable, consistent with sound accounting principles. After all, this allowance is almost two and a half times the corporation\u2019s then recent actual write-off experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Macy argues that the reserves it had set up reflected in part its practice of repurchasing sold accounts receivable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>which are not collected by its assignees, notwithstanding it sells the accounts without recourse. But it does not appear that such sold accounts were reported in Macy\u2019s returns as a part of its accounts receivable assets. Nor were there any proofs as to what their volume was or as to Macy\u2019s actual losses with respect to them, either in dollars or percentages. The contention does not aid Macy\u2019s ease as to this item.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">IV. Deduction eor Debt Owing By Subsidiary</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Macy\u2019s returns for the tax years 1957 and 1958 reflected a deduction from net worth of the aggregate of the value of its stock in, and debt owing to it by, its wholly owned subsidiary, Garden State Plaza Corporation, a New Jersey corporation. It claimed the right so to do by virtue of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:10A-9, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cAny taxpayer which <em>holds </em>capital stock of a subsidiary during all or part of any year may, for the purposes of the tax imposed by this act, deduct from its net worth such proportion of the average .value of <em>such holdings </em>less net liabilities (if any) to subsidiaries, as the ratio of the subsidiary\u2019s taxable net worth, for the same year under this act, to its entire net worth; * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The Division of Taxation disallowed the deduction to the extent that it comprehended Garden State\u2019s debt to Macy, taking the position that the deductible \u201choldings\u201d mentioned in the statute meant only the capital stock in Garden State held by Macy, not debt owing to it by the subsidiary. There is no doubt in our minds, that the State\u2019s position as to this is correct and that there is not even a shadow of ambiguity in the pertinent statutory language. The reference, \u201csuch holdings,\u201d can only be read as relating back to the antecedent, \u201cAny taxpayer which <em>holds capital stoch </em>of a subsidiar)\u2019,\u201d etc. (Emphasis added). Neither the administrative agency nor we may take liberties with statutory language so clearly expressed, see <em>State v. Patfol, Inc., </em>76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>287 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962), even to subserve a supposedly desirable policy not effectuated by the act as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Macy stresses that Garden. State\u2019s whole debt to it must be included in Garden State\u2019s net worth under the act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:10A-4(d) (5), and argues that therefore, unless Macy can. deduct Garden State\u2019s indebtedness to it from its own net worth, double taxation results. It may first be observed that this is a franchise tax, not a property tax, and therefore, the assets not being taxed as such, there is no double tax on any property. To the extent that specific property or choses may incidentally become involved in the tax base of more than one corporation, this is by no means unusual or legally invidious, providing classifications are not arbitrary. See <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas ex rel. Norwood, </em>235 <em>U. S. </em>350, 35 <em>S. Ct. </em>99, 59 <em>L. Ed. </em>265 (1914). The classifications here are not shown to be arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Macy does not argue that if the Director\u2019s ruling is sustained the resulting tax is unconstitutional, nor do we believe such a position would be sound. To the extent that the argument made is offered as a guide as to the probable legislative intent, it cannot prevail against the plain statutory language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">V. Ultra Vires</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Macy contends that the redetermination of the assessment was made by the Corporation Tax Bureau in the Division of Taxation, not by the Director of the Division of Taxation, and that since there is no statutory authorization of delegation by the Director of any of his powers to any subagent or subagencjr, the reassessment is a nullity. We pass the objection by the State that this argument comes too late, not having been raised before the Division of Tax Appeals. The public importance of the issue calls for its disposition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">It is unquestionably sound law that, generally speaking, a delegated power cannot be further delegated, 42 <em>Am. J.ur., Public Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7' 73, <em>p. </em>387, but implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>in the rule is the qualification that there is no1 indication that the Legislature intends otherwise. The rule is essentially one of presumption of intent in statutory construction. However, there is abundant evidence that it is not actually contrary to the legislative intent that such a reassessment as was here made by the Corporation Tax Bureau as a subagency within the Division of Taxation should be within its permissive purview as delegate of the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In determining the question before us we must consider all legislation bearing upon the administrative duties, and powers of the Director of the Division of Taxation and the extent of his right to have assistance in relation thereto. Examination of all legislation <em>in pan materia </em>affords light on the question as to what it may reasonably be supposed the Legislature intended the Director might do in the administration of his responsibilities through agents rather than solely <em>in propria persona.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We find only these express provisions concerning appointment or designation of assistants or deputies generally. <em>R. 8. </em>54:1-8 empowers the commissioner (now Director) to appoint such \u201cclerical, technical and other assistants as may be necessary and prescribe their duties.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>54:1-11 provides that when the Director \u201cis unable to perform any one or more of his public duties, through sickness, absence from his office, pressure of other public business, temporary inability to act or any other cause\u201d he may designate a deputy or deputies to perforin any or all of his duties in his stead upon filing a certificate to that effect with the secretary of state. <em>R. 8. </em>54:1-12 authorizes the Director to establish and reorganize \u201cdivisions\u201d of the department. These sections clearly do not on their face contemplate the permanent delegation by the Director of regular and continuous responsibility for performance of any particular area of the Director\u2019s functions. <em>Cf. Horsman Dolls v. State Unemployment Compensation Com., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>77 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Except for certain isolated situations, there are no statutes expressly authorizing delegation by the Director of any of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>discretionary or quasi-judicial statutory duties or powers. One such exception is the Railroad Tax Act, which authorizes the Director to delegate to any officer or employee of his department \u201cpower to appraise and assess any or all property in railroad use.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:29A-5. Another is <em>B. 8. </em>54:34^-6, which authorizes the Director to appoint appraisers to value the property of decedents under the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act. However, the Director is enjoined to make the actual assessment. <em>B. 8. </em>54:34^12. See also <em>B. 8. </em>54:1\u201412 and 54:50-2, 3. But the great bulk of the statutory administrative functions of the Director are specified to be performed by him without any express authorization of power to delegate any of the manifold types of discretionary or quasi-judicial (in the sense of nonministerial) duties involved. Illustrative are such duties and powers, all specifically imposed by the statutes upon the Director himself, as assessment and taxation of motor fuels, billboards and outdoor advertising, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, public utilities (and apportionment of the proceeds thereof), decedent\u2019s estates, insurers, financial businesses and general corporations; investigation of irregularities or inequalities in local real estate assessments and ordering the increase, decrease or equalization of such assessments when required after investigation; and preparation of tables of equalized valuations of assessed real estate for every municipality in the State for purposes of state school aid distribution, showing separate ratios of assessed to true values, a process which involves analysis and classification of every recorded sale of real property which takes place in the State (about 200,000 annually). See <em>Bayonne v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>230 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The administrative duties involved in this complex of functions include valuation, assessment, jeopardy assessment, collection, remission or compromise of taxes or penalties, promulgation of rules and regulations, suspension and revocation of licenses in certain cases, determinations as to exemptions from taxation, determinations 'as to transfers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>contemplation of death (estate and transfer inheritance taxes), and miscellaneous others.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">If the Director may not delegate any of his nonministerial functions under the Corporation Business Tax Act because of absence of express authority therein, then it follows he may not do so under any of the other statutes imposing upon him the manifold duties and functions mentioned above, practically all of such legislation being equally devoid of express authority of delegation. That hypothesis obviously postulates a legislative intention that the Director do the impossible, since the aggregate number of transactions involving the performance of nonministerial functions in the administration of all these statutes, even excluding those few where there is express authorization for delegation, partial or total, runs hito the scores of thousands. Under the Corporation Business Tax Act alone, some 70,000 corporate returns require annual auditing and the making of the kinds of determinations illustrated by the disputes in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">This court will taire Judicial notice that a Corporation Tax Bureau in the Division of Taxation has administered the Corporation Business Tax Act since the inception of that tax, Just as such a bureau in predecessor state tax departments administered the previous corporation franchise tax act, faxing outstanding capital stock, for many years previously, notwithstanding such an agency was never mentioned in any statute providing for such taxes. Presumably, the Legislature has continuously known of the practice and by its failure to veto it has acquiesced therein, consented thereto, and impliedly authorized its continuance in the administration of the Corporation Business Tax Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We thus conclude that there is implied power in the Director to delegate to such an agency as the Corporation Tax Bureau the authority that agency exercised under his aegis to make the reassessment complained of in this case. <em>Cf. Cammarata v. Essex County Park Comm\u2019n, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>404, 411 (1958). Macy does not contend that in fact such delega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tion has not occurred or that the activities of the Corporation Tax Bureau do not have the full approval of the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">VI. Vagueness of Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The attack here is upon the allegedly \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d for redetermination vested by <em>section </em>54:10A-4 in the Director constituted by the criteria that \u201cin the opinion of the [Director], the corporation\u2019s books do not disclose fair valuations\u201d and \u201cdetermination of the net worth which, in his opinion, would reflect the fair value of the assets\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We have already in (I), above, dealt with the terms \u201cfair valuations\u201d and \u201cfair value\u201d from the standpoint of alleged vagueness of standards, and found that they had sufficient specificity of meaning, in the context of the section where found and the act as a whole, to be validly applicable tO' the dispute as to inventories. We conclude to the same effect in relation to the other asset items in contest discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Macy concentrates upon the statutory incorporation of the \u201copinion\u201d of the Director in the criterion for redetermination as condemning the standard for vagueness. We cannot agree, notwithstanding the reliance upon <em>Abelson\u2019s Inc. v. N. J. State Board of Optometrists, </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>412 (1950). The obvious and sensibly deduced meaning of <em>section </em>54:10A-4(d) is that if in the <em>reasonable </em>opinion of the Director the books do not disclose fair valuations he may make a determination of net worth which in his <em>reasonable </em>opinion reflects the fair value of the assets in accordance with sound accounting principles. The intended criterion, it is clear to us, is the reasonable judgment of an administrator making an objective judgment in the matter, anchored by the further qualification of consistency with sound accounting principles. We regard the <em>Abelson\u2019s </em>case, <em>supra, </em>as only superficially analogous to the issue here involved. The respective standards in the two cases, taken in entirety, are materially different, and the application of the standard in <em>Abelson\u2019s </em>was in a penal setting. The decision is not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>trolling in the present instance. Compare with the statute <em>sub judice </em>the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 471 (26 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Wo find no unconstitutional vagueness in the standards of the act before us. <em>Cf. Oxford v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Company, </em>104 <em>Ga. App. </em>788, 123 <em>S. E. 2d </em>277 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">VII. Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Macy contends that it has been discriminated against in that other competitive department stores applying the Lifo method in inventory accounting without indicating their Eifo differences were not subjected to readjustment of their inventory figures, and that efforts to prove this at the hearing were rebuffed upon objection. However, there was no claim of discriminatory assessment in the petition of appeal to the Division of Tax Appeals. Such a charge would open up a broad range of factual controversy, and, accordingly, of pertinent proofs, both affirmative and defensive, since an assertion of discriminatory assessment requires proof of a deliberate or systematic scheme or plan to subject one or more taxpayers to a more onerous burden than that being applied to the generality of taxpayers. <em>Jat Company, Inc. v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>571 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), certification denied 27 <em>N. J. </em>278 (1958). Introduction of such an issue in the case required pleading it before the Division so that the State might be prepared to meet it. This not having been done, the question of the comparative tax practices of other corporations or their treatment by the Division of Taxation was, as correctly decided below, irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">VIII. Administrative Rule-Making By Adjudication</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Macy contends that the Director\u2019s ruling as to valuation of inventories in this case constitutes the impermissible process of administrative rule-making by <em>ad hoc </em>adjudication of a particular ease rather than through the promulgation of general i-ules and regulations pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>54:10A-37. Here, again, Macy raises a contention not adduced in its petition of appeal before the Division of Tax Appeals in such manner as would have permitted the submission of proofs which might cast light on the reasonableness of the Director\u2019s proceeding in this area by ruling on the particular tax return before1 him rather than by promulgation of a general rule in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In any event, insofar as the argument before us is premised on the position that the Division of Taxation was powerless to exercise its statutory power to determine fair valuations of Macy\u2019s inventories as assets, in accordance with sound accounting principles, without <em>first </em>adopting a general rule that all department stores must report and are to be taxed on the base of Rifo inventories, the contention is without merit. Rirst, without more evidence, we cannot say that such a rule of unvarying application in all such cases would necessarily be appropriate. Second, and more important, there is, as <em>we- have- </em>decided, an adequate legislative standard in this act for administrative guidance, and in such ease the development of subsidiary rules and principles on a case by case basis is not proscribed. See 3 <em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise </em>(1958), \u00a7 17.08, <em>pp. </em>533-538, commenting on <em>Securities and Exchange Com. v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 <em>U. S. </em>194, 67 <em>S. Ct. </em>1575, 91 <em>L. Ed. </em>1995 (1947). Compare a situation involving absence of both statutory and administrative standards and 'an attempt nevertheless to&gt; proceed administratively by <em>ad hoc </em>ruling. <em>Boller Beverages, Inc. v. Davis, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>138 (1963). The <em>dictum </em>in <em>Mitchell v. Cavicchia, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>11, 15 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), is not against the position of the Director. Moreover, it was there said (at <em>p. </em>14) : \u201cthere is no rigid principle requiring an administrative agency to lay down rules and standards spelling out every wide grant of authority it receives.\u201d This precept is peculiarly apposite to taxing statutes which traditionally and commonly employ valuation standards even broader than those fixed by the tax act here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
