J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ACj\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether petitioner\u2019s temporary employment by respondents was properly adjudged to be \u201cnot regular, periodic or recurring\u201d <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-36), with the resultant denial of compensation benefits. Both the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division and the County Court on appeal, in denying recovery, held that the proofs established that petitioner was only a casual employee, as that phrase has been defined by pertinent decisions of our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Plaintiff was 70 years of age when she sustained injury as the result of a fall in defendants\u2019 home in Englewood in this State on Hovember 2, 1960. Petitioner lived in the same municipality. In her compensation petition she described her occupation as \u201cdomestic &amp; cook.\u201d Respondents\u2019 answer alleged that petitioner was working as a \u201cbabysitter\u201d at the time of the accident and that she was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of respondents within the meaning of the aforesaid statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The parties are in substantial agreement as to the factual situation on the basis of which we are required to determine whether petitioner\u2019s claim is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Petitioner, who' had been in receipt of social security benefits since she became 65 years of age, earned approximately $600 to $700 a year by working as a \u201cbabysitter\u201d for various families in the general area of the municipality in which she resided. When engaged in such work she occasionally performed other tasks incident to that type of employment, to which allied phases of her work reference will hereinafter be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Respondent Malcolm McKenna, at the time of the accident in question, was an assistant curator of vertebrate paleontol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ogy employed at the Museum of Natural History in New York City. He and his wife Priscilla McKenna and their three children, respectively <em>&amp;y2, </em>4^2 and <em>2 </em>years of age, comprised the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Prior to the occasion under scrutiny respondents had employed various \u201cbabysitters,\u201d including petitioner. The latter had worked for respondents on eight isolated occasions as a \u201cbabysitter,\u201d all in September and October 1960, as they had recently moved to thoir new home and had frequent need for \u201cbabysitting\u201d services. Petitioner was paid at the hourly rate of one dollar, with a minimum of five dollars for any single engagement. The engagements were for specific dates and varied as to the hour of commencement of the service as well as to the duration thereof. Petitioner\u2019s compensation on each occasion was paid by respondents at the termination of the specific service. Each engagement was a separate hiring. Some of the engagements were arranged through the medium of telephone calls from Mrs. McKenna to petitioner. On other occasions, on the termination of the services as a \u201cbabysitter\u201d on a particular day, Mrs. McKenna would engage petitioner for another specific date. Petitioner had not stayed \u201covernight\u201d at the McKenna home on any occasion prior to October 30, 1960. In response to an interrogation by her own counsel, petitioner, describing her \u201cusual occupation,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cWell, I babysit. I mostly go out to families that have children and keep them for as high as a week at a time if they are out of town for two or three days but then I go out just on regular babysitting nights from ten to fourteen hours, whatever they need me for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">On or about October 1, 1960 respondents advised petitioner that they were planning to go to Denver, Colorado-, and requested that petitioner take care of their children at their home from October 30 to November 4, inclusive. Petitioner accepted the engagement. She testified that her duties during that period, as outlined by Mrs. McKenna, were to \u201clook after the children, cook our meals and keep the house straightened, nothing hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Mrs. </em>McKenna testified that she engaged petitioner for the period in question after unsuccessfully endeavoring to employ each of three other women who, it developed, had prior daily commitments preventing them from accepting the particular work assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Concededly, it was arranged that petitioner\u2019s employment by respondents for the aforesaid period was to be continuous. Her engagement required her to sleep at respondents\u2019 home and to remain there during their absence. Petitioner\u2019s primary task was to take care of the children, to do the necessary cooking, cleaning and washing, and to perform incidental housekeeping chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It was agreed that respondents were to pay petitioner $10 per day, or a total sum of $60, for her work during the sis days of the engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The term \"employee\u201d is defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-36 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201c \u2018[Ejmployee\u2019 * * * includes all natural persons * * * who perform service for an employer for financial consideration, exclusive of casual employments, which shall be defined, if in connection with the employer\u2019s business, as employment the occasion for which arises by chance or is purely accidental; or <em>if not in connection with any business of the employer, as employment not regular, periodic or recurring; * </em>* (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The parties formally stipulated at the hearing in the Division \"that the engagement of petitioner as a babysitter was not in connection with respondents\u2019 business.\u201d As a consequence, the issue presented for resolution by the Division and by the County Court on appeal was whether petitioner\u2019s aforesaid engagements by respondents were \"casual,\u201d as defined by that portion of the aforesaid statutory provision as \u201cnot regular, periodic or recurring.\u201d On this- appeal we are called upon to resolve the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In <em>Glidear v. </em>Charles, 11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>523, 526 <em>(App. Div.), </em>affirmed 7 <em>N. J. </em>345 (1951), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">\u201cThe varying circumstances of employment outside the scope of employer\u2019s business are myriad when employment is tested for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>statutory non-casual requirements,\u2014\u2018regular, periodic or recurring.\u2019 No precise and practical definitions of compensable or casual employments under this provision of our statute suitable for all cases have been cited; and it is apparent that none can be composed. Each case must stand or fall upon its own facts tested by the fair meaning of the statutory standards of employment\u2014-\u2018regular, periodic or recurring.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">furthermore, in <em>Berkeyheiser v. Woolf, </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>171, 175 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cAlthough the statutory definition of casual employment has been found to be unserviceable in its practical application, nevertheless, the term \u2018casual\u2019 at least connotes a relationship relatively brief and passing, coming without regularity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Although, as above noted, \u201cno precise and practicable definitions\u201d of casual employment (where the employment is not in connection with the employer\u2019s business) are \u201csuitable for all cases,\u201d the general connotation of the term is recognized in <em>Forrester v. Eckerson, </em>107 <em>N. J. L. </em>156, 158 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1930), in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cThe words, as used in this act, connote that employment is regular when it is steady and permanent for more than a single piece of work; recurring, when the work is to be performed at some future time by the same party, without further engagement; and periodic, when the work is to be performed at stated intervals, without further engagement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Initially we determine that the proofs demonstrate that petitioner\u2019s aforesaid employment by respondents was not \u201csteady and permanent for more than a single piece of wort.\u201d On the contrary, it was irregular and impermanent. All of petitioner\u2019s engagements by respondents were for isolated periods, were disassociated from each other, were without continuity, and in each instance were created by specific, separate arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Although in this opinion we consider the entire relationship existing between petitioner and respondents, we note that petitioner\u2019s counsel viewed the issne more narrowly in his \u201cStatement of Question Involved,\u201d expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201cWhether the Court below correctly applied the law in holding that the petitioner was a casual employee engaged in a temporary employment where the petitioner was hired for six consecutive days on a twenty-four hour per day basis, and therefore not entitled to benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Petitioner, in support of her contention, relies very heavily on <em>Stillman v. Judges, Ct. Common Pleas, Essex Co., </em>6 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>6, 139 <em>A. </em>705 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>Cantwell v. Delaney, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>783, 160 <em>A. </em>679 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932), affirmed 110 <em>N. J. L. </em>554 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933); and <em>Jasnig v. Winter, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>320 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), affirmed 116 <em>N. J. L. </em>181 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Stillman </em>the petitioner \u201cwas engaged to work in household service of the Stillmans for two1 weeks at least, <em>and for such further time as she should he required.\u201d </em>(6 <em>N. J. Misc., </em>at <em>p. </em>7; emphasis supplied.) In <em>Cantwell </em>the petitioner \u201cwas engaged as a practical nurse to attend the mother and child and to do washing, cooking, and general housework for a period of three weeks <em>and such further time as her services might he required.\u201d </em>(10 <em>N. J. Misc., </em>at <em>pp. </em>783-784; emphasis supplied.) Both cases are factually distinguishable from the case at bar and furnish no basis for petitioner\u2019s claim for compensation. In <em>Stillman </em>and <em>Cantwell </em>our former Supreme Court emphasized not only the preliminary, specific period of employment, but the fact that the employment (as stated in <em>Stillman) </em>was \u201cfor such further time as she [petitioner] should be required,\u201d characterized as \u201can uncertain and indefinite period,\u201d <em>(Stillman, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>7) and (as stated in <em>Cantwell) </em>for \u201csuch further time as her [petitioner\u2019s] services might be required,\u201d which added period was labeled by the court as \"indefinite.\u201d <em>(Cantwell, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>784.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We next consider <em>Jasnig v. Winter, supra, </em>on which, as noted, petitioner also relies. The County Court, in the instant case, deemed <em>Jasnig </em>inapposite. In so holding, it said that in <em>Jasnig </em>\u201ca dressmaker working by the day, under the direction of her employer apparently worked for an indefinite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>period,\u201d and consequently was entitled to compensation. <em>Jasnig, </em>however, in our opinion, is more clearly distinguishable from the case at bar by reason of the fact that the employment of petitioner in the cited case was a \u201crecurring\u201d one. <em>Clausen v. Dinnebeil, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>223, 226 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940); <em>Fitzpatrick v. Haberman, 16 N. J. Super. </em>490, 494 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). The importance of the nonrecurring feature of petitioner\u2019s employment in the instant case is hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We find that the principle enunciated in <em>Glidear v. Charles, supra, </em>is dispositive of petitioner\u2019s contention that she is to be deemed a \u201cregular\u201d employee by virtue of the fact (as set forth in the aforesaid Statement of Question Involved) that she \u201cwas hired for six consecutive days on a twenty-four hour per day basis.\u201d In <em>Glidear v. Charles, </em>we said (11 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>527):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cIt seems dear that in the case <em>sub judiee </em>petitioner was not employed for a single piece of work, <em>nor for a single job, in any sense indicative of casual employment. </em>He was hired for a substantial residence construction project of unestimated duration except its completion.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We determine that petitioner\u2019s employment for the specific six-day period was not sufficient to constitute her a \u201cregular\u201d employee. <em>Cf. Petrone v. Kennedy, </em>75 <em>N. J. Super. </em>295, 303 <em>(App. Div.), </em>certification denied 38 <em>N. J. </em>312 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We also find that petitioner\u2019s arrangements with respondents did not satisfy the aforesaid statutory requirement of a \u201crecurring\u201d or \u201cperiodic\u201d employment. At no time did any arrangement exist whereby, at the conclusion of the rendition of service by petitioner for respondents on a specific occasion, the former <em>without further engagement </em>was to work again for respondents. The uncontradieted proofs show that the situation was to the contrary. At the conclusion of a period of hourly service, if respondents then knew when they would need the services of a babjrsitter\u201d again, arrangements would be made with petitioner (if she were the babysitter\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>desired by the McKennas and if she were available and her other commitments did not interfere) for a specific date for petitioner again to come to respondents\u2019 home to take care of their children. If respondents did not then know when they would next need a \u201cbabysitter,\u201d no arrangement for a further engagement would then be made with petitioner. When the date for such further need of a \u201cbabysitter\u2019s\u201d services became known' to respondents they would make arrangements therefor by calling one of several persons who did such work. On occasion the person so called would be petitioner, and the new engagement for a specific day would then be made with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Moreover, the services performed by petitioner for respondents did not meet the third aforesaid test, expressed in <em>Forrester, supra. </em>The services rendered were not \u201cperiodic,\u201d and were not performed \u201cat stated intervals without further engagement.\u201d As shown by the proofs, the work periods were not fixed at stated intervals. Each engagement was newly created as the need therefor arose. See <em>Gray v. Greenwood, </em>21 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>137, 144-5, 32 <em>A. 2d </em>347 <em>(C. </em>P. 1941), affirmed 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>596 <em>(Sup. Ct.), </em>and 130 <em>N. J. L. </em>558 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943); <em>Williams v. Jacobs, </em>21 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>131, 131 <em>A. 2d </em>803 <em>(Dept. Labor </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In holding that petitioner was a \u201ccasual\u201d employee, the judge in compensation observed that petitioner had \u201cdeveloped an occupation of baby sitting for families in and around her home\u201d; that she had \u201cspent time with this particular family\u201d on prior occasions; that each time she was separately paid for the specific service; that no regularity or continuity featured her employment; and that each employment constituted a separate engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The County Court, after independently analyzing the testimony, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201cIt is quite obvious that her [petitioner\u2019s] employment was not regular, periodic or recurring. She was engaged specifically for sis days, at a specific price for the particular occasion involved. It was not recurring because there was to be no future work without further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>engagement nor was it periodic when the work is to be performed at stated intervals without further engagement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">As noted in <em>Petrone v. Kennedy, supra., </em>75 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>303:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cWhen we deal with business employers, \u2018[o]ur act is construed to bring as many cases as possible within its coverage,\u2019 <em>Hannigan v. Goldfarb, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>190, 195 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958). <em>Cf. Graham v. Green, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>207 (1959). However, as Larson says (\u00a7 50.25, <em>p. </em>745), we should be slow \u2018to impose Workmen\u2019s Compensation liability on householders, either by judicial decision or by statutory extension Jfe * * <em>&gt; \u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The \u00a1judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
