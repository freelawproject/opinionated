After we denied an application filed by plaintiff, our Supreme Court remanded the matter to us as on leave granted and with the specific direction to consider whether the findings of the magistrate and the WCAC regarding \u201cactual events\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d causal connection were error under <em>Gardner v Van Buren Public Schools, </em>445 Mich 23; 517 NW2d 1 (1994). 451 Mich 863 (1996). We considered the case in <em>Zgnilec v General Motors Corporation (On Remand), </em>224 Mich App 392; 568 NW2d 690 (1997) <em>(Zgnilec I), </em>concluded that the magistrate and the wcac erroneously applied principles set forth in <em>Gardner, </em>and remanded for further consideration. <em>Zgnilec I, supra </em>at 393-394. In response to our opinion, the wcac subsequently remanded the case to the magistrate to \u201cdetermine whether the actual events of employment experienced by plaintiff contributed in a significant manner to his mental disability.\u201d The magistrate denied plaintiff\u2019s claim after finding that no actual events occurred that aggravated or contributed to his mental disability, and the WCAC affirmed. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We adopt the following facts set forth in <em>Zgnilec I, supra </em>at 394-396:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">Plaintiff worked for defendant in various capacities from July 19, 1954, through March 12, 1985. At the end of his career plaintiff was a Level 7 supervisor. Plaintiff\u2019s supervi-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>sor described plaintiff as his \u201cright arm\u201d and evaluated plaintiff in 1982 as \u201cimmediately promotable,\u201d although plaintiff was never promoted after that time. Near the end of his career plaintiff was involved in a downsizing or consolidation operation which was quite stressful for plaintiff and for others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">Plaintiff did not get along well with another employee, Bill Pickering, a Level 8 service engineer, with whom plaintiffs work brought him into contact. Plaintiff had a dispute with his supervisor about accompanying Pickering on a business trip. At a meeting on March 12, 1985, plaintiff became very upset, refused to go on the trip despite plaintiffs supervisor\u2019s order to do so, and plaintiff walked out of the meeting. On his way to work the next day, plaintiff was thinking about the workday ahead of him when an episode occurred which might be described as an anxiety attack. Plaintiff was hospitalized for two or three days and has not worked since.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">There is no dispute that plaintiff is disabled. Plaintiffs treating psychiatrist, Dr. Andrew Pasternak, diagnosed depression, a generalized anxiety disorder, and an obsessive compulsive personality. The magistrate found that plaintiff was disabled. This finding was not disturbed by the wcac.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Plaintiff testified about numerous situations, circumstances, and incidents that occurred over the years involving his employment. Plaintiff viewed many of these incidents as harassment or ridicule. Among the \u201cevents\u201d plaintiff testified about were the stress he experienced in connection with the consolidation of defendant\u2019s operations, the conflict he had with Bill Pickering, the fact that plaintiff was not promoted after he was evaluated as immediately promotable in 1982, and being required to accompany Pickering on a business trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Pasternak, testified that plaintiff\u2019s disability was significantly related to plaintiffs perception of what happened to him at his place of work. Examining psychiatrist Richard Feldstein testified that plaintiff\u2019s disability was directly and significantly caused by the stresses and pressures plaintiff experienced at work. Examining psychiatrist John Lukens testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>plaintiff had a personality disorder that led to plaintiffs disability. Lukens thought that plaintiff was preoccupied with a lack of recognition at work and that plaintiff finally reached the point where he simply could not tolerate working for defendant because of the circumstances at his workplace and his perception that he was not sufficiently recognized for his efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We also adopt the standard for establishing a mental disability set forth in <em>Zgnilec I, supra </em>at 396-397:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">To establish a compensable mental disability under MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2), a claimant must prove: (1) a mental disability; (2) which arises out of actual events of employment, not unfounded perceptions thereof; and (3) that those events contributed to or aggravated the mental disability in a significant manner. <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 27-28. Once a disability is established (as in the instant case), the relevant inquiry is: Did the actual events of employment occur, and do these bear a significant relationship to the mental disabilities? <em>Id. </em>at 50. <em>Gardner </em>further explained that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cReduced to its simplest form, the analysis is this: Given actual events and a particular claimant, with all the claimant\u2019s preexisting mental frailties, can the actual events objectively be said to have contributed to, aggravated, or accelerated the claimant\u2019s mental disability in a significant manner?\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 50.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\"><em>Gardner </em>made it clear that unfounded perceptions by a claimant of actual events does not preclude finding a compensable disability. It would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to hold otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 44. It is an unfounded perception of reality which often characterizes a mentally disabled person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Here, as in <em>Zgnilec I, </em>we conclude that the magistrate\u2019s analysis of events and the wcac\u2019s affirmance of the magistrate\u2019s reasoning in regard to whether plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tiff was harassed or ridiculed are inconsistent with the principles explained in <em>Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>m</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Judicial review of a wcac decision is limited to the findings made by the wcac and whether the wcac properly reviewed whether the magistrate\u2019s decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>Hagerman v Gencorp </em>Automotive, 457 Mich 720, 727; 579 NW2d 347 (1998). This Court may also reverse a decision of the \"wcac if the commission operated within the wrong legal framework, if its decision was based on erroneous legal reasoning, if it based a finding of fact on a misconception of law, or if it failed to correctly apply the law. <em>Jones-Jennings v Hutzel Hosp (On Remand), </em>223 Mich App 94, 105; 565 NW2d 680 (1997). Questions of law are reviewed de novo on appeal. <em>Tyler v Livonia Public Schools, </em>459 Mich 382, 388; 590 NW2d 560 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Zgnilec I, supra </em>at 397, we stated that \u201c[t]he question is whether the events or incidents that formed the basis for plaintiff\u2019s sense of harassment and ridicule actually occurred.\u201d On remand, the magistrate analyzed four events to determine which events, if any, actually occurred: (1) whether plaintiff was subjected to stress with consolidation at his workplace, (2) whether plaintiff disliked Pickering, (3) whether plaintiff was passed over for promotion, and (4) whether plaintiff was harassed or ridiculed. First, the magistrate found that while plaintiff was subjected to stress related to the consolidation operation, the consolidation was not a \u201csignificant event\u201d and plaintiff was able to cope with the stress. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the magistrate found that plaintiff did not like Pickering, but concluded that the mere fact that plaintiff disliked a coemployee did not lead to his disability. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the wcac properly reviewed the magistrate\u2019s decision regarding these two events and correctly applied the principles set forth in <em>Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We also conclude that the wcac correctly applied the law in determining that the third event, i.e., whether plaintiff was passed over for promotion, did not occur. The wcac\u2019s decision incorporated the magistrate\u2019s determination that plaintiff was not \u201cpassed over for promotion,\u201d even though plaintiff stated the occurrence of this \u201cevent\u201d to his doctor. We note that the WCAC incorporated the magistrate\u2019s findings in her original opinion that \u201c[a]s of approximately 1982, Mr. lieffers [plaintiff\u2019s supervisor] evaluated the plaintiff and indicated that he was immediately promotable,\u201d and the magistrate\u2019s opinion on remand that \u201c[t]he plaintiff in approximately 1982 was listed as promotable.\u201d Plaintiff did not have an \u201cunfounded perception\u201d that he was evaluated as \u201cimmediately promotable,\u201d and thus his 1982 evaluation was not the type of imaginary, hallucinated, or delusionary event that our Supreme Court prohibited as the basis for a compensable mental disability claim in <em>Gardner. </em>See <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 45-46. However, the crux of plaintiff\u2019s claim is that he was <em>passed over for promotion, </em>not that he received an evaluation as immediately promotable. The fact that plaintiff was listed as immediately promotable did not guarantee plaintiff a promotion. Accordingly, we conclude that the WCAC correctly applied the law in determining that plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>contention that he was passed over for promotion was not an actual event.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">However, we disagree with the wcac\u2019s decision that plaintiff was neither harassed nor ridiculed. The magistrate made the following finding in regard to plaintiffs claim that he was harassed or ridiculed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">As for the ridicule, Mr. Zgnilec linked this with harassment. In my opinion, there is no harassment by General Motors and there was no ridicule. Mr. Zgnilec\u2019s supervisor respected his abilities and indeed testified that Mr. Zgnilec was his \u201cright arm.\u201d Although the plaintiff testified that he was ridiculed, this is only an honest perception and has no basis in reality. In my opinion, the plaintiff also was not harassed. He was asked to do a job by General Motors. Asking someone to do a job does not equate to harassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Our ability to review this issue is hampered by the magistrate\u2019s cursory conclusions, adopted by the wcac, that plaintiff was neither ridiculed nor harassed. \u201c \u2018[C]onclusory findings are inadequate because we need to know the path [the wcac] has taken through the conflicting evidence, the testimony it has adopted, the standards followed and the reasoning used to reach its conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 269, n 20; 484 NW2d 227 (1992), quoting <em>Kostamo v Marquette Iron Mining Co, </em>405 Mich 105, 136; 274 NW2d 441 (1979). The record indicates that certain events occurred that may have constituted harassment or ridicule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the wcac has not set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>forth the testimony it adopted to support its conclusion that plaintiffs testimony regarding harassment and ridicule \u201chad no basis in reality.\u201d While we do not independently weigh the evidence on appeal, <em>Snyder v General Safety Corp (On Remand), </em>200 Mich App 332, 335; 504 NW2d 31 (1993), we nonetheless require an adequate record for review. Accordingly, we must remand the case for further findings to enable us to understand the evidentiary basis and reasoning in support of the wcac\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding harassment and ridicule had no basis in reality. See <em>Layman v Newkirk Electric Associates, Inc, </em>458 Mich 494, 509; 581 NW2d 244 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We remand for further findings setting forth the evidentiary basis for the wcac\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff was neither ridiculed nor harassed. We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> For example, we note that plaintiff testified that he was placed in a room with Pickering so that his supervisor could watch the two \u201cduke it out.\u201d Plaintiff also testified that his supervisor requested him to travel to Flint on various occasions for no apparent business purpose; that his supervisor told plaintiff in front of co-workers that he did not care about plaintiffs accomplishments at the Truck and Bus Division in Pontiac; that other employees took credit for plaintiff\u2019s work and ideas; that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>was the only person in Ms position not reimbursed for mileage in excess of his normal home to home-plant route; that other employees accused him of trying to show off and make them look bad; and, that supervisors commented that plaintiff thought he was \u201ctoo good to participate\u201d m company social events.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
