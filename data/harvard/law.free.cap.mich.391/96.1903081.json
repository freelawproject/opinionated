DeGeer suffered a back injury during the course of his employment with the DeGeer Farm Equipment Company. Compensation was paid voluntarily for the first 500 weeks of disability. After the period of initial compensation expired, appellant filed an application for a hearing with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Department alleging permanent and total disability and seeking further compensation under Part II, \u00a7 10(b)(7) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which grants extended benefits when injury results in the \"[permanent and total loss of industrial use of both legs * * * .\u201d (1956 PA 195; MCLA 412.10; MSA 17.160, reenacted by MCLA 418.361[2] [g]; MSA 17.237[361] [2] [g].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">A hearing was held before a Workmen's Compensation Department hearing referee. The hearing referee granted appellant\u2019s application for permanent and total disability benefits, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\"The plaintiff is totally and permanently disabled as a matter of fact. The question is whether or not he can meet the statutory definition of permanent and total by establishing the loss of use of his legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">\u2666 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\"There is no condition in plaintiff\u2019s legs which would disable him. His disabling condition is in his back where he has had four operations. Because of his back he cannot tolerate prolonged sitting, standing, or walking. He cannot use his legs long enough or consistently enough to qualify for type of employment which could reasonably be anticipated. I believe these facts require a finding of loss of use of both legs under the authority of <em>Paulson v Tile Company, </em>371 Mich 312 [123 NW2d 715 (1963)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The decision of the referee was thereafter reversed on review by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. The Appeal Board found appellant ineligible for any total and permanent disability benefits. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\"The legal rules which must guide our determination as to whether plaintiff has suffered the industrial loss of use of both limbs are detailed in the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Paulson, supra; Miller v Sullivan Milk Products, Inc, </em>385 Mich 659 [189 NW2d 304 (1971)]; <em>Whitt v Ford Motor Co, </em>383 Mich 726 [178 NW2d 917 (1970)]; and the Court of Appeal\u2019s holdings in <em>Lockwood v Continental Motors Corp, </em>27 Mich App 597 [183 NW2d 807 (1970)], and <em>Kozlowski v Chrysler Corp, </em>25 Mich App 392 [181 NW2d 785 (1970)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\"[Pjlaintiff\u2019s medical proofs will not in our opinion support his claim that he has suffered the industrial loss of use of both legs. Both physicians are in agreement that plaintiff\u2019s employment opportunities are limited because of the injury and subsequent surgery to his back, however, both plaintiff\u2019s medical witness and the defendant\u2019s medical witness agree that plaintiff is able to perform work which would of necessity require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>use of the lower limbs. Neither doctor would testify that plaintiff has in fact suffered the industrial loss of use of his lower extremities. In our opinion the proofs presented will not support a finding that plaintiff has in fact suffered the industrial loss of use of both limbs as a result of the injury he suffered in February, 1956.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The Court of Appeals (Levin, J. dissenting) denied leave to appeal. This Court subsequently granted leave to appeal, 389 Mich 803 (1973) and ordered that this case be argued on the same day as <em>Burke v Ontonagon County Road Commission, </em>389 Mich 804 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Appellant raises one basic question for our consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\"Where an employee suffers a back injury which upon use of his legs produces such disabling back pain that no form of employment could reasonably be anticipated, does such employee suffer the industrial loss of use of his legs?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Our first step in reviewing a decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is to separate its findings of fact from its understanding of the law controlling the case. If the Appeal Board correctly understood the law and determined as a matter of fact that appellant did not suffer permanent and total disability, we are bound by law to accept its decision in this case. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28; MCLA 418.861; MSA 17.237(861). If, however, the Appeal Board erroneously interpretated the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in reaching its decision, we have the duty and authority to correct any such erroneous legal conclusions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">In the present case we are unable to perform that necessary first step of review. Unfortunately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the opinion of the Appeal Board has combined its findings of fact and legal conclusions in such a manner that the opinion may be fairly read to support either appellant\u2019s position that the Appeal Board denied benefits because it interpreted the law to limit recovery to factual situations in which the disability results from a direct injury to the legs, or appellees\u2019 position that no permanent and total loss of industrial use was factually established. Consequently, we must remand this case for further proceedings consonant with the remainder of today\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In order to allow the appellate courts to properly perform the review function we remind the appeal board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\"We cannot * * * review the findings of the board as a question of law if * * * it has done nothing more than to present us with a conclusory finding in the form of the statutory language. We need to know the path the board has taken through the conflicting evidence. The appeal board should indicate the testimony adopted, the standard followed and the reasoning it used in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>McClary v Wagoner, </em>16 Mich App 326, 327-328; 167 NW2d 800 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In <em>Burke v Ontonagon County Road Commission, </em>391 Mich 103; 214 NW2d 797 (1974), Justice Williams has thoroughly reviewed the scope of disability required to bring a claimant within the statutory phrase, \"permanent and total loss of industrial use of both legs * * * .\u201d In <em>Burke, </em>this Court adopted the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\"There is permanent and total loss of industrial use of both legs where, <em>inter alia,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">1. An employment-related injury in one or both legs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>causes pain or other condition that prevents use of both legs in industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">2. The use of one or both legs, whether or not injured, triggers an employment-related injury or malady in any part of the body, including one or both legs, that causes pain or other condition that prevents use of both legs in industry.\u201d 391 Mich 103, 114; 214 NW2d 797 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">If appellant DeGeer, on remand, establishes that the use of his legs produces such disabling back pain that he is no longer able to use his legs to perform any reasonable employment, then he will clearly be eligible for permanent and total disability benefits under the above discussed section of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Reversed and remand\u00e9d to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for further proceedings, including the taking of additional testimony if requested, by the Appeal Board or any party, to comply with this opinion.

In the words of the Appeal Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\"Plaintiff was injured prior to the 1956 amendment and if he is permanently and totally disabled as such tenri was defined in the 1956 amendment by the addition of Sec. 10 (b)(7), Part II, then the liability for both the differential payments accruing thereafter and all payments in .excess of 500 weeks would be the liability of the Second Injury Fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
