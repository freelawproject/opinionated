Long\u2019s sale to Wright-Way was in interstate commerce. Long\u2019s activities in Michigan were incidental to that sale. Long was not \"carrypng] on its business\u201d in Michigan and was not subject to the foreign corporation qualification requirements of MCLA 450.93; MSA 21.94.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In holding that Long was \"doing business\u201d in Michigan, both the circuit judge and the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Dobson v Maytag Sales Corp, </em>292 Mich 107, 111; 290 NW 346 (1939). In <em>Dobson, </em>this Court concluded that the defendant foreign corporation was \"doing business [in Michigan] in such a sense as to make it amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State\u201d. The Court stated, however, that the analysis for jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>purposes was \"not to be determined by the tests applicable under statutes such as those prescribing the conditions under which a foreign corporation may be allowed to do business within the State. Activities insufficient to make out the transaction of business under such statutes may yet be sufficient to bring the corporation within the State so as to make it amenable to process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The expansive interpretation of the long-arm jurisdiction statutes<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is not a proper guide for determining what intrastate activities constitute \"carrying] on its business\u201d by a foreign corporation requiring procurement of a certificate of authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6\"The policy, purpose, and history of these statutes differ substantially\u201d. <em>Riblet Tramway Co v Monte Verde Corp, </em>453 F2d 313, 317 (CA 10, 1972).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The United States Supreme Court has considered the propriety of a state requiring a foreign corporation to domesticate before carrying on its business in terms of the Commerce Clause; while the long-arm statutes have been thought to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>questions under the Due Process Clause. The public policy favoring commerce between the states, necessitating the imposition of limitations on state regulation of interstate activity, is entirely consistent with a policy of allowing a state to provide its citizens with a forum in local courts to seek damages resulting from transactions with nonresidents. Both policies have this in common: they ultimately favor the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Long sells its merchandise, manufactured in North Carolina, through a national sales organization. Its traveling salesmen solicit orders for unassembled farm and related machinery and equipment from wholesalers and retailers who, pursuant to agreements, have become Long \"dealers\u201d. As both Long salesmen and the managers of their district sales headquarters lack the authority to bind Long contractually, the solicited orders, being mere offers, are sent to North Carolina for acceptance or rejection. If the order is accepted, the machinery and equipment is shipped to the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Long\u2019s Michigan operations are limited to the solicitation of orders by its salesmen. It has neither an office nor inventory in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In this case the ultimate purchaser was C. J. Williams, a manager of a farm. He inquired about purchasing grain handling equipment from Wright-Way, a Long dealer. Wright-Way\u2019s communications with a Long salesman caused R. W. Strickland, Long\u2019s district sales manager, to come from Ohio to Wright-Way\u2019s office in Michigan to discuss the prospective sale. In the words of the circuit judge, Strickland \" 'took over\u2019 \u201d the discussions \"in no uncertain terms.\u201d He accompanied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Arthur Scott, Wright-Way\u2019s vice-president and general manager, to Williams\u2019 farm, made suggestions regarding the equipment and where it should be located, and presented Wright-Way with a quotation of dealer list prices to offer Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Scott and Williams, after negotiating further between themselves about possible discounts from the list price, agreed upon a final price. Scott and Strickland then returned to Wright-Way\u2019s office where Strickland prepared Wright-Way\u2019s order from Long. Scott signed the order and Strickland forwarded it to North Carolina where it was approved. The equipment was later shipped into Michigan from Iowa. Strickland\u2019s \"taking over\u201d the negotiations between Wright-Way and Williams made it \"quite clear\u201d to the circuit judge that Long had made the \"sale itself (albeit in its dealer\u2019s name).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The statute does not prohibit the transaction of \"any business in the State\u201d but only forbids \"the <em>carrying on </em>of the business of the corporation in this State.\u201d <em>Electric Railway Securities Co v Hen</em>dricks, 251 Mich 602, 605; 232 NW 367 (1930). (Emphasis by the Court.) Thus, \"[i]t is not every act or transaction of a foreign corporation in the state that will bring it within the operation of laws imposing conditions on its right to do business in the state. The thing done must be of a character indicative of an intention on the part of the corporation to carry on its business in the state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is implied in the term 'doing business\u2019 a continuity of act and purpose.\u201d 17 Fletcher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Cyclopedia Corporations (1960 rev ed), \u00a7 8466, pp 554-555.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It appears that this was the first and only time that Long had become involv\u00e9d in a Michigan dealer\u2019s negotiation with a prospective customer. Since isolated or independent intrastate activities, unless evidencing an intention to carry on the corporate business within the state, do not require a corporation first to qualify to do business, Long\u2019s participation in the negotiations between Wright-Way and Williams did not subject Long to the Michigan foreign corporation qualification requirements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ******8</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">There are even some continuous activities in which a foreign corporation may engage locally without domesticating. \"[I]t may be relieved from compliance with state statutes if the business is interstate.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has said that \"the taking of orders in one State for goods to be shipped from another or the shipment of such goods in the channels of interstate commerce\u201d does not subject a foreign corporation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>statutes requiring such corporations to qualify before carrying on their business locally.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\"The mere negotiations of sales of goods which require transportation from outside the state constitute interstate commerce, and hence state statutes as to admission of foreign corporations do not apply to the acts of agents of a foreign corporation in soliciting, receiving and transmitting orders for such goods. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>immaterial whether the orders are taken by residents or non residents, or from consumers or dealers.\u201d 17 Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations (1960 rev ed), \u00a7 8409, pp 338-339.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Thus, Long was not required to qualify in Michigan before making an \"interstate\u201d sale to one of its dealers (Wright-Way) even though one of its employees (Strickland) came into Michigan to obtain the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">If, as the circuit judge found, Long made the \"sale itself (albeit in its dealer\u2019s name)\u201d <em>to Williams, </em>such a direct sale would also be an interstate sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co v Sav-On-Drugs, Inc, </em>366 US 276, 278; 81 S Ct 1316; 6 L Ed 2d 288 (1961), rehearing denied 366 US 978; 81 S Ct 1913; 6 L Ed 2d 1268 (1961), the United States Supreme Court, in its most recent expression, said that while \"[u]nder the authority of the so-called 'drummer\u2019 cases * * * Lilly is free to send salesmen into New Jersey to promote this interstate trade without interference from regulations imposed by the State\u201d, it was engaged in intrastate commerce in New Jersey because, it maintained an office in Newark with 18 promotion men whose function was to induce retailers to purchase from wholesalers who in turn dealt with Lilly.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Here, in contrast, Long maintained no office in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Michigan and had no full or part-time employee regularly engaged in promoting intrastate purchases by Michigan retailers or residents from Long dealers. Whatever Strickland\u2019s involvement in the negotiations culminating in Wright-Way\u2019s sale to Williams, his activities in bringing about that one intrastate sale, being \"isolated\u201d, non\"continuous\u201d, non-\"systematic\u201d, did not amount to carrying on, or evidence an intention on Long\u2019s part to carry on, its business in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The trial judge also found that Long was required to qualify in Michigan because it \"participated actively in the installation and erection of the equipment\u201d, and, when the installation proved defective, Strickland \"made contact with a different contractor named Veil who was put on the job to redo or do right the, work the original contractor Stubbs had done wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">A foreign corporation which contracts to erect or install or supervise the erection or installation of machinery and equipment which it has sold and shipped to a state may under some circumstances subject itself to local qualification requirements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We need not consider the intricate case law concerning such transactions because, quite simply, Long did not contract with Williams to, nor did it actually install the grain bins for Williams. It merely arranged for installation contractors to communicate with Wright-Way and Williams; subsequently Williams entered into separate contracts with installers.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">These arrangements were made after Wright-Way and Williams informed Strickland that neither knew a contractor who could install the equipment and asked him to suggest the name of a contractor. Strickland agreed and made several phone calls. When Eddie Stubbs, an Ohio contractor, expressed an interest, Strickland took the plans and cost projections to Long\u2019s office in Ohio where Stubbs examined them.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Stubbs expressed a desire to take the job, and Strickland told him to communicate with Wright-Way. Stubbs eventually contracted with Williams and installed the grain bins. Long was not a party to this contract. Stubbs was not an employee or agent of Long, but an independent contractor who had previously done business with Long. No employee of Long either supervised or aided in Stubbs\u2019 installation of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">When Wright-Way and Williams became dissatisfied with Stubbs\u2019 installation, they requested Strickland to suggest another installer to remedy the apparent defects. Strickland described the job to another Ohio contractor, C. W. Veil. Upon Veil\u2019s request, Strickland accompanied him to Williams\u2019 farm to discuss the matter with Wright-Way and Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Subsequently, outside of Strickland\u2019s presence and apparently even without his knowledge, Veil entered into a contract signed by both Wright-Way and Williams \u2014 payment to be made by Williams\u2014 to do the necessary alterations. Once again the record fails to indicate that any Long employee was in any way connected with Veil\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Strickland\u2019s placing of Stubbs and Veil in communication with Wright-Way and Williams does not support the finding that Long installed, or even \"participated actively in the installation and erection of the equipment,\u201d and it certainly does not constitute the \"carrying] on of business\u201d by Long in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In finding that Long\u2019s involvement in Wright-Way\u2019s sale constituted doing business in Michigan, the judge also noted that Strickland had \"arranged to have a defect in the nature of a bow in the leg of an elevator corrected by one Lavern Crawford\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">As previously mentioned, while the taking of orders in one state for goods to be shipped from another is regarded as interstate commerce, regular and continuous activity ordinarily does subject a foreign corporation to domestication requirements. Accordingly, just as a foreign corporation which contracts to install may subject itself to such requirements, so, too, may a foreign corporation which contracts to repair or maintain its products subject itself to such requirements. The isolated repair activity in this cas\u00e9 did not, however, constitute the carrying on, or indicate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>intention to carry on, a regular and continuous business.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">At no time did Long contract with Wright-Way or with Williams to repair or maintain the equipment. Long does not employ repairmen. It is not its practice nor part of its business to repair the equipment which it sells.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Strickland visited the farm in response to Williams\u2019 complaints, observed that there was a bow in a leg of the equipment, and agreed that \"a man [Crawford]\u201d who he had \"coming through * * * would stop and tighten the cables or whatever was necessary to get the bow out.\u201d Crawford, a warehouseman \"responsible for keeping the inventory in the proper place,\u201d made a relatively small repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-8\">T.
