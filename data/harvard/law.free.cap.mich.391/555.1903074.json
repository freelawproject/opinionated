It shall be the obligation of the judge to require the prosecutor to produce or explain why he cannot produce Eugene Smith at such hearing and why he was not indorsed and produced at the trial. If Eugene Smith is produced he shall be examined regarding his knowledge of the crime of which the defendant was convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">\"At the conclusion of the remand hearing, the trial judge shall take such action as he deems required. If a new trial is not ordered, the trial judge shall state his findings and the transcript of that hearing and the judge\u2019s statements shall be forwarded to this Court. Defendant may file a supplemental brief within 30 days and the people within 20 days after receipt of the defendant\u2019s brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Eugene Smith was produced at the required evidentiary hearing on February 11, 1974 and the judge drew the following factual conclusions from the testimony therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">\"1. That the alleged res gestae Smith was at or near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the door of the bar in question immediately prior to the fatal shooting <em>[sic];</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\"2.

That he could not or would not offer any testimony at a re-trial of this cause which would differ in any material respects from that adduced at the first trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">A new trial was not ordered. The transcripts and findings have been duly filed but no additional briefs were forthcoming. The respective parties have in writing stated their intention to file no supplemental briefs, counsel for the defendant having outlined a considerable but unsuccessful effort to produce and present additional arguments on behalf of Mr. Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Consistent with the findings of the trial court, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-9\">T.
