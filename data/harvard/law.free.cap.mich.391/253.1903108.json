The MERC order directs the school district to restore plaintiff Wilma Wilder, a public employee, to the status of a substitute bus driver and reimburse her back pay in a yet undetermined amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Mrs. Wilder was hired by the school district and in September, 1968, began work as a substitute school bus driver. She desired a permanent position. When other drivers, junior in seniority, were offered permanent positions, she complained and eventually filed a grievance asserting that such offers were in derogation of her seniority rights under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">During the pendency of her grievance, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Wilder communicated by telephone with the other drivers (whose appointment to permanent positions formed the basis for her grievance) seeking information which would enable her to prosecute her grievance effectively. The school district interpreted these communications as harassment of the other drivers and advised Mrs. Wilder that she would no longer be called as a substitute driver. She, in effect, was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Mrs. Wilder filed unfair labor charges against the union and the school district.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The trial examiner found that Mrs. Wilder had been discharged for engaging in \"lawful concerted activity\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> protected under \u00a7 9 and ordered reinstatement and back pay. He found that she had been discharged \"not for having filed a grievance, but because of the telephone calls the charging party [Mrs. Wilder] made to other employees. In the opinion of the undersigned these telephone calls were inextricably related to the grievance that the charging party had filed relative to her treatment as a substitute bus driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The examiner dismissed the grievance against the union on the ground that it did not state a cause of action under the act. Mrs. Wilder did not file exceptions to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The school district filed exceptions with MERC which adopted the pertinent findings of the examiner and issued an order incorporating his recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Upon MERC\u2019s petition, the Court of Appeals ordered enforcement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">As a general proposition PERA does not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>scribe breach of a collective bargaining agreement or \"unfairness\u201d; an employee may be terminated for a \"good reason, bad reason, or no reason at all\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But an employee may not be discharged for exercising rights guaranteed by \u00a7 9 of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Section 10 of the act provides that it shall be unlawful for a public employer \"to interfere with, restrain or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in section 9\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 9 provides that \"[i]t shall be lawful for public employees * * * to engage in lawful concerted activities for the purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other mutual aid and protection\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">These provisions enlarging the rights of public employees were added to the Hutchinson Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by 1965 PA 379. They adopt word-for-word the analogous provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. Thereby, MERC was transformed into an agency akin to the NLRB and empowered for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>first time to enter a remedial order for violation of the act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">This appeal presents questions concerning the construction of the act not previously addressed by this Court. There are abundant decisions of the NLRB and the United States Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States construing comparable provisions of the NLRA. The parties have relied on and we may appropriately look to the Federal precedents for guidance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The United States Supreme Court has applied the comparable provisions of the Federal Act to protect nonunion as well as union employees from interference for engaging in \"concerted activity\u201d.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, it is not decisive whether Mrs. Wilder, who joined the union, was, as claimed by the school district, ineligible to join because she, a substitute driver, did not have \"regularly scheduled hours\u201d within the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The school district relies on <em>Mushroom Transportation Co v National Labor Relations Board, </em>330 F2d 683, 685 (CA 3, 1964), where the Third Circuit held that an employee was not engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>protected activity when he conversed with other employees about alleged employer failure to observe the union contract. In so holding the Court said that such activity is protected only if it is \"engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or that it had some relation to group action in the interest of the employees\u201d. The <em>Mushroom </em>Court carefully noted that the discharged employee had not filed a formal grievance and referred to his conversations with other employees as \"mere 'griping.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The NLRB and United States Courts of Appeals have held, however, that the filing of a <em>grievance </em>by even a single employee constitutes protected concerted activity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In holding that an employee may not be discharged for the filing of a grievance, the NLRB and the Courts of Appeals have rejected arguments that the filing of an individual grievance is not \"concerted\u201d activity for the purpose of \"collective\u201d negotiation or bargaining or other \"mutual\u201d aid and protection. They reasoned that a person who in good faith asserts an individual grievance based on a provision of a collective bargaining agreement should be protected because \"the collective bargaining agreement is the result of concerted activities by the employees for their mutual aid and protection\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Since Mrs. Wilder had filed a formal grievance before she made the phone calls to the other drivers there is no need in this case to decide the extent of the protection provided employees who voice complaints or gripes which have not yet ripened into a formal grievance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Turning to the facts of this case, we consider MERC\u2019s finding and conclusion that Mrs. Wilder\u2019s telephone calls to other drivers were so \"inextricably related\u201d to the filing of her grievance that the telephone calls, too, constituted activity protected by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The school district expected Mrs. Wilder, in accordance with its established practice, to remain on the substitute run assigned to her in September until the regular driver returned in November. The practice of not considering substitutes for permanent openings was adopted by the school district to avoid frequent shifting of drivers and resulting disruption of school bus schedules. Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Wilder was advised that she would not be considered for a regular position even if one were to become available during her tenure as an assigned substitute. It was during this period that several drivers who had no prior service with the school district were given regular runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">After Mrs. Wilder became a member of the union, she complained to Jack Moore, the bus supervisor for the school district, about her inability to secure a permanent position. Failing in this approach she spoke to Larry Duell, the Association\u2019s president. Upon Duell\u2019s recommendation, on November 8, following the procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement, she filed a written grievance requesting a regular run.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Duell presented Mrs. Wilder\u2019s grievance to Moore, who did not then dispute her right to file a grievance, but dismissed it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, rights accrue only to employees with \"regularly scheduled hours\u201d. The school district maintained that Mrs. Wilder\u2019s hours as a substitute driver were not regularly scheduled and she did not enjoy rights under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The union\u2019s dissatisfaction with Moore\u2019s response resulted in a meeting on November 18 with the school grievance committee. The grievance was not resolved at this meeting, but it was agreed that there would be further discussions regarding the status of substitute drivers under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">During the meeting, both Moore and Duell discussed complaints they had received from other drivers regarding Mrs. Wilder\u2019s telephone calls. Nevertheless, Moore said that Mrs. Wilder would continue to be called as a substitute driver. Yet on December 2, Moore informed Mrs. Wilder that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>would no longer be called because of complaints from other drivers about her telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The trial examiner found that the calls were made by Mrs. Wilder \"when preparing her grievance\u201d and concluded that the cedis were \"protected concerted activity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">To effectively prosecute her grievance, Mrs. Wilder needed certain information: when were these other drivers hired, what had been their prior work experience for the district, the procedures followed in hiring them for permanent positions. She obtained this information by telephoning the other drivers, some of whom she had known for a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">It would be incongruous to hold that Mrs. Wilder had a protected right to file a grievance, but was subject to summary discharge for seeking information which would enable her effectively to present the grievance. An employee may, in connection with the prosecution of a good faith grievance, employ reasonable, nonabusive, methods of obtaining information necessary to prosecute the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The school district argues that Mrs. Wilder, who avowedly sought the jobs of the other drivers, could not by telephoning them engage in \"lawful concerted activities\u201d. These other drivers, the \"target\u201d of Mrs. Wilder\u2019s grievance, were against, if not hostile to, her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The school district asserts that Kathy Stolzman, one of the bus drivers telephoned by Mrs. Wilder, felt her job \"threatened\u201d by Mrs. Wilder\u2019s telephone call. We discern no distinction between this \"threat\u201d and the threat inherent in any similar grievance asserting that someone was granted preferred status in derogation of another\u2019s seniority rights. We would view the situation differently if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>MERC had found that Mrs. Wilder had threatened physical violence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Every employee who alleges a violation of his seniority rights asserts basically that someone else has obtained a benefit that belongs to him. An employee has protected access to the grievance machinery without regard to the disinterest or opposition of other employees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We hold that an employee may not be discharged for attempting in good faith to enforce a right claimed under a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The school district asserts as a defense that Mrs. Wilder was not entitled to a regular bus run.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">If an employee could be discharged for filing an unsuccessful grievance, filing would become hazardous indeed. Grievants who fail in the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tion of their grievances are protected from discharge,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> except, possibly, if the grievance is without arguable merit or is advanced in \"bad faith\u201d or with \"malice.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Mrs. Wilder had a reasonable basis in the collective bargaining agreement for asserting her grievance. The agreement covers nonteaching employees, including bus drivers, who have \"regularly scheduled hours\u201d. Mrs. Wilder during her stint as a substitute driver did have definite hours \u2014a certain time each morning, a time each afternoon, five days a week. The union\u2019s request that she become a member and acceptance of her dues indicates that it thought she had \"regularly scheduled hours\u201d. Article IV of the collective bargaining agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\"Seniority. All job openings will be posted for three days, and bid on according to qualifications and seniority. Seniority will take precedence when the qualifications are equal or better.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The school district\u2019s good faith is not a defense. In <em>National Labor Relations Board v Burnup &amp; Sims, Inc, </em>379 US 21, 23-24; 85 S Ct 171; 13 L Ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>2d 1 (1964), the employer had discharged two employees who were organizing the other employees in the erroneous but good faith belief that the two had threatened violence to achieve their goals. The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\"A protected activity acquires a precarious status if innocent employees can be discharged while engaging in it, even though the employer acts in good faith. It is the tendency of those discharges to weaken or destroy the \u00a7 8(a)(1) right that is controlling.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The school district maintains that Mrs. Wilder\u2019s failure to refer specifically to \"concerted activity\u201d in her complaint deprived it of notice of the charge it was called upon to defend. The school district asserts further that the issue of Mrs. Wilder\u2019s concerted activity was not litigated at the hearing but evolved \"strictly as an afterthought\u201d by the trial examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The charge filed by Mrs. Wilder with MERC alleged that the school district engaged \"in unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section(s) 10 &amp; 11 of said Act\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 10 refers to \u00a7 9 rights, we agree that the wording of the charge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>not enlightening as to the particular conduct charged against the school district. If the reason for Mrs. Wilder\u2019s discharge were in dispute, her failure to frame the charge with greater particularity might require reversal or a remand to MERC for the taking of additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">However, the school district justified Mrs. Wilder\u2019s discharge on the ground that she had made harassing phone calls to other drivers. There is no factual dispute concerning the reason for her discharge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The fuzziness of the wording in her complaint did not prejudice a full and fair presentation of the facts and the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The trial examiner\u2019s decision was not an afterthought. The examiner stated at the outset of the hearing that the charge alleged on its face a discriminatory action by the school board \"apparently because [Mrs. Wilder] attempted to exercise some concerted activity guaranteed by the act in regard to the contractual provision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">In this case the Court of Appeals ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>MERC\u2019s order enforced without formal submission or opinion following submission on the Court\u2019s weekly motion docket of MERC\u2019s petition and the school district\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The school district moved for a rehearing on the ground that the procedure followed did not comply with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Michigan Employment Relations Commission v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>387 Mich 424; 196 NW2d 763 (1972). The application for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In <em>Detroit Symphony, </em>this Court pointed out that a petition for enforcement filed by MERC pursuant to \u00a7 423.23(e)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is an original proceeding in the Court of Appeals and indicated that such petitions are to be considered by the Court of Appeals with the due deliberation of a calendared case, including opinion of the panel of the Court to which the case is assigned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\"By virtue of its original importance, it deserves as suggested in the cases cited below a compendious if not formal opinion of the legislatively appointed court of original jurisdiction. The need for such an opinion is apparent, for as said in one of the earlier Supreme Court cases <em>(Virginian R Co v United States, </em>272 US 658, 675; 47 S Ct 222; 71 L Ed 463, 472 [1926]):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\" 'The failure to accompany the decree by an opinion may thus deprive litigants of the means of exercising a sound judgment on the propriety of an appeal. And the appellate court, being without knowledge of the grounds of the decision below, is denied an important aid in the consideration of the case, and will ordinarily be subjected to much unnecessary labor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Michigan Employment Relations Commission v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, supra, </em>p 429.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>A petition for enforcement under \u00a7 423.23(e)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> invokes the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals as of right. In contrast with a complaint for mandamus or superintending control, which original proceedings are considered by the Court of Appeals at least initially as motions, a petition for enforcement is not addressed to the discretion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The act provides that, upon the filing of such petition,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals \"shall\u201d have jurisdiction of the proceeding and \"shall\u201d grant such relief as \"it deems just and proper, enforcing, modifying, enforcing as so modified, or setting aside\u201d the MERC order.

Mrs. Wilder alleged, in part, that the employer had discriminated against her \"because she attempted to exercise rights guaranteed by law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Defendant replied that Mrs. Wilder had been hired as a substitute bus driver until the return of the regular driver. She subsequently \"began to agitate to be assigned as a regular bus driver to a regular bus run\u201d. Defendant said Mrs. Wilder\u2019s actions created \"confusion and moral <em>[sic] </em>problems\u201d. Defendant concluded that Mrs. Wilder\u2019s actions \"were so inimical to the bus service that- it was decided to no longer use her as a substitute driver\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">A hearing was held on January 28, 1969. Mrs. Wilder testified that her supervisor said she would no longer be called upon to substitute because other drivers had complained about her. The supervisor said Mrs. Wilder \"was harassing the drivers\u201d by approaching them both on the job and at home. The president of the involved union felt Mrs. Wilder was an agitator. At one point he declined to represent her at a meeting because of \"harassment that I. had got for a month \u2014 the phone calls\u201d from Mrs. Wilder.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The supervisor testified under oath, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>\u00abq </em>* * * Did the fact that Mrs. Wilder had processed a grievance have anything to do with your dispensing with her services?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><em>\"A. </em>It certainly did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>For what .reasons did you dispense with her services?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\"><em>\u2019A. </em>Because of the problems she was causing these drivers; that they were calling me and complaining to me that \u2014 I guess they were being harassed by Mrs. Wilder to the point where they didn\u2019t know whether the job was worth it. They were just in training, new drivers, and being involved in union problems, they didn\u2019t like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>That was the only reason?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">TA/Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">When questioned by the trial examiner, the supervisor told of the complaints he had received about Mrs. Wilder\u2019s actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\"><em>\u201dMr. Bixler: </em>I have one question. Please feel free to object. You say you have dispensed with the services of Mrs. Wilder because she was calling up bus drivers?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\"><em>\u2019A. </em>She was causing me problems with other bus drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Now, these bus drivers related things to you, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>What was the jest <em>[sic] o\u00ed </em>what they related Mrs. Wilder said to them, what was it?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\"><em>\"A. </em>To me, I took it as a complaint.

Well, Mrs. Stolzman\u2019s job was threatened; she said she was going to get that.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>What did Mrs. Elliott relate to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\"><em>'A. </em>She was disturbed that Wilma had approached her on the bus \u2014 at the school on the job, and that she bothered her at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\"><em>\"Mr. Bixler: </em>What did she say about that?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\"><em>'A. </em>Questioning whether she had been hired, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>she had signed anything, and relating her problems and that she had been \u2014 felt she had been mistreated.

It said filing a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement was concerted activity. As such, PERA prohibited the employer \"from taking any action that would interfere, restrain or coerce public employees when so doing\u201d. He found that Mrs. Wilder was not discharged for filing the grievance, but for telephoning other employees. He felt this was \"inextricably related to the grievance\u201d and \"amounted to protected concerted activity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">The Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) sustained the examiner\u2019s finding and order. It said the telephone calls were part of Mrs. Wilder\u2019s effort to process her own grievance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">\"The testimony leads to the conclusion that the school officials, for reasons which do not appear on the record, decided to use the telephone calls as an excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>for terminating Wilder. Wilder, in making the telephone calls, was engaging in a protected activity, i.e., the filing of a grievance protesting the failure of the School District to assign her a regular school bus run.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Court of Appeals, by a 2-1 vote, granted MERC\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order on July 20, 1972. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on December 28, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>STATUTES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Defendant was found to have violated MCLA 423.210(a); MSA 17.455(10)(a), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\"It shall be unlawful for a public employer or an officer or agent of a public employer (a) to interfere with, restrain or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in section 9 * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The rights guaranteed are found in MCLA 423.209; MSA 17.455(9):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\"It shall be lawful for public employees to organize together or to form, join or assist in labor organizations, to engage in lawful concerted activities for the purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other mutual aid and protection, or to negotiate or bargain collectively with their public employers through representatives of their own free choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Section 16 of PERA (MCLA 423.216; MSA 17.455[16]) provides remedies for violations of \u00a7 10. Subsection (b) permits MERC to issue cease and desist orders. MERC may also require affirmative action. MERC may not require reinstatement of an employee who \"was suspended or discharged for cause.\u201d Subsection (d) provides for court enforcement of MERC orders. It says findings of fact shall be conclusive \"if supported by competent, material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">1.

Such activities are protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Not every act is sanctioned. It must be concerted group activity directed, in part, toward \"bargaining or other mutual aid and protection\u201d. Activities furthering a group rather than an individual interest will generally be considered concerted. Actions justifying discharge or suspension for cause are not protected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The Fourth Circuit reversed a reinstatement order in <em>Joanna Cotton Mills Co v National Labor Relations Board, </em>176 F2d 749 (CA 4, 1949). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>employee had been cautioned about his on-the-job conduct. The employee took offense, berated the supervisor and circulated a petition calling for his discharge. The company discharged the employee because the petition had an adverse effect on discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Court said this activity was not protected but \"was a mere continuation and aggravation of the original defiant conduct\u201d. The Court did not feel that \"all activities in which employees act together are 'concerted activities\u2019 \u201d for statutory purposes. The employees need not be organized but they must act together for mutual aid and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In <em>Mushroom Transportation Co v National Labor Relations Board, </em>330 F2d 683 (CA 3, 1964), a non-regular employee was discharged in part for telling other employees that they were not receiving the full benefit of the collective bargaining agreement. The Court said these contacts could not be considered concerted activity and set aside the order reinstating the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Court found no evidence of an effort \"to initiate or promote any concerted action\u201d. The Court would not adopt the view \"that any conversation between employees comes within the ambit of activities protected by the act provided it relates to the interests of the employees\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\"It is not questioned that a conversation may constitute a concerted activity although it involves only a speaker and a listener, but to qualify as such, it must appear at the very least that it was engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or that it had some relation to group action in the interest of the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The Court said \"mere talk must, in order to be protected, be talk looking toward group action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>This emphasis on activity furthering a group interest is seen in <em>National Labor Relations Board v City Yellow Cab Co, </em>344 F2d 575 (CA 6, 1965). Two drivers had been discharged because they joined the striking switchboard operators in picketing. The Court said this was concerted activity and quoted the following from Judge Learned Hand\u2019s opinion in <em>National Labor Relations Board v Peter Cailler Kohler Swiss Chocolates Co, </em>130 F2d 503 (CA 2, 1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\" 'Certainly nothing elsewhere in the act limits the scope of the language to \"activities\u201d designed to benefit other \"employees\u201d; and its rationale forbids such a limitation. When all the other workmen in a shop make common cause with a fellow workman over his separate grievance, and go out on strike in his support, they engage in a \"concerted activity\u201d for \"mutual aid or protection,\u201d although the aggrieved workman is the only one of them who has any immediate stake in the outcome. The rest know that by their actions each one of them assures himself, in case his turn ever comes, of the support of the one whom they are all then helping; and the solidarity so established is \"mutual aid\u201d in the most literal sense, as nobody doubts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Also see <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co v National Labor Relations Board, </em>358 F2d 411 (CA 9, 1966) saying that \" 'Section 7 rights are group rights, relating to \"concerted activity\u201d \u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As earlier stated, not every employee action is protected. It must be an element of lawful concerted activity which is directed toward mutual aid and protection. The above-cited cases contain a constant refrain. The activity must either be group activity or directed toward furthering a group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Hand spoke of \"common cause\u201d and \"solidarity\u201d. The Third Circuit spoke of \"initiating or inducing or preparing for group action\u201d or having \"some relation to group action in the interest of the employees\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Mrs. Wilder\u2019s activities, even though subsequent to the filing of a grievance, do not merit the protection of PERA. It is pertinent that the trial examiner found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\" * * * the record <em>does not disclose any motivation on the part of the School District in denying the Charging Party a permanent school bus route that is prohibited by the Act. </em>The Charging Party argues that it was contrary to the contract, contrary to seniority provisions of the contract, and generally unfair to treat her in this manner. None of these actions, however, are prohibited by PERA. This conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that <em>the Charging Party does not allege that she engaged in any concerted, protected activity up until November 17, </em>which was her last day of work, that could give possible grounds for concluding that the Charging Party was denied permanent employment for this reason. <em>The Charging Party joined the Union October 29, this alone, was the extent of her Union activity. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Nevertheless, the trial examiner continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\"The undersigned is of the opinion that Sec. 10(a) of PERA makes the filing of a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement protected activity, and a public employer is prohibited by PERA from taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>any action that would interfere, restrain or coerce public employees when so doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\n<em>\"In the case at hand, however, the Charging Party was discharged not for having fled the grievance but because of the telephone calls the Charging Party made to other employees. * * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\"In the fact situation at hand, the Charging Party, <em>when preparing her grievance, </em>called another driver indirectly involved and <em>told her of her intent. This, I am convinced, amounted to protected concerted activity. </em>\"(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">MERC later found that there was \"sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that * * * her further attempts to <em>solicit the aid </em>of fellow employees * * * constituted protected, concerted activity regardless of the merits of her individual grievance\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The actual testimony demonstrates that her actions did not institute or implement any group action. There is no intimation of a \"common cause\u201d or \"solidarity\u201d between Mrs. Wilder and her coworkers. If anything, her actions ruptured the bonds of common cause. She even alienated the union president.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Plaintiff was not discharged for filing the grievance or for union activity or membership. She was discharged because her actions exceeded the permissible gathering of information in support of her grievance. Plaintiff did not communicate to develop facts but to complain, coerce and intimidate. Those activities do not warrant protection. Those activities furnish ample cause for discharge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\n<em>Issue II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Section 16(d) of PERA says MERC\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive \"if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d.
