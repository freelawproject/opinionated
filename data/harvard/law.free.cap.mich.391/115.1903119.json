(Emphasis by the Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The questions reserved in the cited case are now before us. After a preliminary examination an information was filed charging that John Edward Hoskins did \"kill and murder\u201d another person. Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection the judge \u00e1ccepted Hoskins\u2019 plea of guilty to the offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The prosecutor sought a writ of superintending control from the Court of Appeals, which refused to grant the writ. We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>When the matter was argued in the trial court the parties were in agreement that because of the use of the word \"kill\u201d, the information charged the crime of manslaughter as well as of murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Manslaughter can also be a lesser included offense of the crime of murder. Accordingly, this case raises both the question whether, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, a judge may accept a plea of guilty to one count of a multi-count information and the question whether, over objection, a judge may accept a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Implicit in this controversy is Hoskins\u2019 expectation that if his plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted he would not stand trial for murder; Hoskins would, upon compliance with the guilty plea procedures, have the right, without the consent of the prosecutor, to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter as long as it was clear that, nevertheless, he must stand trial for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The circuit court acquires jurisdiction of a criminal prosecution \"upon the making of a proper return from the magistrate before whom the defendant had been examined or waived examination\u201d. <em>People v Curtis, </em>389 Mich 698, 707; 209 NW2d 243 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The magistrate\u2019s decision is reviewable by a circuit judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5If such review indicates that the evidence did not tend both to show the commission of the crime charged and probable cause for charging the accused with its commission,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>may grant a motion to dismiss<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or remand the cause to the examining magistrate for a further preliminary examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, the prosecutor may obtain review in the circuit court of a magistrate\u2019s dismissal of the charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Also relevant are the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure imposing on the prosecutor the duty, following the preliminary examination, \"to make full examination of all the facts and circumstances connected with\u201d the case, and requiring, if he determines that an information ought not to be filed, that he file with the clerk of the court a statement in writing containing \"his reasons in fact and in law\u201d. The judge may then examine the statement \"together with the evidence filed in the case\u201d and if he is not \"satisfied with said statement\u201d the prosecuting attorney \"shall be directed\u201d to file \"the proper information and bring the case to trial\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">It is also provided that, once an information has been filed, it shall not be lawful for the prosecuting attorney to enter a nolle prosequi \"or in any other way to discontinue or abandon the same, without stating on the record the reasons therefor and without the leave of the court having jurisdiction to try the offense charged, entered in its minutes\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In deciding whether an examining magistrate acts properly in binding or in refusing to bind over an accused person, and in deciding whether a prosecuting attorney acts properly in deciding not to file an information or in proposing to nolle prosequi, discontinue or abandon a prosecution, the circuit judge reviews the action of the magistrate and prosecuting attorney on the record \u2014 the record made before the magistrate at the preliminary examination, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement of reasons and \"the evidence filed in the case\u201d. Such review is a judicial review, searching the record to determine whether the magistrate\u2019s or prosecutor\u2019s decision is in accord with the law, facts and reason of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">A circuit judge does not enjoy supervisory power over a prosecuting attorney. He may reverse a magistrate\u2019s decision only for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He may not properly substitute his judgment for that of the magistrate or prosecuting attorney as if he were reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>or acting in a supervisory capacity with respect to the prosecuting attorney. He may reverse or revise their decisions only if it appears on the record that they have abused the power confided to them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Hoskins was bound over after a preliminary examination on evidence that he shot and killed the victim following an argument. The testimony tended to show that Hoskins shot the victim once while the victim was standing and a second time five seconds after he had fallen to the ground. The prosecutor was willing to accept a plea of guilty to second-degree murder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not exceed his power in refusing to authorize a plea of guilty to manslaughter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In <em>People v McMiller, </em>389 Mich 425, 432; 208 NW2d 451 (1973), we held that if the procedures prescribed in GCR 1963, 785 are not followed in accepting a plea of guilty and on that account the conviction is reversed on appeal, on remand the defendant may not be prosecuted for a higher offense arising out of the same transaction. We so held for policy reasons to encourage compliance with the procedures prescribed by the court rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\"Allowing trial on a higher charge following reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of a plea-based conviction of a lesser offense would (1) discourage exercise of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal a conviction claimed to be based on an improperly accepted plea, and (2) tend to insulate from appellate scrutiny non-compliance with the guilty plea procedure established by the statute and the court rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">We said we perceived no double jeopardy issue as \"McMiller was never in peril of being convicted and punished for murder [the higher charge]. He has not 'run the gantlet\u2019 on that charge.\u201d <em>People v McMiller, supra, </em>p 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">So, too, here, there is no double jeopardy issue as Hoskins has not been tried for murder. The policy considerations which govern when the defendant appeals contending that his plea of guilty was accepted without complying with the court rule are not applicable when it is the prosecutor who is seeking appellate relief. <em>McMiller </em>does not bar trying Hoskins on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The complaint for a writ of superintending control is granted. Hoskins\u2019 plea of guilty to the offense of manslaughter and the sentence imposed are set aside and the cause is remanded for trial on the information charging him with the offenses of manslaughter and murder.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-7\">T.
