The question boils down to whether there should be liability for <em>foreseeable </em>as well as <em>known </em>reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">This Court has answered that question affirmatively in a related fact situation, and in categorical terms relieved Michigan jurisprudence of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>strictions of \"privity\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this opinion, we reaffirm our general decision eliminating privity and specifically apply it to abstracters.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There is a second issue in this case. When does liability accrue and what statute of limitations applies?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">I \u2014FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Plaintiffs Williams purchased certain property situated in the City of Warren, Macomb County, from defendant Polgar on a land contract dated August 1, 1959. At the time of purchase, as provided in the land contract, defendants furnished to plaintiffs an abstract of title certified to July 15, 1959 by Abstract and Title Guaranty Company. This abstract was originally issued on February 4, 1926 by the Macomb County Abstract Company and was extended by said company in 1936, 1937, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, 1951, and 1952. Defendant American Title Insurance Company is the successor in interest to Macomb County Abstract Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The abstract of title failed to include a deed dated May 1, 1926 which was recorded on May 24, 1926 in Liber 242 of Deeds at page 174 of Macomb County records. This deed conveyed the southerly 60 feet of the property in question to the Macomb County Board of Road Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">After execution of the land contract on August 1, 1959, plaintiffs learned, allegedly for the first time, of the existence of this omitted deed. As the result thereof, plaintiffs claim they were required to completely remove a building and that certain other damages were incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Plaintiffs filed this action on April 21, 1971. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>defendants filed motions for accelerated judgment based on the statute of limitations. The trial court held that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action accrued no later than the execution of the land contract on August 1, 1959. Thus accelerated judgment was granted defendants. Plaintiffs were non-suited. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. 43 Mich App 95; 204 NW2d 57 (1972). Defendant American Title Insurance Company requested leave to appeal to this Court which was granted on December 12, 1972. 388 Mich 812 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II \u2014EFFECT OF ACCELERATED JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Under a motion for accelerated judgment by defendants the facts well pleaded by plaintiffs and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be considered most favorably towards plaintiffs. As the complaint adequately alleges the title company\u2019s negligent misrepresentation in the abstract, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance thereon and the damage caused thereby as well as the other matters appearing in the above statement of facts, this case presents at this point no dispute as to facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Where there is a person negligently injured by another, normally there is recovery therefor. <em>Ubi injuria, ibi remedium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Defendant title company here, however, seeks immunity from liability for the injury it caused plaintiff buyers, pleading two defenses. First, defendant pleads it is immune from suit because it is not in contractual privity with plaintiffs. Second, defendant pleads it is immune from suit because of the statute of limitations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Ill \u2014DEFENSE OF PRIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">A. <em>Cessante Ratione Legis, Cessat et Ipsa Lex</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The early common-law rule restricting liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to those in contractual privity with an abstracter was based on a system where abstracts would only be used by real estate owners. 1 Fitch, Abstracts and Titles to Real Property, \u00a7 9, p 9; and see \u00a7 3. As time went on the actual usage of abstracts and the class of people relying on them expanded. This historical change in circumstance and the corresponding change in law is noted in numerous cases of which the following two quotations will serve as examples. The first, <em>Brown v Sims, </em>22 Ind App 317, 325; 53 NE 779; 72 Am St Rep 308 (1899) illustrates a judicial expansion of liability to a known third-party beneficiary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\"It is very well known that the owner of real estate seldom incurs the expense of procuring an abstract of the title from an abstracter, except for the purpose of thereby furnishing information to some third person or persons who are to be influenced by the information thus provided. If the abstracter in all cases be responsible only to the person under whose employment he performs the service, it is manifest that the loss occasioned thereby must in many cases, if not in most cases, be remediless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The second, <em>Gate City Abstract Co v Post, </em>55 Neb 742, 746; 76 NW 471 (1898), represents judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cial support of legislation that purports to create liability \"for the payment by such abstracters of any or all damages that may accrue to any party or parties, by reason of any error, deficiency or mistake in any abstract\u201d:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\"By the common law, as we interpret it, the owner of real estate could only utilize an abstract as an argument to reinforce his own assertions concerning the state of his title. It might be persuasive, but was without legal efficacy. He may now use it as evidence in an action to enforce the specific performance of a contract of sale, and in every other form of action in which the validity of his title or the existence or non-existence of liens or incumbrances are questions directly or collaterally involved. The right to use an abstract as evidence is not even limited to the person to whom it is issued. Any one may use it, and any one against whom it is employed may be injured in consequence of the certificate being false. Having thus widened the abstract\u2019s sphere of action, it was quite natural that the legislature should also widen the abstracter\u2019s liability.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Responding to the actual change in use of abstracts and the additional classes of persons relying on them, at least six general court-created exceptions have been grafted onto the supposed common-law requirement of strict contractual privity. These exceptions include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(1) abstracter\u2019s fraud or collusion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">(2) theory of third-party beneficiary contracts,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(3) theory of foreseeability of use by a third-party,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(4) actual knowledge or notice of third-party,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(5) agent for disclosed or undisclosed principal contracting with an abstracter, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">(6) reissuance or recertification of an abstract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afu\">See <em>Liability of Abstracter-Privity, </em>34 ALR3d 1122, 1131, for cases supportive of each of these exceptions. See also 12 Vand LR 783 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Whereas the common-law rule limiting abstracter liability provided immunity from all who were injured by a faulty abstract except those in actual contractual privity, of the 35 jurisdictions (outside of Michigan) addressing themselves to this matter only seven retain a rule of strict contractual privity: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, 11 extend liability to known third-parties relying thereon: Alabama, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>New York, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two jurisdictions have allowed recovery by undiscovered principals: Iowa and Washington.<footnotemark>7.5</footnotemark> Fourteen purport to extend liability by statute to \"any person\u201d relying on the abstract: Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And one jurisdiction extends liability to foreseeable relying third-parties by court decision: Louisiana.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">B. <em>Michigan Has Abolished Privity Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Michigan ended the last century and began this one firmly wed to the rule of contractual privity immunizing abstracters. <em>Smith v Holmes, </em>54 Mich 104; 19 NW 767 (1884); <em>Kenyon v Charlevoix Improvement Co, </em>135 Mich 103; 97 NW 407 (1903). By the end of the second decade it reluctantly broke away from strict privity in favor of a known third-party beneficiary. <em>Beckovsky v Burton Abstract &amp; Title Co, </em>208 Mich 224; 175 NW 235 (1919). Michigan thereby joined a category of 11 other jurisdictions just noted who had opened recovery to parties the abstracter knew would rely on the abstract. In <em>Beckovsky, </em>the plaintiff buyer actually accompanied the seller to the office of defendant title company and said he wanted an abstract but the contract in all truth was between the seller and the title company with the seller paying the title company for its work, although in order to avoid the title company\u2019s defense of privity, the trial court graciously put that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">So <em>Beckovsky </em>extends liability to the faulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>abstracter who knows a third-party beneficiary will rely on its abstract. The question remains, will liability likewise apply to the faulty abstracter who can reasonably foresee reliance by a third-party.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Michigan answered this question affirmatively in 1958 and categorically eliminated the requirement of privity. <em>Spence v Three Rivers Builders &amp; Masonry Supply, Inc, </em>353 Mich 120; 90 NW2d 873 (1958). This was done in a products liability case where a plaintiff not in privity with a defendant building supply company purchased cinder-block building materials through a third-party building contractor. The supplies subsequently proved faulty to plaintiffs damage, just as the abstract did in the instant case. Defendant in that case, like the defendant in the instant case, relied on privity to bar plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Justice Voelker, speaking for this Court, recognized that privity was more honored by exceptions than by the rule. However, this Court decried continued evasion of the rule and faced the issue squarely, holding that privity was an unnecessary bar to recovery. Justice Voelker spoke forthrightly to the point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\"We now proceed to face up to the big issue in this case: Should lack of privity bar this action as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\"As the court below correctly observed, there is little doubt that in the past our court has for the most part devotedly followed the 'general rule\u2019 and been reluctant to permit a third person 'not in privity\u2019 to recover from a manufacturer on a theory of negligence or implied warranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\"Saddled with such a doctrine and its hair-splitting exceptions, it is not surprising that while a few of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>decisions have afforded passing illusory comfort to all, certainty has been afforded to none. The reason is simple: A court lacking a clear and understandable rule of its own can scarcely be expected to impart it to others. Legal confusion has inevitably resulted. Aggrieved plaintiffs have scarcely known whether to sue in deceit or fraud or for negligence or for breach of warranty \u2014 or indeed whether it was worthwhile to sue at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\"Our court perhaps uttered the towering legal understatement of the year (1924) when in <em>Hertzler v Manshum, </em>228 Mich 416 [200 NW 155] (a poison flour case), we observed that cases in this category 'appear hopelessly at variance.\u2019 We there reverently discussed the accepted theory of claimed nonliability (our old friend, lack of privity) and then proceeded to hold that food cases were an exception (pp 421, 422) 'and there only by reason of a want of a high degree of care.\u2019 While that case is not alone, it is typical of the curious things courts can bring themselves to do and say when they try vainly to wed the outmoded thinking and legal cliches of the past to the pressing realities of modern life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\"Consider what was just said in <em>Hertzler. </em>'Higher care\u2019 was there our way around privity. This is a beguiling notion, but we find ourselves unable to discover why the imposition by judicial fiat of a mystical higher degree of care should magically dissolve the need for privity, as just asserted in <em>Hertzler. </em>Why should this be so? Either lack of privity should always be a defense in these cases or it never should be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\"In this case it appears that there was a lack of due care. Merely to describe what happened to the blocks should be showing enough on that score \u2014 but here the defendant admitted that he had inspected or tested neither the r\u00e1w materials nor the finished blocks. Granting the learned trial court\u2019s understandable bewilderment under our past decisions, we think it should have permitted recovery either on a theory of negligence or implied warranty and should also have proceeded to take such further proofs on plaintiff\u2019s dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ages as may have been necessary.\u201d 353 Mich 121, 126, 128-129, 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">C. <em>Privity Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Michigan\u2019s own jurisprudence records the categorical elimination of privity. This Court had previously extended abstracter liability consonant with the historical growth in reliance and use of abstracts and the corresponding changes in the law to known relying third-parties. Confronted now as of first impression with the question of abstracter liability to foreseeable relying third-parties, we have but to apply our own persuasive precedent of categorical elimination of privity to an analogous situation, and we do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">IV \u2014ABSTRACTER LIABILITY IN TORT FOR NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">On the basis of <em>Three Rivers </em>and a plethora of jurisdictions in the United States a good case is made for abolishing contractual privity and permitting suit in \"negligence or implied warranty\u201d by any foreseeable third-party who would and does rely on the abstract. We consider now the matter of suit in \"negligence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251; 150 NW2d 755 (1967), for example, it was held that breach of a contract to repair, clean, and paint a water storage tank, also gave rise to an action in tort in favor of a non-contracting third-party. Chief Justice (then Justice) T. M. Kavanagh explained this relationship \u00f3f a tort action to the underlying contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\"Actionable negligence presupposes the existence of a legal relationship between parties by which the injured party is owed a duty by the other, and such duty must be imposed by law. * * * Such duty of care may be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>specific duty owing to the plaintiff by the defendant, or it may be a general one owed by the defendant to the public; of which the plaintiff is a part. <em>Moreover, while this duty of care, as an essential element of actionable negligence, arises by operation of law, it may and frequently does arise out of a contractual relationship, the theory being that accompanying every contract is a common-law duty to perform with ordinary care the thing agreed to be done, and that a negligent performance constitutes a tort as well as a breach of contract. </em>But it must be kept in mind that the contract creates only the relation out of which arises the common-law duty to exercise ordinary care. Thus in legal contemplation the contract merely creates the state of things which furnishes the occasion of the tort. This being so, the existence of \u00e1 contract is ordinarily a relevant factor, competent to be alleged and proved in a negligence action to the extent of showing the relationship of the parties and the nature and extent of the common-law duty on which the tort is based.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 379 Mich 251, 260-261.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">This Court recently reaffirmed these principles, citing <em>Clark, </em>in <em>Nash v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, </em>383 Mich 136, 143; 174 NW2d 818 (1970). See also <em>Nicholson v Han, </em>12 Mich App 35, 43; 162 NW2d 313 (1968), and <em>Talucci v Archambault, </em>20 Mich App 153, 161; 173 NW2d 740 (1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>With respect to the particular type of tort action arising from breach of an abstracter\u2019s contractual duty, we hold it to be an action in negligent misrepresentation. Numerous cases and law review articles have debated the precise tort cause of action most appropriate in this context.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The theories of fraud, deceit, warranty, and strict liability have all been the subject of extensive discussion with respect to professional misrepresentations of this sort. None of these theories has been found to adequately deal with this particular problem; negligent misrepresentation, on the other hand, precisely fits this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The obvious difficulty with a fraud or deceit action is the requisite element of <em>scienter. </em>The issue we are dealing with in the instant case does not, on the pleadings, involve <em>intentional </em>misrepresentation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To supply the element of intent constructively is to do great violence to existing law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>on the subject of fraud. Note the discussion of this point by Prof. Francis Bohlen in <em>Should Negligent Misrepresentations Be Treated As Negligence or Fraud, </em>18 Va LR 703, 706-707 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\"In all other fields of tort law the line is sharply drawn between intentional and unintentional injury. The persistence of this distinction can only be explained by recognizing the fact that it is. in accord with the normal reactions of the mass of mankind. If negligent misrepresentation is called fraud, and, therefore, comes to be regarded by courts as tantamount thereto, there is danger that the unintentional character of the one and the intentional character of the other will be overlooked. There is danger that that liability, which is regarded both by lawyers and laymen as just where there is conscious dishonesty, will be imposed, although there is no purpose to deceive. Call any two essentially different things by the same name and the two are likely to be treated as identical for all purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Further, to treat this cause of action as sounding in warranty or strict liability might serve to extend an abstracter\u2019s duty beyond the duty anticipated by the original contract. It is important to repeat that the tort cause of action created by an abstracter\u2019s nonfeasance or misfeasance stems from the contractual duty originally imposed and does not render an abstracter liable for action beyond such contractually-imposed duty, <em>i.e., </em>to perform in a diligent and reasonably skillful workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Thus, we adopt the tort action of negligent misrepresentation in this context. See 1 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 7.6; 17 CJS, Contracts, \u00a7 154(c). It should be noted that this action is premised on negligence in title search; an abstracter is not converted into a title insurer by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>virtue of our decision today.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We repeat that the only liability an abstracter has to an injured third-party is with respect to negligent performance of his or her contractual duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">As to the measure of the duty required to be exercised by the abstracter, Chief Justice T. M. Kavanagh noted in <em>Nash v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co, supra, </em>at page 142:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\"Every contract of employment includes an obligation, whether express or implied, to perform in a diligent and reasonably skillful workmanlike manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">This is clearly a form of the traditional negligence standard. Since the legal duty which, when breached, gives rise to a tort cause of action, springs from the contractual duty imposed, this <em>Nash </em>standard governs an abstracter\u2019s legal obligation to non-contracting parties. Because an abstracter is hired to determine what is in the public record, misstatements of, or failure to include, relevant items contained in that record are obviously examples of acts constituting failure to perform abstracting services in a diligent and reasonably skillful workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">This cause of action arising from breach of the abstracter\u2019s contractual duty runs to those persons an abstracter could reasonably foresee as relying on the accuracy of the abstract put into motion. The particular expert-client relationship accruing to a professional contract to certify the condition of the record of title reposes a peculiar trust in an abstracter which runs not only to the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>contracting party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is a clearly foreseeable class of potential injured persons which would obviously include grantees where his or her grantor or any predecessor in title of the grantor has initiated the contract for abstracting services with the abstracter.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">V \u2014DEFENSE OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Defendants below were granted accelerated judgments on the basis of a plea of statute of limitations bar to this action. There is some textbook authority to the effect that the statute of limitations in an abstracter liability action begins to run from the date the abstract was furnished rather than from the time of the discovery of the error.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">But the textbook authority referred to is predicated upon an action <em>in contract, </em>not an action <em>in tort. </em>Consider for example, part of the applicable section in American Jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\"[T]he statute of limitations begins to run from the time of the occurrence of the breach of duty * * * .\u201d 1 Am Jur 2d 245.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">While such a breach of duty creating a cause of action <em>in a contract action </em>would date from the actual act of omission or misrepresentation, the cause of action <em>in a tort action </em>runs from the date the tort was committed, not the date the actor put his or her force wrongfully into motion. 20 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Statute of Limitations, \u00a7 43; 51 Am Jur 2d, Limitations of Actions, \u00a7\u00a7 107, 109s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The single case appellants rely on as authority for their statute of limitations argument, <em>Cushman v Avis, </em>28 Mich App 370; 184 NW2d 294 (1970), was a <em>contract </em>action not involving abstracts of title and, further, did not involve a non-contracting third-party.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">More relevant to the issues presented in this case is <em>Coury v General Motors Corp, </em>376 Mich 248; 137 NW2d 134 (1965). The question presented in that case was when a cause of action accrued under the wrongful death act so as to start the running of the statute of limitations. In holding that the statute began to run only upon death and not when the death-dealing force was put into motion, Justice Dethmers stated for a unanimous court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\"How could a right of action under the death act accrue at all if death never occurred in consequence of the injury or accrue before the occurrence of death?\u201d 376 Mich 248, 250.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Similarly, how can a tort cause of action accrue prior to the occurrence of the tort?<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To bar such suits prior to the date of injury, would negative, in most cases, any value of having a separate tort cause of action at all. Justice T. E. Brennan made this same point for a unanimous court in <em>Connelly v Paul Ruddy's Equipment Repair &amp; Service Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>388 Mich 146, 150; 200 NW2d 70 (1972), noting that running the statute of limitations from the day the tortious force was put into motion would destroy plaintiffs cause of action before it even arose. 388 Mich 146, 150. He also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\"In the case of an action for damages arising out of tortious injury to a person, the cause of action accrues when all of the elements of the cause of action have occurred and can be alleged in a proper complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\"Those elements are four in number:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\"(1) The existence of a legal duty by defendant toward plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\"(2) The breach of such duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\"(3) A proximate causal relation between the breach of such duty and an injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">\"(4) The plaintiff must have suffered damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Under these standards, is there a tort cause of action accruing before plaintiff has knowledge, or should have knowledge, of the negligent misrepresentation? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">General tort law principles in Michigan as discussed <em>supra, </em>support our determination that the statute of limitations does not begin running until the point where plaintiff knows or should have known of this negligent misrepresentation. At that point, the four elements in <em>Connelly, supra, </em>are satisfied: a legal duty exists, such duty is breached, a proximate causal relation is established (if plaintiff can show reliance on the abstract),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the plaintiff then is, or should be, aware of any resultant damages.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>VI \u2014CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">For the reasons outlined above, we hold that there is a valid tort cause of action in the nature of negligent misrepresentation arising from a contract for an abstracter\u2019s services in favor of a non-contracting damaged third-party whose reliance on the abstract could be foreseen. In a tort action of this nature, the statute of limitations begins running from the date the injured party knew or should have known of the existence of the negligent misrepresentation, a date not clearly in evidence in this case.

In <em>Arizona Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co v O\u2019Malley Lumber Co, </em>14 Ariz App 486; 484 P2d 639 (1971), Arizona recognized the tort action of negligent misrepresentation in a business situation not involving an abstracter, but citing Restatement Torts (2d) \u00a7 552 \u00e1nd abstracter cases from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\n<em>ARKANSAS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">In <em>Talpey v Wright, </em>61 Ark 275; 32 SW 1072 (1895), direct privity was required as a basis for suit against an abstracter though there was language supportive of extension of this cause of action to known third-parties (61 Ark 275, 282; 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>SW 1072, 1074). <em>Adam v Greer, </em>114 F Supp 770 (WD Ark, 1953), continued to hold to the general rule of privity noting that the issue of tort or contract was not reached as unnecessary to the disposition of the instant case (114 F Supp 770, 775). In 1969, Ark Stats Ann 71-106 was added creating an abstracter\u2019s bond to cover any damages sustained by \"any person * * * for whom said applicant may compile, make or furnish abstracts\u201d.

The Court held the statute of limitations began to run when the fault in the abstract was discovered. Idaho Code \u00a7 54-101 had, since 1897, extended liability to \"any person\u201d injured by an abstracter\u2019s negligence and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>approach was upheld in <em>Merrill v Fremont Abstract Co, </em>39 Idaho 238; 227 P 34 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\n<em>ILLINOIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In <em>Chase v Heaney, </em>70 Ill 268 (1873), the language refers to any injured party while the facts of the case showed recovery by a plaintiff-purchaser of the abstract. Ill Ann Stats Chpt 115 \u00a7 25 clearly makes abstracters liable to purchasers of abstracts (since 1903). <em>Rozny v Marnul, </em>43 Ill 2d 54; 250 NE2d 656; 35 ALR3d 487 (1969), a surveyor\u2019s case citing abstracter case precedent, moved Illinois clearly into the tort arena, abolishing the privity concept and accepting the tort cause of action arising from the breach of a contractual duty. <em>See generally </em>1 Ill Digest (3d ed), Abstracts of Title \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>INDIANA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In <em>Brown v Sims, </em>22 Ind App 317; 53 NE 779 (1899), the strict privity rule was held inapplicable where the abstracter has knowledge of a third-party relying on the abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\n<em>IOWA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Iowa has ruled a cause of action against an abstracter to be in contract since before the turn of the century. <em>Russell &amp; Co v Polk County Abstract Co, </em>87 Iowa 233; 54 NW 212; 43 Am St Rep 381 (1893). But in an interesting case the Court found the abstracter liable in contract to the undisclosed principal of an agent who purchased the abstract. <em>Young v Lohr, </em>118 Iowa 624; 92 NW 684 (1902). And a recent case, <em>Ryan v Kanne, </em>170 NW2d 395 (Iowa, 1969), an accountant\u2019s liability case portends a move to some sort of foreseeability standard under Restatement Torts 2d \u00a7 552, although the case required only a finding that it was a known third-party.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\n<em>KANSAS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">On the basis of the old Kansas abstracter legislation, the requirement of strict privity was closely followed. <em>Mallory v Ferguson, </em>50 Kan 685; 32 P 410; 22 LRA 99 (1893); <em>Symns v Cutter, </em>9 Kan A 210; 59 P 671 (1900); <em>Allen v Hopkins, </em>62 Kan 175; 61 P 750 (1900). But in <em>Arnold &amp; Co v Barner, </em>91 Kan 768; 139 P 404 (1914), the new Kansas abstracter bond statute (now Kans Stat Ann 58-2802) was held to broaden liability to \"any person\u201d regardless of who paid for the abstract, but the statute of limitations ran from the date of furnishing the abstract.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>KENTUCKY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Kentucky appears to have no statutory or case law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>LOUISIANA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In Louisiana, the Register of Conveyances has the responsibility of issuing certificates of title showing the existence of all encumbrances. La Civ Code, Art 2251 <em>et seq. </em>Under this statute, Louisiana case law has moved from the strict privity requirement of <em>Morano v Shaw, </em>23 La Ann 379 (1871) to the foreseeability test illustrated in <em>American Legion Ed Brauner Post No 307, Inc v Southwest Title &amp; Insurance Co, </em>(La App, 1968) 207 So 2d 393, <em>rev\u2019d on other grds, </em>218 So 2d 612 (1969). In <em>American Legion, </em>the Register of Conveyances was found liable not only to the purchasing grantee but also to the unknown, relying grantor and title insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\n<em>MAINE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Maine appears to have no statutory or case law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">\n<em>MARYLAND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">In <em>Watson v Calvert Building &amp; Loan Association, </em>91 Md 25; 45 A 879 (1900); <em>Wlodarek v Thrift, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>178 Md 453; 13A2d 774 (1940); and <em>Corcoran v Abstract &amp; Title Co of Maryland, </em>217 Md 633; 143 A2d 808 (19s58), an abstracter action was held to be limited to strict contractual privity though in <em>Watson </em>plaintiff recovered though his agent was the abstract purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\n<em>MASSACHUSETTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">There appears to be no statutory or case law with respect to abstracter liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>MICHIGAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In <em>Smith v Holmes, </em>54 Mich 104; 19 NW 767 (1884), it was stated that an abstracter\u2019s liability action was an action based on negligent performance of a contract. <em>Kenyon v Charlevoix Improvement Co, </em>135 Mich 103; 97 NW 407 (1903) noted, in dicta, the requisite of strict privity. But <em>Beckovsky v Burton Abstract &amp; Title Co, </em>208 Mich 224; 175 NW 235 (1919) found privity where plaintiff was probably a third-party grantee. See discussion in body of opinion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\n<em>MINNESOTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">In <em>Mulroy v Wright, </em>185 Minn 84; 240 NW 116 (1931), Minnesota moved to note the irrelevance of the privity concept following the reasoning of <em>Glanzer, supra, </em>and moving to a tort analysis. There the actual defendant was not an abstracter but a city official who furnished the abstracter erroneous information. Plaintiff was the buyer of property from owner who ordered abstract. Minn Stat Ann \u00a7 386.66 has limited though the amount of damages recoverable by \"any person\u201d so injured to the amount of the abstracter\u2019s bond, $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">\n<em>MISSISSIPPI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Mississippi appears to have no statutory or case law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\n<em>MISSOURI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">In <em>Zweigardt v Birdseye, </em>57 Mo App 462 (1894), and <em>Schade v Gehner, </em>133 Mo 252; 34 SW 576 (1896), Missouri Courts stuck by the absolute privity requirement even where the abstracter had knowledge of affected third-parties. <em>Anderson v Boone County Abstract Co, </em>418 SW2d 123; 34 ALR3d 1111 (Mo, 1967), reaffirmed these holdings. But <em>Slate v Boone County Abstract Co, </em>432 SW2d 305 (Mo, 1968) created an exception with respect to known third-party \"beneficiaries\u201d, and, most recently, <em>Aluma Kraft Manufacturing Co v Elmer Fox &amp; Co, </em>493 SW2d 378 (Mo App, 1973), an accountant\u2019s liability case, cited <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Slate </em>in moving to a balancing test involving foreseeability. <em>See also Thorne v Johnson, </em>483 SW2d 658 (Mo App, 1972), which involved suit by owner and his grantees and their grantees against a negligent abstracter. An unfavorable judgment on the pleadings against liability was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\n<em>MONTANA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>Western Loan &amp; Savings Co v Silver Bow Abstract Co, </em>31 Mont 448; 78 P 774 (1904), it was held that privity was required but the exception was noted where the abstracter has knowledge of plaintiff. Since the decision in that case, Montana adopted Mont Rev Code \u00a7 66-2113 which creates a cause of action on an abstracter\u2019s bond of $5,000 \"for the use of any owner, mortgagee or other person having an actual interest in the real estate covered by an abstract of title\u201d. The constitutionality of this statute was upheld by <em>State ex rel Freeman v Abstracters Board of Examiners, </em>99 Mont 564; 45 P2d 668 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>NEBRASKA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The early Nebraska rule with respect to abstracter\u2019s liability was on the order of strict priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ity. <em>Thomas v Carson, </em>46 Neb 765; 65 NW 899 (1896). However, passage of the predecessor to Rev State Neb \u00a7 76-501 changed Nebraska law extending liability to \"any party\u201d suffering damages. <em>Gate City Abstract Co v Post, </em>55 Neb 742; 76 NW 471 (1898); <em>Crook v Chilvers, </em>99 Neb 684; 157 NW 617 (1916); <em>Ehlers v Pound, </em>176 Neb 673; 126 NW2d 893 (1964); <em>Marley v McCarthy, </em>129 Neb 880; 263 NW 385 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>NEVADA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Nevada, since 1927, has had a statute equivalent to the current Nev Rev Stats Title 19, \u00a7 240.330 which extends abstracters\u2019 liability \"[f]or any misconduct or neglect in any of the matters in which any commissioned abstracter * * * , is authorized to act, he shall be liable on his official bond to the person or persons injured thereby for all damages sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\n<em>NEW HAMPSHIRE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">There appears to be no statutory or case law on this specific point in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\n<em>NEW JERSEY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The early case of <em>Economy Building &amp; Loan Association v West Jersey Title &amp; Guarantee Co, </em>64 NJL 27; 44 A 854 (1899) relaxed the strict privity requirement with respect to agents and third-party beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">\n<em>NEW MEXICO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">New Mexico Stat Ann \u00a7 70-2-6 and its predecessors extend abstracters\u2019 liability to \"any person * * * acting in faith and reliance upon an abstract.\u201d <em>Gallegos v Ortiz, </em>28 NM 598; 216 P 502 (1923).

In <em>Glanzer v Shepard, </em>233 NY 236; 135 NE 275; 23 ALR 1425 (1922) then Judge Cardozo in a weigher\u2019s case allowing recovery by an unknown third-party beneficiary applied the same liability in dicta to abstracters. In <em>Cole v Vincent, </em>229 App Div 520; 242 NYS 644 (1930), the Appellate Division said recovery by a third-party beneficiary would depend upon a jury decision as to whether or not the abstracter could be charged with knowledge his abstract would be relied on by someone in addition to the purchaser thereof. Next came <em>Ultramares v Touche, </em>255 NY 170; 174 NE 441; 74 ALR 1139 (1931) where then Judge Cardozo limited the rule of foreseeability he set forth in <em>Glanzer </em>in an accountant\u2019s case. In <em>Goodman v Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co, </em>206 NYS2d 32; 11 App Div 2d 1003 (1960), in a case where a potential buyer of plaintiffs property ordered an abstract from defendant abstracter and was deterred from buying because the abstract falsely showed weakness and where the abstracter \"had knowledge of the terms of the contract and knew the purpose to which the report would be put\u201d, the Court allowed an action in fraud. It used fraud because unless \"negligence so reckless as to justify a finding that the defendant had no knowledge of or genuine belief in [the] accuracy\u201d of the abstract, there could be no recovery under <em>Ultramares </em>unless privity. Subsequently, the New York Supreme Court in <em>Cecala v Title Guarantee Co, </em>45 Misc 2d 986; 258 NYS2d 464 (1965) relied on <em>Goodman </em>to allow suit in fraud for \"gross errors\u201d in a title search in a case involving plaintiff owner of property suing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>abstracter for a false abstract delivered to hirn \u2014 no question of privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\n<em>NORTH CAROLINA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">North Carolina appears to have no statutory or case law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>NORTHDAKOTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Though ND Cent Code \u00a7 43-01-11 and its predecessors have, since 1889, expanded an abstracter\u2019s liability to \"any person\u201d, it is nonetheless clear that in North Dakota, the cause of action remains in contract not in tort and that this is not a fraud cause of action with the element of intent constructively supplied. <em>Commercial Bank of Mott v Adams County Abstract Co, </em>73 ND 645; 18 NW2d 15 (1945) (third-party purchaser cause of action against abstracter).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\n<em>OHIO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">In <em>Thomas v Guarantee Title &amp; Trust Co, </em>81 Ohio St 432; 91 NE 183 (1910), Ohio stuck by the requirement of strict contractual privity.

The effect and purpose of this adoption is to delay the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">I cannot agree with the theory or the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">I agree with the majority that plaintiffs\u2019 action is premised on a breach of contractual duty. MCLA 600.5807, MSA 27A.5807 says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\"No person may bring or maintain any action to recover damages or sums due for breach of contract * * * unless, after the claim first accrued to himself or to someone through whom he claims, he commences the action within the periods of time prescribed by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\"(8) The period of limitations is 6 years for all other actions to recover damages or sums, due for breach of contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">When did plaintiffs\u2019 claim accrue? The answer is found in MCLA 600.5827, MSA 27A.5827 which provides, insofar as applicable to these facts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\"[T]he claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when damage results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim thus accrued, at the very latest, in 1959, although no specific date was alleged. Suit was not filed until 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">To avoid application of this unambiguous legislative directive, the Court today adopts a theory which razes the structure of contract law. Prompting this destruction is a desire to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to recover damages after the applicable statute of limitations has foreclosed suit. I repeat a concern expressed in <em>Rizzo v </em>Kretschmer; 389 Mich 363; 207 NW2d 316 (1972). By so altering the law \"to fit a single desired result this Court would force Michigan courts to apply the distortion here wrought to all future cases.\u201d (p 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The Legislature is entitled to place limitations upon the bringing of actions in the courts of this state. Indeed, it is the duty of the Legislature to impose jurisdictional limitations in such matters. There is such a limitation applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The majority cites examples of a number of states which have legislation purporting to do what would be done here by judicial fiat. I thoroughly agree that we should give \"judicial support of legislation\u201d when possible. In fact, that is the point of this dissent. Michigan has no such statute and we should not attempt to provide such by judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">I repeat what was written in dissent in <em>Dyke v Richard, </em>390 Mich 739; 213 NW2d 185 (1973): \"Although individuals may differ as to the wisdom of the legislation, it is not our function to rewrite it.\u201d I would reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of accelerated judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-6\">Levin and J.
