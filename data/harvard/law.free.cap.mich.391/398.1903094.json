Plaintiffs live directly across the street from the Leland Plant and claim to represent additionally a similar class of neighboring property-owners. The Leland Plant is involved primarily in the manufacture of automotive seating, cushioning, and padding in the City of Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">On July 2, 1971, plaintiffs filed a motion for production of documents under GCR 1963, 310 seeking discovery of certain letters, reports, and other documents prepared prior to this litigation in 1968, 1969, and 1970 by expert consultants employed by defendant to study the Leland Plant\u2019s emission control situation. Plaintiffs learned of the existence of these documents through interrogatories answered by defendant on June 8, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">After submission of briefs and presentation of oral argument, the trial court denied the motion for production of documents by interlocutory order in a lengthy opinion handed down from the bench September 2, 1971, and in its order of September 24, 1971. The court based its denial primarily upon the fact that the requested documents would not be admissible in evidence. The trial court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">\"It would appear in the instant matter, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Defendants do not intend to use at trial, either the reports sought by Plaintiffs or the testimony of those who prepared the reports. The effect of allowing discovery in this instance would be to assist Plaintiffs in building their claims as opposed to permitting litigants to adequately prepare for testimony to be given at \u00bftrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Secondarily, the court held that discovery in this case was not within the public interest for it would tend, as defendant urged, to discourage pollution control programs necessitating the documentation of evidence which could later be used against the entity which solicited the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 2-1 on November 28, 1972. 43 Mich App 726; 204 NW2d 726 (1972). The two-judge majority, in a brief five-paragraph opinion, resolved this case entirely on the issue of trial court discretion. Finding no abuse of that discretion, the majority affirmed. Judge V. J. Brennan dissented in an opinion which we essentially follow today.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">This Court granted leave to appeal on April 30, 1973. 389 Mich 788 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">II \u2014IS EVIDENTIARY ADMISSIBILITY PREREQUISITE TO GCR 1963, 310 DISCOVERY?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">It should first be noted that Michigan has a strong historical commitment to a far-reaching, open and effective discovery practice. In light of that commitment, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that discovery rules are to be liberally construed in order to further the ends of justice. <em>Hallett v Michigan Consolidated Gas Co, </em>298 Mich 582, 586; 299 NW 723 (1941); <em>Scarney v Clarke, </em>276 Mich 295, 303; 267 NW 841 (1936); <em>Vincent v VanBlooys, </em>263 Mich 312, 314-315; 248 NW 633 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The portion of Rule 310 relevant to the instant appeal reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">\"Rule 310. Discovery and Production of Documents and Things for Inspection, Copying, or Photographing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\".1 Power of the Court. After commencement of an action the judge of the court in which the action is pending may, upon motion of any party and upon notice to all other parties, and subject to the provisions of subrule 306.2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\"(1) order any party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing, by or on behalf of the moving party, of any reasonably designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects, or tangible things, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action and which are in his possession, custody, or control; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The relevant portion of Rule 306.2 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\"The court shall not order the production or inspection of any writing prepared by the adverse party, his attorney, surety, indemnitor, or agent in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial unless satisfied that denial or production or inspection will unfairly prejudice the party seeking the production or inspection in preparing his claim or defense or will cause him undue hardship or injustice, except as provided in sub-rule 310.1(4). The court shall not order the production or inspection of any part of the writing that reflects an attorney\u2019s mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Rule 310 literally appears to give plaintiffs an unlimited discovery right to relevant, non-privileged documents subject only to the protective provisions of Rule 306.2 and trial court discretion. But Rule 310 has been subject to significant judicial construction. In light of the mandate for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>liberal construction in order to further the ends of justice, this Court has clarified the import of Rule 310 noting the necessity for a showing of \"good cause\u201d by the moving party before such party is entitled to put the issue of document production to the trial court for exercise of its discretion. <em>Covington Mutual Insurance Co v Copeland, </em>382 Mich 109, 111-112; 168 NW2d 220 (1969); <em>J A Utley Co v Saginaw Circuit Judge, </em>372 Mich 367, 375; 126 NW2d 696 (1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In the instant case, the trial judge correctly imposed this \"good cause\u201d showing requirement upon the moving party, but, significantly, the court held additionally that \"requisite 'good cause\u2019 is good cause in relation to answering or countering evidence or testimony to be used at trial\u201d. While it could have been interpreted more broadly, the quoted language became the troublesome fly in this discovery ointment, because the trial court proceeded to interpret this language to impose an evidentiary <em>admissibility </em>requirement upon plaintiffs moving under Rule 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">But \"good cause\u201d under Rule 310 is clearly no longer governed by considerations of admissibility. On June 7, 1965, Rule 310.1(1) was amended, effective immediately, to explicitly eliminate, <em>inter alia, </em>the limitation on production of documents to those documents which, by reference to GCR 1963, 302.2, were \"admissible under the rules of evidence\u201d. See 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Authors\u2019 Comment 4 to GCR 1963, 310. The trial judge in the instant case erroneously reimposed this deleted admissibility requirement. To accept such a conclusion would do great damage to the settled Michigan policy of encouraging full and open dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>covery in order to narrow the range of disputed issues which might otherwise needlessly waste the parties\u2019 and judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Ill \u2014GOOD CAUSE FOR GCR 1963, 310 DISCOVERY</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">While we have elucidated what Rule 310 does <em>not </em>require with respect to a showing of \"good cause\u201d, the issue of what <em>is </em>required is more difficult. The question of the meaning of \"good cause\u201d in the Federal context, prior to elimination of that standard in 1970, was a subject of vigorous discussion and debate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3****Without inserting ourselves into that now-mooted controversy at the Federal level, we do note with approval the analysis of one Federal court on this subject. In <em>Franks v National Dairy Products Corp, </em>41 FRD 234 (WD Texas, 1966), a similar issue was before the court under Federal Rule 34, the Federal counterpart to Rule 310, when it had a \"good cause\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Fisher, after a scholarly review of the competing authority, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\"[T]he requirement of Rule 34 that 'good cause\u2019 must be shown is satisfied when the moving party demonstrates that the information sought is or might lead to admissible evidence, <em>is material to the moving party\u2019s trial preparation, </em>or is for some other reason necessary to promote the ends of justice.\u201d 41 FRD 234, 238. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">This standard, we believe, is both just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>squarely in line with the judicial rationale behind imposition of a \"good cause\u201d requirement. It provides for extensive discovery in those actions where discovery presents the reasonable likelihood of providing the moving party with relevant and appropriate information. Thus we consider that the <em>Franks </em>standard quoted above is well-reasoned and we adopt it as an accurate statement of the meaning of \"good cause\u201d under Rule 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On this basis, we must look to the plaintiffs\u2019 showing in the instant case to determine whether or not they did in fact present the court with \"good cause\u201d sufficient to move that court to grant discovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for production of documents gives a two-sentence rationale supportive of good cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\"Such documents relate directly to the subject matter of the instant litigation since plaintiffs allege injuries resulting from defendant\u2019s air pollution. Said documents contain relevant material evidence which may be utilized in whole or in part by defendant at the trial of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>These succinct allegations in plaintiff\u2019s motion well illustrate the apparent confusion which heretofore surrounded the \"good cause\u201d showing requirement. Indeed, at first blush, one might well have interpreted the last sentence of plaintiffs\u2019 allegation, read in conjunction with the first sentence, as implying that plaintiffs were seeking document discovery in order to obtain <em>evidence to be introduced at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">But the opinion of the trial court demonstrates that plaintiffs\u2019 arguments at the hearing on their motion clearly alleged the materiality of these documents to plaintiffs\u2019 <em>trial preparation. </em>As the court capsulized plaintiffs\u2019 arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\"Plaintiffs seek production of certain studies and other documents prepared by Defendant\u2019s Air Pollution Control Consultants in order for Plaintiffs <em>to prepare their case for trial, </em>particularly in proving injury to Plaintiffs by defendant\u2019s alleged pollution, and for the necessary information to ascertain the class of Plaintiffs injured by the alleged nuisance. Plaintiffs further claim that the documents prepared were not prepared in connection with the instant litigation, present an analysis of the magnitude of the problem, the consequence of continuing the <em>[sic] </em>maintain the alleged nuisance, and the alternatives to solve the problem, if any.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations from the foregoing are therefore clearly within the <em>Franks </em>rule which we have adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">If plaintiffs can factually support (or have factually supported) these allegations of the materiality of these documents for trial preparation they can establish (or have established) good cause entitling them to discovery. The trial court was in error in denying document discovery on the basis of lack of evidentiary admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>IV \u2014THE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>A. The \"Deterrence\u201d Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Plaintiffs also contended below that the public policy in favor of broad, effective discovery practice and the public policy in favor of private litigation aimed at obtaining environmental relief arising out of the Environmental Protection Act of 1970, MCLA 691.1201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 14.528(201) <em>et seq., </em>give further strength to their \"good cause\u201d arguments under Rule 310.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">But, conversely, defendant argued and the trial court agreed that competing considerations of public policy gave rise to the opposite conclusion that discovery in these circumstances should be barred. The trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\"If discovery of such investigation conducted, not in preparation or contemplation of litigation, is permitted, despite Plaintiffs\u2019 protestations to the contrary, it is <em>not </em>likely that private resources will undertake programs aimed at ameliorating pollutant conditions; for to do so, they would have to document evidence that might be used against them during litigation. In effect, they would be preparing a Plaintiffs\u2019 case against themselves which could actually be used to oppose their own defense, should indeed litigation arise out of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\"To permit such documents, prepared not for trial, but rather to assist private resources to resolve pollution problems would be to discourage efforts to resolve such problems. Such a result would not be in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We concur in the able analysis of Judge V. J. Brennan siding with plaintiffs in dissenting on this issue in the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\"Finally, the court advanced a public policy reason for the denial of discovery. The court below felt that permitting discovery in this instance would discourage voluntary anti-pollution studies and programs on the part of industry. The discouragement would stem from the polluter\u2019s knowledge that such a study could be discovered and used to facilitate a cause of action for damages against him. Again, I cannot endorse the reasoning of the trial court. A manufacturer whose operations pollute the environment would, if discovery were allowed in this situation, face two alternatives. On the one hand he could choose to do nothing regarding the undesirable side effects of his operation, and expose himself to continued and protracted litigation. On the other hand he could attempt to ameliorate and hopefully eliminate those side effects and eventually end litigation of this nature. In my opinion, the latter alternative is obviously superior even though it would admittedly have the short term side effect of facilitating a plaintiff\u2019s task in litigation of this nature.\u201d 43 Mich App 726, 733.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Judge V. J. Brennan has thus skillfully grasped the nettle of this difficult and thorny conflict of strong competing policy arguments and has resolved the issue in a pithy but well-reasoned and practical manner. One might only add in answer to defendant\u2019s argument that the best policy is voluntary industry pollution abatement, that, while such policy might be \"ideal\u201d, the Legislature in enacting the Environmental Protection Act has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>made a realistic policy decision that the stimulus of possible litigation is now practically necessary to expedite what the ideal of <em>laissez-faire </em>has been too slow in accomplishing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>B. The \"Subsequent Repairs\u201d Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Defendant contends that the doctrine of inadmissibility of subsequent repairs bars discovery of these reports. Defendant cites for this proposition the Michigan cases of <em>Moon v Pere Marquette R Co, </em>143 Mich 125; 106 NW 715 (1906); <em>LaDue v Lebanon Twp, </em>222 Mich 301; 192 NW 636 (1923); <em>Thirlby v Mandeloff, </em>352 Mich 501; 90 NW2d 476 (1958); and <em>People v Gill, </em>247 Mich 479; 226 NW 214 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>Thirlby </em>and <em>Gill </em>are entirely inapposite to the instant case in that they involve admission into evidence of settlement offers. 352 Mich 501, 505; 247 Mich 479, 480. Such offers arise in the course of litigation. Expert reports prepared in the course of litigation are excluded from Rule 310 discovery by virtue of the Rule 306.2 prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\"><em>Moon </em>is a case involving admission of a change of safety rules after an accident; <em>LaDue </em>involves subsequent repairs. In. both cases, evidence was found <em>inadmissible at trial </em>because of the danger of unfairly influencing the jury. 143 Mich 125, 127-128; 222 Mich 301, 305-306. The issue of trial admissibility is not before us. We are concerned only with the issue of whether these documents are suitable for discovery purposes, not whether they can be placed in evidence before a judge or jury. While we do not express an opinion on the continued viability of the subsequent repairs evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>dentiary exclusion doctrine, we hold that it is not applicable to the instant discovery application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\n<em>C. Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Again, we strongly reaffirm our clear public policy favoring a broad and effective pretrial discovery. All of the preceding policy and legal arguments must be viewed in light of that overriding concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Thus, we hold that the trial court was in error in barring discovery in the instant case on the basis of defendant\u2019s policy argument. There is neither legal nor policy ground supporting denial of document discovery on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">V \u2014THE ISSUE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Defendant contends that whether or not the trial judge erred in refusing production of these documents is not dispositive of this appeal as the matter is one of trial court discretion and plaintiffs here have not demonstrated abuse of that discretion. As the standard for such abuse, defendants and the Court of Appeals majority below cite the following passage from <em>Spalding v Spalding, </em>355 Mich 382, 384-385; 94 NW2d 810 (1959), a child support case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">\"The term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations. In order to have an 'abuse\u2019 in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The <em>Spalding </em>abuse of discretion standard relative to decision on the <em>facts </em>is not appropriate for use in all situations. <em>People v Charles O. Williams, </em>386 Mich 565, 573; 194 NW2d 337 (1972). In <em>Spalding </em>the Court was using its judgment concerning the particular facts of record to enable it to make an appropriate discretionary ruling as to child support. The trial court in the instant case had discretion under Rule 310 to determine whether the <em>facts </em>placed before it were sufficient under the <em>law </em>to entitle plaintiffs to the benefit of Rule 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">But more to the point, such standard of discretion relates to judgment on the <em>facts </em>not on the <em>law, </em>where appellate courts must exercise their judgment. Again, as judge V. J. Brennan succinctly observed in the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\"By adopting the <em>Spalding </em>standard and applying it to this case, the majority has ignored the trial court\u2019s rationale for denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for discovery. After reviewing that rationale I find that I disagree with the trial court\u2019s 'judicial opinion\u2019, but not with any of the trial court\u2019s conclusions regarding the facts of the case.\u201d 43 Mich App 726, 730.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">It is obvious that the trial court ruling in the instant case was not based upon discretionary consideration of the facts but was based instead upon a misinterpretation of the applicable law. The legal question as to the standard for \"good cause\u201d is not subject to the discretionary predilections of individual judges. Such a holding would demolish entirely the appellate system of review insulating errors of law from just and appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>scrutiny on appeal. Thus, the legal errors in the instant case present solid grounds for reversal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">VI \u2014CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">For the reasons advanced in Sections II, III, IV and V of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>we hold that admissibility as evidence is not a factor to be considered by the trial court in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant GCR 1963, 310 document discovery, we adopt the rule in <em>Franks </em>which <em>inter alia </em>holds \"good cause\u201d exists where \"the information sought * * * is material to the moving party's trial preparation\u201d, we hold further that defendant\u2019s policy argument, outlined <em>supra </em>in Section V, is not a bar to discovery, and we hold finally that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant production of the documents was based on an error of law and thus was not a matter within the purview of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The trial court order of September 24, 1971, denying production of these documents was erroneous and is hereby set aside. The trial court and Court of Appeals are reversed and the cause is remanded to Wayne County Circuit Court for pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

In <em>Pearson, </em>plaintiffs sought Rule 310 discovery of a statement made by defendant\u2019s insurer following an automobile accident. Justice Fitzgerald held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\"Once the 'good cause\u2019 requirement of <em>Utley </em>has been satisfied, we feel that the trial court in the instant case had little latitude but to order the production of * * * [defendant\u2019s agent\u2019s] statement. Nonproduction of the statement is the gravamen of this appeal and left too many imponderables in this case * * * . While a motion filed with the court should not necessarily precipitate an order, we feel that the failure to supply a copy of the statement plus the clear issue of the credibility of * * * [defendant\u2019s agent], who was not a casual bystander, but rather the driver of the other vehicle, furnished sufficient grounds <em>to require </em>the trial court to order production of the statement.\u201d 3 Mich App 41, 49-50.

On rehearing, the point was made with respect to deposition discovery (GCR 1963, 302.1) that, in light of the aim of complete disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\"There is not need to leave the resolution of the question before us to the murky area of trial judge discretion. Only those questions for which it is not possible to devise a rule of law generally applicable are properly left to unregulated discretion. If a rule can be stated, one way or another, then the choice should be responsibly made and the decision should be uniformly implemented \u2014 the question should no longer depend on the personal predilections of the sitting judge.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 28 Mich App 42, 53.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b535-6\">M. S. Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQge\"><em>(concurring). </em>I agree that it is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant broad discovery for \"cause shown\u201d. I also agree that the exercise of this discretion is not limited to documents or objects admissible in evidence and so I concur with the final result of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Two aspects of this case are of concern to me, but one is not before the Court \u2014 the current proliferation of class actions. The other matter of concern is a policy which encourages an industry to assess and control its own pollution problems and then cause the result of its expenditures and labors to be turned like a knife against itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">There is more than a likelihood that our decision will \"heat up\u201d class actions and \"chill\u201d good faith efforts to control pollution. I foresee a \"chilling\u201d of the engagement of expert consultants and engineers, of farsighted resolutions of boards of directors, of surveys and of the written sharing of ideas. None of this benefits the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">There is something essentially wrong with a policy which demands large expenditures (around $828,000 in this case) to control pollution problems and then requires that same industry to produce its work product to be used against it in litigation concerning past pollution which that same work product has been designed to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Ultimately, of course, the consumer pays the total cost.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-11\">Swainson and J.
