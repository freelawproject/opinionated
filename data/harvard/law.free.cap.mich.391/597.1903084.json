Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad0d\">Defendant is appealing a jury verdict finding him guilty of armed robbery. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion. <em>People v Howard, </em>No. 13083 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The incident occurred on December 3, 1970 at the O\u2019Mack Bar in Detroit. Two men committed the robbery. One was armed with a pistol, the other with a sawed-off shotgun. The patrons were made to lie on the floor and surrender their valuables.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On December 18th, an automobile was stopped because it was being driven without lights after dark and was on the wrong side of the street. Defendant was a passenger in the rear seat. The driver had a sawed-off shotgun standing between his legs, the butt of the gun resting on the floor. Defendant subsequently was arrested for the armed robbery of the O\u2019Mack Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The first witness at trial, a barmaid, identified defendant as being the robber holding the shotgun. She had previously identified him in a lineup. When shown the shotgun, at first she identified it as the one used in the robbery and on further examination, she said it looked like the one used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The next witness, a customer, also made an in-court identification of defendant as being the man with the shotgun. He said that he thought the shotgun taken from the car was approximately four inches longer than the robbery weapon. A second barmaid identified defendant. She testified that the shotgun was similar to the one used in the robbery. Another employee gave similar testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>mony. She also recalled identifying defendant when shown some photographs after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The fifth witness was a customer. He identified defendant as the robber with the shotgun. When shown the weapon he said it was similar to the one used in the robbery. Another customer could not positively identify defendant but he did say the shotgun was similar to the robbery weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The next witness identified himself as the robber who was holding the pistol. He identified defendant as being his partner in this particular crime. He said defendant used a sawed-off shotgun. When shown the weapon produced in court, he said it was similar to the robbery weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">. Following this testimony the jury was excused and a separate record was made to determine if the shotgun should be admitted into evidence. One of the arresting officers testified regarding the aforementioned circumstances of the arrest, also including the fact that the two in the back seat of the car ducked down when the police approached. The prosecutor and defendant\u2019s attorney presented arguments and briefs. After deliberating overnight, the court ruled in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">When the jury was returned, the arresting officer testified. The prosecution moved to introduce the weapon. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected. After admitting the evidence, the court, without request, cautioned the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\"There has been no testimony that this is the sawed off shotgun. Now, you will remember that. So I am admitting that gun into evidence for your consideration; it is up to you to determine under the facts and circumstances of the arrest, and who was arrested at the time, and what was found; you will assess the weight that you will give to that Exhibit in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Defendant presented one witness. His mother-in-law said he spent the night of the robbery in her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In the Court of Appeals defendant alleged two instances of reversible error. He said the trial court did not give correct instructions regarding the alibi defense. There was no objection to the instructions at trial. The Court of Appeals noted the judge\u2019s frequent references to the prosecutor\u2019s duty to prove all elements of the offense and the defendant\u2019s involvement beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals noted the judge\u2019s frequent reminders that the defendant was not obligated to prove anything. The Court of Appeals was \"satisfied the jury understood that this defendant\u2019s alibi defense need only to have raised a reasonable doubt to justify acquittal\u201d. We are convinced there was no error in the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Also challenged was the court\u2019s admitting the shotgun into evidence. The Court of Appeals said that the shotgun</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">\"was sufficiently connected with the offense for which defendant was on trial to warrant its introduction into evidence. The fact that the sawed off shotgun was not specifically identified as the weapon used in the robbery but was only identified as being similar to the one used in the robbery goes to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Leave to appeal was granted 389 Mich 807 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Defendant has made two attacks concerning admission of the shotgun. He claims the evidence was irrelevant because it was not found in defendant\u2019s possession nor was it specifically identified as the robbery weapon. Even assuming that the gun was admissible, defendant claims its prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>effect was so great that it was an abuse of discretion to admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">How are we to evaluate the relevancy of the proffered evidence? Defendant has cited this passage by Justice Cooley in <em>Stewart v People, </em>23 Mich 63; 9 Am Rep 78 (1871) concerning the use of impeachment evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\"The proper test for the admissibility of evidence ought to be, we think, whether it has a tendency to affect belief in the mind of a reasonably cautious person, who should receive it and weigh it with judicial fairness.\u201d (p 75.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Justice Cooley further said the judge \"ought to be allowed a reasonable discretion in such cases\u201d which \"ought not to be set aside except in a cle\u00e1r case of abuse\u201d, (p 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">This preeminent jurist understood the difficulty of trying to devise a mechanical test for determining relevancy. The trial judge must draw upon his own wisdom and experience in making a decision. It is not within the role of the appellate courts to second-guess such judgment. They should intervene only when clear abuse is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Our statutes and court rules reflect this conclusion. MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096 says in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u00abNo * * * verdict shall be * * * reversed or a new trial granted by any court of this state in any criminal case on the ground of * * * improper admission or rejection of evidence * * * unless in the opinion of the court, after examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Also see GCR 1963, 529.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">In the instant matter, the trial judge heard the testimony, saw the witnesses, listened to argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ments and read the briefs. He decided that the shotgun should be admitted. He told the jury, in effect, to \"receive it and weigh it with judicial fairness\u201d. Compare <em>People v Kelly, </em>386 Mich 330; 192 NW2d 494 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Defendant argues that the shotgun was not relevant and, if relevant, that the probative value of the otherwise admissible evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. It also has been argued that its probative value in this instance amounts to little or none at all in light of the several positive identifications and other strong testimony which almost certainly would have led to defendant\u2019s conviction without admission of the gun into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">' The fact that defendant had access to a sawed-off shotgun which at a minimum was similar to the one used in the commission of the crime is adequate at least to establish relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The argument that proof of access to the shotgun tagged defendant as a \"bad boy\u201d and therefore was prejudicial to a fair trial is also of flimsy fabric. Although it is conceded that the probative value was not conclusive, there was real probative value in the evidence that the defendant was identified as the robber with a shotgun and he did have access to a sawed-off shotgun which was similar to and could have been the one used by defendant at the time of the robbery. As the judge properly instructed immediately upon admission of the gun, the jury was to give the evidence whatever weight it deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">It further is noted that no objection was made during the showing of the gun to the various witnesses and the questioning regarding identification of the gun. Only after the completion of the testimony and a motion to admit into evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>there a motion to suppress. By this time, whatever prejudice may have flowed from the gun was a <em>fait accompli. </em>The technical hurdle of admission was accompanied by the judge\u2019s statement that there had been no testimony that this \"is\u201d the sawed-off shotgun. It was relevant and was submitted for jury consideration and assessment of weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Prejudice is not borne out by facts. Indeed, one of defendant\u2019s arguments is that there were so many positive identifications, including that of the other man admittedly with defendant in the perpetration of the armed robbery, that the evidence of the shotgun was not needed at all for conviction. In other words, defendant contends that the prosecutor was guilty of \"overkill\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Argument is made that such evidence might have had sufficient probative value had it been part of a chain of circumstantial evidence, but was not necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">On the face of it, this theory is subject to some limitations and use of discretion if it is not to become \"form without substance\u201d. For instance, if such evidence is to be used in a weak case against the defendant but not in a strong case, we could distort the reflection of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Practically speaking, the prosecutor normally does not have the gift of \"second sight\u201d. He cannot gauge before trial exactly what identification testimony will be forthcoming (as of the subject shotgun and of the defendant himself). He cannot predict with exactitude what will bring the jury to the conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or tip the scales to acquittal. He must bring all possible evidence which, if admitted, must be weighed against all other evidence. It would be unreasonable under the facts of the instant case to require the prosecutor (1) to know in advance the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>nature of the identification testimony and (2) then to assess its probative value in the last analysis as against its prejudicial value and (3) to make judgment as to whether the case is strong enough to stand without the exhibit. We must concede that the prosecutor must present all of the evidence known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The burden then falls upon the judge to control the introduction of evidence, to assess the total of trial facets and use discretion. As stated, in the content, context and posture of this case, the judge did not abuse that discretion in submitting the gun for the consideration of the jury. Indeed, an argument might have been made that the instruction to the jury was overly favorable to the defendant in light of the testimony of one witness at least that the gun was the one used in the robbery and of the others that it looked like the one used. Certainly, no one would expect them to have closely inspected the gun under the circumstances. We conclude that both the prosecutor and the judge performed their functions in a manner which requires affirmance by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">This is an appropriate occasion to speak also of the role of the truth in judicial proceedings. The constitutional guarantees to persons coming into our system of justice were designed to develop the true facts of any given situation. Procedures have developed over the years towards orderly means of insuring the truth. Occasionally, the target of these procedures and rules is obscured by webs of split hairs and the constitution is subrogated to a play of words or \"gamesmanship\u201d. On the other hand, there are occasions when there is something in a trial \"so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that it never can be regarded harmless\u201d. <em>People v Mobley, </em>390 Mich 57; 210 NW2d 327 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In this case, the truth is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Defendant was properly and fairly tried. The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-6\">Swainson, J., concurred with M. S. Coleman, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b727-7\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Williams, J., concurred in the result of the opinion by M. S. Coleman, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b727-8\">Levin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Al15\"><em>(concurring). </em>The shotgun was not identified as the very gun used when the crime was committed, nor was it part of a chain of circumstantial evidence sufficient in the aggregate to support a verdict or finding of guilty. It should not have been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">We, nevertheless, concur in the affirmance of Howard\u2019s conviction of armed robbery because the attention of the trial judge was not directed to the fact that the gun was not part of such a chain of circumstantial evidence and because we are satisfied that the admission of the gun was of relatively little importance and if a new trial were held with the gun excluded it is unlikely Howard would be acquitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">The people assert that the shotgun, found 15 days after the robbery when the police stopped an automobile in which Howard was a passenger, might have been used by Howard in the robbery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The gun was found between the legs of the driver of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">None of the eyewitnesses could identify the gun as <em>the </em>gun used by the robber who was armed with a shotgun. The most any of the witnesses could say was that it was \"similar\u201d to the robber\u2019s gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Howard was identified by five eyewitnesses as the robber who was carrying a shotgun. On the basis of their identification testimony the jury could properly convict him of the crime. Without the identification testimony Howard could not have been convicted; manifestly he could not have been convicted because 15 days after the robbery he was a passenger in an automobile where there was found a shotgun similar in appearance to the shotgun used in committing the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The admissibility of weapons which <em>might </em>have been used to commit a crime is an important issue to both the people and accused persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We agree that merely because evidence that a defendant may have had access to a gun is damag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ing (\"prejudicial\u201d) to the defendant does not warrant its exclusion. We also agree that a gun is not rendered inadmissible merely because there is other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The people are entitled to prove their case by more than one route.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The people should not, however, be permitted to exploit a tenuous relevance to put before the jury evidence which does not truly tend to prove a defendant\u2019s guilt, evidence which may very well divert the jury from an objective appraisal of the probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">There are many general statements that where a weapon or tool was used to commit a crime, a weapon or tool which might have been used in its commission, found in the defendant\u2019s possession, may be introduced without proof that it was the very weapon or tool used.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These generalizations overstate the true rule. In the only Michigan Supreme Court cases of which we are aware where weapons or tools found in the defendant\u2019s possession were held admissible to show capacity to commit a crime, they were part of a chain of circumstantial evidence against the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Guns found some time after the commission of a crime which might have been used to commit it are admissible where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">1. There is testimony or other evidence tending to identify the gun as the very gun used to commit the crime. The testimony of the eyewitnesses in this case was not of that quality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ***5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">2. Although the gun is not so identified, it is part of a chain of circumstantial evidence which in the aggregate is sufficient to support a verdict or finding of guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Here the relevance of the evidence of Howard\u2019s access to a shotgun was a theoretical relevance unrelated to any other proof, bearing no logical or rational connection to any other evidence. It was not part of a composite of circumstantial proofs from which Howard\u2019s guilt could have been deduced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The people did not seriously seek to prove their case by more than one route. The evidence of Howard\u2019s access to a shotgun was left suspended before the jury unrelated to any other evidence. If this evidence served any purpose, it could only have been possibly to divert the jurors from the central issue of whether to believe the identification testimony of the eyewitnesses or the testimony of the alibi witness, thus encouraging the jurors to resolve any doubts regarding the conflicting testimony on the evidence that Howard was riding with other men at night with a sawed-off shotgun and the legally irrelevant inference that he must be a bad man.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">If the attention of the trial judge had been directed to the fact that the shotgun was not admissible on either of the two grounds mentioned or if the evidence tending to establish Howard\u2019s guilt were less overwhelming or if the rebuttal evidence offered by Howard were more impressive, a different result might be in order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b731-6\">T. G. Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b731-7\">J. W. Fitzgerald, J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> While we are not prepared to say that the judge\u2019s ruling was reversible error, we favor a rule requiring a prosecutor, <em>before </em>a weapon which might have been used to commit the crime is displayed to the jury, to state his theory of admissibility and to outline the proofs which he expects to offer in support of that theory so that weapons are not displayed unless the prosecutor expects to be able to establish admissibility on one of the two bases mentioned in this opinion <em>(see </em>text,accompanying fns 5 and 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> Four eyewitnesses testified that the shotgun offered in evidence was \"similar\u201d to the weapon used by one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">One witness \"thought\u201d the shotgun taken from the car was approximately four inches longer than the gun used during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">A self-proclaimed confederate testified that the gun was similar, but \"I\u2019m not positive if that\u2019s the exact one we used on that night\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Evelyn Vaughn, the barmaid, did say on direct examination, \"It\u2019s the one he was carrying\u201d. But she was then asked by the prosecutor, two questions later, whether there was anything \"unusual\u201d about the gun which she recognized. She responded, \"It\u2019s a difference, but I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know that much about guns but \u2014 .\u201d The question was repeated in a somewhat different form and she responded, \"I really couldn\u2019t say positively\u201d. She was then asked by the prosecutor: \"All right. Was the weapon that you saw on that particular evening very similar to this one in total length?\u201d Answer: \"Yes\u201d. The trial judge\u2019s view of her testimony, as set forth in his cautionary instruction, was \"There had been <em>no </em>testimony that this <em>is </em>the sawed-off shotgun\u201d.
