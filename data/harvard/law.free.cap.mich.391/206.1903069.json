M. K\u00e1vanagh, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">In December, 1968 the Circuit Court of Washtenaw County ruled that MCLA 712A.4; MSA 27.3178(598.4), allowing the probate court to waive jurisdiction over certain juveniles, thus allowing them to be tried as adults, was not unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals, upon remand from this Court, upheld this decision. 30 Mich App 390; 186 NW2d 15 (1971). This Court granted leave and entered a decision reversing these lower courts. 388 Mich 66; 199 NW2d 217 (1972). Rehearing was granted and the case was again before us for decision. Justices Black and Adams each circulated proposed opinions. Before final decision, the terms of Justices Black and Adams on the Court expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On January 22, 1973, on the Court\u2019s own motion, the Court granted rehearing without oral argument and upon the briefs previously filed. We hereby adopt the opinion of Justice Adams, circulated November 20, 1972. This author has added footnotes 3 and 4 to bring the opinion to date and has changed the wording in the third sentence from the end on page 221, but not the content thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Justice Black, in the opening paragraph of his first opinion in this case <em>(People v Fields, </em>388 Mich 66; 199 NW2d 217 [1972]), stated the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\"The reviewable question is whether 1948 CL 712A.4; MSA 27.3178(598.4) is unconstitutional for <em>want of standards </em>governing probate determination of how a juvenile over the age of 15 years, accused of any act the nature of which constitutes a felony, may be waived to circuit court for trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Judge Mary Coleman, in her Amicus Curiae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>brief of Michigan Probate and Juvenile Court Judges Association, stated the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">\"The principal issue being argued in this case is the extent to which the legislature may delegate power to another body or agency. Such delegation must include <em>sufficient standards </em>so as to obviate any delegation of legislative power. The legislature may not delegate the power to make laws.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In my first opinion <em>(People v Fields, </em>388 Mich 66 [1972]), I said (p 75):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\"It is important to understand the precise issue in this case. It is <em>not </em>whether the constitutional requirements of due process stated in <em>Kent v United States, </em>383 US 541; 86 S Ct 1045; 16 L Ed 2d 84 (1966), were met. Rather, it is whether the <em>lack of standards </em>in the statute preclude a waiver proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">At this time, it is necessary to state what is not involved in this case because so much has been written that tends to obfuscate the issue. This case was decided by Probate Judge O\u2019Brien on August 16, 1968. The Juvenile Court Rules of 1969 were adopted December 5, 1968 and went into effect March 1, 1969. The Juvenile Court Rules were not in effect when this case was decided by the probate judge. They have no application to the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">It is true that, among other reasons, the Juvenile Court Rules of 1969 were written in response to <em>Kent v United States, </em>383 US 541; 86 S Ct 1045; 16 L Ed 2d 84 (1966). The study draft of Rule 11, circulated to the committee in January 1968 notes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">\"Provision for a finding of probable cause in a waiver proceeding appears in <em>Green v United States, </em>308 F2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>303 (1962) and appeared to be the conclusion of conference and committee discussion. Notice provisions are drawn from requirements of the <em>Gault </em>case, <em>and provisions for the right to counsel, access to social records, and written statements of \u00f1ndings from Kent v U.S. </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">While this Court cannot enact substantive laws, it does have the authority to decide upon the procedures to be followed in the courts of this state. Such authority has been exercised by adopting the General Court Rules for courts of general jurisdiction, the District Court Rules for the district courts, and the Juvenile Court Rules. Being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>fully cognizant of the problems created by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kent, supra </em>and <em>In re Gault, </em>387 US 1; 87 S Ct 1428; 18 L Ed 2d 527 (1967), the Probate Court Committee of this Court, of which I was then chairman, undertook with the help of the probate judges, to insure <em>procedural </em>due process in the handling of juvenile court cases. Any question pertaining to JCR 1969, 11, is not before the Court in this case since it was not in effect at the time the action of the probate judge herein reviewed took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It is perhaps unfortunate that the issue in this case was framed in terms of standards rather than in the more usual terminology used to attack an ambiguous or unclear statute \u2014 void because of vagueness or overbreadth. The fundamental question revolves around the concept that ours is a government of laws and not of men. If we have a viable law that can be applied by the probate judges of this state, the decision of the lower cohrts should be upheld.. On the other hand, if the law is so vague that its application is nothing more than a <em>carte blanche </em>grant of discretion to each probate judge to exercise his own wisdom and compassion as to what he thinks should be done in each case that comes before him upon a request for waiver, the previous decision of this Court was correct and should be reaffirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Review is an essential part of the judicial process. While a vast majority of cases, both criminal and civil, are decided by a single judge, an all-important element in the decision making process is the ever-present possibility in every case that the decision of a judge will be subjected to appellate review. If that possibility is removed, the judge becomes a monarch from whose ruling\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>good, bad or indifferent \u2014 there is no recourse. As was said in <em>Kent, supra </em>(p 561):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\"Meaningful review requires that the reviewing court should review. It should not be remitted to assumptions. It must have before it a statement of the reasons motivating the waiver including, of course, a statement of the relevant facts. It may not 'assume\u2019 that there are adequate reasons, nor may it merely assume that 'full investigation\u2019 has been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Under the statute, the provisions of which I discussed at length in my first opinion, the law leaves it solely up to the judgment of each probate judge to formulate his own criteria. The basis for waiver could be as varied as the number of probate judges. For example, see Appendix A setting forth three possible sets of standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The difficulty with the statute has been overcome by the enactment of 1972 PA 265; MCLA 712A.4; MSA 27.3178(598.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">There remains the question as to whether the decision of this Court should be given retroactive or prospective effect. Volumes have been written on this subject.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are concerned with the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tutionality of a statute in which the decision by a probate-juvenile judge, under the statute, can result in a person, classified as a juvenile, being waived from that classification and treated as an adult in a prosecution for a criminal offense. Some legal scholars adhere to the theory that once such a statute is declared to be unconstitutional, the court must also find that it was void and of no effect from the time of enactment. Others feel that the court finding can be given just prospective effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>O\u2019Callahan v Parker, </em>395 US 258; 89 S Ct 1683; 23 L Ed 2d 291 (1969), the United States Supreme Court held that military courts lacked the authority to try a soldier who, while temporarily freed of military responsibility, had been charged with a crime cognizable in a civilian court. The issue of retroactivity of this decision came before the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, in <em>Gosa v Mayden, Warden, </em>450 F2d 753 (CA 5, 1971). Judge Clark, writing the majority opinion, said (p 758):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\"It has always been the law that proceedings of a court which is without jurisdiction of the subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>are void, but does this inevitably lead to the necessity for full retrospective application of the court decision which first discovers and announces the jurisdictional deficit? We hold it does not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In analyzing the question as applied to <em>Gosa, </em>Judge Clark pointed out (p 759):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\"The issue * * * is not whether the accused could be tried at all, but which forum had the right to conduct the proceedings. Not whether, but where.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Judge Clark applied the tests for refusing retroactive application set forth in <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; 87 S Ct 1967; 18 L Ed 2d 1199 (1967). Applying the \"purpose of the new standard test\u201d, he concluded \"that <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>ultimately decides no more on this subject [jurisdiction] than that there is a belief that a civilian court trial with grand and petit jury protections would tend to prevent arbitrariness and repression and be fairer.\u201d Applying the \"justified reliance on the old standard test\u201d, he noted that the <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>decision had not been foreshadowed in other opinions. Applying the \"effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application test\u201d, he noted that the number of cases which conceivably might be affected and the administrative problems which could arise from them were so considerable as to militate against giving the decision retrospective effect. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari (June 19, 1972), 407 US 920; 92 S Ct 2467; 32 L Ed 2d 805 (1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>United States of America ex rel Flemings v Chafee, </em>458 F2d 544 (CA 2, 1972), the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>involving precisely the same issue as in <em>Gosa, supra, </em>reasoned to a contrary result and concluded that <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>must be applied retroactively because that decision was grounded in the absence of jurisdiction to adjudicate. Applying a two pronged test, the Court concluded that, as to the purpose to be served, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Callahan </em>is that court martial procedures employed there raised a \"clear danger of convicting the innocent\u201d, and, applying the impact of the retroactivity test, the Court was unimpressed with the claim that the administrative burden of granting full retroactivity would be staggering or that there would be a significant impact on the administration of justice. Certiorari was granted June 19, 1972 in the above case. 407 US 919; 92 S Ct 2461; 32 L Ed 2d 805 (1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We find the reasoning of the Court in <em>Gosa, supra, </em>and in its antecedents going back to the opinion of Justice Cardozo in <em>Great Northern R Co v Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co, </em>287 US 358, 364-366; 53 S Ct 145, 148-149; 77 L Ed 360, 366-367 (1932), and the decision in <em>Griffin v Illinois, </em>351 US 12; 76 S Ct 585; 100 L Ed 891 (1956), followed with approval by this Court in <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960), to be the more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For exapple, in the present case, even though the statute was enacted in 1939, it was never seriously challenged until 1968. Prior to the 1960\u2019s and the decisions in <em>Kent </em>and in <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>juvenile courts were considered to be <em>sui generis. </em>This was the situation in Michigan and throughout the United States. Before January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>1964 (see Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 19), a probate-juvenile court judge was not even required to be a lawyer. In keeping with the then , theory of the juvenile courts, these laymen-judges functioned as heads of a broad social rehabilitative process that not only involved court procedures but medical and dental care, foster home supervision, operation and supervision of detention homes, and school and teaching facilities for the neglected or the delinquent child. The probate-juvenile court judge was the <em>pater-familias </em>for such children. Presumably this concept would be followed by the judge in granting waiver of a juvenile. It is scarcely any wonder that the statute went unchallenged. <em>Kent </em>and <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>abruptly brought the juvenile court into the full stream of the judicial process. As in <em>Gosa, supra, </em>the issue here pertains not to whether, but where \u2014 in which court is the juvenile to be tried. Both justice and reality will now be served by holding that the decision of this Court in this case be given prospective effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We hold that the retroactive effect of this decision is limited to those cases pending prior to October 3, 1972 (the date 1972 PA 265 was signed into law and given immediate effect) in which the issue of waiver was raised before the trial court and properly preserved on appeal. Waivers otherwise granted prior to date of this decision and not contested upon proper preservation of the issue shall not be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We vote to reverse the decisions of the lower courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-8\">Swainson and Williams, JJ., concurred with T.

He argues that petitioner\u2019s detention and interrogation, described above, were unlawful. He contends that the police failed to follow the procedure prescribed by the Juvenile Court Act in that they failed to notify the parents of the child and the Juvenile Court itself, note 1, <em>supra; </em>that petitioner was deprived of his liberty for about a week without a determination of probable cause which would have been required in the case of an adult, see note 3, <em>supra; </em>that he was interrogated by the police in the absence of counsel or a parent, cf. <em>Harling v United States, </em>111 U.S. App. D.C. 174, 176, 295 F. 2d 161, 163, n. 12 (1961), without warning of his right to remain silent or advice as to his right to counsel, in asserted violation of the Juvenile Court Act and in violation of rights that he would have if he were an adult; and that petitioner was fingerprinted in violation of the asserted intent of the Juvenile Court Act and while unlawfully detained and that the fingerprints were unlawfully used in the District Court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The issues considered by the Court are stated as follows (p 552):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\"It is to petitioner\u2019s arguments as to the infirmity of the proceedings by which the Juvenile Court waived its otherwise exclusive jurisdiction that we address our attention. Petitioner attacks the waiver of jurisdiction on a number of statutory and constitutional grounds. He contends that the waiver is defective because no hearing was held; because no findings were made by the Juvenile Court; because the Juvenile Court stated no reasons for waiver; and because counsel was denied access to the Social Service file which presumably was considered by the Juvenile Court in determining to waive jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">From the above, it will be seen that the Policy Memorandum No. 7 of November 30, 1959 of the Juvenile Court was not in issue.

Unless criteria are formalized, a lawyer representing a juvenile cannot effectively prepare his case, the judge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>without a guide to assist him in exercising his discretion, and effective appellate review is impeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We do not agree that the absence <em>\"in the statute itself </em>of carefully defined standards,\u201d 388 Mich 75 (emphasis supplied) obliges us to hold the waiver provision unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The original opinion proceeds on the assumption that a statute which delegates discretionary power must itself contain standards to guide the exercise of the delegated power. The source of this assumption is unclear; it is perhaps attributable to the manner in which the standards requirement developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">While the principle of three separate branches of government and of separation of powers is basic, the constitution does not expressly prohibit the Legislature from delegating law-making power.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Indeed, despite the constant iteration of the non-delegation doctrine, governmental officials, administrative agencies and other authorities, including the courts, daily make and remake, apply and fail to apply rules which they, earlier or ad hoc, themselves establish that have \"the effect of law\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *3 Those rules and regulations are often the only law that counts \u2014 the law that governs disposition of the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Administrative Code of this state, including the periodic supplements, takes half a shelf.

Faced with the expanding discretionary power of governmental officials and agencies, the judiciary sought to place restraints on the exercise of delegated power. The judges writing at the time thought it persuasive to justify their restrictions on agency power as measures designed to preserve legislative power \u2014 rather than to control it \u2014 and, specifically, to explain the standards requirement as an elaboration of another judicially-created doctrine, the nondelegation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Logically, if the purpose of the standards requirement was preservation of legislative power, the Legislature must itself prescribe the standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The source of the standards requirement was not, however, an abstract concern with delegation of law-making power. It was rather the need to curb delegations made without adequate safeguards protecting against misuse of discretionary decision-making power. The nondelegation doctrine was just one of the handles, like procedural due process and judicial review, the courts grasped to restrain the agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Just as the nondelegation doctrine as an absolute limitation on the power of the Legislature to delegate law-making power failed to prevent the delegation in fact of discretionary law-making power, so, too, the standards requirement has failed effectively to control either the delegation of discretionary law-making power or agency exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The courts have sustained delegations of lawmaking power although no standard has been expressed or under standards so general they provide no meaningful protection against the hazards lurking in delegated law-making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">It clearly appears, upon examining one encyclopedia, that the standards \"requirement\u201d is a goal or test and not truly a requirement invariably enforced. While it is there stated that \"the legislative authority must declare the policy or purpose of the law and, as a general rule, must also fix the legal principles which are to control in given cases by setting up standards or guides to indicate the extent, and prescribe the limits, of the discretion which may be exercised\u201d (1 Am Jur 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 113, pp 913-914), a few pages later it is acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\"[H]oldings of particular cases may range from a decision that the general rule is inapplicable because of the nature of the power involved, or the nature of the right involved, or that no specific standard is required because of the impracticability of providing one, or the public necessity of vesting the discretion conferred, or because only a privilege and not a property right is involved.\u201d 1 Am Jur 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 115, p 918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The text swings back, and this goes to the heart of the dispositive issue, to state that the standard governing the authority and discretion \"must be found in the law itself, since only the legislature can create such standards and limits\u201d. 1 Am Jur 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 116, p 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">But the very next sentence states with equal absoluteness, in language this Court quoted with approval in <em>Pleasant Ridge v Governor, </em>382 Mich 225, 247; 169 NW2d 625 (1969), in rejecting the contention \"that necessary standards must be set up in the act by which an administrative tribunal is appointed and directed to act\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\"><em>\u2019\u2019The standard which is to guide the discretion of administrative agencies need not in all instances be expressly stated in the statute or ordinance. </em>It is not always necessary to prescribe a specific rule of action to govern the exercise of powers conferred, particularly where a standard is implied in the statute or ordinance conferring the power. The standard to guide a particular act which in terms is not limited by any specific standard may be found within the framework of the statute under which the act is to be performed, or may inhere in its subject matter or purpose, and a clearly defined field of action may implicitly contain the criteria which must govern the action. Also, a standard may be found in other pertinent legislation, or in executive order, or in the field of law governing the operation of the agency.\u201d 1 Am Jur 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 116, pp 919-920.

Its purpose should no longer be either to prevent delegation of legislative power or to require meaningful statutory standards; its purpose should be the much deeper one of protecting against unnecessary and uncontrolled discretionary power. <em>The focus should no longer be exclusively on standards; it should be on the totality of protection against arbitrariness, including both safeguards and standards. The key should no longer be statutory words; it should be the protections the administrators in fact provide, irrespective of what the statutes say or fail to say. \u201d </em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Supp), \u00a7 2.00, pp 40-41. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The need to transform the failing standards requirement into a more effective safeguard against discriminatory exercise of delegated discretionary power has been judicially acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\"It is now apparent that the requirement of expressed standards has, in most instances, been little more than a judicial fetish for legislative language, the recitation of which provides no additional safeguards to persons affected by the exercise of the delegated author- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">\"As pointed out in Davis on Administrative Law, the important consideration is not whether the statute delegating the power expresses <em>standards, </em>but whether the procedure established for the exercise of the power furnishes adequate <em>safeguards </em>to those who are affected by the administrative action.\u201d (Emphasis by the Court.) <em>Warren v Marion County, </em>222 Or 307, 314; 353 P2d 257, 261 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Similarly, see <em>Butler v United Cerebral Palsy of Northern Kentucky, Inc, </em>352 SW2d 203 (Ky App, 1961); <em>Elk Run Telephone Co v General Telephone Co of Iowa, </em>160 NW2d 311 (Iowa, 1968); <em>Esso Standard Oil Co v Holderman, </em>75 NJ Super 455; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>183 A2d 454 (1962), <em>aff'd </em>39 NJ 355; 188 A2d 599 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Davis maintains that because the Legislature often is unable or unwilling to supply meaningful standards a judicial requirement of statutory standards is often impractical. Yet with the right kind of judicial prodding administrators can be expected to produce them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\"Legislative bodies should clarify their purposes to the extent they are able and willing to do so, but when they choose to delegate without standards, the courts should uphold the delegation whenever the needed standards to guide particular determinations have been supplied through administrative rules or policy statement.\u201d Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Supp), \u00a7 2.00-5, p 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">A recognition that much of the law is created by those who administer it, coupled with a requirement that administrators (judicial as well as nonjudicial) articulate in reasoned statements (rule making) and opinions the bases of their determinations, will provide more effective protections against arbitrary and discriminatory exercise of discretionary power than ritualistic incantations by the decision-maker that he has \"carefully considered\u201d the statutory criteria (which he may then enumerate) and has reached one conclusion or another, without any explanation of the process by which he reached that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Now that it is clear both that the Legislature must be allowed to delegate law-making power and that delegations may be sustained although unaccompanied by standards, or under statements of purported standards so general that they do not confine but, rather, stretch the discretion exercisable to the outer limits of reasonable, and, therefore, of constitutional exercise of power, \u2014 now that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>it is recognized that the purpose is the \"deeper one of protecting against unnecessary and uncontrolled discretionary power\u201d, and that the focus should be \"on the totality of protections against arbitrariness, including both safeguards and standards\u201d, it would be stultifying to insist that the absence of standards in the statute itself is necessarily fatal.'</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Recognizing the difficulty in formulating any \"true test\u201d for determining whether a particular delegation will be sustained, that courts ultimately make a pragmatic analysis of whether the consequences of the delegation are so undesirable as to require judicial intervention, and that it is not possible to articulate or enumerate all the factors that appear to motivate decision, Professor Cooper identified a number of factors which appear to favor sustaining a particular delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">He wrote: \"If a seemingly vague standard is susceptible of definition by reference to well-established legal concepts, it will usually be sustained.\u201d Similarly, in areas where the delegation of broad discretionary powers is supported \"by long tradition,\u201d delegations cast in terms that leave wide discretion are often upheld, 1 Cooper, State Administrative Law, pp 74-76. He added that where judicial review is available to correct abuses, especially where the scope of review is not unduly limited, delegations of broad discretionary power have been sustained. 1 Cooper, State Administrative Law, p 81. There are still other factors which favor sustaining a particular delegation but they need not presently be considered as the factors already mentioned plainly support the delegation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The Michigan statutory provision authorizing a probate judge to waive juvenile court jurisdiction to a court of general criminal jurisdiction was first enacted 50 years ago, and has been carried forward to the present without pertinent substantive change.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">During the years that intervened before this case arose, many requests for waiver of jurisdiction were considered by the probate judges of this state. Out of their decisions criteria developed for the exercise of this power. Those criteria, like the rules of the common law, were handed down from one judge to another. In this manner the criteria so developed came to be law. This is the process by which the common law (and indeed a great amount of statutory law, so much of which is assimilative of the common law) was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">An order waiving juvenile jurisdiction was and, after the 1970 amendments governing appeals of orders of the probate court, continues to be appeal-able as of right to the circuit court. MCLA 712A.22; MSA 27.3178(598.22). Even before trial, the Court of Appeals and this Court may grant leave to appeal a decision of the reviewing circuit court \u2014 as was done in this very case \u2014 if it appears that further appellate review is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In <em>Kent v Dulles, 357 </em>US 116; 78 S Ct 1113; 2 L Ed 2d 1204 (1958), the United States Supreme Court, while stating that the discretionary power delegated to the Secretary of State to grant and issue passports must be guided by adequate standards, permitted the delegation although a standard was not stated in the statute itself. The Court reached this result by treating as the standard an <em>administrative </em>policy of refusing to issue a passport only if there was a question concerning the applicant\u2019s citizenship or allegiance to the United States or if the applicant was participating in criminal or unlawful conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ****6</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">This precedent aptly fits the case before us. Over 45 years of judicial experience in the application of the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction provision preceded the waiver decision in this case.

It should not be remitted to assumptions.

Whether he reached the right conclusion in waiving jurisdiction of Fields need not now be considered, as the sole issue presented on appeal to the circuit court, the Court of Appeals and our Court concerns the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">While the courts have refused to allow Legislatures to impose nonjudicial functions on them,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there is little support for the proposition that a legislative act which confers power on a <em>court </em>is constitutionally deficient because it lacks standards to guide the court in discharging its judicial duty. The standards test is a judicial safeguard against the action of administrative officials and agencies, not against judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Discretion conferred \"in the legal sense of that term\u201d <em>(Yick Wo v Hopkins, </em>118 US 356, 366; 6 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Ct 1064; 30 L Ed 220 [1886] [see fn 4]) is discretion guided by a standard that represents the very antithesis of arbitrary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">This Court has upheld a statute which authorized the disconnection of land from cities or villages although a circuit judge might \"in his discretion\u201d deny the disconnecting petition if because of sewer, sidewalks, or other public improvements it would be \"inequitable\u201d to grant the petition. <em>Tribbett v Village of Marcellus, </em>294 Mich 607, 615; 293 NW 872 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">More recently this Court upheld an amendment to a garnishment statute authorizing the court to discontinue \"for good cause shown\u201d the proceedings against the garnishee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\"Judicial discretion upon good cause shown is a standard in itself sufficient to satisfy all constitutional requirements.

They require of the judges the compromise that they think in accord with the general purposes of the measure as the community would understand it.

If we hold that a statute conferring on a judge discretionary power is necessarily invalid if guiding standards are not contained in the statute itself, it would necessarily foreshadow holding unconstitutional important provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Large segments of other statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>e.g., </em>the Revised Judicature Act and the Probate Code, would similarly fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Especially pertinent is the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act which permits a court to \"elect\u201d to consider and assign to the status of a youthful trainee a youth who commits a criminal offense between his 17th and 20th birthdays or a youth waived to the court by the juvenile court. MCLA 762.11, 762.15; MSA 28.853(11), 28.853(15). Many persons, by reason of the Holmes Act and the exercise of trial judge discretion,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> have avoided criminal prosecution. If the Holmes Act were held to be unconstitutional because express standards are not stated, this beneficial diversion from the formal criminal process might come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The Legislature might not respond to a decision declaring the Holmes Act unconstitutional. If it were to add standards,' little would be added to what is already known and we could ourselves attend to. We know the likely standards: consider the nature of the offense, the history of the offender, the likelihood of his responding favorably, and the like, standards very much like the criteria, now formalized in the court rule and statute, developed by probate judges for deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to waive juvenile court jurisdiction to a court of general criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The failure of the Legislature to promulgate standards does not gainsay the desirability of requiring guidelines for the exercise of discretionary power. But, surely, we would not hold unconstitutional the Holmes Act, the indeterminate sentence statute, or the other statutory provisions mentioned (see fn 16) because of the absence of standards in the statute itself. The solution is to formalize sound criteria to govern in future cases now that the need and desirability of structuring the exercise of judicial discretion has been recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The prosecutor has a broad, totally unstructured discretion in charging that is rarely challenged and, with narrow exceptions, not subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The police also exercise an undefined but very real discretion in charging, releasing without charge many offenders, particularly youthful offenders.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Two men are arrested for engaging in precisely the same criminal conduct. One may be charged and the other released without charge. The legislative proliferation of the common-law crimes often means that criminal conduct constitutes more than one crime; this generally gives the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>a choice of charges to lodge against an offender. Persons who engage in the same criminal conduct may be charged with committing different offenses \u2014the possible penalties they face frequently depend on the charge brought by the prosecutor and not on the antisocial conduct in which they engage. The judiciary has declined invitations to control this enormous discretion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The powers of the prosecutor are not constitutionally established. His duties and powers are those \"provided by law\u201d. Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In the context of the prosecutor\u2019s almost unlimited discretion in charging, a power delegated to him by the Legislature, power which the Legislature manifestly could structure by more carefully defining the various penal offenses, power exercised without any of the safeguards that accompany the judicial process, it simply makes no sense to hold that an adjudication by a probate judge, guided by fundamentally the same highly generalized multichoice standards now formalized by court rule and statute, was defective because the Legislature was unaware that its imprimatur should be added to the judicially-developed standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In contrast with the prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge Fields, the probate judge\u2019s decision to waive jurisdiction of Fields followed a judicial hearing after notice, Fields was represented by counsel, the proceedings were stenographically transcribed, the judge stated the standards by which he felt bound in reaching his decision, he explained the reasons for his decision, and there was an opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>judicial review of the waiver decision in the appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">XII</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Standards \u2014 the standards added to the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction provision by the Legislature in response to our original opinion \u2014 vjill not eliminate errors in human judgment and in decision making. Standards cannot prevent the arbitrary exercise of power and unjustified discrimination in its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">While the standards promulgated by this Court and subsequently enacted by the Legislature are a useful guide for the judicial decision maker, there were few cases in which probate judges were asked to waive jurisdiction before formal standards were promulgated, and still fewer in which waiver orders were entered, where waiver could not have been sustained under the newly-promulgated standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The primary safeguards against abuse of discretion by agencies and judges alike \u2014 which is at the heart of the objections stated in the originally filed opinion, not delegation as such \u2014 are the rights to an evidentiary hearing after proper notice, to representation by counsel and to judicial review upon a transcribed record of the judge\u2019s decision elucidated with a statement of facts found and reasons for decision. These safeguards attended the juvenile waiver hearing in this case and have generally been observed in most probate jurisdictions in this state even before <em>Kent; </em>they are now formalized in the Juvenile Court Rules of 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The means of protecting juveniles who are improvidently waived to a court of general criminal jurisdiction is appellate intervention. We can pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tect against unjustified discrimination in the exercise of the waiver power by encouraging the circuit courts and the Court of Appeals to exercise, and by ourselves exercising, thoughtful review on appeals from orders waiving jurisdiction. This means reading transcripts, weighing the testimony, scrutinizing the reasons advanced for ordering and sustaining the waiver, and, where unconvinced, unhesitating intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-6\">T. G. Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> Earlier in the opinion the Court, stressing the importance of standards as a safeguard against unjustified discrimination, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\"Absent carefully defined standards <em>in the statute itself </em>which would justify such disparity of treatment, there is <em>no way </em>by which it can be determined what standard a probate judge should apply in a waiver proceeding. He might use the standards used by Judge O\u2019Brien. He might use the standard contended for by the prosecutor\u2014 'the child\u2019s welfare and the best interest of the state.\u2019 This standard is so vague and subject to so many possible interpretations as to be no standard at all. He might formulate his own standard for review by the appellate courts of this state on a case-by-case basis. He might apply the standards set forth in JCR 1969, 11.\u201d 388 Mich 75-76 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">There is, however, a way the controlling standard can be \"determined\u201d even though no standard is explicitly stated in the statute itself \u2014 the way charted before the original opinion in <em>Fields: </em>adoption of a court rule, or the filing of a judicial opinion articulating a rule of law which henceforth controls.

Duration of an interval of time, if any, shall be discretionary with the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">\"(a) <em>Phase 1: Showing of Probable Cause: </em>The court shall first determine if there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed an offense which, if committed by an adult, would be a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">\u2022 \"(b) <em>Phase 2: Criteria for Waiver: </em>Upon a showing of probable cause, the court shall proceed to conduct a full investigation to determine whether or not the interests of the child and the public would best be served by granting a waiver of jurisdiction to the criminal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">\"In making such determination, the following criteria shall be considered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">\"(1) The prior record and character of the child, his physical and mental maturity, and his pattern of living;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-17\">\"(2) The seriousness of the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-18\">\"(3) Even though less serious, if the offense is part of a repetitive pattern of offenses which would lead to a determination that the child may be beyond rehabilitation under the regular statutory juvenile procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\"(4) The relative suitability of programs and facilities available to the juvenile and criminal courts for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\"(5) Where it is found to be in the best interests of the public welfare and for the protection of the public security, generally, that said juvenile be required to stand trial as an adult offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Following our original decision in this case, the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction provision quoted in the opening paragraphs of this opinion was amended to add almost verbatim the text of Juvenile Court Rule 11. <em>See </em>1972 PA 265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> <em>J W Hampton, Jr, &amp; Co v United States, </em>276 US 394, 409; 48 S Ct 348, 352; 72 L Ed 624, 630 (1928).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> Although the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that the District of Columbia Juvenile Court Act \"does not state standards to govern the juvenile court\u2019s decision as to waiver\u201d <em>(Kent </em>v <em>United States, supra, </em>p 547), the absence of standards in the act itself was not a focal point of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The Supreme Court added as an appendix to the <em>Kent </em>opinion a policy memorandum, prepared by the judge of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia, which read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\"The statute sets forth no specific standards for the exercise of this important discretionary act, but leaves the formulation of such criteria to the [Juvenile] Judge. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">\"An offense falling within the statutory limitations (set forth above) will be waived if it has prosecutive merit and if it is heinous or of an aggravated character, or \u2014 even though less serious \u2014 if it represents a pattern of repeated offenses which indicate that the juvenile may be beyond rehabilitation under Juvenile Court procedures, or if the public needs the protection afforded by such action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">\"The determinative factors which will be considered * * * are the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">\"1.

There, the statute very much like ours, simply provided: \"The judge may, after full investigation, waive jurisdiction.\u201d The Court analogized to the lack of formalized criteria for the exercise of the sentencing power and stated that a person accused under a criminal statute \"does not know with precision the liability to which he will be subjected\u201d. Two accused persons, both convicted of the same or similar offenses, may be treated differently; one sentenced to an extended prison term and the other sent home on probation. This, said the Court, \"is the essence of modern penology. There are no precisely formulated criteria for the difference in results. It is an imponderable, a true exercise of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In <em>People v Shipp, </em>59 Cal 2d 845, 852-853; 382 P2d 577, 581-582; 31 Cal Rptr 457, 461-462 (1963), the California Supreme Court ruled that even though its statute contained \"no express standards, the trial judge must exercise his discretion reasonably and in furtherance of justice\u201d, and that he was impliedly required to exercise his discretion \"to serve the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\"> \"Jurisdiction ordinarily is waived when (1) the defendant has acquired such a degree of emotional or mental maturity that he is not receptive to rehabilitative programs designed for children; (2) although the defendant is immature, his disturbance has eluded exhaustive prior efforts at correction through existing juvenile programs; or (3) the defendant is immature and might be treated, but the nature of his difficulty is likely to render him dangerous to the public, if released at age twenty-one, or to disrupt the rehabilitation of other children in the program prior to his release.\u201d <em>State v Gibbs, </em>94 Idaho 908, 916; 500 P2d 209, 217 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> The decision in <em>Kent v United States, supra, was </em>not placed on constitutional grounds, but rather was reached in the exercise of the Court\u2019s supervisory power over a Federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> <em>See Local 170, TWU v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>322 Mich 332, 346-347; 34 NW2d 71 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> As the question before us is one of criminal procedure, we turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>to the Code of Criminal Procedure for illustrations.
