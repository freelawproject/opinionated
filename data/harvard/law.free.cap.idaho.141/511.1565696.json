We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-26\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b544-27\">This case involves two children, the Does\u2019 son and daughter, with divergent problems and needs. The son is the elder, having been born on December 16,1997. He has difficulties with speech and suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Reactive Attachment Disorder. He was taken into state custody on December 8, 2000, and has remained in the custody of the state since that date. The daughter is significantly delayed, both physically and mentally. She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>born on May 30, 1999, and remained in the physical custody of the Does until December 4, 2001, at which time she was taken into state care.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The son was initially removed from the Does\u2019 home based on a report that he had been disciplined with an electric flyswatter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 8, 2001, the Does stipulated that he had been threatened with the flyswatter, that their home was dirty and unsanitary, and that the home lacked adequate plumbing and heat. The Does further stipulated that the son had, at some point, had a severely bruised eye and that he had a burned abdomen from coming into contact with another adult\u2019s cigarette. Based upon this initial stipulation, the son was placed in foster care. The daughter was removed from the home a year later, when the Department of Health and Welfare (Department) filed an Amended Petition Under Child Protection Act, based upon several reports of poor parenting made by various service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">A trial was held in October of 2002. The magistrate court determined that the Does had neglected their children as defined under Idaho law and that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the Does\u2019 parental rights. An order terminating the Does\u2019 parental rights was entered on January 17, 2003. The Does appealed to the district court, which affirmed the decision of the magistrate court. The Does timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The Idaho Court of Appeals succinctly summarized the standards of evidence and review applied by this Court in termination cases, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">It is well settled that, in a proceeding to terminate a parent-child relationship, the due process clause mandates that the grounds for termination must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); <em>Matter of Aragon, </em>120 Idaho 606, 608, 818 P.2d 310, 312 (1991). <em>See also, </em>I.C. \u00a7 16-2009. When the trial court finds that the grounds as defined by statute, which are alleged for termination, are established by clear and convincing evidence, those findings will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In Interest of Crum, </em>111 Idaho 407, 725 P.2d 112 (1986). Clear error, in turn, will not be deemed to exist where the findings are supported by substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence. <em>Id. \u201cIt is for the </em>trial court to determine whether clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of parental rights. Our task on this appeal is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding ... is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 725 P.2d at 114. Furthermore, \u201cin reviewing such findings, this Court will indulge all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment\u201d when reviewing an order that parental rights be terminated. <em>Aragon, </em>at 608, 818 P.2d at 312.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-14\"><em>In Interest of Baby Doe, </em>130 Idaho 47, 53, 936 P.2d 690, 696 (Ct.App.1997). When reviewing the decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity, the Supreme Court reviews the magistrate judges decision independently of, but with due regard for, the district courts intermediate appellate decision. <em>Swanson v. Swanson, </em>134 Idaho 512, 515, 5 P.3d 973, 976 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">A. The Magistrate Judge Did Not Err When He Held The Children At Issue Were Neglected Under Idaho Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">Courts have the authority to terminate parental rights when a parent has neglected his or her child. Neglect is defined under Idaho law as \u201ca situation in which the child lacks parental care necessary for health, morals and well-being.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(b). The magistrate court found that the Does had neglected their children, and this finding was affirmed by the district court. The Does assert the magistrate court\u2019s finding of neglect is not supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and competent evidence for a number of reasons. They state in their opening brief that, \u201cThe magistrate relied in his finding of neglect primarily on the status of the living arrangements in Ketchum, [John Doe\u2019s] failure to find employment or obtain income assistance, Ms. .Traughber\u2019s observations, and the incident regarding [the daughter\u2019s] fall from a slide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Although the Does admitted their home environment in Ketchum was unsatisfactory, they assert they had taken steps to improve it. They point out they had moved to a \u201crelatively clean home in Arco with plumbing and heat and food prior to [the daughter\u2019s] removal,\u201d and claim that this was overlooked in the ruling. The judge did mention the fact that when the son was removed from the home in Ketchum, the home lacked adequate plumbing, a safe heating system and was not a safe or healthy environment for either child. He also stated that the Does failed to remedy any of these issues for several winter months, even though the daughter continued to live with them. The court responded to the Does\u2019 argument that they were in a rental property and had little control over these issues by stating that no evidence was presented to indicate the Does were prevented from moving out of the \u201cless than marginal living .quarters.\u201d However, as the district judge noted, the magistrate judge did address the fact that the Does eventually moved out of Ketchum when he stated the Does had moved \u201cout of Blaine County and into a better physical living environment, i.e., one that has a reliable heat source, unbroken windows, and adequate plumbing.\u201d Therefore, the Does\u2019 argument that their move was not taken into consideration is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Does assert the court relied heavily on the Does\u2019 failure to have financial stability. However, they do not argue that the judge\u2019s findings in this regard were not based on substantial and competent evidence, nor do they argue there is conflicting evidence regarding this issue. As noted by the court, Jane Doe had worked briefly at a variety of low-paying jobs and had reapplied for and was receiving SSI benefits in the amount of $538 per month for an undisclosed disability. John Doe had not worked in over six years when the trial took place, and there was no indication that he had any source of income. John Doe claimed that he suffers from various health problems and believed himself to be disabled. There is evidence in the record to substantiate some of his contentions; however, there was no indication that he followed through with applications for disability benefits. In fact, there is no evidence that he has had any source of income attributable to him since the events of this case began in late 2000. Further, neither of the Does has contributed any financial support for their children since they were taken into custody. The judge noted that he was particularly concerned that the Does reported that on more than one occasion they did not have any food in the house while their daughter was in their custody, though they continued to have internet service. Also, the Does had at one point obtained food stamps but did not follow through to maintain their eligibility to continue receiving such assistance. In his conclusion, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">The issue here is not one of poverty. There are plenty of people with inadequate incomes who are able to manage meager resources so as to take care of their children\u2019s needs. [John Doe] seems unwilling or unable to either find employment or to jump through the bureaucratic hoops required to qualify for federal disability assistance. Parents are not required to have any particular standard of living but are required to obtain sufficient resources with which to support themselves and their children. The [Does] have demonstrated a persistent pattern of being unable to do so. Worse, they have a persistent pattern of failing even to take advantage of assistance programs that may so provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The Does next argue the court relied too heavily on the observations of Ms. Pat Traughber, a contract provider for the Department. Ms. Traughber created a list of her concerns in bullet form, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u2022 Absence of child centered parenting related to a lack of parental motivation and/or ability to prioritize the needs of the children over their own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u2022 Chronic and chaotic lifestyle, with the inability to demonstrate and maintain a stable living environment to meet the children\u2019s basic needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u2022A lack of motivation or desire to take responsibility for their own actions and responsibilities as parents, while blaming others (including the child) for their circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u2022 Role reversal and unrealistic expectations of children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u2022 Perception that they as adults have been victimized rather than the child. This raises concerns about their ability to protect them child from harm either through direct participation or from victimization by others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u2022 Lack of recognition of the problems that brought the children to the attention of Child Protection Services and an unwillingness to make changes necessary to allow reunification to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u2022 Lack of urgency (as demonstrated by their behavior, not what they verbalize) to have the child returned to their care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u2022 Lack of knowledge related to basic day-to-day care, parenting and behavior management coupled with the unwillingness or inability to utilize what they have been taught to improve the quality of their children\u2019s life experiences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u25a0 Lack of empathy and indiffei\u2019ence to child\u2019s experiences, coupled with the lack of ability to assess risk and safety based on the child\u2019s age and development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">\u2022 The absence of a successful history in the parent\u2019s ability to provide their own needs for food, shelter, and medical care without heavy reliance on State and Federal agencies and support programs or extended family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u2022 Parents have the intellectual ability to function at a much higher level than is being demonstrated in their day to day lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u2022 Unpredictability of mood and behavior in the parental role of both [Does].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">\u2022 Most importantly, a lack of emotional connection between parent and child, especially with regard to [mother] and [son].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">In considering the testimony of Ms. Traughber and other Department witnesses, the judge expressed some criticism and concern. He observed that Ms. Traughber\u2019s report gave the appearance of being \u201cthe opening bell of a termination action.\u201d The judge stated that the involvement of the Family Investment Team, a group which contracts with the Department to provide behavior modification training with respect to parenting techniques, \u201cappeared geared at least as much toward gathering evidence for a termination case as it represented a genuine effort to employ any behavior modification techniques which had any likelihood of success.\u201d Further, he expressed dismay that \u201cthe more helpless [daughter] was not removed from the very same home environment that was considered too hazardous for [the son] to live in December of 2000.\u201d However, despite his expressed concerns, the judge found there was no evidence that contradicted the findings of Ms. Traughber and adopted her list of concerns as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The Does argue that Ms. Traughber\u2019s assessment is inadequate because it was conducted after spending only four and one-half hours with the Does. However, after a thorough review of the record, this Court finds itself in agreement with the following statement by the district judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">Some things may be so open and apparent that only one with a tentative grasp of the obvious would require additional time and resources to come to the same conclusion. Furthermore, regarding the findings of fact, it is the trial judge who is charged with determining the credibility of the witnesses, not the Court on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">Finally, the Does take issue with the court\u2019s consideration of an incident where the daughter was injured after falling off a slide. They assert that their description of the incident, i.e. that they were both behind and in front of the daughter when she fell, cannot be contradicted. It appears the court accepted this description, as indicated by the following statement: \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that the [Does] deliberately caused [the daughter] to fall from the slide. The court is certain they were attempting to engage in a playtime activity with their daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ter when she fell on her head from a height of ten feet.\u201d While the court found the Does did not cause the injury to their daughter, it stated the incident confirmed Ms. Traughber\u2019s concerns that there was a serious problem with the Does\u2019 \u201cjudgment, insight, supervision or all three\u201d, given the daughter\u2019s physical limitations and the choice of an appropriate activity. The court noted that the daughter\u2019s development of motor skills was seriously delayed, that she was unsteady, and that she suffered frequent falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">There was no evidence to suggest that' the daughter\u2019s disabilities were a result of the Does\u2019 neglect. However, the court found the Does\u2019 lack of empathy and insight as to her limitations were not conducive to her health or well being. With regard to the son, the court noted that the testimony and report of Dr. Richard Smith, a psychologist who testified for the Department, indicated the son\u2019s Reactive Attachment Disorder was \u201calmost certainly\u201d caused by the Does\u2019 \u201cunstable home life coupled with their lack of engagement with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The facts of this case are extensively set forth in a 48-page decision issued by the magistrate judge. His articulate and in-depth decision demonstrates a thoughtful evaluation of all of the evidence. It is clear that the judge carefully reviewed and considered the evidence submitted in support of the Does and that he critically evaluated the actions and evidence of the Department. This Court finds that there is substantial and competent evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">B. The Magistrate Judge Did Not Err When He Held That It Was In The Best Interests Of The Children To Terminate The Parental Rights Of The Does.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">When a judge finds a statutory ground, such as neglect, he or she must then decide if termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the children. <em>Doe v. State of Idaho, Department of Health and Welfare, </em>123 Idaho 502, 849 P.2d 963 (Ct.App.1993). Here, the court properly observed that \u201cthe most important thing that can be done for both [the daughter] and [the son] is to provide them with a stable and nurturing home environment.\u201d He considered whether this goal would be best served by giving the Does another chance or by terminating their parental rights. He observed, further, \u201cThe [Does\u2019] constellation of personality disorders explains to a large extent how they developed such a poor relationship with the Department. Nonetheless, it is also clear that same constellation makes it difficult if not impossible for them to make substantial changes in their lives so as to provide a safe and stable home for the children.\u201d He noted that, although the Does had made some modest improvements, they had not demonstrated an ability to provide the children with the type of home environment they needed in order to have a chance to develop.</p>\n<p id=\"AIQ\">The Does assert that they had made improvements by moving into a new home and by virtue of the fact that Mr. Gordon Lee Rhine had become the Does\u2019 counselor and thought the children could be returned to the Does as long as they followed his case plan. The judge addressed this assertion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">[T]he court had misgivings about Mr. Rhine\u2019s ability to address the [Does\u2019] complete lack of parenting skills as related to the specific needs of their children in the context of a twelve-week course entitled \u201cLove and Logic\u201d. Specifically, the court was concerned that a course which emphasizes \u201cnatural consequences\u201d as the appropriate disciplinary technique for children might fit a bit too neatly into the laissezfaire parenting style already exhibited by the [Does]. The court was concerned that the [Does] would hear only the part of the course that said children should suffer the natural consequences of their actions as the primary disciplinary technique and would miss the part regarding supervision and protection. Standing by and watching [the daughter] nearly pull a hot coffee pot off a countertop and onto herself came to mind as an example of a natural consequence. The court believes that these parents\u2019 lack of insight into the needs of them children would require much more than the twelve-week course as described by Mr. Rhine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Furthermore, the court considered testimony that the children were in a stable foster home and their special needs were being addressed. The son is being treated for ADHD, is receiving speech therapy and is constantly supervised. The daughter has made modest progress with her speech, is walking better, her night terrors have abated though not ended entirely, and she has fewer staring incidents. Evidence of improvement in the well-being of children while living apart from their parents is a factor appropriate to consider in determining what will serve them best interests. <em>Hofmeister v. Bauer, </em>110 Idaho 960, 966, 719 P.2d 1220, 1226 (Ct.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">We find there is substantial and competent, albeit conflicting, evidence to affirm the finding of the magistrate court that it is in the best interests of the children to terminate the parental rights of the Does.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This Court affirms the order of the magistrate court terminating the parent-child relationship between the Does and their two children.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-8\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER, Justices TROUT and BURDICK, and Justice WALTERS, Pro Tern concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">.
