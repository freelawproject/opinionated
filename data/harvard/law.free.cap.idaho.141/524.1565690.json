Doe and her parents sued Albertson\u2019s alleging various tort claims for failing to protect Doe from Repp\u2019s sexual advances. On motion for summary judgment the district court found in Albertson\u2019s favor, holding Doe\u2019s and her parents\u2019 claims barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Idaho Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Doe and her parents (collectively referred to as Appellants) appealed. We reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Both Doe and Repp began working for Albertson\u2019s Store No. 161 in July 1999. Doe, a minor, worked as a courtesy clerk (grocery bagger). Repp, who was 38 years old, was employed as an assistant front end manager. Front end managers supervise courtesy clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">Beginning in September 1999, Repp started to show favoritism to Doe. He would invite Doe into areas prohibited to courtesy clerks, walk Doe to her car, allow Doe extended breaks, and allow her to act as a cashier, although company policy required that cashiers be 18 years old. In November 1999, Repp made sexual advances to Doe. During November the two kissed, fondled each other, and engaged in oral sex while on duty at Albertson\u2019s. The two attempted to have sexual intercourse while at the store, but, because it was too physically painful for Doe, they stopped. By November some employees knew, while others simply questioned the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">On December 4, 1999, store Director Jim Johnson began an investigation. He spoke separately to Doe and Repp. Both Doe and Repp denied the relationship. Johnson suspended Repp pending further investigation. After the investigation, Johnson concluded Repp and Doe had not been involved in a sexual relationship. Nevertheless, as a result of Repp\u2019s inappropriate behavior with Doe, on December 9, 1999, Albertson\u2019s suspended Repp for six days, demoted him to the position of checker, and transferred him to a different Albertson\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">After his transfer, Repp continued to communicate with Doe. With Albertson\u2019s continuing the investigation, he instructed Doe to deny everything. On or about December 17, Repp asked Doe to meet him at the Albert-son\u2019s where he worked. She did so, and the two then left Albertson\u2019s premises driving to Hillside Park where they engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">Doe\u2019s mother discovered information that lead her to believe Doe and Repp were having a romantic relationship. Doe\u2019s mother notified Albertson\u2019s on January 25, 2000. Two days later, Albertson\u2019s re-interviewed Repp. This time Repp admitted he and Doe were involved in a romantic relationship. Albertson\u2019s terminated Repp\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">Subsequently, Repp pleaded guilty to the crime of statutory rape in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(1) and was sentenced on October 19, 2000. Repp served one year in jail and one year on work release, and is serving ten years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>On May 11, 2001, Doe and her parents filed a complaint against Repp and Albert-son\u2019s alleging negligence, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, negligent retention, and negligent training. Albert-son\u2019s denied responsibility, asserting several defenses including that the Idaho\u2019s Worker\u2019s Compensation Law precluded recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Albertson\u2019s moved for summary judgment. The district court originally denied summary judgment. The court found Doe\u2019s alleged injury, a broken hymen, met the definition of injury provided by I.C. \u00a7 72-102(17)(c). Furthermore, the alleged injury qualified as an \u201caccident\u201d as the term is defined in I.C. \u00a7 72 \u2014 102(17)(b). The district court also presumed the injury arose out of and in the course of employment. The district court then analyzed whether the exception provided in I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3) applied to circumvent the worker\u2019s compensation law. The district court determined that when viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Doe, there was enough evidence presented to deny summary judgment because there was an issue whether or not Albertson\u2019s impliedly authorized Repp\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Albertson\u2019s moved for reconsideration, presenting additional briefing to the district court on whether Albertson\u2019s impliedly authorized Repp\u2019s behavior. On reconsideration the district court analyzed the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3) in accordance with agency law and principles. The district court then granted summary judgment in Albertson\u2019s favor, finding the exceptions contained in I.C. \u00a7 72-209 inapplicable and that the worker\u2019s compensation law precluded the suit against Albertson\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Doe and her parents moved for reconsideration. The district court denied the motion, issued a Rule 54(b) certificate, and awarded $16,539.38 in costs to Albertson\u2019s. Doe and her parents timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">This Courts review of a district courts ruling on motion for summary judgment is the same as that required of the trial court when ruling on the motion. <em>Sun Valley v. Rosholt, Robertson &amp; Tucker, </em>133 Idaho 1, 3, 981 P.2d 236, 238 (1999). On appeal, we exercise free review in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Miller v. Simonson, </em>140 Idaho 287, 289, 92 P.3d 537, 539 (2004). The law is well established in Idaho that on a motion for summary judgment the trial court must determine whether the pleadings, depositions, and admissions, together with affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Ada County v. Fuhrman, </em>140 Idaho 230, 232, 91 P.3d 1134, 1136 (2004). We liberally construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Anderson v. Glenn, </em>139 Idaho 799, 801, 87 P.3d 286, 288 (2003). Because our review is de novo, providing the summary judgment transcript that contained the parties\u2019 arguments is not necessary for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">I. THE WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION LAW ABOLISHES ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYER FOR PHYSICAL INJURIES CAUSED BY AN ACCIDENT ARISING OUT OF AND IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Appellants argue the district court erred in holding that the worker\u2019s compensation law barred the Appellants\u2019 complaint. Appellants contend this is in error because Doe\u2019s injuries were not compensable under worker\u2019s compensation and therefore the tort action may be maintained in district court against Albertson\u2019s. Albertson\u2019s disagrees and argues that the only remedy available to an employee is via the worker\u2019s compensation law. Albertson\u2019s asserts that the declaration of police power section and the exclusive remedy provision of the worker\u2019s compensation law specifically abolished all claims against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">In 1917, our legislature enacted the state\u2019s first worker\u2019s compensation laws. 1917 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 81; <em>Gifford v. Nottingham, </em>68 Idaho 330, 340, 193 P.2d 831, 837 (1948) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(Holden, J., dissenting). Because the act was originally passed as an entire complete act it should be construed and considered as a whole. <em>Arneson v. Robinson, </em>59 Idaho 223, 239, 82 P.2d 249, 255 (1938). Idaho recodified the worker\u2019s compensation law in 1971. 1971 Idaho Sess. Laws, ch. 122, p. 408; <em>Horton v. Garrett Freightlines, Inc., </em>115 Idaho 912, 916, 772 P.2d 119, 123 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The \u201cDeclaration of Police Power\u201d section of the worker\u2019s compensation law was once known as the 1917 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 81 \u00a7 1(b), later known as I.C. \u00a7 43-902, and today has been recodified as I.C. \u00a7 72-201. Today\u2019s version of the statute essentially reads as it did in 1917, except for the exclusion of three sentences<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the inclusion of occupational diseases. Idaho Code \u00a7 72-201 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">The common law system governing the remedy of workmen against employers for injuries received and occupational diseases contracted in industrial and public work is inconsistent with modern industrial conditions. The welfare of the state depends upon its industries and even more upon the welfare of its wageworkers. The state of Idaho, therefore, exercising herein its police and sovereign power, declares that all phases of the premises are withdrawn from private controversy, and sure and certain relief for injured workmen and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding or compensation, except as is otherwise provided in this act, and to that end all civil actions and civil causes of action for such personal injuries and all jurisdiction of the courts of the state over such causes are hereby abolished, except as is in this law provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Since its original enactment the worker\u2019s compensation law included an exclusiveness provision for an employee\u2019s remedy. In 1917 the section was known as the \u201cRight to Compensation Exclusive.\u201d 1917 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 81 \u00a7 6, p. 256.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This section was recodified in 1971 as I.C. \u00a7 72-211 and is now titled \u201cExclusiveness of Employee\u2019s Remedy.\u201d The section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">Subject to the provisions of section 72-223, the rights and remedies herein granted to an employee on account of an injury or occupational disease for which he is entitled to compensation under this law shall exclude all other rights and remedies of the employee, his personal representatives, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury or disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">I.C. \u00a7 72-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">Within the first few years of enactment of the worker\u2019s compensation law we began expressing in our opinions that common law actions for workers injured in the course of employment were abolished. As early as 1923, we recognized that \u201c[t]he Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is purely statutory, and is an express departure and innovation so far as the common law is concerned, explicitly doing away with common law actions previously applicable to controversies within the scope of the statute.\u201d <em>Cook v. Massey, </em>38 Idaho 264, 269-70, 220 P. 1088, 1090 (1923), <em>overruled in part by University of Utah Hosp. on Behalf of Harris v. Pence, </em>104 Idaho 172, 657 P.2d 469 (1982). \u201c[T]he legislature abolished every remedy for all injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(negligent and non-negligent) received by a workman <em>\u2018in course of his employment.'\u201d\u2019 Gifford, </em>68 Idaho at 334, 193 P.2d at 833 (emphasis added). We recognized that the Act is a \u201cspecial law providing compensation for injured employees, without reference to any question of negligence, either on the part of the employer or employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 193 P.2d at 832-33. Our early interpretation limited the abolishment of common law actions to instances where the employee\u2019s injury occurred during the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In 1940 we began explicitly questioning what causes of actions were eliminated by the enactment of the worker\u2019s compensation law and whether a person may maintain an action in district court. In <em>Lebak v. Nelson, </em>62 Idaho 96, 111, 107 P.2d 1054, 1060 (1940), we asked \u201c[w]hat common law remedy only was thereby intended to be abolished?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The statute answers: \u201cThe remedy of workmen against <em>employers </em>for injuries received in industrial and public work\u201d (italics ours). And why was the common law remedy of the worker for personal injuries against his <em>employer </em>abolished? Again the statute answers: Because \u201cthe remedy of the workman has been uncertain, slow and inadequate.\u201d The provisions of the statute are expressly confined to those occupying the relationship of employee and employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Id. </em>In 1940, a personal injury caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of any employment covered by the act was compensated only by worker\u2019s compensation and not under any common law action. I.C. \u00a7 43-1001 (1931). We specified that an injury received in an industrial accident was the common law action abolished. The <em>Lebak </em>court, however, held that \u201cthe common law action of an <em>employee against a third person </em>to recover damages for <em>personal injuries </em>sustained by reason of actionable negligence of such third party <em>was not </em>abolished____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 107 P.2d at 1061. A year later in 1941, we stated \u201cthe legislature did not mean to take from a workman his common law remedy for a negligent act of his employer, resulting in serious injury and damage to him, and give him no other remedy in lieu thereof.\u201d <em>Olson v. Union Pac. R. Co., </em>62 Idaho 423, 428, 112 P.2d 1005, 1007 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">In looking at the intent behind I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-201 and 72-211 we have said, \u201cthe legislature removed from the sphere of civil actions, all suits against an employer for damages on account of personal injury or death of an employee, where such injury or death rises out of and in the course of the employment____\u201d <em>Gifford, </em>68 Idaho at 334, 193 P.2d at 833. In 1969, this Court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Gifford, </em>recognizing that the \u201crule of law may in some cases deprive persons of remedy for damages which they had prior to the passage of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law____\u201d <em>Stample v. Idaho Power Co., </em>92 Idaho 763, 766, 450 P.2d 610, 613 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">Throughout the history of the worker\u2019s compensation law we have continued to rule that common law actions for personal injuries arising out of and in the course of employment were abolished. Until 1970, we were not asked, nor did we indicate, what causes of action might be maintained in the district court by an employee against his employer. Then in 1970, this Court heard an appeal from an employee who sued her employer in district court alleging that her cause of action was not covered by worker\u2019s compensation and therefore the action was properly brought in the district court. <em>Summers v. Western Idaho Potato Processing Co., </em>94 Idaho 1, 479 P.2d 292 (1970). This Court stated \u201cactions based upon injuries otherwise remediable by common law action, which are not covered under the Idaho Workmen\u2019s Compensation scheme, are not abrogated by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 479 P.2d at 293. The employee Summers sued in district court for damages arising out of an industrial accident. <em>Id. </em>at 1, 479 P.2d at 292. Summers had already received worker\u2019s compensation benefits for her physical injuries. <em>Id. </em>This Court held Summers suffered an industrial accident when her clothes became entangled in a machine that left her standing nude in front of her fellow employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2, 94 Idaho 1, 479 P.2d 292-93. However, if Summers was not alleging any physical injury then she had to \u201cestablish a right of recovery at common law for purely emotional trauma, negligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>caused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 479 P.2d at 293. On the other hand, if the emotional trauma was the result of a physical injury, then worker\u2019s compensation precluded her suit in district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">With <em>Summers </em>the issue was settled \u2014 causes of action not cognizable under worker\u2019s compensation may be brought in district court. Then in 1971, the legislature recodified the worker\u2019s compensation law. As stated above both the police power section and the exclusive remedy section remained part of the Act. Additionally, the legislature adopted a new provision, I.C. \u00a7 72-209, titled \u201cExclusiveness of liability of employer,\u201d which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">(1) Subject to the provisions of section 72-223, [Idaho Code] the liability of the employer under this law shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of the employer to the employee, his spouse, dependents, heirs, legal representatives or assigns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Prior to 1971 there was no similar provision, although this provision appears to be the employer\u2019s mirror image of I.C. \u00a7 72-211. Both provisions state that if an employer is liable under the worker\u2019s compensation law then all other liability is excluded. Our prior caselaw interpreting the exclusiveness of worker\u2019s compensation is unaffected by the enactment of I.C. \u00a7 72-209.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">[Wjhile section 72-209 of the Idaho Code provides that the liability of the employer under this law shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of the employer to the employee, the exclusiveness of an injured employee\u2019s remedy is not absolute. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-209(1). Circumstances may arise where an injured employee may seek redress in an Idaho forum other than the Industrial Commission where an alleged injury occurs in the course and scope of employment, but the injury is not compensable under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\"><em>Selkirk Seed Co. v. State Ins. Fund, </em>135 Idaho 434, 439, 18 P.3d 956, 961 (2001). We have continued to hold that in Idaho the exclusive remedy for an employee against his employer for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment is the worker\u2019s compensation law. <em>Baker v. Sullivan, </em>132 Idaho 746, 749, 979 P.2d 619, 622 (1999) (quoting <em>Yeend v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>104 Idaho 333, 334, 659 P.2d 87, 88 (1982)). A tort action may be maintained against the employer if the injury is not compensable under worker\u2019s compensation. <em>Luttrell v. Clearwater County Sheriff's Office, </em>140 Idaho 581, 585, n. 1, 97 P.3d 448, 452, n. 1 (2004); <em>Yeend v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>104 Idaho 333, 334, 659 P.2d 87, 88 (1982). If we were to hold otherwise, employees would be precluded from suing their employers for employment contract disputes, wage disputes, wrongful termination, and other causes of action such as violations of the Idaho Human Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 72-201, 72-209 and 72-211 should not be read in isolation from one another. Each section is part of the worker\u2019s compensation law and we interpret them <em>in pari materia. See Robison v. Bate-man-Hall Inc., </em>139 Idaho 207, 211, 76 P.3d 951, 955 (2003). When interpreting these three statutes we must conclude, as we have in the past, that if an injury is cognizable under the worker\u2019s compensation law then any common law remedy is barred, but if the injury is not cognizable under workman\u2019s compensation, then the employee is left to a remedy under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">II. A SEXUAL ASSAULT INHERENTLY PERSONAL OR PRIVATE IN ORIGIN AND WITHOUT PHYSICAL INJURY IS NOT COVERED BY WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Albertson\u2019s, as the moving party, must show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact that Doe would have been covered by worker\u2019s compensation and that it is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Eligibility under worker\u2019s compensation requires a showing that the injury was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. <em>Dinius v. Loving Care and More, Inc., </em>133 Idaho 572, 574, 990 P.2d 738, 740 (1999). Therefore, Albertsons must demonstrate Doe suffered an injury covered by workers compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Doe and her parents argue that Doe did not suffer an injury as defined by the workers compensation law. They contend Doe did not suffer \u201cviolence to the physical structure of the body.\u201d They assert Does injuries are psychological and therefore, not compensable under workers compensation. The district court concluded Doe suffered an injury, a broken hymen, caused by an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 72-102(17)(a) defines injury as \u201ca personal injury caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of any employment covered by the workers compensation law.\u201d Injury is \u201cconstrued to include only an injury caused by an accident, which i\u2019esults in violence to the physical structure of the body.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-102(17)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Even if we were to assume Does alleged broken hymen constitutes a physical injury, we find it difficult to classify Repps and Does actions as an accident. Her ruptured hymen was not \u201can unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event.\u201d It was something that typically occurs when a virgin engages in sexual intercourse. Although a seventeen-year-old such as Jane Doe is incapable, under the laws, of giving consent to sexual intercourse, <em>Fulgham v. Gatfield, </em>72 Idaho 367, 241 P.2d 824 (1952), such inability to legally consent to the act does not mean that either the act of sexual intercourse or the physical consequences of such sexual intercourse (a ruptured hymen) were \u201can unexpected, undesigned, and unlooked for mishap, or untoward event.\u201d Since there was no accident as defined by I.C. \u00a7 72-102(17)(b), Jane Doe did not suffer a personal injury as defined by I.C. \u00a7 72-102(17)(c), and her claims are not pre-empted by the Workers Compensation Law. The district court erred in determining that Doe\u2019s injuries were compensable under worker\u2019s compensation, thereby barring her claim in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">III. THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S AWARD OF COSTS TO ALBERTSON\u2019S IS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Upon granting summary judgment in Albertson\u2019s favor, the district court awarded Albertson\u2019s $16,539.38 in costs. Since we reverse the district court\u2019s order on summary judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings, we also reverse the award and judgment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">IV. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Both parties request attorney fees on appeal. To award attorney fees on appeal, a party must assert the specific statute or common law rule on which the award is based. <em>Browning v. Browning, </em>136 Idaho 691, 696, 39 P.3d 631, 636 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Albertson\u2019s requests attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. However, that statute requires that Albertson\u2019s be the prevailing party, and since they do not prevail on appeal they are not awarded attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Doe and her parents mistakenly request attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Appellate Rule 41 and I.C. \u00a7 12-101. First of all, Idaho Code \u00a7 12-101 authorizes an award for costs not attorney fees. Moreover, in Idaho, pro se litigants are not entitled to attorney fees. <em>O\u2019Neil v. Schuckardt, </em>112 Idaho 472, 480, 733 P.2d 693, 701 (1986). Therefore, no attorney fees are awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d provision of the worker\u2019s compensation law is not a bar to Doe\u2019s and her parents\u2019 claims against Albert-son\u2019s. The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is reversed. The district court\u2019s award of costs is reversed. Costs to Doe and her parents on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-16\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices TROUT, EISMANN and JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. In 1971 the following sentences were removed from the \"Declaration of Police Power\u201d section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The administration of the common law system in such cases has produced the result that little of the cost to the employer has reached the injured workman, and that little at large expense to the public. The remedy of the workman has been uncertain, slow and inadequate. Injuries in such employments formerly occasional, have become frequent and inevitable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. 1917 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 81 \u00a7 6, p. 256 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee on account of a personal injury for which he is entitled to compensation under this Act shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, dependents, or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">Employers, who hire workmen within this State to work outside of the State, may agree with such workmen that the remedies under this Act shall be exclusive as regards injuries received outside this State by accident arising out of and in the course of such employment; and all contracts of hiring in this State shall be presumed to include such an agreement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
