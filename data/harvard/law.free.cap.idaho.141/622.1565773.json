We vacate the order and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">The background facts are taken from the decision produced from these parties\u2019 previous visit to this Court, <em>Hayward v. Valley Vista Care Corp., </em>136 Idaho 342, 33 P.3d 816 (2001), and they are as follows. Eighty-five-year-old Delbert Hayward (Delbert) had been living in Valley Vista Care Center (Valley Vista), a nursing home facility in St. Maries, Idaho, for nearly a year when he died on February 16, 1995. Prior to taking residence at Valley Vista, Delbert lived at home with the assistance of home health care providers. In order to receive home health care services, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare required Delbert to submit to periodic medical evaluations. Delbert was admitted to the Kootenai Medical Center on February 22,1994 for one such evaluation. He was released to a personal care home in Hayden Lake on March 4, 1994. When he refused to eat and expressed a desire to return home, he was again admitted to Kootenai Medical Center on March 10, 1994. This time he was discharged to Valley Vista, where he lived until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">Alfred Hayward (Hayward), Delbert\u2019s son and the personal representative of his estate, sued Valley Vista, Jack\u2019s Pharmacy (which had filled prescriptions for Delbert), and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>W. Dyce Thurston,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Valley Vista\u2019s medical director. Hayward claimed false imprisonment and breach of contract, and later moved to amend his complaint to add a claim for wrongful death stemming from allegedly negligent injection of the drug Haldol. The district court refused to allow Hayward to amend his complaint and granted Valley Vista\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Hayward\u2019s breach of contract claims. On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s order regarding the breach of contract claims but reversed the district court\u2019s order refusing to allow Hayward to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">After our decision, Hayward filed a third amended complaint alleging that Delbert\u2019s death resulted from the negligence of Valley Vista, Dr. Thurston, and Jack\u2019s Pharmacy (including pharmacists Jack Botts and Chad Brown). All of the defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Valley Vista\u2019s motion. Dr. Thurston\u2019s estate was partially successful. The court ruled that the claim against Dr. Thurston, in his capacity as Delbert\u2019s physician, must be dismissed since Hayward presented no expert testimony about the standard of care of physicians in St. Maries. However, the court allowed Hayward to proceed against Dr. Thurston\u2019s estate in the doctor\u2019s capacity as Valley Vista\u2019s medical director. It also granted Jack\u2019s Pharmacy\u2019s motion, finding that Hayward\u2019s pharmacy expert did not testify to the standard of care for dispensing (as opposed to in-house or consulting) pharmacies in St. Maries. The court also ruled that Hayward\u2019s pharmacy expert did not adequately familiarize himself with the local standard of care. Hayward filed a motion to reconsider and more information was submitted to the court. The court denied the motion and this appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The claims at issue in this appeal were disposed of via summary judgment. When we consider appeals of orders on such motions, our standard of review is the same as that of the district court in considering the motion. <em>Thomson v. City of Lewiston, </em>137 Idaho 473, 475, 50 P.3d 488, 491 (2002). Summary judgment is appropriate only when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). The burden of establishing the absence of an issue of material fact is on the moving party. <em>Tingley v. Harrison, </em>125 Idaho 86, 89, 867 P.2d 960, 963 (1994). To meet this burden, the moving party must \u201cchallenge in its motion and establish through evidence the absence of any genuine issue of material fact on an element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Smith v. Meridian Joint Sch. Dist. No. 2, </em>128 Idaho 714, 719, 918 P.2d 583, 588 (1996). Courts must liberally construe the record, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>Friel v. Boise City Hous. Auth., </em>126 Idaho 484, 485, 887 P.2d 29, 30 (1994). If the facts, when so construed, are such that reasonable persons could reach differing conclusions, summary judgment is not available. <em>Harris v. Department of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>123 Idaho 295, 298, 847 P.2d 1156, 1159 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">This appeal requires us to decide whether (1) Hayward\u2019s medical expert submitted competent testimony regarding the standard of care for the class of health care provider to which Dr. Thurston belonged and in which capacity he was functioning at the time of the alleged negligence and (2) Hayward\u2019s pharmacy expert submitted competent testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to Jack\u2019s Pharmacy and the breach thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">A. The District Court Erred in Distinguishing Dr. Thurston\u2019s Roles as Medical Director and Physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Hayward contends the district court erred when it distinguished between Dr. Thurston\u2019s roles as Valley Vista\u2019s medical director and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Delbert\u2019s treating physician, and then went on to rule that Hayward presented no expert testimony relating to the standard of care applicable to physicians in St. Maries. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In medical malpractice eases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">plaintiff must, as an' essential part of his or her case in chief, affirmatively prove by direct expert testimony and by a preponderance of all the competent evidence, that such defendant then and there negligently failed to meet the applicable standard of health care practice of the community in which such care allegedly was or should have been provided, as such standard existed at the time and place of the alleged negligence of such physician and surgeon, hospital or other such health care provider and as such standard then and there existed with respect to the class of health care provider that such defendant then and there belonged to and in which capacity he, she or it was functioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">I.C. \u00a7 6-1012. Section 6-1012 also provides the criteria by which a health care provider shall be judged: \u201cSuch individual providers of health care shall be judged in such cases in comparison with similarly trained and qualified providers of the same class in the same community, taking into account his or her training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The applicable standard of care and the defendant\u2019s failure to meet it must be established by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">testimony of one (1) or more knowledgeable, competent expert witnesses, and such expert testimony may only be admitted in evidence if the foundation therefor is first laid, establishing (a) that such opinion is actually held by the expert witness, (b) that the said opinion can be testified to with reasonable medical certainty, and (c) that such expert witness possesses professional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable said community standard to which his or her expert testimony is addressed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">I.C. \u00a7 6-1013. If there is \u201cno other like provider in the community and the standard of practice is therefore indeterminable, evidence of such standard in similar Idaho communities at said time may be considered.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-1012. A competent expert witness from somewhere other than the locale at issue may \u201cadequately familiariz[e] himself with the standards and practices of (a particular) such area....\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-1013. An out-of-area expert witness with personal knowledge of the national standard of care may adequately familiarize himself with the applicable local standard of care by contacting a local physician who states that the local standard of care does not differ from the national standard of care. <em>Grover v. Smith, </em>137 Idaho 247, 251, 46 P.3d 1105, 1109 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">We have consistently held that in order to survive a motion for summary judgment in medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff must offer expert testimony indicating the health care provider negligently failed to meet the standard of care for the class of health care provider to which he belonged and in which capacity he was functioning at the time of the alleged negligence. <em>Dulaney v. St. Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>137 Idaho 160, 164, 45 P.3d 816, 820 (2002). Expert testimony introduced via affidavits must \u201cset forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify as to the matters stated therein.\u201d <em>Rhodehouse v. Stutts, </em>125 Idaho 208, 212, 868 P.2d 1224, 1228 (1994). Finally, an expert must state how he or she became familiar with the standard of care about which he or she is testifying. <em>Perry v. Magic Valley Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>134 Idaho 46, 995 P.2d 816 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Because the district court distinguished Dr. Thurson\u2019s roles as medical director and physician and allowed the claim against his estate to proceed insofar as it pertained to Dr. Thurston in his role as medical director, our task is to decide to what \u201cclass of health care provider\u201d Dr. Thurston belonged, and, in what capacity was he functioning? Having considered the record, we believe that he was not sometimes a medical director and sometimes a physician; instead, he was at all times some of each. Recall, Dr. Thurston must be judged \u201cin comparison with similarly trained and qualified providers of the same class in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>community, taking into account his or her training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, if any.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-1012. Hayward\u2019s expert, Dr. Jay Luxenberg, a San Francisco-based physician and medical director of a nursing home, testified that the medical director and physician roles really are not separable in this case. Consider the following exchange between Dr. Luxenberg and counsel for Dr. Thurston\u2019s estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">[Counsel for Dr. Thurston\u2019s Estate]: Regarding Dr. Thurston as potentially the Medical Director of Valley Vista, have you come to any opinions on a more probable than not basis that he breached a standard of care as Medical Director that was also a pi\u2019oximate cause of [Delbert's] death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">And let me say I do wish you to distinguish that from your prior testimony regarding Dr. Thurston which I assume was regarding his practice as an attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">[Answer by Dr. Luxenberg:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">MR. EYMANN: I have to object to the form. If you understand the question, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">[Dr. Luxenberg]: I do understand the question, and I\u2019ll just state that it becomes a classic problem to distinguish the action of the Medical Director who also is serving as an attending physician in that their duties as Medical Director involve in essence supervision of the medical care as practiced within the facility which implies supervising their own care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">And so I will say that the faults that I found in terms of the prescription of long-acting Haloperidol in terms of his, Dr. Thurston\u2019s practice as an attending physician, imply an additional failure of supervision on his part as Medical Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">I also as mentioned earlier felt that retaining a resident who has not signed in and in fact who actively demonstrates his desire to leave a facility against that person\u2019s will and administering medication against the will of a patient both are failures of standard of care, and the Medical Director has a duty to supervise the general practices of a nursing home. And if those are representative of the practice of the nursing home, that would be a failure on his part as Medical Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">I also acknowledge that an individual error of practice within a nursing home can\u2019t possibly be supervised by the attending \u2014 by the Medical Director, and that just a single example of a practice that falls below the standard of care of the nursing home does not necessarily mean that the Medical Director themselves fell below the standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">So, in that respect I\u2019ll say that I only fault Dr. Thurston\u2019s failure to supervise Dr. Thurston in this case, but not his other actions as Medical Director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-14\">[Counsel for Dr. Thurston\u2019s Estate]: Q. All right. So, if we can clarify this then, Doctor, regarding Dr. Thurston as potential Medical Director of Valley Vista, you have no opinions that he breached any standards of care other than regarding his own actions as a practicing attending physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-15\">[Dr. Luxenberg:] No, again as his practice as an attending physician went against the regulations of nursing home, and I\u2019m certainly assuming that his own examination confirmed that he was aware that [Delbert] was not conserved and had the right to leave the facility, et cetera, then anything that he did as attending physician should have been stopped by the Medical Director, and his failure to do that implies a failure as medical director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-16\">So, all the things that I object to in terms of the care of [Delbert] reflect on the practice of Dr. Thurston as Medical Director, but those aren\u2019t independent of his practice as attending physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">The upshot of this testimony is, we believe, that when a medical director is actually treating the patient in the nursing home, in the manner in which Dr. Thurston was treating Delbert in this case, any particular act cannot be assigned separately to a particular capacity. As Dr. Luxenberg pointed out, if Dr. Thurston failed in his capacity as medical director, that failure is based on his own failures as a physician prescribing Haldol to a patient in a nursing home. We acknowledge the affidavit of Dr. Frederick Haller, who had served as medical director of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>nursing home in another small, rural Idaho community. He said, essentially, that when he was actually treating individual residents, he was acting as a physician and not a medical director. Under the statute, however, we are unable to split those hairs. In judging Dr. Thurston\u2019s performance as a physician, we cannot ignore his training and experience as a medical director \u2014 the individual charged with supervising patient care. He cannot simply swap his medical director hat for his physician hat depending on the service he was providing, especially in this case, where he was performing both simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Neither can we ignore the place in which Dr. Thurston was treating Delbert: a nursing home facility \u2014 not an ordinary hospital or physician\u2019s office. The parties agree that nursing homes are required to follow federal and state guidelines relating to patient care, including the prescription of pharmaceuticals, and that they are responsible when those standards are not met. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 483.25, 483.60; Idaho Admin. Code sec. 16.03.02.154.0Lc. Therefore, it follows that the standard of care for a physician treating a patient in a nursing home would be governed by those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The alternative makes no sense: if a non-medical director physician treating a patient in a nursing home does not meet the standard to which the facility is held, or follows a lesser, local community standard, the nursing home as a facility has failed to meet the standard it is required to meet. To allow this result would thwart the purpose of the state or federal regulation \u2014 hence our rule that in cases where state or federal laws or regulations set forth minimum requirements for licensure of health care providers local communities are not free to adopt lower standards. <em>See, e.g., Grover v. Smith, </em>137 Idaho at 252, 46 P.3d at 1110 (taking patient\u2019s medical history is a minimum requirement necessary to become licensed dentist in Idaho; local community may not adopt a local standard below licensing requirements). Accordingly, we believe the rationale in Gro<em>ver </em>applies in this case: a physician treating a patient in a nursing facility is not free to adopt a standard of care lower than that required of the nursing home in which the provider works. If the physician is functioning both as treating physician and as medical director of the facility, his or her standard of care includes the minimum standards set by applicable state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">B. Hayward\u2019s Pharmacy Expert was Competent to Testify About the Standard of Care Applicable to Jack\u2019s Pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The district court ruled that Hayward\u2019s pharmacy expert failed to properly establish the standard of care applicable to Jack\u2019s Pharmacy. Hayward contends this ruling is in error and we agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Hayward offered the deposition testimony and affidavit of one Rex Lott, a pharmacist licensed in Washington (but not Idaho), who works for the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital in Boise. Lott holds a doctorate in pharmacy. He is an instructor of pharmacy at Idaho State University and has worked with nursing homes. To familiarize himself with the standard of care in St. Maries, he reviewed Delbert\u2019s medical records and the depositions of Jack Botts and Chad Brown, pharmacists at Jack\u2019s Pharmacy. He also contacted one Marvin Wheeler, who had worked as a pharmacist in St. Maries until 1992, when he began working on a fill-in or temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Based on his review of Botts\u2019 and Brown\u2019s depositions and his discussion with Wheeler, Lott offered the following explanation of the standard of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">[T]he standards identified by Chad Brown and Jack Botts in their depositions are no different from the standards that I discussed with Marvin Wheeler ... My opinion is that, with respect to a retail pharmacist in St. Maries, Idaho, at the time, the principal standard of care was \u2018start low, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>go slow\u2019 in the dispensing or dosing of Haldol. A pharmacist has a duty to intervene when the \u2018start low, go slow' dosing for Haldol is not followed, such as with Delbert Hayward on March 18,1994, when Mr. Hayward\u2019s orders for Haldol were increased from one-half milligram a day to a potential of well over 24 milligrams a day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsW\">The \u201cstart low, go slow\u201d standard is not disputed. Lott stated further that under state regulations, pharmacists are \u201crequired to look at each drug order with a prospective view and evaluate the order for such tilings as rational therapy contraindications, reasonable dose, over utilization and abuse and misuse.\u201d This duty was identified by Jack Botts in his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Lott explained that the regulations applied to all retail pharmacies doing businesses with nursing homes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">[T]he standard of care in St. Maries, Idaho, for the provision of pharmaceuticals to nursing home patients is the same whether in St. Maries, Boise, Spokane or Coeur d\u2019Alene. The similarity in the standard of care is primarily because of the pervasive regulation of nursing homes by the United States government including their interpretive guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Lott said the regulations imposed on Jack\u2019s Pharmacy a duty to monitor the usage of drugs prescribed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Marvin Wheeler stated to me in 1999 that the regulations for nursing homes applied to all retail pharmacies doing business with nursing homes. Those regulations including the I.A.P.A. require contracts with unit dose pharmacies. Jack\u2019s Pharmacy was providing daily medication to Valley Vista Care Center which was distributed in a unit dose fashion. Therefore, these regulations applied to Jack\u2019s Pharmacy and its dispensing pharmacists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Lott said also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">The pharmacist must have an adequate system in place to identify that drugs are delivered and billed correctly along with documentation of unused doses. The extensive errors I reviewed in this case, including notes indicating medications were dispensed on the non-existent dates of November 31, 1994 and April 31, 1994, fell below the minimum standard of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Lott concluded, based on his review of the information and guidelines, that Jack\u2019s Pharmacy should have contacted Dr. Thurston about the March 18, 1994 prescription and failing to do so \u201cresulted in the chemical restraint and may have contributed to the physical decline of Delbert Lewis Hayward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">Based on the testimony recited above, we conclude that Lott satisfied the competency test. He reviewed the depositions of Botts and Brown, two St. Maries pharmacists, which indicated (1) the \u201cstart low, go slow\u201d utilization standard of Haldol, and (2) the duty to alert the physician where it appears that a large or excessive dose has been prescribed. He confirmed with Wheeler that the standard of care imposed by state and federal regulations did apply to all pharmacies dispensing pharmaceuticals to nursing facilities and that the standard was the same, whether the dispensing occurred in St. Maries, Spokane, Coeur d\u2019Alene, or Boise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony recited above also leads us to conclude that there is a question of fact on whether the standard was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Having concluded that Lott was competent to testify, and that there was evidence the standard of care was breached, one additional point is worth discussing briefly. Jack\u2019s Pharmacy argued that if Hayward prevailed, the resultant rule would require Jack\u2019s Pharmacy to actually visit the nursing home and review the particular patient\u2019s records. Nothing in the evidence suggests so and nothing in our holding today should be construed to require this. We hold only that Lott was competent to testify as to the standard of care and its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Dr. Luxenberg\u2019s testimony about the standard of care applicable to a medical director treating a patient in a nursing facility was admissible and the district court erred in drawing the distinction between Dr. Thurston\u2019s roles as medical director and physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As for Jack\u2019s Pharmacy, Dr. Lott adequately familiarized himself with the local standard of care applicable to Jack\u2019s Pharmacy. While there is disagreement about what the standard of care is and whether it has been breached, Hayward\u2019s only obstacle to surviving summary judgment is offering competent and admissible expert testimony to show the standard of care and the breach thereof. Hayward has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Accordingly, the rulings of the district court regarding Dr. Thurston in his capacity as Delbert\u2019s treating physician and regarding Jack\u2019s Pharmacy and its two pharmacists are vacated. The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision. No party seeks attorney\u2019s fees, and therefore none are awarded. Costs are awarded to Hayward.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-8\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER, and Justices TROUT, EISMANN and BURDICK concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">. Dr. Thurston passed away during the course of the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. Throughout this action, the parties have operated on the assumption that I.C. \u00a7 6-1012 applies to retail pharmacies. Pharmacies are not specifically listed in the section, and it is not altogether clear whether the section does apply to pharmac\u00edes. On the other hand, the section is fairly all-inclusive. The question was never raised, however, and we need not decide it to resolve the case vis-a-vis Jack\u2019s Pharmacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-10\">. The district court found that there was no evidence in the record showing that Wheeler knew what the standard of care in Spokane, Coeur d\u2019Alene, or Boise was. Whether Wheeler knew the standard in Boise or Spokane or even Omaha is irrelevant. All the statute requires is that the expert, in this case Lott, confirm with a local professional that the local standards do not differ from state or national standards. Explaining that the standards are the same in St. Maries as they are in other cities is simply a way to illustrate the point that the standard in St. Maries does not differ from the state or national standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
