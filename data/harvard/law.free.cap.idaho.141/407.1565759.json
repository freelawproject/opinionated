Simplot Company (Simplot).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">Emery began working for Simplot as a warehouseman in November of 2000. On March 10, 2001, he twisted and injured his back as he hurried to get out of the way of falling boxes. After reviewing a lumbar MRI taken on April 11, Dr. Douglas M. Hill diagnosed Emery with a work-related lumbar sprain and a pre-existing degenerative lumbar disc disease. Emery was treated conservatively for his condition. He continued to work for Simplot, but in a lighter position than his previous job as a warehouseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-22\">On August 8, 2001, Dr. Hill released Emery from his care. Though Emery continued to suffer from low back pain, Dr. Hill determined that this pain was related to a preexisting condition and not the work-related injury. Simplot denied compensation for all expenses incurred by Emery for his treatment after August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-23\">Emery sought a second opinion from Dr. Lisa Koltes on August 27, 2001. At this point, Emery had retained an attorney who arranged for an examination by Dr. Monte Moore, a physiatrist in Boise. Dr. Moore examined Emery and assigned him a five percent permanent impairment rating. Of this five percent, Dr. Moore attributed two and one-half percent to Emery\u2019s pre-existing condition and the remaining two and one-half percent to the work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Emery\u2019s attorney filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the Industrial Commission on February 20, 2002, alleging that Emery was entitled to further compensation from Simplot. Emery offered to settle the claim, but Simplot rejected this offer. Shortly before the hearing Emery\u2019s attorney advised him that proceeding with the matter would involve substantial risk and expense. The attorney suggested that Emery dismiss his claim. Emery agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Emery\u2019s attorney sent a stipulation to dismiss to Simplot. Simplot refused to sign the stipulation as it was written and insisted that the dismissal be \u201cwith prejudice\u201d to avoid the possibility of Emery bringing the same claim at a later date. Emery and Simplot both signed the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice. Before approving the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice, the Commission sought additional information as to the reasons for dismissal from Emery and his attorney who sent a letter to the Commission setting forth the reasons for permanently dismissing the claim. The Commission approved the stipulation and issued an order dismissing the claim on October 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Emery alleges that he did not fully understand the implications of a dismissal \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d He retained new counsel in January of 2003, and on May 12 submitted a motion to vacate the Commission\u2019s dismissal of his claim. The Commission treated the motion as a motion for reconsideration, which it determined was untimely. The Commission denied Emery\u2019s motion on July 2, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Emery submitted a motion for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s denial of his May 12 motion to vacate. The Commission determined that its July 2 Order improperly disposed of the case. The Commission reconsidered Emery\u2019s May 12 motion to vacate on August 29 and denied it on its substantive merits. Emery appealed, challenging the Commission\u2019s approval of the stipulation of dismissal and its subsequent denial of his motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">This Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">The Industrial Commission\u2019s conclusions of law are freely reviewable by this Court. <em>Taylor v. Soran Rest., Inc., </em>131 Idaho 525, 527, 960 P.2d 1254, 1256 (1998). Factual findings will be upheld if supported by substantial, competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>Constitutional issues as well as the construction and application of legislative acts are questions of law subject to free review by this Court. <em>Struhs v. Prot. Tech\u2019s, Inc., </em>133 Idaho 715, 722, 992 P.2d 164, 171 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-13\"><em>Cutsinger v. Spears Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>137 Idaho 464, 466, 50 P.3d 479, 481 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">THE COMMISSION HAD THE AUTHORITY UNDER I.C. \u00a7 72-508 TO DISMISS THE CLAIM BY APPROVING THE STIPULATION TO DISMISS THE CLAIM WITH PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Emery maintains that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority under I.C. \u00a7 72-508 when it applied Rule XII(A) of its own Judicial Rules of Practice and Procedure to approve a stipulation of the parties to dismiss the claim with prejudice, asserting that I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2) suggests that the stipulation was void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">I.C. \u00a7 72-508 explicitly grants the Commission the authority to adopt rules governing judicial practice and procedure in front of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">Idaho Code \u00a7 72-508 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">[T]he Commission shall have authority to promulgate and adopt reasonable rules and regulations for effecting the purposes of this [Workers\u2019 Compensation] act.... [T]he commission shall have authority to promulgate and adopt reasonable rules and regulations involving judicial matters.... Rules and regulation as promulgated and adopted, if not inconsistent with law, shall be binding in the administration of this law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">I.C. \u00a7 72-508 (1999). According to the language of I.C. \u00a7 72-508, the Commission\u2019s authority to adopt rules and regulations governing judicial matters is limited to the extent that such rules and regulations cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>be inconsistent with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Emery argues that the stipulation to dismiss his claim with prejudice amounts to an \u201cagreement by an employee to waive his rights to compensation,\u201d which is invalid under I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2). His argument is that although the Commission has the authority to adopt rules and regulations governing judicial matters, it applied Rule XII(A) to approve an agreement that violated I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2), making the Commission\u2019s actions in this case \u201cinconsistent with law.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 72-318 states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">(1) No agreement by an employee to pay any portion of the premiums paid by his employer for workmen\u2019s compensation, or to contribute to the cost or other security maintained for or carried for the purpose of securing the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation, or to contribute to a benefit fund or department maintained by the employer, or any contract, rule, regulation or device whatever designed to relieve the employer in whole or in part from any liability created by this law, shall be valid....</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">(2) No agreement by an employee to waive his rights to compensation under this act shall be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">I.C. \u00a7 72-318 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Emery\u2019s argument focuses on I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2). However, the stipulation to dismiss Emery\u2019s claim with prejudice is not an \u201cagreement by an employee to waive his rights to compensation under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation] act.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2). Emery was not waiving his rights to compensation under the act. He stipulated to dismiss his claim with respect to the injury he suffered on March 10, 2001. The stipulation did not reheve Simplot of liability for any injury he might suffer in the future while employed by Simplot. Emery and Simplot agreed to resolve the specific claim at issue in this case. The Commission\u2019s finding that the parties had not created a \u201cscheme\u201d to avoid the employer\u2019s obligations under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Emery\u2019s claim that the only instances where a workers\u2019 compensation claim can be dismissed with prejudice are under the lump sum provisions of Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 72-^104 and 72-711 is not persuasive. Those statutes specifically provide that settlements under their provisions permanently resolve workers\u2019 compensation claims. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-404, 72-711 (1999). This does not mean that a lump sum settlement is the <em>only </em>way to permanently settle workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Pursuant to the authority granted to it in I.C. \u00a7 72-508, the Commission adopted Rule XII(A) of its Judicial Rules of Practice and Procedure. In 2002, the year the Commission issued its order approving the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice, Rule XII(A) stated, \u201c[u]nless good cause to the contrary appears, the Commission shall grant a Motion for Dismissal when made by the party filing the Complaint.\u201d Idaho Indus. Comm\u2019n, Judicial Rules of Practice Procedure Rule XII(A)(1999). The Rule does not say anything about a dismissal being with or without prejudice. Emery\u2019s argument that the Commission\u2019s reliance on this rule to approve the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice is \u201cinconsistent with law\u201d is not persuasive. Rule XII(A) does not preclude the Commission from approving a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice. I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2) does not invalidate the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice under the facts of this case. The Commission\u2019s actions in this case were in accordance with I.C. \u00a7 72-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The fact that there was no hearing on the merits of Emery\u2019s case and no compensation paid to him in exchange for dismissing his claims does not change the result of this case. Emery does not challenge Rule XII(A) in general. Under Rule XII(A), there is no requirement that a hearing be held prior to dismissal or that compensation be paid to a claimant who brings a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"Adc\">The Commission\u2019s decision is also in accordance with <em>Woodvine v. Triangle Dairy, Inc., </em>106 Idaho 716, 682 P.2d 1263 (1984), which held that the Commission\u2019s decisions were final only as to those matters actually considered by it. <em>Id. </em>at 721, 682 P.2d at 1268. Before approving the stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>tion to dismiss with prejudice, the Commission sought additional information from Emery\u2019s prior attorney as to the reasons for the dismissal. The attorney responded with a letter to the Commission informing it that Emery\u2019s medical information, Simplot\u2019s surveillance tapes, high litigation costs, and Emery\u2019s continued employment with Simplot were the motivating factors behind the dismissal. The letter stated that, \u201cClaimant has decided, after full legal consultation, to permanently dismiss this ease.\u201d After reviewing this information, the Commission approved the stipulation and issued its order dismissing the Complaint. The Commission actually considered the stipulation. The Order dismissing Emery\u2019s claim is a final decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The Commission again examined the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice in considering Emery\u2019s motion to vacate and determined that there was sufficient consideration supporting it. The Commission stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANQ\">[T]he stipulation is not void for want of consideration under basic contract principles. Claimant received certain compensation benefits before determining to end his claim for further benefits. Moreover, it is clear that Claimant considered the medical information, surveillance videotape, litigation cost, and retention of his job with Defendant as other factors in his decision to permanently dismiss his case. In hindsight, Claimant regrets the earlier decision. However, at the time of dismissal, Claimant appeared to be fully cognizant of his decision in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Commission\u2019s analysis of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the stipulation is valid in light of the evidence presented to it. There was good cause supporting the Commission\u2019s approval of the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice, and there was good cause supporting the Commission\u2019s refusal to vacate that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I.C. \u00a7 72-404 AND 72-711 DO NOT PREVENT THE COMMISSION\u2019S DISMISSAL OP THE CLAIM WITH PREJUDICE IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Emery argues that the Commission did not have statutory authority under either I.C. \u00a7 72-711 or I.C. \u00a7 72-404 to approve a stipulation to dismiss the Claimant\u2019s Complaint with prejudice, and I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2) suggests that the stipulation was void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Emery argues that the Legislature specifically provided for instances where a workers\u2019 compensation claim could be settled between the parties without a hearing, stating that the statutes allowing for such settlement are I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-404 and 72-711. He maintains that a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice does not qualify under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-404 and 72-711 and is not the proper means for the Commission to dismiss a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">In its August 29, 2003, order denying the motion to vacate the Commission determined that I.C. \u00a7 72-711 was not relevant to this case because the stipulation was not \u201can agreement in regard to compensation.\u201d The Commission reasoned that since the stipulation addressed only the complaint filed by Emery and \u201cnot the income or medical benefits for which Defendant was or was not liable ____ it cannot be considered an enforceable award of the Commission.\u201d Similarly, the Commission refused to characterize the stipulation as an agreement for a \u201clump sum\u201d payment under I.C. \u00a7 72-404. Thus, the Commission\u2019s refusal to vacate its prior order approving the stipulation was based on its findings that there was consideration supporting the agreement, and that the agreement did not violate I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2). In other words, I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404 were not relevant to the determination of whether the Commission had the authority to approve the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">Emery\u2019s argument that the Commission lacked authority under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404 to approve the stipulation to dismiss with prejudice is nearly identical to the argument he made that any agreement dismissing a case outside the lump sum provisions violates I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2). Here, Emery\u2019s argument is that the stipulation did not qualify as a lump sum settlement under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404, and the Commission cannot ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>prove an invalid lump sum settlement. However, there is nothing in the record, statutes or case law supporting Emery\u2019s argument that the mere existence of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404 precludes the use of any other agreement dismissing a workers\u2019 compensation claim with prejudice. Emery\u2019s argument that the Commission lacked authority to approve the stipulation under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404 depends on his argument that I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2) prohibits the -dismissal of workers\u2019 compensation claims with prejudice outside the lump sum provisions. Idaho Code \u00a7 72-318(2) does not invalidate the stipulation in this case. A determination of whether or not it qualified as a lump sum settlement under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and/or 72-404 is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The Commission acted pursuant to its authority under I.C. \u00a7 72-508 in adopting and applying Rule XII(A) to approve the stipulation at issue in this case, and such approval neither violated I.C. \u00a7 72-318(2), nor was it \u201cinconsistent with law.\u201d There is no error in the Commission\u2019s determination that I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-711 and 72-404 do not apply to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Commission\u2019s order denying Emery\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal of his claim is affirmed. Simplot is awarded costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">Justice TROUT, KIDWELL, EISMANN and BURDICK concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
