The defendant insurance company appeals from an order which, <em>inter alia, </em>granted the plaintiffs summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Under the terms of the policy in question, the Sayeghs were only entitled to excess liability coverage for those properties covered by the underlying policies listed on the declarations page of the policy. The declarations page does not contain any reference to the property where the plaintiffs allegedly sustained their injuries. It only refers to a policy covering the Sayeghs\u2019 private residence and another policy covering their automobiles. In exchange for coverage of their private residence, the Sayeghs paid an annual premium of $41. Thus, the Supreme Court erred in declaring that the Sayeghs were entitled to coverage that was not provided by the unambiguous terms of the contract of insurance and that was not taken into account in fixing the insurance premium. Lawrence J. P., Eiber, O\u2019Brien and Santucci, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
