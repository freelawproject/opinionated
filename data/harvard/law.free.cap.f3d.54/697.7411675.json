The district court concluded that service could not be effected on a foreign defendant by serving his putative agent in the United States. We REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">Plaintiff-appellant Owen F. Silvious filed suit against defendant Ghaith R. Pharaon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in May, 1992, and alleged a cause of action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), (\u201cRICO\u201d). Silvious charged that Pharaon, as owner and operator of the Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International (\u201cBCCI\u201d), defrauded Silvious of money deposited with BCCI in 1985 and due to be repaid to Silvious in October, 1990. Allegedly, Pharaon has left the United States and is in Saudi Arabia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-23\">In May, 1992, Silvious began his unrelenting effort to serve Pharaon in Richmond Hill, Georgia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in Saudi Arabia. Despite the InterRedee attorney\u2019s notifying the United States Marshal\u2019s office that Pharaon did not reside at the Richmond Hill plantation, Silvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ous attempted to serve Pharaon at the Richmond Hill address several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">In August, 1992, Silvious moved for a court order for service for the second time. He requested that the district court approve one of the following methods of service for Pharaon: (1) delivery of the complaint, summons and amended pleadings to an employee of Pharaon\u2019s, as requested in the earlier motion; (2) physical attachment of the documents to the Richmond Hill structure itself;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or (3) publication of notice in either the <em>International Herald Tribune </em>or the <em>Economist, </em>publications distributed in France and Saudi Arabia, where it was thought Pharaon might be located. The magistrate judge consequently directed that the U.S. Marshal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtYx\">attempt service upon the defendant at any place that he may be found within the United States [as allowed by the RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965(d) ]. Additionally, <em>the Marshal may leave a copy of the summons and complaint at Cherry Hill Plantation ... with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein or with an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1) [ (1992) ]. If the Marshal is unable to perfect service using these methods, the plaintiff may then urge the Court to consider other methods of service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">R1-15-1 to 2. The court, however, denied Silvious\u2019s request for service by publication and determined that Silvious had not complied with Georgia\u2019s long-arm statute for service by publication. In September, 1992, Dooley E. Culbertson, purportedly the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of InterRedec, wrote the court a letter stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">Pharaon is not a resident of Sterling Bluff Plantation nor has he ever been a legal resident. Furthermore, Dr. Pharaon owns no real property in Bryan County and has never been an employee, officer or director of InterRedec.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">In light of the above, it is useless for the court to attempt to serve papers on Ghaith Pharaon at the InterRedec offices at Sterling Bluff Plantation. Dr. Pharaon is represented by the firm of Whitman and Ransom, 200 Park Avenue, Suite 2800, New York, New York 10166, attention Mr. Berge Setrakian. I do not know, however, whether that law firm or any of its members serve in the capacity of agent of record for Dr. Pharaon and doubt whether they can accept service for him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">Rl-18-2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The magistrate judge promptly issued another order indicating its belief that \u201cfurther efforts to serve the defendant at the Cherry Hill Plantation would be futile.\u201d Rl-19-1 to 2. The court instead directed that a copy of the summons and complaint be mailed to Pharaon\u2019s counsel at the address provided by Culbertson. A copy of the summons and complaint were mailed, but counsel never responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Silvious then endeavored to serve Pharaon by mail in Saudi Arabia, and he again moved for a determination of sufficiency of process. In June, 1993, the magistrate judge concluded that despite Silvious\u2019s numerous attempts to effect mail service, Pharaon had not been served properly yet. By order dated November 1, 1993, the magistrate judge ruled that none of the attempts at service had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>successful but that, because Silvious was attempting service in a foreign country, the 120 day time limit of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j) (1992) did not apply to this action. Therefore, instead of dismissing the action pursuant to Rule 4(j), the magistrate judge allowed Silvious thirty additional days to complete service. The magistrate judge stated that, if Silvious failed to effect service, the judge would recommend that the case be dismissed <em>without prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On January 21, 1994, the Bryan County Sheriffs Department delivered the summons, complaint and amended complaint to Kethes-paran Srikanthan, allegedly an agent of Pharaon, at Sterling Bluff Plantation. The affidavit and certificate of service were filed with the district court on January 24, 1994. When Pharaon failed to answer, Silvious moved for a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">On March 21, 1994, the magistrate judge entered a Report and Recommendation to the district court finding that the newly amended Rule 4 did not allow Silvious to use substituted service on Pharaon because Pharaon was physically outside of the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Silvious objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation; he argued <em>inter alia </em>that Pharaon\u2019s agent authorized by law was properly served and, therefore, substituted service had occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court dismissed Silvious\u2019s action for failure to effect service successfully. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\u201cThe starting point for an analysis of amenability to service of process in federal court is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.\u201d <em>Brink\u2019s Mat, Ltd. v. Diamond, </em>906 F.2d 1519, 1521 (11th Cir.1990). In 1993, during the pendency of Silvious\u2019s case, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were amended; Rule 4 was revised. Our review of this case focuses upon the district court\u2019s conclusion that revised Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4(e) and (f) eliminated the practice of allowing an agent in the United States to receive service of process on behalf of a principal who was located in a foreign country. <em>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, </em>486 U.S. 694, 705, 707, 108 S.Ct. 2104, 2111, 2112, 100 L.Ed.2d 722 (1988). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <em>de novo. Burns v. Lawther, </em>44 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>McBride v. Sharpe, </em>25 F.3d 962, 968 (11th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 489, 130 L.Ed.2d 401 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The Supreme Court\u2019s order amending the Rules stated in pertinent part \u201c[tjhat the foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 1993, and shall govern all proceedings in civil cases <em>thereafter commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings in civil cases then pending.\u201d </em>Supreme Court Order of April 22, 1993, <em>reprinted in Federal Civil Judicial Procedure and Rules </em>17 (West ed. 1994). The plain language of the Supreme Court\u2019s order indicates that the district court may apply either the rule in effect when the complaint was filed and the case thereby commenced pursuant to Rule 3, or the rule in effect when service was attempted last in 1994.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Elkay Mfg. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Ebco Mfg. Co., </em>No. 93 C 5106, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 473, at * 18 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 13, 1995); <em>Eskofot A/S v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>872 F.Supp. 81, 86 (S.D.N.Y.1995); <em>Lowe v. Hart, </em>157 F.R.D. 550, 551 (M.D.Fla.1994). For analysis, we assume that the district court considered application of the revised Rule 4 to Silvious\u2019s attempts at service occurring after December 1, 1993, just and practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The district court held that because Pharaon personally could not be found and served within the United States, Silvious must serve Pharaon pursuant to revised Rule 4(f), which provides for service abroad. Revised Rule 4(e), however, clearly provides for substituted service.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Prior to the revisions to Rule 4, substituted service did not fail merely because the principal was outside of the United States. <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, </em>486 U.S. at 705, 108 S.Ct. at 2111 (\u201cUnder [the Due Process] Clause, foreign nationals are assured of either personal service, which <em>typically </em>will require service abroad <em>... or </em>substituted service that provides \u2018notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950))). \u201cPersonal service has not in all circumstances been regarded as indispensable to the process due to residents, and it has more often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Substituted service on an agent of the party to the action is a common practice. We find no indication that the amendments to Rule 4 were intended to alter this method of service for individual foreign defendants. The committee notes indicate that the changes in the Rule were intended to widen the reach of service of process, not to restrict it. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 advisory committee\u2019s note on 1993 amendment (subdivision (e) and subdivision (f)) (\u201cTogether with subdivision (f), [subdivision (e)] provides for service on persons anywhere, subject to constitutional and statutory constraints.... [Subdivision (f) ] facilitate^] the use of federal long-arm law in actions brought to enforce the federal law against defendants who cannot be served under any state law but who can be constitutionally subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Moreover, revised Rule 4(e) makes no reference to where the defendant or individual is \u201cfound.\u201d We interpret the words \u201cin any judicial district of the United States\u201d in Rule 4(e) to describe the place where the personal or substituted service is \u201ceffected\u201d rather than the location, at the precise moment of service, of the individual being served. The individual and the agent need not be in the same place. For example, in the case of an individual who is located in a foreign country but whose legal agent is located in a judicial district of the United States, a plaintiff may <em>either </em>personally serve the individual, <em>per </em>Rule 4(f), <em>or </em>effect substituted service through the individual\u2019s agent, <em>per </em>Rule 4(e). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>In deciding which subsection applies, the focus is upon the place where service is effected, not the location of the defendant at the time of service. This reading of Rule 4(e)(2) is consistent with the language of subdivisions (g) and (h) which alternately refer to service within a judicial district and to service <em>\u201cin a place </em>not within any judicial district of the United States.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(g), 4(h)(2) (emphasis added). A plaintiff may effect proper service on an agent in the United States pursuant to Rule 4(e)(2) so long as that service complies with requirements of the Due Process Clause and the relevant statute, even though the individual party to be served may not be \u201cfound\u201d personally in the United States at the time of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Silvious has appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim for failure to effect proper service on Pharaon per Rule 4(f). We conclude that the amendments to Rule 4 did not abolish the practice of effecting service on an individual who resides outside of the United States by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint in the United States to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process for that individual. Because we conclude that the district court misinterpreted the effect of the Rule 4 amendments in this case, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court to determine whether Silvious properly served Pharaon under Rule 4(e)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\">. Pharaon has never filed an answer or motion with the district court and has not filed any briefs or other documents with this court regarding this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-16\">.

Additionally, a copy again was mailed. Upon learning of the attempted service, Silvious amended his motion to request that this latest attempt at service be deemed effective under Georgia law and that, additionally, publication be allowed. Silvious apparently contends that this service was proper under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9\u201411\u20144(d)(6). However, because service in this manner is limited to actions in which the amount in controversy is less than $200.00, Silvious could not have complied with Georgia's process statute in this manner. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9\u201411\u20144(d)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\">.
