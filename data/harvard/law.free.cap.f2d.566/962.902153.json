Adams appeals from his conviction upon a guilty plea of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He contends that his plea was involuntary and that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, which establishes detailed procedures for accepting guilty pleas. We hold that the district court must comply strictly with Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-25\">\u201cPlea bargains have accompanied the whole history of this nation\u2019s criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 775, 780, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1079, 95 S.Ct. 668, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). The pragmatic need for plea bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>gaining must be reconciled, however, with the constitutional requirement that the plea be voluntary. In 1966 the rule was amended to forbid the court to accept the plea \u201cwithout first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the voluntariness of the plea\u201d. Even after the 1966 amendment some courts still held that substantial compliance would satisfy the rule. <em>Waddy v. Heer, </em>6 Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 789, 794, <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 911, 88 S.Ct. 2069, 20 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1968). <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, put an end to that view of Rule 11. Under its supervisory power, the Supreme Court held in <em>McCarthy </em>that there must be strict compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">On December 1, 1975, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 was tightened by amendments providing that trial judges accepting guilty pleas \u201cmust address the defendant personally in open court\u201d, inform him of certain constitutional rights, certain consequences of his plea, and the nature of the charges to which he is pleading.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge must also determine that the defendant understands what he is told. In <em>United States v. Aldridge, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 922 (per curiam), we held that the adoption of the new amendments did not change the rule in this circuit that \u201ccompliance with Rule 11 must be literal\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Here, the trial judge complied with Rule 11 in informing the defendant of the maximum sentence he faced and of his right to a jury trial. The defendant had received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>indictment and had gone over it with his counsel. The trial judge, however, did not inform the defendant \u201cpersonally\u201d that he \u201chas the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront . . . witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself\u201d. The trial judge did not inform the defendant personally of the nature of the charge to which he pleaded. Because Rule 11 required the trial judge to inform the defendant of these matters, we must reverse the judgment and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-29\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-30\">The colloquy between the trial judge and the defendant on which this appeal is based is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the collo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>quy, the United States Attorney announced that the parties had entered into a plea bargain. The government agreed that in return for Adams\u2019 guilty plea to count two, it would move to dismiss the other two counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the government agreed that in return for Adams\u2019 testifying against his codefendants, it would not oppose probation. Finally, the government agreed to seek expansion of the territorial limits of Adams\u2019 bond and to seek Adams\u2019 release as surety on the codefendant\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Adams also executed a written guilty plea form in the court\u2019s presence. The form stated that Adams understood \u201cthe elements of the offense\u201d, recounted that Adams had the right to counsel and the right to stand trial regardless of guilt, and accurately listed the maximum sentence including the special parole term. The form also stated that Adams had received no promise of leniency for pleading guilty nor threat of harshness for standing trial and that no promise of leniency would be binding on the court. The form announced that the only bargain had been the government\u2019s agreement to dismiss two of the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The court accepted the guilty plea. Three months later, on January 25, 1977, Adams appeared for sentencing. He told the court that he found the cocaine at his home and had given it to an undercover agent to find out what it was. The court sentenced him to three years imprisonment and a three-year special parole term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Plea bargaining passes constitutional muster only if it is voluntary. Rule 11 imposes strict procedural requirements to keep plea bargaining within acceptable constitutional standards. In addition, under the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory power, the trial judge is allowed no latitude to depart from Rule 11. He must inform the defendant of the nature of his rights, and determine that the defendant understands what his rights are and what he is giving away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-14\">A. <em>Constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-15\">Here the trial judge did not personally inform the defendant that he \u201chas the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront . . . witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself\u201d. Rule 11(c)(3) requires that a defendant be personally informed of those three rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Adams therefore must be allowed to plead again. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418; <em>United States v. Aldridge, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 922 (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-17\">The trial judge instructed Adams that he had a right to a \u201cspeedy trial before either a judge or jury\u201d, but that statement does not clearly state that the choice belongs to Adams. The defendant said that he understood that he was waiving this right. We suggest that this statement could be clarified by specifying that it is the defendant who makes the choice whether to be tried before a judge or before a jury. Nevertheless, in this respect we conclude that the language of the trial judge comports with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-18\">B. <em>Nature of the charge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-19\">The trial judge did three things to inform the defendant of the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>charge to which he pleaded and to determine that the defendant understood the nature of the charge. First, the trial judge determined from Adams that he had received the indictment and gone over it with his attorney. Second, the charge was read to Adams. Third, after Adams described the transfer of the cocaine in his own words, the trial judge asked him if he \u201cintend[ed] to distribute or sell\u201d the cocaine he described transferring.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Curiously, in spite of the plea bargain, Adams denied that he had intended to distribute the cocaine, a statement that might have aroused doubts as to Adams\u2019 understanding of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The trial court, however, made no attempt to explain the charge and did not ask Adams whether he understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">We hold that the trial judge did not properly inform Adams of the nature of the charge he faced and did not determine that he understood the charge. In dictum in <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 166, 174 n.12, we reserved the question whether amended Rule ll\u2019s additional requirement that the trial court inform the defendant of the nature of the charge must be literally construed. Following <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, and <em>United States v. Aldridge, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 922 (per curiam), we now hold that the trial court must personally inform the defendant of the nature of the charge to which he pleads. The trial court must also, as we have held previously, determine that the defendant understands the nature of the charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">To inform a defendant of the nature of the charge must mean more to having the indictment read to the defendant. Reading the indictment informs the defendant of the technical charge. But the trial court should proceed \u201con the assumption that the defendant is ignorant of the nature of the charges\u201d. <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 166, 172. In most cases only the most sophisticated defendant would be informed of the nature of the charge by a reading of the indictment without more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">In <em>Coronado, </em>Judge Goldberg, writing for the Count, suggested the use of jury instructions as a pattern for explaining to defendants the nature of the charges to which they are pleading. We need not adopt such a requirement now, for different cases may require different explanations. Some defendants are more sophisticated than others. <em>See United States v. </em>Saft, 2 Cir. 1977, 558 F.2d 1073, 1079. Some charges are more difficult to understand than others. <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>554 F.2d at 172.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But \u201cno matter how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>simple the charges, a district court should make the minor investment of time and effort necessary to set forth their meaning and demonstrate on the record that the defendant understands\u201d. <em>Id. </em>And when there is a lesser included offense, as in this case with simple possession, \u201cpersonally addressing the defendant as to his understanding of the essential elements of the charge to which he pleads guilty\u201d seems essential. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 467 n.20, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, 426 n.20. <em>See </em>8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 11.02[1] at 11-25, <em>citing Dorough v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 887, 894 (Goldberg, J., dissenting). See <em>also </em>1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Here, the trial judge made no attempt to explain the charge or to assure himself that the defendant understood it. <em>Cf. Canady v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 203, 205. Asking Adams whether he intended to distribute the cocaine was insufficient to determine whether he understood the charge. Such a question would be as proper in taking a plea to a charge of distribution as in taking a plea to a charge of possession with intent to distribute. This question is of little help in explaining to a defendant the nature of the charge to which he is pleading or in determining that he understands the charge. <em>See Sierra v. Government of Canal Zone, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 77, 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">In this case it is possible that Adams has a colorable entrapment defense. Adams contended that he found the cocaine and that, at least originally, he did not intend to distribute it. Adams could not intelligently decide whether to plead without knowing the basic elements of the charge, including the intent requirement. The trial court should treat the defendant as ignorant of the nature of the charges against him. <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>554 F.2d at 172. In cases where there are plausible defenses, a trial court might well inform the defendant of the possible availability of affirmative defenses, and of the elements of the affirmative defenses. Such instruction would make it clearer that the defendant knowingly and intelligently pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">As we stated in <em>Coronado </em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-11\">In adhering to the rule\u2019s mandate that it address the defendant personally, the court should engage in extensive an interchange as necessary to assure itself and any subsequent reader of the transcript that the defendant does indeed fully understand the charges. With respect to some points the court may choose to have the defendant recount his or her understanding of the charges in narrative form and in his or her own language. We do not suggest an arcane definition of the legal concepts, nor a law review exegesis, but enough simple language that a person unlearned, untutored and unschooled could understand the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amx\">554 F.2d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">Moreover, a determination that the defendant has gone over the indictment with his attorney is not the determination that Rule 11 requires. This procedure, used by the trial court here, could possibly help the trial court determine that the guilty plea is voluntary, as the Constitution requires. It does not fulfill the other purpose of Rule 11, to provide a record that will show that the plea was voluntary. <em>See Sierra v. Government of Canal Zone, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 77, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">C. <em>The consequences of the plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-14\">Rule 11, as amended, requires that the trial judge inform the defendant of the minimum and maximum sentences he faces from the charge to which he pleads. The trial judge correctly informed the defendant of the maximum sentence he faced; there is no minimum sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). The trial judge complied with this aspect of Rule 11. The Rule as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>amended is less stringent than its predecessor. Before December 1, 1975, the Rule required that the defendant be informed of \u201cthe consequences of the plea\u201d. The trial court did not explain the special parole term required by \u00a7 841(b) in connection with all active sentences. Such an explanation is no longer required under the language of the new Rule. <em>See </em>8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 11.02[1] (August 1977 cum. supp. at 71-72). <em>See also </em>1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 173. Nevertheless, such an explanation will often be helpful in determining that the plea was voluntary, as the Constitution requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Because the trial court did not follow Rule 11 literally, we must remand so that Adams may plea again. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">. Rule 11, as amended, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">(c) <em>Advice to Defendant. </em>Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform him of, and determine that he understands, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-7\">(2) if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, that he has the right to be represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceeding against him and, if necessary, one will be appointed to represent him; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-8\">(3) that he has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and that he has the right to be tried by a jury and at that trial has the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">(4) that if he pleads guilty or nolo conten-dere there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty or nolo con-tendere he waives the right to a trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-10\">(5) that if he pleads guilty or nolo conten-dere, the court may ask him questions about the offense to which he has pleaded, and if he answers these questions under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel, his answers may later be used against him in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-11\">(d) <em>Insuring That the Plea is Voluntary. </em>The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or his attorney.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">. We recognize that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Eighth Circuits have approved certain slight deviations from strict compliance with Rule 11. <em>See United States v. Michaelson, 2 </em>Cir. 1977, 552 F.2d 472, 477; <em>United States v. Journet, 2 </em>Cir. 1976, 544 F.2d 633, 637 n.6; <em>United States v. Saft, 2 </em>Cir. 1977, 558 F.2d 1073, 1080; <em>United States v. Scharf, </em>8 Cir. 1977, 551 F.2d 1124, 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">The Supreme Court announced in 1969 that \u201cany noncompliance with Rule 11 is reversible error\u201d. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 464 n.9, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1170, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, 424 n.9. The procedure embodied in Rule 11 has two purposes: \u201cFirst, . it is designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is truly voluntary. Second, the Rule is intended to produce a complete record at the time the plea is entered of the factors relevant to this volun-tariness determination. Thus, the more meticulously the Rule is adhered to, the more it tends to discourage, or at least to enable more expeditious disposition of, the numerous and often frivolous post-conviction attacks on the constitutional validity of guilty pleas.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>1969, 394 U.S. 459, 465, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1170, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, 424-25 (footnotes omitted). <em>See Sierra v.

Rule 11 explicitly requires the court to address the defendant \u201cpersonally in open court\u201d \u2014 not by means of a writing\u2014 and we have reversed convictions on this basis. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Crook, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 526 F.2d 708. \u201cWritings provide no substitute for the rule\u2019s requirement of a personal interchange between court and defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 166, 175 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">While it is true that in <em>Burroughs v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 515 F.2d 824, and <em>United States v. Sapp, </em>5 Cir. 1971, 439 F.2d 817, we approved the use of a written form as a \u201cpartial record surrogate for oral dialogue between the court and the defendant\u201d, <em>Burroughs, </em>515 F.2d at 828, we did so on the basis of oral dialogues considerably more extensive than that involved here. In the case at bar, unlike <em>Burroughs </em>or <em>Sapp, </em>the district court failed even to ask the defendant whether he understood the charge. In addition, in <em>Burroughs </em>we emphasized that reliance on a written form \u201chazards the due performance of the solemn responsibility of plea taking and beclouds appellate review of Rule 11 challenges to those proceedings\u201d. 515 F.2d at 828. Two years later, it is time for courts and prosecutors to grasp that message. In sum, to whatever extent <em>Sapp </em>and <em>Burroughs </em>survive the intervening revision of Rule 11, they cannot help the government here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">. <em>See Sassoon v.

I write to state briefly my own precise view, which I do not think is in conflict with the majority. For essentially the reasons given, and because it is now so painstakingly specific, it seems to me that Amended Rule 11 intends a litany. Not one, to be sure, for mere recitation; the trial judge must carefully and personally explore the defendant\u2019s understanding of each of its items. But a litany in the sense that we should not lightly, or perhaps not at all, undertake to add to it or diminish it by construction. Instead, it is simply to be followed as written, and if so followed, it suffices.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
