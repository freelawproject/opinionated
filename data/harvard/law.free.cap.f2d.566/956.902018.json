We are called upon to construe the following clause of the insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-21\">\u201cin cases where the liability of the Vessel has been contested or proceedings have been taken to limit liability, with the consent in writing, of a majority (in amount) of the Underwriters on the hull and machinery, we will also pay a like proportion of the costs which the Assured shall thereby incur or be compelled to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-22\">Plaintiff contends that the proper construction of this clause is that written consent of the Underwriters is necessary for the payment of costs for \u201cproceedings . to limit liability,\u201d but that the written consent clause does not modify \u201ccases where the liability of the Vessel has been contested.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s proffered interpretation is unconvincing. The clause in question naturally and properly modifies both contests of liability and proceedings to limit liability. There is no comma between the phrases describing the two different types of proceedings in which potentially indemnifiable costs could be incurred, and it is therefore reasonable to read the subsequent modifying clause as relating to both of the preceding phrases. We find that the district court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law correctly state the facts and interpret the law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
