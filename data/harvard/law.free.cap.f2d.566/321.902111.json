They have resided in Hong Kong ever since. When their 1971-72 applications for conditional entry into the United States as Seventh Preference refugees were denied by the District Director at Hong Kong of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), they sought judicial review. In that proceeding the District Court found that appellants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lacked standing and dismissed the suit. In its opinion the court also noted that appellants in any event were not entitled to relief on the merits since the evidentiary record they presented to the Immigration Service indicated they were \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in Hong Kong and thus did not demonstrate that they were still refugees within the controlling statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7). <em>Chinese American Civic Council v. Attorney General, </em>396 F.Supp. 1250 (D.D.C.1975). We affirm the District Court upon the substantive grounds relied upon by the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">The individual appellants, all originally citizens of China, fled to Hong Kong at various times after the communists assumed power in that country. They arrived in Hong Kong between 1949-1956 and all obtained and presently possess Hong Kong Identity Cards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant, Chinese Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>can Civic Council, is a non-profit organization which sponsors and provides assistance to conditional entrants and refugees.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Appellants filed applications for conditional entry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1971 and 1972 with the District Director of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service in Hong Kong.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All five applications were considered, as the statute requires, by \u201can Immigration and Naturalization Service Officer\u201d who notified each applicant by letter that he was satisfied from his \u201ccareful inquiry\u201d they were \u201cnot eligible for the benefits of section 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In deciding on the evidence presented to him that each applicant was \u201cnot eligible for the benefits under section 203(a)(7),\u201d <em>supra, </em>because each of them \u201cis <em>firmiy resettled </em>outside the country from which he fled,\u201d (emphasis added) the Immigration Officer was denying Seventh Preference entry in accordance with the Supreme Court decision in <em>Rosenberg v. Yee Chien Woo, </em>402 U.S. 49, 91 S.Ct. 1312, 28 L.Ed.2d 592 (1971).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Although appellants have never been in the United States they challenged the denials of their applications by suits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia requesting a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. Their basic complaint is that the denials by the INS were arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and invalid. Upon the alternative, motion by the INS to dismiss or for summary judgment the District Court found that appellants lacked standing. It also observed that standing \u201capparently has never been granted to a person outside the United States challenging the denial of entry or immigration eligibility\u201d and that serious practical consequences would result should a person \u201canywhere in the world\u201d be afforded access to the federal courts to contest immigration eligibility. 396 F.Supp. at 1251. With respect to the Chinese American Council the court found that it also lacked standing for want of \u201cconcrete injury to itself or to its members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252. We' affirm that finding without further discussion. <em>Laird v. Tatum, </em>408 U.S. 1, 13, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972); <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>Association of Data Processing Ser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>vice Organizations, Inc. v.

The court reached this conclusion independent of any application of the \u201cHong Kong seven year rule\u201d which the District Director had referred to in his letter to appellants denying their applications because he found them to be \u201cfirmly resettled.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One plaintiff, Shui Chong Kwan, was found to have standing since he had been in the United States since 1967, a factor clearly distinguishing him, for purposes of standing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the other plaintiffs. His case was remanded to the INS for further proceedings. Accordingly, Kwan did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The parties have argued on appeal both the standing question and the merits of whether appellants were wrongfully denied refugee status by the INS District Director. Accordingly, we are not pressed to reach a decision on the standing issue since applicable legal standards lead us to conclude that the Immigration officer correctly decided on the record before him that appellants are not refugees under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7). Prudential considerations also restrain us from deciding the difficult and unquestionably far-reaching standing question when the merits of the case readily provide a fair, clear resolution of the appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Finally, we find that the record on appeal provides us with an adequate basis for affirming the District Court\u2019s order on grounds other than lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">The District Court not only had before it a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment but also, as the court\u2019s decision states,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> considered the \u201centire admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>istrative record\u201d and heard argument. Our review of the record accordingly leads us to' conclude that summary judgment could have been entered in favor of appellees on the same substantive grounds that the agency relied upon.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order on the ground that the motion for summary judgment should have been granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Turning, then, to the merits of appellants\u2019 claim, we find that the undisputed facts which were presented to the Immigration officer by appellants, specifically that sixteen to twenty years had elapsed between appellants\u2019 departures from China and their applications for refugee status, clearly were sufficient to support his conclusion that appellants were not entitled to conditional entry. Appellants did not present any facts to rebut the normal conclusion from such extended residence that appellants were firmly resettled and no longer in flight. On that ground we affirm the judgment of the District Court. Our ground for this conclusion is based on the same reason expressed in the letter of the Immigration officer,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>i. </em>e., that appellants have \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d so as not to be refugees under section 1153(a)(7).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This result is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenberg v. Yee Chien Woo, </em>402 U.S. 49, 91 S.Ct. 1312, 28 L.Ed.2d 592 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>In <em>Rosenberg, </em>the Court was faced with an appeal from an INS decision in the United States denying refugee status to a Chinese national. The appellant Woo, fled communist China in 1953, lived in Hong Kong until 1960 and then moved to the United States upon receiving a temporary permit. When the permit expired the INS initiated deportation proceedings and Woo countered by applying for an immigrant visa claiming Seventh Preference rights as a refugee under section 1153(a)(7). The INS denied the application on the ground that to qualify an applicant\u2019s \u201cphysical presence in the United States [must be] a consequence of an alien\u2019s flight in search of refuge.\u201d 402 U.S. at 57, 91 S.Ct. at 1316. Woo successfully challenged this ruling in District Court which reversed<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the INS. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court and stated that \u201c[w]hether appellee has firmly resettled in Hong Kong is not . relevant.\u201d <em>Chien Woo </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>419 F.2d 252, 254 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">The Supreme Court, in reversing the Ninth Circuit and affirming the standard employed by the INS, provides particular guidance for deciding this case. The Court first found that the concept of resettlement was, contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, essential to the inquiry Congress intended the INS to make in reviewing applications for refugee status.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Next, in what we consider to be dispositive of our case, the Court approved the standard employed by the INS in assessing whether Woo had resettled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">The District Director applied the <em>correct legal standard </em>when he determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00a7 203(a)(7) requires that \u201cphysical presence in the United States [be] a consequence of an alien\u2019s <em>flight </em>in search of refuge,\u201d and further that \u201cthe physical presence must be one which is <em>reasonably proximate to the flight and not one following a flight remote in point of time or interrupted by intervening residence in a third country reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">402 U.S. at 57, 91 S.Ct. at 1317 (footnote omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">This standard of physical presence proximate to flight outside the departed country, as explicitly adopted by the Supreme Court, clearly supports the basis that the Immigration officer gave for denying the instant applications. In looking to whether appellants have \u201cfirmly resettled,\u201d we find that the period of sixteen to twenty years between appellants\u2019 flight and their applications for refugee status convincingly demonstrates that appellants\u2019 applications are not \u201creasonably proximate to [their] flight,\u201d but rather are \u201cremote in point of time\u201d <em>and clearly </em>\u201cinterrupted by intervening residence in a third country.\u201d These facts support the finding of the Immigration officer that, on the record presented to him, appellants\u2019 applications indicated they were \u201cfirmly resettled,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>not still in flight.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The question of resettlement, however, is not always to be limited solely to an inquiry of how much time has elapsed between flight and application. We only hold that the Immigration officer was thoroughly correct in deciding on the facts of record as presented to him that the extended residence of appellants in Hong Kong, which far exceeded the minimal seven years upon which their Chinese resident status was based, is a sufficient basis for finding that appellants were no longer refugees in flight.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Our upholding the Immigration Officer in his finding that the periods of time appellants were resident in Hong Kong between their initial flight and application were sufficient to destroy any Seventh Preference refugee status is not a novel approach. Consideration of elapsed time is often the dominant if not crucial factor employed in assessing whether resettlement has occurred. <em>In Chi-Wai Lui v. Pilliod, </em>358 F.Supp. 542 (N.D.Ill.1973), the court, in concluding that an INS denial of a preference visa should be upheld, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">There is sufficient evidence that plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements established by Congress and implemented by the Service to qualify as refugees. It was reasonable of the Service to conclude from the length of Mr. and Mrs. Lui\u2019s residences in Hong Kong, fourteen and six years respectively, and from the other attendant circumstances as set out in the facts, that both plaintiffs had \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in Hong Kong .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 544. <em>Accord, Matter of Sun, </em>12 I &amp; N Dec. 36 (1966) (refugee preference visa denied when seventeen years had elapsed since applicant had fled his homeland). The periods of time here generally exceed those in these cases. <em>Cf. Matter of Chai, </em>12 I &amp; N Dec. 81 (1967) (presence of five years, as a student, in Hong Kong not sufficient to establish firm resettlement); <em>Matter of Moy, </em>12 I &amp; N Dec. 121 (1967) (presence in Hong Kong for less than one year does not constitute firm resettlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Here we do no more than the court in <em>Chi-Wai Lui v. Pilliod, supra, </em>a case markedly similar to this one, when it concluded that it was, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenberg v. Woo, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"axk-dedup-1\">left to the discretion of the Immigration Service to determine what amount of time of intervening residence in a third country is sufficient to terminate the applicant\u2019s flight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">. It was reasonable of the Service to conclude <em>from the length of Mr. and Mrs. Lui\u2019s residences in Hong Kong, </em>fourteen and six years respectively, and other attendant circumstances . that both plaintiffs had \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in Hong Kong . . . . Under these circumstances, we cannot say that there was an <em>abuse of discretion </em>in denying plaintiffs permanent residence in this country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">358 F.Supp. at 544-45 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"aiy-dedup-0\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">Appellants further contend they should be allowed conditional entry because they applied during 1971 and 1972 and had their applications been passed on before August 1, 1973, they would have been granted. In other words they complain that delay in the agency\u2019s processing of their applications caused theirs to be denied. In the absence of a showing that such delay was intentional or the result of gross negligence we do not consider such delay as a proper basis for granting applications that do not satisfy the statute as presently interpreted by the Supreme Court. There is no showing on this record that the time which transpired in the processing of these applications was unreasonable, given the extensive consideration that agency procedures required.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Nor do we find that the Immigration Officer was required further to explain the alleged change in INS practices around April 1, 1973. The references in the INS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>letter<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to the \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d standard of <em>Rosenberg, </em>decided April 21,1971, and to the 1971 Hong Kong Ordinance which became effective April 1, 1972, were self-explanatory. The effect on the decision of these recent developments was also clearly stated. While a more precise explanation would have been helpful, it is sufficient that the recently reaffirmed \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d requirement of <em>Rosenberg </em>required a denial of the applications and that was the basis stated for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">It is also significant that each appellant who considered \u201cthe denial of [his] application [to be] erroneous or . not [to] apply to [him] . . . \u201d was notified that his \u201capplication may be considered further\u201d if he notified the Immigration Office within 30 days \u201cof the basis for [his] objection <em>supported </em>by any evidence and requested] that [he] be interviewed with respect to [his] application ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">This evoked letters from applicants\u2019 attorneys in Chicago, Illinois, requesting reconsideration of each denial and a hearing reiterating many of the claims raised here, calling attention to the \u201cStatutory Declarations\u201d that were filed, and stating that if their clients had been interviewed they were not aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Thereafter, it appears that two applicants (Lee and Yuen) appeared with their attorney and were interviewed. They each stated their date of entry into Hong Kong as 1951 and 1959, respectively, and stated they never made application to Hong Kong Immigration for \u201cChinese resident\u201d classification.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition Lau sent a letter merely stating the circumstances which compelled him to leave China and restating his desire to gain entry to the United States. The record does not indicate that the other applicants took any additional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">None of the material presented on these occasions was sufficient to overturn the pri- or conclusion that those three were firmly resettled in Hong Kong and hence were not refugees in flight entitled to Seventh Preference entry. Lee, Yuen and Lau had been residing in Hong Kong for 20 years, 21 years and 9 months, and 17 years and 10 months, respectively, and all the evidence they presented to the Immigration officer, both with their application and subsequently, proved their residence in Hong Kong for those periods of time, that they were firmly resettled in Hong Kong, and that they were not then refugees in flight from communism.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Finally, our decision is consonant with, if not bolstered by, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(d) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">Every immigrant shall be presumed to be a nonpreference immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer and the immigration offices that he is entitled to a preference status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">This language makes clear that Congress intended that each immigrant should shoulder the burden of proving that he qualifies for a preference. This presumption was not overcome by the material presented to the Immigration Officer, nor was the burden met in view of the extended residence of appellants in Hong Kong before application. The \u201cremoteness in point of time\u201d of appellants\u2019 applications in this ease establish that appellants are outside the standard of flight, and within the \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d standard, as enunciated in <em>Rosenberg. </em>Those two elements had to be respectively proved or negated in order to qualify for a section 1153(a)(7) preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">We therefore find that the INS District Director did not abuse his discretion in find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ing that appellants were \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d and not entitled to conditional entry as refugees. The District Court order dismissing appellants\u2019 suit is affirmed on this ground.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">.

After the most careful inquiry and after extensive consultation with appropriate Hong Kong authorities with respect to the effect of the Hong Kong Immigration Ordinance 1971, I have concluded that you appear to be eligible in all respects for official recognition by the Immigration Department, Hong Kong, as a \u201cChinese resident\u201d within the meaning of the Ordinance which became effective April 1, 1972. The Ordinance accords \u201cChinese resident\u201d status to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>those persons who have legally resided in Hong Kong for 7 or more years and to those persons who have been residing in Hong Kong, whether legally or not, since prior to April 1, 1965. A \u201cChinese resident\u201d enjoys the privilege of unconditional residence and is deemed under U.S. law to be firmly resettled. A person who is firmly resettled outside the country from which he fled is not eligible for the benefits of section 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOmS\">If you believe that the foregoing basis for the denial of your application is erroneous or does not apply to you, your application may be considered further if you, no later than 30 days from the date of this letter, notify this office of the basis for your objection supported by any evidence and request that you be interviewed with respect to your application for conditional entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">I repeat my regret that it has been necessary to take this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXr\">/s/ Sam I.

That opinion holds that the statute which opens the doors of this country to those who have \u201cfled\u201d from fear of communism, or its persecution, imposes a requirement that applicants be in flight at the time they apply for conditional entry to this country and that those who became \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in another non-communist country after flight from a communist country are not, under the statute, eligible under \u00a7 203(a)(7) for conditional entry to the United States. As Justice Black remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">It was never intended to open the United States to refugees who had found shelter in another nation and had begun to build new lives. Nor could Congress have intended to make refugees in flight from persecution compete with all of the world\u2019s <em>resettled refugees </em>for the 10,200 entries and permits afforded each year under \u00a7 203(a)(7). Such an interpretation would subvert the lofty goals embodied in the whole pattern of our refugee legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-15\">In short, we hold that the \u201cresettlement\u201d concept is not irrelevant. It is one of the factors which the Immigration and Naturalization Service must take into account to determine whether a refugee seeks asylum in this country as a consequence of his flight to avoid persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">402 U.S. at 56, 91 S.Ct. at 1316 (emphasis added). The opinion further sets forth the correct legal standard to use in determining refugee and flight status under \u00a7 203(a)(7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-17\">[T]he physical presence must be one which is reasonably proximate to the flight and not one following a flight remote in point of time or interrupted by intervening residence in a third country reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">402 U.S. at 57, 91 S.Ct. at 1317.

Standing was never considered as an issue in the <em>Rosenberg </em>case. Accordingly, an inquiry into whether non-resident aliens who have never had contact with United States have standing in a suit such as this is not aided by <em>Rosenberg </em>where the disappointed applicant was actually present in the United States when he initiated the litigation. Presence inside the United States is crucial and has been recognized in the past, by this court, to bear heavily on the question of standing. In <em>Pesikoff v. Secretary of Labor, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 501 F.2d 757, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1038, 95 S.Ct. 525, 42 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974), we held that an American citizen who wished to employ an alien had standing to challenge a denial of a preference under \u00a7 1153. In so holding our opinion explicitly negated any inference that an alien who was physically outside the United States had standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">Inasmuch as we hold that Dr. Pesikoff, as the prospective employer of the alien . . . does have standing . . . it is not necessary for us to consider whether Ms. Quintero, as an alien outside the country, may also challenge denial of her certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">163 U.S.App.D.C. at 199, 501 F.2d at 759. Similarly, the separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">In view of the disposition I would make herein I do not find it necessary to determine whether appellant Quintero as a nonresident alien, has standing to bring this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">163 U.S.App.D.C. at 205 n. 3, 501 F.2d at 765 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Again, the notion that the existence or lack of standing may be affected by presence in the United States, albeit illegal, is found in <em>Brow-nell v. Tom We Shung, </em>352 U.S. 180, 77 S.Ct. 252, 1 L.Ed.2d 225 (1956). There the Court noted, in holding that an alien <em>present at the borders of the United States </em>could challenge an exclusion order either by habeas corpus proceedings or by seeking a declaratory judgment (later limited by Congress to habeas corpus proceedings, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(b)), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">We do not suggest, of course, that an alien who has never presented himself at the borders of this country may avail himself of the declaratory judgment action by bringing the action from abroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 184 n. 3, 77 S.Ct. at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">Consistent with our decision not to reach the standing issue in this case we mention this distinction, not to intimate our views on whether a non-resident alien has standing, but only to underscore that <em>Rosenberg, </em>aside from its silence on standing is clearly distinguishable from this case regarding standing and that as in <em>Pesikoff, supra, </em>the question remains open in this circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b413-20\">. The Court found, that while the language employed by Congress in the various Acts covering refugee immigration varied, that the concept of \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d was still an integral part of the present statutory scheme. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-21\">For substantially the reasons stated by the Second Circuit in <em>Shen v.

Appellants and the INS argue over whether the District Director correctly applied the Hong Kong Ordinance of 1971 as a basis for denying their applications. Because we are affirming the INS in its determination that appellants were \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d within the standards established by the Supreme Court in <em>Rosenberg v. Woo, </em>402 U.S. 49, 91 S.Ct. 1312, 28 L.Ed.2d 592 (1971), we do not reach the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the Hong Kong rule beyond the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">As we interpret the decision of the Immigration officer, he had a right to and he did decide on the evidentiary record before him that appellants\u2019 16 to 20 years uninterrupted residence in Hong Kong, with the added assurance such residence acquired under the 1971 Ordinance, clearly justified a conclusion that they could continue to rely upon. the firmness of their residence and hence were firmly resettled. The evidence they presented to the District Director showed that each of them met the Ordinance\u2019s requirement of seven consecutive years\u2019 residence in Hong Kong, \u201cwhether <em>legally or </em>not\u201d (emphasis added), necessary in order to qualify for Chinese resident status and the Ordinance gave persons with such residential qualifications reasonable assurance that they would not be deported, <em>in the absence of any disqualifying showing in the record to the contrary. </em>He was therefore justified in holding that each applicant was to be considered \u201cnot eligible for the benefits of \u00a7 203(a)(7),\u201d <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">We accordingly affirm based on our conclusions from the facts of record that the decision of the Immigration officer was correct in finding, on this record, that appellants were firmly resettled, <em>i. e., </em>not still in flight, because their applications are clearly <em>\u201cremote in point of time [and] interrupted by intervening residence in a third country </em>reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge.\u201d <em>Rosenberg v. Woo, </em>402 U.S. at 57, 91 S.Ct. at 1317 (emphasis added). This was what the District Director based his decision on when he referred to our law on firm resettlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">. Other factors besides time elapsed may be germane in deciding whether an applicant has \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d so as to be eligible for refugee status. An applicant\u2019s family ties, intent, business or property connections and other matters may be relevant to resettlement determinations. To the extent that these were presented to the Immigration Officer they were insufficient to support a finding that any of the appellants were still in flight and not firmly resettled in Hong Kong. Resettlement is largely a factual question which, once that fact appears of record, the applicants bear the burden of overcoming. As we read the record which was before the INS official in this case, we conclude that he did not abuse the long-standing discretion accorded the INS in these matters in finding that applicants because of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>long residence in Hong Kong did not qualify for Seventh Preference status as refugees still in flight.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">The scope of judicial review in cases of denial of preference visas is very narrow.

This opinion does not consider whether appellants might successfully attain other immigration preference categories or whether they are eligible for immediate relative status. While appellants are ineligible for refugee preference visas, we are not in any way passing upon the eligibility of any one of them to obtain entry into the United States under the statutory provisions specifically designed by Congress to alleviate those situations where an alien\u2019s family relationships warrant entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b417-6\">FRANK A.

All of the individual appellants have suffered injury. The Council sponsors at least one of the individual appellants. It is seemingly recognized by the INS as a representative of applicants such as the individual appellants. \u201cWhere there is no effect on the organization itself, standing to represent the interests of its members has come most easily when an administrative agency itself has recognized the organization as a representative.\u201d 13 Wright, Miller and Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3531 at 213 (1975) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The issue of whether an association, operating and existing within the United States, has standing to represent its members or those whom it sponsors, when such persons are determined to be without standing solely because of lack of physical presence in the United States, has not been specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>presented or determined herein. Accordingly, before I would affirm the judgment below on grounds of lack of standing of the Council, I would remand this case to the District Court for further consideration of that issue and for further testimony with regard to the role of the Council and its relationship with persons such as the individual appellants. But since I am in accord with Judge MacKinnon\u2019s conclusion on the substantive issue presented in this appeal, I agree that no remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\n<em>Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The District Court\u2019s observation that appellants \u201care confronted with an almost ir-rebuttable presumption that * * * they have \u2018firmly resettled\u2019 in Hong Kong and are no longer \u2018in search of refuge\u2019 \u201d hits the nail on the head. 396 F.Supp. at 1251-52 n. 2.

The District Director applied the correct legal standard when he determined that \u00a7 203(a)(7) requires that \u201cphysical presence in the United States [be] a consequence of an alien\u2019s flight in search of refuge,\u201d and further that \u201cthe physical presence must be one which is reasonably proximate to the flight and not one following a flight remote in point of time or interrupted by intervening residence in a third country reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 56, 91 S.Ct. at 1316-1317 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The denial letter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does erroneously apply the Hong Kong Ordinance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letter seemingly also does not correctly apply the <em>Rosenberg </em>doctrine because it appears to assume that long residence creates an <em>irre-buttable </em>presumption of \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d. But the letter nevertheless does basically rest upon that doctrine as the core reason for its negative decision. \u201cThe grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). <em>See also Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962). Still, there is \u201csome play in the joints\u201d of that doctrine. K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 16.12 at 581 (1970 Supp.), discussing, in a slightly different context, the effect of <em>Penn-Central Merger </em>and <em>N &amp; W Inclusion Cases, </em>389 U.S. 486, 88 S.Ct. 602, 19 L.Ed.2d 723 (1968), upon the <em>Chen-ery </em>principle. That \u201cplay\u201d in this case eliminates the need for reversal because of any violation of the <em>Chenery </em>principle, particularly since the individual appellants were given the chance to rebut the effects of their long residences in Hong Kong and to present other facts relevant under the <em>Rosenberg </em>test. Judge MacKinnon (pp.-- - of 185 U.S.App.D.C., p. 330 of 566 F.2d) has carefully reviewed the opportunity given to each of the individual appellants <em>after </em>the denial letter was sent to them and their failure to present any data which, under the <em>Rosenberg </em>\u201cfirmly resettled\u201d test, would have permitted an administrative determination other than a negative one. Thus, not only were the appellants dealt with fairly, but the total administrative action embodied in the combination of the denial letter, the post-letter opportunities afforded to appellants, and appellants\u2019 failures to rebut the effect of their respective lengthy Hong Kong residences adds up to (a) fair procedure and (b) correct and indeed compelled substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>application of <em>Rosenberg. </em>Thus, in this case, a strict application of the <em>Chenery </em>doctrine is not called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. <em>See </em>n.5 in Judge MacKinnon\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-13\">.
