New York, </em>432 U.S. 197 (1977). We hold that <em>Patterson </em>controls our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The appeals before us are from judgments entered in the Southern District of New York on state prisoners\u2019 petitions for writs of habeas corpus (1) denying Farrell\u2019s petition in No. 76-2131, Charles M. Metz-ner, <em>District Judge, </em>and (2) granting Reid-out\u2019s petition in No. 76-2144, Marvin E. Frankel, <em>District Judge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Under attack on the instant appeals is New York\u2019s first degree robbery statute, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.15(4) (McKinney 1975), which permits a defendant who, in the course of a robbery, \u201c[displays what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm\u201d to raise as \u201can affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a loaded weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury, could be discharged.\u201d If he does not sustain his burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant can be convicted of first degree robbery. If he does sustain the burden, he will be convicted of second degree robbery. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.10(2)(b) (McKinney 1975). By placing the burden of proving the affirmative defense on a defendant, New York was said, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Patterson, </em>to have contravened the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The Supreme Court in <em>Patterson, </em>however, restricted <em>Mullaney </em>by holding that a state, without violating the Constitution, may place on a defendant the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a matter not defined by the legislature as a necessary ingredient of the crime but which mitigates the degree of the offense. Under the New York first degree robbery statute, possession of a weapon actually capable of causing death is not a necessary ingredient of the offense, since the prosecutor is not required to prove the presence of such a factor in order for a defendant to be convicted of first degree robbery. Moreover, proof that the gun was not capable of causing death does not entirely exonerate the defendant of criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">We hold that under <em>Patterson </em>the New York first degree robbery statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Affirmed as to the denial of the Farrell petition (No. 76-2131); reversed as to the grant of the Reidout petition (No. 76 \u2014 2144).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b468-13\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AyIb\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">I join in the judgment of the court, but for somewhat different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">In <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional Maine\u2019s allocation of the persuasion burden to murder defendants on the mitigating circumstance of action \u201cin the heat of passion on sudden provocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684-85, <em>quoting </em>Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., Tit. 17, \u00a7 2551 (1964). In <em>Patterson v. State of New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977), the Court upheld New York\u2019s allocation of the persuasion burden to murder defendants on the mitigating circumstance of action \u201cunder the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d <em>Id., quoting </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(2) (McKinney 1975). Mr. Justice Powell, who wrote <em>Mullaney, </em>dissented in <em>Patterson. </em>He criticized the purported distinction between the two cases as purely \u201cformalistic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221-225, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>97 S.Ct. 2319. Unlike the Maine statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the New York legislature denoted the mitigating factor as an affirmative defense without mentioning either the presence or absence of the factor in the core definition of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Farrell and Reidout question the constitutionality of New York\u2019s robbery statute to the extent that it requires a defendant to prove that his firearm was unloaded. If he can prove that it was, then his crime is mitigated from first to second degree robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With all due respect, the <em>Patterson </em>decision, and its failure to overrule <em>Mulla-ney, see </em>432 U.S. at 212-217, 97 S.Ct. 2319, raises as many questions as it answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">First, it could be argued that the statute effects a shift of the persuasion burden on an element of the crime. Because a defendant may be convicted of <em>first </em>degree robbery when, <em>inter alia, </em>he \u201c[displays <em>what appears to be </em>a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.15(4) (McKinney 1975) (emphasis added), the core definition of the crime does not require that the weapon be loaded. It need only \u201cappear\u201d to be such. The operative effect of the statute, however, is to create a presumption that the weapon is loaded. The defendant must rebut that presumption or stand convicted of first degree robbery. If the defendant\u2019s rebuttal fails, he stands convicted of a crime under the statute which, even though drafted not to require that the weapon be loaded, in fact so operates. Otherwise, it would make no sense to differentiate first from second degree robbery on the basis of whether a weapon is loaded. Because the defendant must prove the negative of the first degree robbery statute\u2019s operative effect, this case arguably resembles that aspect of <em>Mullaney </em>which condemned the shift of the persuasion burden on the factor of heat of passion on sudden provocation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Patterson </em>might also be viewed as suggesting that the only factors significant enough to require the prosecution to shoulder the burden of proving are those which are part of the core definition of the crime and which are therefore determinative of guilt. Thus, if the negative of one such factor were required to be proved by the defendant, presumably even under <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>strictures, a due process violation could be found. Under that view, this case could be disposed of as merely presenting a difference between degrees of crime and not between guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That is what the majority opinion here suggests, I presume, when it concludes that \u201cproof that the gun was not capable of causing death does not entirely exonerate the defendant of criminal liability.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 6156. Of course, proof of acting in the heat of passion in <em>Mullaney </em>did not entirely exonerate the defendant there of criminal liability; it only reduced his crime from murder to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Ultimately, it may be that the <em>Patterson </em>Court opted for a highly \u201cformalistic\u201d approach, as the dissenting opinion suggests, 432 U.S. at 221-225, 97 S.Ct. 2319, thereby leaving lower court judges without \u201ca conceptual framework,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 225, 97 S.Ct. 2319 for distinguishing <em>Mullaney </em>shifts from <em>Patterson </em>shifts. In any event, <em>Mullaney, </em>while not expressly overruled, has been drained \u201cof much of its vitality,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 216, 97 S.Ct. 2319, and for present purposes perhaps all.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I come then to the same result as my brethren, only in a somewhat less inexorable, slightly more perplexed way. I suppose that I am left with the proposition after <em>Patterson </em>that if a legislature includes in the definition of a crime a significant factor whose negative may be proved by the defendant as an affirmative defense, and the affirmative defense has been one of historical significance \u201cin the Anglo-American legal tradition,\u201d <em>id. </em>432 U.S. at 226, 97 S.Ct. at 2335, and the crime is historically and conceptually separate in kind, as opposed to degree, from the crime if the affirmative defense were proven, there may still be a due process violation where the burden of proof has shifted to the defendant. Under this proposition, however, appellant Farrell and appellee Reidout both lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. Maine law defined murder as the unlawful killing of a human being \u201cwith malice aforethought,\u201d Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., Tit. 17, \u00a7 2651 (1964), and manslaughter as an unlawful killing \u201cin the heat of passion, on sudden provocation, without express or implied malice aforethought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2551. The effect of the Maine statute, as interpreted by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, was to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant to disprove malice aforethought for the purpose of mitigating his crime. <em>Mullaney </em>found this shift of the burden to violate the due process standards of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). <em>See </em>421 U.S. at 696-704, 95 S.Ct. 188.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. The <em>Patterson </em>majority\u2019s definitional compartmentalization of elements of the crime from mitigating factors was thought to be formalistic by Mr. Justice Powell, because as he pointed out the Maine Supreme Judicial Court had held that malice was <em>not </em>an independent element of the crime of murder in Maine. 432 U.S. at 221 &amp; n.4, 223 &amp; n.7, 97 S.Ct. 2319. The state had so held even though the language of malice appeared in the definition of crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.15(4). The statute states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when he forcibly steals property and when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aut-dedup-0\">Displays what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a loaded weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury, could be discharged. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, robbery in the second degree, robbery in the third degree or any other crime.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-13\">. This is not to suggest that Farrell and Reid-out have fully satisfied what were thought to be the due process requirements of <em>Mullaney. </em>Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s <em>Patterson </em>dissent pointed out that the mitigating defense here involved was a \u201c[n]ew ameliorative affirmative defense\u201d which \u201cneed not [have been] disturbed\u201d even if <em>Patterson </em>had followed <em>Mul-laney </em>more enthusiastically. 432 U.S. at 229, 97 S.Ct. 2319. The very statute here at issue was his first example of such a \u201c[n]ew ameliorative affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.14. Thus, this case would not satisfy the <em>Mullaney </em>test, not because it met <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>formalistic requirements, but because the distinguishing feature of first from second degree robbery \u2014 whether the gun was loaded \u2014 does not have the same historical significance in the common law definition of robbery as had the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d language at issue in <em>Mullaney. See id. </em>at 230, 97 S.Ct. 2319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. <em>Mullaney </em>would then have to be looked at as involving two separate crimes, murder and manslaughter, rather than decrees of homicide. For the conceptual difficulties involved in this analysis, see the discussion in <em>United States ex rel. Jackson v. Follette, </em>462 F.2d 1041 (2d Cir.) (double jeopardy context), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1045, 93 S.Ct. 544, 34 L.Ed.2d 496 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
