Following a trial to the court, the district judge ruled that the aggrieved ex-wife, Mabel Crouch, was entitled to receive from her former husband the sum of $45,000. Appealing this judgment, Mr. Crouch raises two issues for our consideration: whether the lower court should have refused to exercise diversity jurisdiction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of the domestic relations overtones in the case and whether the district judge erred in fashioning its award of damages. We turn first to the more important question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Federal courts have traditionally refused to exercise diversity jurisdiction in a variety of domestic relations cases, including suits for divorce and alimony, see <em>Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, </em>280 U.S. 379, 50 S.Ct. 154, 74 L.Ed. 489 (1930); <em>Barber v. Barber, </em>62 U.S. (21 How.), 582, 584, 16 L.Ed. 226 (1859) (dictum); child custody actions, see <em>Ex parte Burrus, </em>136 U.S. 586, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890); disputes over visitation rights, see <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>516 F.2d 1018 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Hernstadt v. Hernstadt, </em>373 F.2d 316 (2d Cir. 1967); suits to establish paternity and to obtain child support, see <em>Buechold v. Ortiz, </em>401 F.2d 371 (9th Cir. 1968); <em>Albanese v. Richter, </em>161 F.2d 688 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 U.S. 782, 68 S.Ct. 49, 92 L.Ed. 365 (1947); and actions to enforce separation or divorce decrees still subject to state court modification, see <em>Lynde v. Lynde, </em>181 U.S. 183, 21 S.Ct. 555, 45 L.Ed. 810 (1901); <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>273 F.2d 678 (7th Cir. 1960). The reasons for federal abstention in these cases are apparent: the strong state interest in domestic relations matters, the competence of state courts in settling family disputes, the possibility of incompatible- federal and state court decrees in cases of continuing judicial supervision by the state, and the problem of congested dockets in federal courts. <em>See Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>508 F.2d 348, 349-50 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim &amp; Ballon v. Rosenstiel, </em>490 F.2d 509, 514 (2d Cir. 1973); C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of Federal Courts \u00a7 25, at 97 (3d ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">While we approvingly acknowledge the so-called domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find it inapplicable to the instant case, which involves little more than a private contract to pay money between persons long since divorced, whose children are well into adulthood. We are faced here with no questions of custody or parental rights, no pending state court action or agreement to litigate in state court, and no threat that the former spouses will seek to play one court system off against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the other. <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>516 F.2d at 1025. Nor do we perceive any strong state interest in the adjudication of this suit or any special competence on the part of state courts, other than their superior ability to interpret state law, which is always present in diversity suits. Because none of the rationales for the domestic relations exception obtain in this case \u2014 with the possible exception of congested federal dockets \u2014 we uphold the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and proceed to determine the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The separation agreement in dispute here was executed in 1974, following Mr. Crouch\u2019s persistent failure to honor the support agreement that was drawn up when he and Mrs. Crouch separated in 1957. Under the terms of the more recent agreement, Mr. Crouch was obligated to pay his former wife (1) the sum of $2,500, (2) $4,000 annually for five years, and (3) $150 per month for the rest of her life. Appellant fulfilled these obligations for a time, paying a total of $9,000 but then breached the agreement, and the present litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The lower court found that Mr. Crouch had repudiated the separation agreement and that his former wife had accepted his repudiation. Appellant does not contest these findings but contends that the district court erred when it calculated the damages for appellant\u2019s breach of his promise to pay monthly installments of $150 by multiplying that figure times the factor for the number of months appellee is expected to live under the pertinent actuarial table. Mr. Crouch\u2019s argument is that this evaluation improperly ignores the separation agreement\u2019s disability clause, which relieved him of the duty to make any monthly payments in the event of his total and permanent incapacitation. While the district court rejected Mr. Crouch\u2019s claim of present disability resulting from his diabetic condition, appellant now contends that the possibility of future incapacity precluded the court\u2019s lump-sum award. If we were to accept this argument, the only alternative form of relief would be an order decreeing specific performance as to future installments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 4 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 969, at 893 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Texas law provides no specific answer to appellant\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s position that the disability clause should be ignored receives some support from <em>Rapid Transit Lines, Inc. v. Transit Ads, Inc., </em>401 S.W.2d 276 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Eastland 1966, no writ), which involved the anticipatory repudiation by a transit company of an advertising firm\u2019s exclusive advertising rights on the transit company\u2019s buses. In that case the court not only upheld the award of damages for the initial term of the contract but also upheld the award of damages for a five-year option contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the contract, even though the option was conditioned on the city\u2019s renewal of the transit company\u2019s franchise. Nonetheless, since the court in <em>Rapid Transit </em>offered no explanation for this ruling, we must consult general principles of Texas contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In Texas the anticipatory repudiation of a contract entitles the wronged party to recover, as of the date of repudiation, the present value of all that he would have received had the contract been performed. <em>See Republic Bankers Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Jaeger, </em>551 S.W.2d 30, 31 (Tex.1976); <em>Pollack v. Pollack, </em>39 S.W.2d 853, 855 (Tex. Comm\u2019n App.1931, holding approved); <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Boerger, </em>389 S.W.2d 566, 568 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Waco 1965, writ dism\u2019d); <em>Patterson v. Magill, </em>259 S.W.2d 954, 956 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Austin 1953, no writ). To take an analogous case, if an insurance company repudiates its agreement to pay monthly installments to a disabled policyholder, the insured can, by bringing an action for anticipatory breach, recover the value of those installments in lump sum. <em>See Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Klotz, </em>251 F.2d 499 (5th Cir. 1958) (applying Texas law); <em>Williams v. Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>100 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1938) (applying Texas law); <em>Pan American Life Insurance Co. v. Garrett, </em>199 S.W.2d 819, 824-25 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014El Paso 1946, no writ); <em>Englehart v. Volunteer State Life Insurance Co., </em>195 S.W.2d 798, 802 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Eastland 1946, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.) (dictum). But that sum would have to be calculated with reference to the probable duration of the disability as found by judge or jury. <em>See Universal Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. v. Sanders, </em>129 Tex. 344, 348, 102 S.W.2d 405, 407-08 (Tex.Comm\u2019n App.1937, opinion adopted); <em>Commercial Travelers Casualty Co. v. Dymke, </em>279 S.W.2d 405 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Eastland 1955, no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">While we agree with appellant that repudiation does not change the terms of the contract, <em>see Newman v. San Antonio Traction Co., </em>155 S.W. 688, 690 (Tex.Civ. App. \u2014 San Antonio 1913, no writ), and that the wronged party is limited to recovering expectancy damages, we cannot agree that the lower court\u2019s damage award would have been proper only if appellee had shown that her former husband will not become disabled during her lifetime. Appellee need prove damages only to a reasonable certainty, <em>see Fredonia Broadcasting Corp. v. RCA Corp., </em>481 F.2d 781, 804 (5th Cir. 1973) (applying Texas law); <em>International Harvester Co. v. Kesey, </em>507 S.W.2d 195, 197 (Tex.1974); <em>Bildon Farms, Inc. v. Ward County Water Improvement District No. 2, </em>415 S.W.2d 890, 896-97 (Tex.1967), a stan dard we find satisfied in this case. The possibility of future incapacity is a much too speculative reason for denying lump-sum recovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whatever uncertainty does exist about the damages in this case has been caused by Mr. Crouch\u2019s own failure, over the course of seventeen years, to abide by the separation agreements executed between himself and his former wife. This failure is in itself a persuasive argument for the inadequacy of a decree ordering specific performance of future monthly payments under the 1974 contract. Furthermore, we note that the purpose of the disability clause is to relieve Mr. Crouch of the duty to make monthly payments during a time of financial hardship. Mr. Crouch was found able at the time judgment was entered in this case, a time which \u2014 if premature \u2014 was determined by Mr. Crouch\u2019s own defaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the trial court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-12\">. When Mr. and Mrs. Crouch separated in 1957, both were North Carolinians. In the year following Mr. Crouch moved to Texas, where he still resides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">. No Fifth Circuit case has discussed the domestic relations exception, although we did affirm a district judge\u2019s observation that federal courts should not exercise diversity jurisdiction in divorce,actions. <em>Lutsky v. Lutsky, </em>433 F.2d 346 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>affirming </em>310 F.Supp. 517 (S.D.Fla.1970). See <em>also In re Frei-berg, </em>262 F.Supp. 482 (E.D.La.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\">. In <em>Gullet v. Gullet, </em>188 F.2d 719 (5th Cir. 1951), this court heard a suit to collect unpaid alimony under a final divorce decree but did not discuss the domestic relations exception. And a district court within our circuit did likewise in <em>Hemphill v. Hemphill, </em>398 F.Supp. 1134 (N.D.Ga.1975). We find <em>Gullet </em>and <em>Hemphill </em>indistinguishable from this case, all being actions merely to recover a fixed sum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">. In his brief, appellant argues that relief should be had only as to accrued payments, but this is untenable. One who breaches a contract may not escape liability by reason of the injured party\u2019s inability to prove damages with exactness. <em>See Dessommes v. Dessommes, </em>505 S.W.2d 673, 680 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1973, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); <em>Southwest Battery Corp. v. Owen, </em>131 Tex. 423, 428, 115 S.W.2d 1097, 1099 (1938); Texas <em>Sanitation Co. v. Marek, </em>381 S.W.2d 710, 715 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1964, no writ).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">. We arrive at the applicable law by resort to Texas\u2019 conflicts rules, to which we are bound by <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). Under those choice of law rules the applicable law in a breach of contract case is generally that of the place where the contract was made \u2014 in this case, Texas \u2014 unless the agreement is to be performed solely in another jurisdiction, in which case the apposite law is that of the place of performance. <em>Ramirez v. Autobuses Blancos Flecha Roja, S.A. De C.V., </em>486 F.2d 493, 496 (5th Cir. 1973) (applying Texas law). Without belaboring the point, we observe that the separation agreement in this case will be at least partially performed in Texas because the payor resides in that state. Thus, Texas law is controlling. <em>See id</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. While it occurs to us that Mr. Crouch\u2019s life expectancy could be taken into account in determining the possibility of future incapacity, <em>compare Pollack v. Pollack, </em>39 S.W.2d 853 (Tex.Comm\u2019n App.1931, holding approved), since one is certainly disabled at death, the 1974 agreement, contains an insurance clause protecting against Mr. Crouch\u2019s predecease. This makes appellant\u2019s life expectancy irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
