The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>basis for these rejections was the underlined portion of the claim recitation: \u201cA composition of matter for treating lymphatic congestions . . . Thus, the board summarized the examiner\u2019s position (with which it agreed) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-6\">The examiner\u2019s position is that the expression \u201clymphatic congestions\u201d is undefined in the specification and does not appear to define a specific condition, but rather to describe a symptom which can be associated with an extremely large number of pathological conditions of varying etiology. The examiner\u2019s position is further that, because of the wide number of possible diseases involved, some of which are known to be extremely therapy resistant, the utility disclosed is inherently incredible and requires a high degree of proof of utility and a quite specific disclosure of how to use the claimed compositions with respect to the various disease states possibly contemplated in order to meet the requirements of 35 USC 101 and 112.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Regarding the section 101 rejection, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-8\">Although the treatment of cancer is not expressly disclosed in the specification, the totality of the evidence of record strongly suggests that it must be at least implicitly included within the disclosure of \u201clymphatic congestions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">The board noted that utility was particularly lacking in claim 1, which recites only families of plants, as opposed to genuses, since \u201c[i]t is considered most unlikely that these varied plant types will yield the same drug extracts.\u201d It did not specifically address the examiner\u2019s rejection of all claims for failure to set forth the best mode, as required by section 112, or his rejection under section 101 for lack of proof of safety-</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">The board also sustained the examiner\u2019s rejection under section 112 (for lack of en-ablement) of claims 5, 9-11, 17, 20, and 21, based on disclosure in the specification that \u201cointment base\u201d (recited in these claims) is an active part of the composition and not merely an inert carrier; and also based, in the case of claims 20 and 21, on disclosure that \u201csulphur-containing amino acid\u201d is an active ingredient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">Finally, the board sustained the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) of claim 14 over appellant\u2019s German application No. 1,931,-467, published December 23, 1970, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-16\">The limitation [in claim 14] \u201cbetween about 3% and about 35% of potassium arsenite\u201d does not appear in appellant\u2019s parent application, and the invention including that limitation is thus not described therein. Example 7 of the above specified published application discloses a composition which is a species within the genus claimed in appealed claim 14, and thus the claim is anticipated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-17\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">\n<em>1. Defining \u201cLymphatic Congestion\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-19\">The meaning of \u201clymphatic congestion\u201d in appellant\u2019s specification is the threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-20\">The specification discloses the intended use of the compositions to be the removal of \u201clymphatic congestions.\u201d The sections 101 and 112 rejections are based upon the construction of this term by the PTO. Although the specification does not set forth a specific definition of the term, it does disclose using the compositions for treating a symptom or condition in which the lymphatic vessels are clogged, or the lymph flow is otherwise retarded. Appellant' argues that the words \u201clymphatic congestion\u201d are common and well known and should be given their ordinary meaning; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the term, as used in the specification, is limited to simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>lymphatic congestion (clogged lymph vessels) and does not extend to the causes or results of lymphatic congestion (various therapy resistant diseases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">The board, on the other hand, found \u201cthat the term is intended to include lymphatic edemas resulting from various trauma including postoperative trauma and any number of disease states, including various forms of cancer\u201d; further, that \u201cthe totality of the evidence of record strongly suggests that it [cancer] must be at least implicitly included within the disclosure of \u2018lymphatic congestion.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Nevertheless, we conclude that appellant\u2019s compositions are intended only for treatment of congestions or stoppages in the lymph system. The specification contains fifteen examples of such treatment. There is no mention of use in treating cancer. Appellant\u2019s brief sets forth the following explanation, which is entirely consistent with the specification and the dictionary definitions, <em>supra </em>note 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-6\">As a result of the clogging, lymph may not flow beyond the point of clogging but lymph continues to flow toward that point, thereby filling to excess with lymph the space in the tubes upstream of the point of stopage. As this overfilling continues the pressure it exerts on the walls of the tubes increases and the lymph passes through those walls, which are porous, and into the space between the cells in the surrounding flesh, thereby producing edemas and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">The record clearly shows that the compositions were developed for the \u201cactivation and regeneration of the lymphatic vessels and of the lymph nodes associated with them\u201d; that one of the criteria for determining the effectiveness of the composition is the \u201ctendency of the swellings of the tissues to decrease on account of the treatment\u201d; that these compounds are \u201csuited to diminish inflammatory changes of the lymphatic system and to remove conges-tions as well as products deposited in the lymph\u201d; and that the result of treatment is \u201cthe effective drainage of the entire lymphatic system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">The board\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s compositions are intended for treatment of diseases that cause or result from lymphatic congestions apparently rests on a semantical interpretation of the word \u201ccovers\u201d in the board\u2019s statement that appellant \u201cacknowledged\u201d in Paper No. 8 (amendment of January 14, 1975, in response to office action of August 12, 1974) \u201cthat the term lymphatic congestion covers all the various diseases listed by the examiner in his rejection as well as others.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the portion of Paper No. 8 containing this \u201cacknowledgment\u201d has not been included in the record, we must accept the finding as true. <em>Tiffany &amp; Co. v. National Gypsum Co., </em>459 F.2d 527, 59 CCPA 1063, 173 USPQ 793 (1972). However, we need not and do not accept the board\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccovers\u201d to mean that appellant\u2019s compositions are intended for treatment of such diseases when the specification and the record as a whole do not support such an interpretation. Also, we note that appellant\u2019s affidavit which accompanied Paper No. 8 contained no such \u201cacknowledgement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">Appellant\u2019s compositions may be compared to the many over-the-counter ointment drugs which have the purpose of stimulating blood circulation. Use of an ointment to stimulate circulation and to decrease pain is not the same as treatment directed at curing the disease (e. <em>g., </em>arthritis) which has caused the condition. Appellant\u2019s compositions are directed at stimulation of the circulation in the lymph system, which is not the same as treatment of the disease which caused the congestion in the lymph system or resulted from such congestion. Clearly, a physician can prescribe medicine for a patient with cancer (or other therapy resistant disease) to relieve him of a condition (e. <em>g., </em>swelling of lymphatic vessels) accompanying that cancer without prescribing for the treatment of the cancer itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>\n<em>2. The 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 Rejection (Claims 1-21)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">\n<em>a. Lack of Utility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">As previously related, the examiner and the board found that \u201cthe utility disclosed is inherently incredible.\u201d However, this finding is premised on an overly broad interpretation of \u201clymphatic congestion,\u201d discussed above. Construing the term more narrowly, as appellant has persuasively argued, the claimed utility is clearly not \u201cincredible.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">This case is reminiscent of <em>In re Gazave, </em>379 F.2d 973, 54 CCPA 1524, 154 USPQ 92 (1967), in which the claimed invention was directed to the treatment of \u201cvascular disorders.\u201d The court held that the utility was not speculative, unbelievable, incredible, or factually misleading and said that where the assertion of usefulness appears to be believable on its face, the disclosed utility will be accepted as accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">In this case, there is ample evidence of utility needed to satisfy 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Most convincing is the affidavit of Dr. Horst Veith which reports on a blind comparative study using one of appellant\u2019s compositions successfully.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are other affidavits stating that the claimed \u201cointment has been and is prescribed at present by several hundred physicians for more than 2,000 patients every month.\u201d Further, the record contains a report of eight case studies detailing the case history, diagnosis, treatment, and effectiveness of the treatment of each patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">We note that the PTO has not contested any of the offers of proof of utility submitted by appellant; nor has it presented any contrary evidence. Moreover, the PTO did not request information or research on appellant\u2019s compositions from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, which is specifically provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 372(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-14\">\n<em>b. Lack of Safety</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-15\">The Solicitor notes that the board did not reverse the examiner\u2019s rejection for lack of utility because of the inclusion of ingredients that are extremely toxic, such toxicity demonstrating a lack of safety that is incompatible with utility under section 101. Appellant makes the point, however, that all medicines can be unsafe in excessive doses and that extremely toxic substances can be very valuable in appropriate doses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-16\">The case of <em>In re Anthony, </em>414 F.2d 1383, 1394-95, 56 CCPA 1443, 1456-57, 162 USPQ 594, 603-04 (1969), provides a helpful analysis of what is necessary to meet the safety requirement under section 101:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-17\">No one, we suppose, would seriously maintain that, as a matter of policy, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>composition unsafe for use by reason of extreme toxicity to the point of immediate death under <em>all </em>conditions of its sole contemplated use in treating disease of the human organism would nevertheless be useful within the meaning of the patent laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-4\">But at the same time it must be recognized that \u201csafety\u201d is a relative matter, and that absolute proof of complete safety is realistically impossible. As this court pointed out in <em>In re Hartop, </em>311 F.2d 249, 50 CCPA 780, 135 USPQ 419 (1962) . . . :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-5\">. True it is that such substances would be <em>more </em>useful if they were not dangerous or did not have undesirable side effects, but the fact remains that they <em>are </em>useful, useful to doctors, veterinarians and research workers, useful to patients, both human and lower animal, and so are useful within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The use of drugs in medicine is frequently a matter of balancing risks to save a life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-6\">And Congress has given the responsibility to the FDA, not to the Patent Office, to determine in the first instance whether drugs are sufficiently safe for use that they can be introduced in the commercial market .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-7\">. The board also correctly recognized that the fact that many \u201cuseful\u201d drugs exhibit some degree of toxicity or side effects \u201cwould not provide a basis for refusal of a patent on such drugs as without utility\u201d under \u00a7 101. The presence of a certain degree of danger or risk attendant on the use of a drug does not necessarily mean that the subject matter is not useful within the meaning of the patent law because of that danger or risk. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Thus, <em>Anthony </em>points to only a minimum level of safety to meet section 101. <em>In re Watson, </em>517 F.2d 465, 475-76, 186 USPQ 11, 19-20 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). We are satisfied that appellant\u2019s specification and affidavits are adequate to establish this minimum level of safety, since they demonstrate that when the claimed compositions are used properly, there are no harmful side effects.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">In view of the foregoing, the rejection of claims 1-21 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">\n<em>3. The 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 Rejections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\"><em>a. Enablement </em>\u2014 \u201cLymphatic <em>Congestions\u201d (Claims 1-21)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">The board concluded that \u201c[t]hese facts [lymphatic congestion \u201ccovers\u201d many disease states, including cancer] strongly support the examiner\u2019s position that the original specification did not contain a sufficient disclosure to enable one of ordinary skill in the medical arts to treat the extremely large variety of diseases contemplated with the claimed compositions without the exercise of undue experimentation . . . .\u201d What the examiner said (in his Answer before the board) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-15\">The disclosure sets forth that the present invention involves important technical advance as compared to remedies of the prior art and also indicates that while in case of the treatment of diseases of the blood-circulation numerous efficient remedies are available to the physician there is a sensible need of a remedy which efficiently removes the pathologic changes in the lymphatic system. Accordingly, the use disclosed is of such nature that the art is unaware of successful treatments with chemically analogous compositions and therefore a more complete statement of how to use is necessary and proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-16\">It is readily apparent that contrary to Appellant\u2019s position <em>the application does not define or state which disease conditions are encompassed by the terminology \u201clymphatic congestions\u201d nor does the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number><em>specification state \u201cthe nature of\u201d same. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">As this court said in <em>In re Marzocchi, </em>439 F.2d 220, 224, 58 CCPA 1069, 1073, 169 USPQ 367, 370 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-6\">[I]t is incumbent upon the Patent Office, whenever a rejection on this basis is made, to explain <em>why </em>it doubts the truth or accuracy of any statement in a supporting disclosure and to back up assertions of its own with acceptable evidence or reasoning which is inconsistent with the contested statement. Otherwise, there would be no need for the applicant to go to the trouble and expense of supporting his presumptively accurate disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\"><em>Cf. In re Gazave, supra. </em>In order to affirm this rejection, there must be evidence or reasoning of record which is inconsistent with a critical statement in the disclosure. We find none. The PTO\u2019s only argument is that treatments of the lymph system are not well known, so that appellant must disclose which diseases are encompassed by the term \u201clymphatic congestions.\u201d However, there is no need for such a disclosure when the meaning of that term is limited to simple lymphatic congestion (clogged lymph vessels), as we have earlier concluded. Moreover, appellant\u2019s specification provides adequate guidance on how to use his compositions in the treatment of this condition. See <em>In re Stephens, </em>529 F.2d 1343, 188 USPQ 659 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976); <em>In re Armbruster, </em>512 F.2d 676, 185 USPQ 152 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975); <em>In re Rainer, </em>347 F.2d 574, 52 CCPA 1593, 146 USPQ 218 (1965). Several examples even provide information on the appropriate doses and what variations can be made in these doses in the case of \u201csevere and desolate cases.\u201d The PTO has cited no evidence or reference that contradicts or is inconsistent with any supporting statement of the disclosure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the rejection of claims 1-21 for lack of enablement due to use of the term \u201clymphatic congestions\u201d is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\"><em>b. Enablement </em>\u2014 Plant <em>Extracts (Claim 1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">In the case of claim 1, however, the board supported its rejection for lack of enablement with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-13\">We note that claim 1 recites families of plants as opposed to genuses. The taxonomy of plants is not based on drug content but on leaf form, flower type, etc. Thus, the family Solanaceae, for example, includes belladonna, petunia, hot pepper and sweet pepper. It is considered most unlikely that these varied plant types will yield the same drug extracts. Similarly, within the family Umbelliferae are found anise, caraway, celery, dill and parsley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">Such reasoning is inconsistent with the efficacy of the mixtures of the drug extracts within the ratios of claim 1<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and establishes a prima facie case of lack of enablement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a result that would not follow from a showing or allegation of the mere possibility of inclusion of inoperative embodiments in broad claims. See <em>In re Sarett, </em>327 F.2d 1005, 1019, 51 CCPA 1180, 1199, 140 USPQ 474, 486 (1964); Einhorn, <em>The Enforceability of Patent Claims Encompassing Some Inoperative Species, </em>45 J.P.O.S. 716 (Oct. 1963); Goodman, <em>The Invalidation of Generic Claims by Inclusion of a Small Number of Inoperative Species, </em>40 J.P.O.S. 745 (Oct. 1958). Therefore, the burden shifted to appellant to show that one of ordinary skill in the art could practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation. See <em>In re Marzocchi, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>In determining what constitutes undue experimentation, many factors are taken into account,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> including the guidance provided by the specification for selecting those embodiments of the invention which achieve the disclosed utility. Such guidance is essential where the invention involves an unpredictable art, as in the instant case. See <em>In re Fisher, </em>427 F.2d 833, 57 CCPA 1099, 166 USPQ 18 (1970), where the court said that the scope of enablement varies inversely with the degree of unpredictability of the involved factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">All that appellant has done is point out that drug extracts of some of the preferred members of each plant family have similar physiological effects. There is no proof that <em>ali </em>or even a substantial number of the drug extracts of members of the families of claim 1 have similar physiological effects. Nor has appellant provided (1) any evidence that one skilled in the art would know which of the member plants\u2019 extracts would be operative, or (2) any guidance to enable one skilled in the art to choose the operative plant extracts. Thus, undue experimentation is indicated, and the rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">c. <em>Enablement </em>\u2014 \"Ointment <em>Base\u201d (Claims 5, 9-11, 17, 20, and 21)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">These claims include extracts from each of the plant families and \u201cfrom about 76.1 to about 83.3% of ointment base.\u201d Appellant\u2019s specification discloses that the \u201cointment base\u201d is an active ingredient in the compositions. However, the only guidance on how to select it is: \u201cThe preferred active ingredient of vital necessity for the cellular respiration is an ointment base containing from' about 76.1 to about 83.3% of linoleic acid or linolenic acid in combination with a sulphur-containing amino acid and the bio-catalyzer cytochrome C.\u201d In his rejection, the examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-10\">While, generally, the term [\u201cointment base\u201d] would not be criticized if the specification indicated that same was not critical and that any conventional ointment base may be utilized to practice the invention, the instant application states that the ointment base employed enhances the activity in certain cases. Therefore, the specific ointment base employed is deemed necessary herein particularly in view of the internal use of such compositions and the alleged synergistic effects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">For the specification to be enabling, it must provide sufficient guidance for one skilled in the art to determine which ointment bases (or ingredients thereof) have the necessary activity-enhancing property. We are satisfied that the specification provides sufficient enabling support for claims 20 and 21. Claim 20 recites an ointment base containing linoleic acid; claim 21, an ointment base containing linolenic acid. Both claims recite that the ointment base contains a sulphur-containing amino acid and the biocatalyzer cytochrome C. Therefore, this rejection of claims 20 and 21 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">However, claims 5, 9-11, and 17 recite only an \u201cointment base.\u201d There is no evidence showing that one skilled in the art would know what ingredients (other than those recited in claims 20 and 21) would favorably affect cellular respiration. Also, we are persuaded that the disclosure of \u201cpreferred active ingredient of vital necessity for the cellular respiration\u201d does not provide sufficient guidance to select other operative ointment bases without undue experimentation, considering particularly that an unpredictable art is involved. See <em>In re Fisher, supra. </em>We note that appellant does not argue that one skilled in the art would know which ointment bases (or ingredients thereof) have the desired effect on the cellular respiration. Indeed, the definition of ointment base submitted by appellant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>the examiner<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> underscores the difficulty of determining a proper ointment base. Therefore, this rejection of claims 5, 9-11, and 17 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\"><em>d. Enablement </em>\u2014 \u201cSulphur-containing <em>Amino Acid\u201d (Claims 20 and 21)</em></p>\n<p id=\"afn-dedup-0\">The Solicitor argues that appellant has abandoned this issue by failing to argue it. There is no question that the issue was preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, an issue raised below which is not argued before this court, even if properly brought here by the reasons of appeal, is regarded as abandoned and will not be considered. <em>In re Wiechert, </em>370 F.2d 927, 936-37, 54 CCPA 957, 968, 152 USPQ 247, 254 (1967), and cases cited therein. In <em>Wiechert, </em>the court considered the \u201crecord, briefs, and oral arguments\u201d to see whether the issue was \u201cargued.\u201d In doing so here, we note that appellant argues this issue in his reply brief, so that it cannot be maintained that he abandoned the issue. <em>In re Farrow, </em>554 F.2d 468, 473 n. 2, 193 USPQ 689, 692 n. 2 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">On the merits, appellant argues that the phrase \u201csulphur-containing amino acids\u201d in claims 20 and 21 is \u201cwell known, to the extent of being the heading of a German patent classification, and means any amino acid containing sulphur.\u201d However, we agree with the board\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-10\">In view of the extremely large number of compounds of differing properties that this recitation reads on and the absence of a single specific disclosure of a sul-phur-containing amino acid, appellant\u2019s invention can not [sic] be said to be enabled with respect to this limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">Also, there is no evidence that one skilled in the art would have knowledge of the proper compounds. This rejection of claims 20 and 21 is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">e. <em>Best Mode (Claims 1-21)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The examiner\u2019s final rejection establishes <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that all claims were rejected for failing to set forth the best mode, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azc-dedup-0\">Claims 1-21 are rejected under 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and Rule 71 as stated in Paper No. 4. . Contrary to Applicants\u2019 [s/e] opinion the application does not fully satisfy the requirements of the Rule 71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-15\">Paper No. 4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-16\">The specification is objected to as being insufficient and defective in not complying with Rule 71. . . . The specification does not teach or disclose how to use the invention nor is the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention setforth [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Also, we note that the Examiner\u2019s Answer included the following statement: \u201cThe specification also does not teach the best mode of using the invention.\u201d Since the board did not specifically reverse the best mode rejection (\u201cbest mode\u201d is not mentioned in the board\u2019s opinion), the rejection is deemed to have been affirmed. <em>In re Watson, supra, </em>517 F.2d at 472, 186 USPQ at 16 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975); <em>In re Pye, </em>355 F.2d 641, 53 CCPA 877, 148 USPQ 426 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The language of appellant\u2019s Notice and Reasons of Appeal<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is broad enough to preserve the correctness of the rejection for consideration by this court. <em>In re Castner, supra, </em>518 F.2d at 1238, 186 USPQ at 217. Also, we consider that appellant has argued this issue, having stated in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-5\">The compositions may be in the form of ointments, suppositories, capsules, injections and sprays, each of which is the best mode known of using the invention for certain parts of the body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">Furthermore, at oral argument, when questioned about the best mode, appellant\u2019s counsel referred to the fifteen examples in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">This rejection is similar to the one in <em>In re Bosy, </em>360 F.2d 972, 976, 53 CCPA 1231, 1236, 149 USPQ 789, 792 (1966), where \u201cthe error of failing to \u2018analyze exactly what appellant\u2019s invention is in the instant case,\u2019 . . . has resulted in the additional error [by the PTO] of requiring a best mode be set forth of details not relating to the essence of the invention.\u201d Moreover, appellant\u2019s specification sets forth numerous examples, many with exact doses and a discussion regarding the method of treatment. The examiner\u2019s conclusory statement that the specification does not teach the best mode of using the invention is unaccompanied by evidence or reasoning and is entirely inadequate to support the rejection. <em>Compare Union Carbide Corp. v. Borg-Warner Corp., </em>550 F.2d 355, 193 USPQ 1 (6th Cir. 1977). Accordingly, the rejection of claims 1-21 for failure to set forth the best mode is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">\n<em>4. The 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) Rejection (Claim 14)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-15\">As stated earlier, the board rejected claim 14<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> over appellant\u2019s German application for anticipation, because the limitation in the claim of \u201cbetween about 3% and about 35% of potassium arsenite\u201d does not appear in appellant\u2019s parent application (serial No. 43,947), upon which appellant relies for a filing date of June 5, 1970, to antedate his German application (December 23, 1970). Example 7 of the German application discloses a composition (7.5 grams of potassium arsenite is added to 30 grams of the composition) which is a species of the claimed genus (3-35%) in claim 14; appellant\u2019s parent application discloses the same species in Example 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-16\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection, which was based on inadequate disclosure of the claimed invention in the parent application, thus precluding use of its June 5, 1970, filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-17\">The disclosure in the parent application (in addition to Example 9) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a-e-dedup-0\">According to a particular embodiment of the invention the composition also contains arsenicum or compounds of arseni-cum. By this means an additional very important enhancement of the activity is achieved. Examples of arsenicum or compounds of arsenicum, respectively, which may be contained in the compositions according to the invention are colloidal arsenicum, arsenious acid and potassium arsenite.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-18\">Obviously, such a disclosure, coupled with Example 9, does not describe the limitation of \u201cbetween about 3% and about 35%. \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>See, e. <em>g., In re Blaser, </em>556 F.2d 534, 194 USPQ 122 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977); <em>In re Wertheim, </em>541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976); <em>In re Smith, </em>458 F.2d 1389, 59 CCPA 1025, 173 USPQ 679 (1972); <em>In re Lukach, </em>442 F.2d 967, 58 CCPA 1233, 169 USPQ 795 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Since claim 14 is not entitled to the parent\u2019s filing date, it is anticipated by the published German application, which discloses a species of the claimed genus (3-35%) in claim 14. <em>In re Smith, supra; In re Lukach, supra. </em>As this court said in <em>Lu-kach, id. </em>442 F.2d at 970, 58 CCPA at 1236, 169 USPQ at 797:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-6\">[It is] the law that the description of a single embodiment of broadly claimed subject matter constitutes a description of the invention for anticipation purposes ., whereas the same information in a specification might not alone be enough to provide a description of that invention for purposes of adequate disclosure.
