In <em>Barr v. Matteo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court struck the balance in favor of the officials. We do not view that 1959 ruling as undercut by later decisions, and adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Plaintiff, Expeditions Unlimited, brought an action for libel against Clifford Evans, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Museum of Natural History, and against the Smithsonian Institution. The action is based on a letter by Evans in which he was critical of plaintiff\u2019s capabilities in the field of underwater archaeological excavation. The district court granted summary judgment for defendant Smithsonian Institution on governmental immunity grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment for defendant Evans on the grounds of his absolute privilege in making statements within the scope of his duties as a government employee. We remand for further exploration of the issue whether Evans was acting within the ambit of his employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we agree with the district court that if Evans was acting within the ambit of his discretion, he would have absolute immunity. We do not reinstate the view in the panel opinion that there might be only a qualified privilege. We now state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">It was the fear of chilling legitimate official conduct that motivated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the seminal case of <em>Barr v. Matteo, supra. Barr </em>also involved an action for defamation. There, the Acting Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization, a federal agency, was sued by another government employee who claimed that the Acting Director had maliciously issued a press release injurious to the employee\u2019s reputation. The Court held that once it had been established that the action taken \u201cwas within the outer perimeter of [his] line of duty,\u201d the Acting Director was entitled to absolute immunity against liability in damages even though his action was a discretionary exercise and was allegedly prompted by malice. 360 U.S. at 575, 79 S.Ct. at 1341. Justice Harlan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reasoned that an absolute privilege was required because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>. officials of government should be free to exercise their duties unembarrassed by the fear of damage suits in respect of acts done in the course of those duties \u2014 suits which would consume time and energies which would otherwise be devoted to governmental service and the threat of which might appreciably inhibit the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">360 U.S. at 571, 79 S.Ct. at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The federal common law rule of absolute immunity of officials sued for defamation furthers the goal of effective administration of government in the public interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A qualified immunity would be dependent upon a myriad of factors and a particularistic assessment of the facts of each case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> leaving an official at hazard to anticipate whether or not he is protected. \u201cAn absolute immunity defeats a suit at the outset, so long as the official\u2019s actions were within the scope of the immunity. The fate of an official with qualified immunity depends upon circumstances and motivations of his actions, as established by the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 419 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. 984, 989, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Even the need to find the time and money for a defense<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would have a chilling, if not paralyzing, effect on an official\u2019s willingness to speak out, in the exercise of his discretion, to further the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">At the time we granted rehearing en banc we were aware of <em>Economou v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, </em>535 F.2d 688 (2nd Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree with <em>Econo-mou, </em>and view it, indeed, as illustrating the dangers of a doctrine providing only qualified immunity. There, an administrative complaint and accompanying press release of the Department of Agriculture had alleged, on the basis of an audit, that Econo-mou had failed to maintain the minimum prescribed capital balance required for a registered futures commission merchant. An administrative law judge issued a decision finding a violation. While the administrative proceeding was pending on appeal, Economou, alleging defamation and wrongful institution of administrative proceedings, sued various officials of the Department of Agriculture, including the administrative law judge, for $32 million in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">As the <em>Economou </em>court recognized, if <em>Barr </em>had governed its decision, its inquiry would have stopped if \u201cthe alleged conduct of the defendants . . . was \u2018within the outer perimeter of their authority\u2019 and involved the exercise of discretion.\u201d 535 F.2d at 691. Instead, the court, rejecting <em>Barr, </em>held that only a qualified \u201cgood faith\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>immunity was applicable, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This rejection of <em>Barr </em>can only exacerbate an already serious problem of modern government \u2014 the tendency of bureaucrats to sit tight rather than take action likely to rile the individuals or groups being regulated. The nation\u2019s welfare is dependent upon officials who are willing to speak forthrightly and disclose violations of the law and other activities contrary to the public interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Their voices will be stilled if they perceive or fear that the person involved has the resources or disposition to defend with all affirmative tactics. When millions may turn on regulatory decisions, there is a strong incentive to counter-attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>Economou, </em>the Second Circuit suggested that <em>Barr </em>had been undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in cases arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We disagree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Supreme Court decisions in \u00a7 1983 eases do not overrule <em>Barr. </em>They rather establish the rule for cases where fundamental, constitutional rights are involved, and declare that ordinary rules of official immunity must yield when the executive is charged with exercising his special power as a government official in a way prohibited by the Constitution. In <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>far from undercutting <em>Barr, </em>Chief Justice Burger cited <em>Barr </em>and its antecedent, <em>Spalding v. Vilas,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as cases illuminating the inherent necessity of providing broad protection to executive discretionary acts in the context of defamation actions. He noted, however, that <em>Barr </em>and <em>Spalding </em>arose \u201cin a context other than a \u00a7 1983 suit\u201d (at 247, 94 S.Ct. at 1692.). The absolute immunity those cases granted to federal executive officials was not extended to state officials sued under \u00a7 1983; they could claim only qualified immunity. Chief Justice Burger\u2019s opinion makes the reason clear: Since \u00a7 1983 gives an action against state officials when constitutional violations are invoked, it is patently inconsistent with that federal statutory action to apply a federal common law rule of absolute immunity for executive officials subjected to suit by the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While \u00a7 1983 retains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>absolute immunity of officials exercising power within the judicial or quasi-judicial ambit,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the plain provision for suits against officials in the executive branch precludes an absolute immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Our decision in <em>Apton v. Wilson, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 506 F.2d 83 (1974), extended the <em>Scheuer </em>rule of qualified immunity in \u00a7 1983 cases to an action against federal officials that involved one of our \u201cmost cherished liberties,\u201d the freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention. 165 U.S.App.D.C. at 32, 506 F.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The defamation action in the case at bar involves damage to business reputation \u2014 an interest of no greater weight than the interest in personal reputation involved in <em>Barr. </em>While damage to reputation is not inconsequential, and can, under some circumstances, qualify for procedural protection under the due process clause,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it is not as basic to a free society as the Fourth Amendment right to be free from arbitrary search and seizure of person or property, a right so precious that a remedy in damages has been inferred from the Constitution itself. <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Nor is <em>Barr </em>undercut by <em>Doe v. McMillan, </em>412 U.S. 306, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973). That was essentially a case involving legislative immunity, under the speech or debate clause, and the Court remanded for a determination of the extent of legisla-five immunity. <em>Doe </em>involved a suit by parents for invasion of privacy from the dissemination of a congressional report that identified students in derogatory contexts. The ruling as to the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents was only that they did not have an absolute immunity greater than the immunity of the legislators who tendered the documents for printing. The Court held that although they acted \u201cwithin the outer perimeter\u201d of their statutory duties in printing what was tendered, they had no \u201cindependent immunity.\u201d 412 U.S. at 322-23, 93 S.Ct. 2018. The Court\u2019s decision was responsive to the character of the Government Printing Office, which acts as a service organization for the three branches of government. 412 U.S. at 322, 93 S.Ct. 2018. The Court concluded that for purposes of the judicially-fashioned doctrine of immunity, the officials of the Printing Office were immune from the suit only to the extent that they were acting within the \u201csphere of legitimate legislative activity.\u201d 412 U.S. at 324, 93 S.Ct. 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\"><em>Barr </em>premises that it is better to leave unredressed some defamations<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by officers acting out of malice or excess zeal, than to subject the conscientious to the constant dread of retaliation. For every case of malicious governmental action potentially remedied by replacing <em>Barr </em>with a qualified immunity, hundreds if not thousands of other actions in the public interest may be deferred or omitted. There is too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>much to be said for the <em>Barr </em>choice, there was too much hard work and hard thought when the problem was faced squarely by great judges like John Harlan and Learned Hand, to sweep it aside as the detritus of a doctrine that has been nibbled away <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The judgment in favor of defendant Smithsonian Institution is affirmed. The judgment in favor of defendant Evans is remanded for limited inquiry whether his letter was within the outer perimeter of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A-l</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The part of the panel opinion in this' case dealing with the Smithsonian Institution is reinstated as the opinion of the panel.

The claim arose out of a letter writ-' ten by Evans, in which he expressed views as to the capabilities of petitioner Expeditions Unlimited in the field of underwater archaeological excavation. The merits of the libel claim are not presently before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>since summary judgment for defendants was granted on the grounds of Smithsonian\u2019s governmental immunity and Evans\u2019 absolute privilege in making statements within the scope of his duties as a government employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">IMMUNITY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The holding of the district court that the Smithsonian Institution may not be sued for libel is affirmed. That conclusion rests upon our reading of the Federal Tort Claims Act. Because we find that the Tort Claims Act should be read as granting federal agencies immunity from suit for libel, we do not reach the issue of the Institution\u2019s immunity status at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In finding immunity under the Act, the initial step is to determine whether the defendant organization is a \u201cfederal agency\u201d within the definition set forth in the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the Smithsonian has a substantial private dimension,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the nature of its function as a national museum and center of scholarship, coupled with the substantial governmental role in funding<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and oversight,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> make the institution an \u201cindependent establishment of the United States,\u201d within the \u201cfederal agency\u201d definition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">Section 1346(b) of Title 28, U.S.C., creates subject to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80, a remedy against the United States for injuries wrongfully caused by any \u201cemployee of the government.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the Smithsonian is a federal agency, its employees are \u201cemployee[s] of the government,\u201d and the \u00a7 1346(b) action thus may lie.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(a), the \u00a7 1346(b) remedy is made exclusive in cases where that section applies, even where an agency may elsewhere be authorized to sue and be sued in its own right.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), the provisions of the Tort Claims Act, including the jurisdictional provision, \u00a7 1346(b), are made inapplicable to libel actions, such as the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>presently before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The difficult interpretive problem posed by this case is to determine the effect of this exceptions clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On the one hand, the exceptions clause might be viewed as making the Tort Claims Act entirely inapplicable to libel actions, in which event the common law immunity status of a defendant would govern, and an action might be possible if independent jurisdictional grounds could be found. On the other hand, \u00a7 2680(h) could be seen as imposing a bar to suit, if the Tort Claims Act is regarded as a systematic statute governing all tort claims, with the exceptions clauses setting forth the areas where suit is to be barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">There are significant arguments to be made in favor of the first view. The language of the exceptions section makes no reference to any creation or, more properly, continuation of long established governmental immunity in the categories of cases it sets forth. Rather, the exceptions section only states that the provisions of the Tort Claims Act \u201cshall not apply\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would not be illogical to conclude that, in these categories of cases, the Act neither creates nor removes immunity but leaves the question of suability as it was before the Act, to be determined by other statutes and by common law rules. This interpretation is further bolstered by the construction which has been given to \u00a7 2680(7) and (m), which except the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Panama Canal Company from the Act\u2019s provisions. These parallel provisions to the libel exception (h) have consistently been held not to create any immunity, but to allow suit to be brought against the organizations just as before the Act, under separate statutory authorizations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">While logic and a consistent reading of the statute would, by themselves, thus lead us outside the Act at the very start, to inquire as to the Smithsonian\u2019s common law immunity status and as to other possible bases of jurisdiction, other factors cause us to reject this approach. Legislative history, the great weight of judicial precedent, and a desire to facilitate future application of the Act, convince us that \u00a7 2680(h) should be read as an affirmative grant of immunity to \u201cfederal agencies\u201d in the types of deliberate tort cases which it describes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">We conclude from the structure of the Tort Claims Act, and from the legislative reports accompanying its passage, that Congress probably did not intend to leave unaffected by the Act the categories of suits excepted by \u00a7 2680(h). While primarily seeking to expand governmental liability for torts, it appears to us that Congress also sought to systematize and centralize the immunity laws.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One evidence of this appears in \u00a7 2679(a) of the statute, which in essence renders ineffective any other laws allowing suit or creating remedies against an agency, where the actions \u201care cogniza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ble under section 1346(b).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Another evidence of this centralizing impulse appears in the context of exceptions clause \u00a7 2680(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This section sets forth the category of discretionary activity, for which immunity has traditionally been granted. That Congress bothered to include it in the exceptions section is consistent with the view that it meant to embody, within \u00a7 2680 all of the instances in which immunity is to exist under the statute. It seems to us an unreasonable conclusion, at least in the instances of exceptions (a) and (h), that Congress intended for courts to go beyond the Act, and inquire into common law immunity status and alternative jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">More affirmative, though still ambiguous, evidence that Congress saw itself as preempting the common law of immunity appears in the reports which accompanied the bill through the House and Senate. In discussing the exclusivity provision,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the reports of both chambers make the following statement:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\"><em>This will place torts of \u201csuable\u201d agencies of the United States upon precisely the same footing as torts of \u201cnonsuable\u201d agencies. </em>In both cases, the suits would be against the United States, subject to the limitations and safeguards of the bill; and in both cases the <em>exceptions of the bill would apply either by way of preventing recovery at all or by way of leaving recovery to some other act, </em>as, for example, the suits in Admiralty Act. It is intended that <em>neither corporate status nor \u201csue and be sued\u201d clauses shall, alone, be the basis for suits </em>for money recovery sounding in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">From these statements may be inferred a general intent to treat all federal agencies alike as regards immunity, irrespective of what their immunity status was at common law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We find it likely that Congress conceived of itself as codifying the immunity law, and eliminating any necessity to look at the common law, once it is concluded that the defendant is a federal agency within the definition of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">We might perhaps take a different view of legislative intent if this were a matter of first impression. But we give weight to the fact that since the time of enactment, it has been the consistent practice of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>courts to read both exceptions (a) and (h) as defining grants of immunity to \u201cfederal agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The courts\u2019 consistent sense of legislative intention is impressive even though the decisions fail to acknowledge the difficulty presented by the literal text.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We are also influenced, we must confess, by the consideration that a contrary reading of the statute would lead to perplexing questions as to the state of the common law, while not leading to a clear change of result in any imaginable case. For there to be any difference in result, the defendant would have to be within the \u201cfederal agency\u201d definition of \u00a7 2674, and yet be sufficiently private as to lead to the inference that Congress, in creating the organization, intended not to render it immune.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Were both of these conditions met, it would be necessary, further, that the subject matter of the suit be within one of the clauses of \u00a7 2680 which are presently construed to confer immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We cannot envisage that more than a few, if any, cases would meet all of these requirements, and thus be decided differently under a literal reading of the Act. Yet to determine whether it might be applicable would require the courts in a considerable array of cases fo make a complex and speculative inquiry into common law immunity status.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We think the legislature intended the courts to decide suability questions by direct reference to the statute rather than by pursuit of the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of the prior law. We conclude that exception clause (h) should continue to be read as defining the existence of immunity in suits involving deliberate torts, and that the summary judgment in favor of Smithsonian should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. That judgment was affirmed by the panel for the reasons stated in Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion. After ordering sua sponte that the issue of the Smithsonian\u2019s- immunity would be decided without oral argument under Rule 11(e), the en banc court chose not to consider the matter. The portion of the panel opinion dealing with the Smithsonian is therefore reinstated as the opinion of the panel and for convenience is reprinted in the appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">As to the immunity defense raised by the individual defendant Evans, the panel opinion, Judge Leventhal dissenting, ordered a remand to the district court to determine whether the case was appropriate for absolute immunity or qualified immunity. It contemplated an individualized inquiry into whether the added benefits derived from the award of absolute immunity to the official outweighed the loss of litigant rights. It set out a number of factors for the district court to consider, including the nature of the litigant\u2019s interest, the expected impact of the differing immunities on the performance of the official\u2019s duty and the governmental as opposed to private character of that duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-14\">. Although Evans\u2019 responsibilities included responding to information inquiries from foreign governments in his field, the record does not elucidate whether official replies had to be channelled in a certain manner, whether Smithsonian officials respond to personal inquiries in their official capacity, and if the letter was a personal letter whether it is considered proper for several officials to comment independently on foreign queries. These considerations are relevant to the determination of whether Evans acted within the perimeter of his responsibilities or whether, as plaintiff claims, he was acting in a personal capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-15\">. While only three other justices concurred in Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion, his views on the doctrine of absolute immunity did command a majority of the Court. Justice Stewart dissented only because he felt that under the particular facts of <em>Barr, </em>the official was acting beyond the outer perimeter of his duties. 360 U.S. at 592, 79 S.Ct. 1335. See also <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>360 U.S. 593, 79 S.Ct. 1331, 3 L.Ed.2d 1454 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\">. The need to determine whether an official is acting within the outer perimeter of his duties will not defeat the purpose of absolute immunity. For example, on the facts of this case, the determination of whether Evans was acting within the scope of his employment may be made on the basis of affidavits from his superiors elucidating his duties and the procedures usually followed in answering queries from foreign governments.

Perhaps that is all that really needs to be said. Frankness, however, compels me to admit increasing difficulty in reconciling <em>Barr </em>with other strands of jurisprudence evolving on the amenability of public servants to suits for damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I join in the disposition of this case, then, not out of any ability to divine the ultimate schematism of this area of the law, but because of the judge\u2019s duty to abide controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Few would suggest that public officers be made answerable in damages for good-faith errors in judgment, even when the result is exceedingly unfortunate. Fewer still would condone venally or maliciously motivated acts by public functionaries or their ofttimes appalling consequences. If recompense to. victims implicated no more than the purses of callous bureaucrats, there would be no need for official immunity, for the availability of some sort of good faith defense would suffice to separate the sheep from the goats.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The problem is not nearly so simple, however, because a great deal more than monetary liability is at stake. The ease with which malice can be charged leaves open the possibility that even the conscientious public servant will be dogged by suitors. The mere prospect of a lawsuit may deter even the otherwise courageous official from the full and ardent discharge of altogether lawful duties, lest he become enmeshed in vexatious, though unfounded, litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">When an officer thus deviates from whole-hearted conservation of the common weal, the public interest is to that extent disserved. The virtue of absolute immunity for public functionaries, as well as its sole justification, is that it safeguards against that measure of disservice. So it was that, with full appreciation of society\u2019s weighty interest in fairness to those injured by improper manipulation of the levers of government, the <em>Barr </em>Court struck the balance on the side of averting litigation of defamation claims, whether ill-founded or not, arising from statements made in the line of federal duty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[TJhere may be occasional instances of actual injustice which may go unredressed,\u201d the Court said, \u201cbut we think that price a necessary one to pay for the greater good.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, by extension of <em>Barr, </em>the generally accepted rule today is that the federal officeholder is totally immune to suit for damages attributed to any common law tort emanating from non-ministerial conduct within the outer perimeter of his official authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Developments in related quarters, however, have introduced asymmetry in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>field of official immunity. More than a century ago, by what is now 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Congress authorized civil actions by those deprived of federally secured rights through action under color of state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Much more recently, notwithstanding the facial broadness of Section 1983, the Supreme Court has recognized immunities for state officers from civil damage suits thereunder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike the invariably absolute immunity which <em>Barr </em>attaches to non-ministerial activity precipitating common law tort actions against those in federal service, immunity inherent in the functions of particular state offices for purposes of Section 1983 may be either absolute or qualified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More importantly, the process of formulating Section 1983 immunities has involved careful appraisal of the degree to which the operations of the office might be impaired by the specter of groundless suit, and a weighing of the assessment thereon against the remedial purposes of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This category-by-category approach to immunity determinations, sensitive both to costs and to benefits, stands in sharp contrast to the <em>Barr </em>choice of immunity, which varies neither with the value of the premium it confers nor with the potential for harm it leaves in its wake.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Of course, congressional specification in Section 1983 of a right to monetary relief rules out judicial interposition of absolute immunity,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> save only where a court may infer that Congress did not intend the statute to operate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the other hand, damage actions against federal officials for transgression of common law norms, such as the defamation action that was <em>Barr, </em>do not encounter any manifestation of legislative will that might stifle judicial implication of unlimited and unqualified immunity. What brings this doctrinal consonance to the point of discord is the still-developing body of law shaping the suability of federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>functionaries for damages charged to unconstitutional depredations. There, as in the situation <em>Barr </em>epitomizes, the judicial hand is unfettered by the legislature\u2019s command; <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> yet, since the Section 1983 immunity decisions have been deemed authoritative,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the immunity in vogue in that area may be either qualified or absolute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The upshot is that one kind of judicially-fashioned immunity is available to federal officials in fending off damage suits founded on constitutional claims, and quite another \u2014 the <em>Barr </em>-type \u2014 to such officials in repulsing suits invoking the common law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The incongruity between immunities available to the same officer exercising the same functions, depending only upon the genesis of the legal standard by which his behavior is to be measured, strikes at the very foundations of the <em>Barr </em>rule. Many if not most constitutional torts have analogues in the common law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus the official who finds himself charged with a tort of each sort \u2014 a common posture<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 -may assert against the common law claims his <em>Barr </em>immunity, but the travail of litigation \u2014 which that immunity is designed to spare him \u2014 largely remains since he still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>has the burden of defending on the constitutional claim, albeit on the basis of qualified privilege. Friction with <em>Barr </em>runs even deeper, since the same commonsense assumption that underlies its holding suggests that far-sighted officials will guard against vexatious litigation rooted in the Constitution. One may thus question how much their resoluteness in job performance will be bolstered by <em>Barr\u2019s </em>assurance of absolute immunity, which protects them only from the same annoyance couched in the principles of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">That constitutional rights have a status in our jurisprudence which common law rights can never attain does not satisfactorily explain the line presently drawn.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If its justification lies in our greater willingness to risk exposure of public servants to personal liability when vindicating constitutional rights than when enforcing more pedestrian legal norms, one may wonder whether absolute immunity ought ever to be conferred in constitutional tort actions, as indeed it sometimes is.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> One may also suspect that in such actions, no less than in Section 1983 suits, the constitutional origins of the plaintiff\u2019s claim may be less efficacious than the historical stature of particular immunities in the determination of whether the protection from suit is to be qualified or absolute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">I speak to these matters to acknowledge a dilemma, and not in any endeavor to orchestrate the field of public-servant liability, in which the Supreme Court occupies by far the major role. It may be that further enlightenment will come from the Court\u2019s forthcoming <em>Economou </em>decisions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, my bounden duty at the moment is to follow <em>Barr, </em>in my view without any effort at reexamination of its holding or its rationale. For \u201c[s]ave only for the exceptional cases where the proper decisional result is very clear, it is for the Supreme Court, not us, to proclaim error in its past rulings, or their erosion by its adjudications since.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-18\">. 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-19\">.

Matteo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court decision that the majority views as controlling on the question of executive immunity. For the reasons stated by the majority and amplified by my discussion in Part I, <em>infra, </em>I do not doubt that the absolute immunity afforded by <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Mat-teo </em>represents sound policy, as much now as it did when it was decided. However, in the various \u00a7 1983 cases that have intervened since <em>Barr, </em>the Supreme Court appears to have described the immunity generally available to executive officials <em>in common law actions </em>as being only a qualified immunity. As I will explain more fully below in Part II, <em>infra, </em>the Court\u2019s persistence in this description, set out first in <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and ratified twice thereafter,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> leads me to doubt whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Court is still committed to the absolute immunity of <em>Barr. </em>Since it is the Court\u2019s prerogative to overrule its own decisions, if it wishes, I join, although <em>dubitante, </em>in the judgment of this court in reliance upon <em>Barr.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">At first exposure the doctrine of absolute immunity for government officials in common law tort actions appears to be a harsh doctrine indeed. Someone who has incontestably been hurt as a result of the tor-tious conduct of a government official may be denied any compensation, regardless of the magnitude of the injury. Similarly, no matter how malicious an official\u2019s action may appear to be, the operation of absolute immunity may preclude inquiry in a civil suit for damages into the reasonableness of his behavior, even if it appears that there will be no review of his action by other means. In terms of compensation denied and accountability foreclosed, absolute immunity may often seem distasteful in its rigidity. For these and other reasons, well-respected commentators have called for an overruling of <em>Barr, </em>so that for common law torts as is already the case for constitutional torts executive officials will have only a qualified immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Recognizing that the rule of absolute immunity imposes real costs, the relevant question becomes whether the benefits to be derived from the doctrine justify these costs. The <em>Barr </em>Court openly confronted this question and decided that the contribution of absolute immunity to \u201cthe effective functioning of government\u201d outweighed the loss of litigant rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Justice Harlan concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">To be sure, as with any rule of law which attempts to reconcile fundamentally antagonistic social policies, there may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>occasional instances of actual injustice which will go unredressed, but we think that price a necessary one to pay for the greater good.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Critical to the balance struck by <em>Barr </em>was the view that the threat of personal liability hanging over an individual officer \u201cmight appreciably inhibit the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Judge Leventhal has pointed out, it is as much a concern today that the possibility of personal liability will \u201cchill\u201d forthright government administration as it was in 1959, the year of <em>Barr. </em>If anything, with government regulation touching many more aspects of American life and with the stakes of regulation correspondingly more significant, there is even more reason today to expect \u201ccounter-attacks,\u201d in Judge Leventhal\u2019s phrase, against the officials who are charged with making the difficult and sensitive decisions of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">It is argued, however, that precisely because so much can turn upon the actions of executive officials, then there must be civil damage suits available in order to hold them accountable for their conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To begin with, however, many of the actions by federal executive officials, which may give rise to common law torts, are subject to review and correction by courts under the Administrative Procedure Act and other statutory review provisions. In addition, the conduct of executive officials may be subject to a wide range of alternative oversight \u2014 by the press, by Congress, by the public, and by internal agency personnel. And, of course, the absolute tort immunity of <em>Barr </em>does not foreclose any possible criminal prosecutions of government officials who violate the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">If it is thought that these possible methods of oversight are still inadequate to assure full and fair accountability \u2014 and on occasion misbehavior by executive officials surely does go unchecked \u2014 it is not easy to know what courts should do about it. One possibility is that absolute or qualified immunity might turn on an assessment by a court <em>in each case </em>whether the allegedly tortious action of the officer was indeed subject to review or scrutiny by other means or in another forum. If not, then the civil damage suit can be allowed to proceed, with the award of only a qualified immunity, so that the officer will be called to answer for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">In my estimation this is an unwise and unworkable approach. An assessment of whether alleged misbehavior has been \u201cadequately\u201d reviewed and/or corrected by other means may often have to involve further proceedings and factual findings, a possibility which undercuts the purpose of absolute immunity, as expressed in <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pacht-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>man,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to provide protection <em>at the outset </em>from trial and liability. Moreover, a variable criterion such as this adds a further element of judgment and uncertainty to the process of choice between immunities, thereby importing the \u201cchilling\u201d effect of possible liability. How does a trial court assess, for example, the fact that there was no \u201cofficial\u201d disciplinary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing? What if this is because the various supervisors believed on the record before them that no wrongdoing had taken place and that the challenged conduct was justified? I suggest, in brief, that it is inappropriate to immunity doctrine, and inconsistent with Supreme Court practice,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to have absolute immunity awarded or taken away depending on whether there was, as seen in retrospect, alternative review of the incident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In terms of assuring accountability, then, the other alternative is to drop absolute immunity for common law torts altogether, so that the reasonableness of every official action can be tested. Yet this need not involve a direct legal action against the executive official personally. And, as noted earlier, because this net of civil liability is so wide, and will entrap the innocent official along with the guilty, the policy preference has been for absolute immunity instead, which \u2014 ideally\u2014encourages executive officials to act in a fearless, public-spirited way without the risk of immense personal liability. It seems to me that if the balance struck by <em>Barr </em>is deemed unsatisfactory, then the response should be legislative \u2014 the waiver of sovereign immunity for intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">If the complaint is that it is very unjust that there are uncompensated injuries from common law torts, then the preferable solution is to amend the Federal Tort Claims Act to cover intentional torts, like libel and slander, which are presently excluded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Surely in terms of realistic compensation, this change would provide a more effective remedy than the abandonment of absolute immunity, leaving monetary relief only against the officer. Similarly, if the complaint is that absolute immunity is resulting in a widespread unaccountability for common law torts, the preferable solution again may be to amend the Torts Claims Act to cover intentional torts. With regard to intentional torts, such as abuses by police officers, for example, it has often been thought that the imposition of judgments on governmental units may induce the higher officials to see that there is better training in the avoidance of wrongdoing and more effective oversight on the charges of misconduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Indeed, with further changes in the Torts Claims Act, the government could secure the power, if it wished, to collect from the wrongdoing officer for malicious or egregious torts. This approach, if fairly and consistently administered, could bring a greater measure of accountability for the individual wrongdoer without imposing the degree of \u201cchill\u201d expected from the aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>donment of absolute immunity. For with a waiver of sovereign immunity for intentional torts, the officer knows that the government will assume whatever judgment may ensue from an uncertain trial on liability and damages. Personal liability, the primary source of the \u201cchill\u201d upon the exercise of unintimidated discretion, would depend instead upon a disciplinary screening <em>by the government </em>about when to pursue recovery from the officer and about how much recovery to seek. Presumably this screening will be less unpredictable and capricious than present trial and jury outcomes against an officer and would thus provide a more fine-tuned way of holding accountable those who maliciously abuse their power.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Motivated by some of the considerations suggested above, Congress has already changed the Tort Claims Act so as to make the federal government financially responsible for the intentional torts of some of its officers. With a 1974 amendment sovereign immunity was waived for claims arising out of \u201cassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process or malicious prosecution\u201d which are committed by United States \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whether Congress should further amend the Tort Claims Act to include the intentional torts of other officers, many of which would be common law torts, remains, of course, a matter of legislative judgment. Similarly, whether coverage of intentional torts by the government should include a right to seek indemnity from the officers involved also calls for an exercise of judgment by the legislature.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Recognizing the responsibility of Congress for the basic structure of the Tort Claims Act, I am unwilling to drop the absolute immunity of <em>Barr, </em>thereby leaving federal executive officials with only a qualified immunity for common law torts, in an effort to induce Congress to make further amendments to the Torts Claims Act. <em>Barr </em>has been rightly viewed as an aid to effective government and because its abandonment would thus impair public-spirited administration by the executive branch, its absolute immunity should be retained until a workable substitute, such as a waiver of sovereign immunity, is in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">In 1959 <em>Barr </em>v. Matteo<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> established the rule of federal common law that executive officials at all levels were entitled to absolute immunity from civil damage suits for those torts which involved action of a discretionary nature and which were taken within the scope of their authority. Over the years the Supreme Court appears to have adhered to the <em>Barr </em>rule<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, most notably, in 1973, did \u201cnot disturb the judgment\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of a lower court, which had found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>absolute immunity under <em>Barr </em>for federal officials performing discretionary acts within their duty. In three subsequent immunity cases under \u00a7 1983, the Court, however, appears to have described the common law for executive officials as affording only a qualified immunity, even as to common law torts. With no clear indication that the Court was only describing state common law as opposed to federal common law, I am concerned about whether this undercuts the <em>Barr </em>rule and feel obliged to explain my doubts. Because of the ambiguity inhering in the Court\u2019s recent approach, it becomes necessary to trace in some detail its description of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In 1974, <em>Scheuer v. </em>Rhodes<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> presented the question of whether there should be absolute or qualified immunity in a suit for damages under \u00a7 1983 for the Governor and other high officials of a state, the president of a state university and members of the state National Guard. Noting that \u00a7 1983 was meant to give a remedy to parties deprived of their constitutional rights, the Court also repeated that \u00a7 1983 did not mean \u201cto abolish wholesale all common law immunities.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> With this suggestion that the common law would be a helpful guide in structuring immunities under \u00a7 1983, the Court turned to a review of its three past determinations. In 1951 the Court had recognized absolute immunity for state legislators, noting the history of the absolute immunity at common law, <em>Tenney v. Brandhove.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly in 1967 the Court had afforded absolute immunity to state judges sued under \u00a7 1983, again noting the absolute immunity of the common law, <em>Pierson v. Ray.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lastly, in its review, the <em>Scheuer </em>Court came to the other class of officials involved in <em>Pierson </em>\u2014 local police officers. Noting that the common law had not granted them an absolute immunity, <em>Pierson v. Ray</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>made available to them \u201cthe defense of good faith and probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">At this juncture in <em>Scheuer </em>one expects the Court to state next: 1) what the immunity at common law would be for executive officials like these, charged with some analogous tort, like wrongful death, and 2) whether that common law immunity, be it absolute or qualified, will be carried over, for whatever policy reasons, into \u00a7 1983 actions. This was essentially the analysis embodied in <em>Tenney and,Pierson </em>and was expressly the analysis employed in the later cases of <em>Wood v. </em>Strickland<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which also transplanted their respective common law immunities. But the paragraphs that one next expects in <em>Scheuer </em>are not there; instead, there are the next two sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">When a court evaluates police conduct relating to an arrest its guideline is \u201cgood faith and probable cause.\u201d <em>[Pierson </em>] In the case of higher officers of the executive branch, however, the inquiry is far more complex since the range of decisions and choices \u2014 whether the formulation of policy, of legislation, of budgets, or of day-to-day decisions \u2014 is virtually infinite.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">What these sentences suggest is that the <em>Scheuer </em>Court <em>had already decided, </em>without setting out its customary analysis, that only qualified immunity would be available. In other words, the first sentence repeated from <em>Pierson </em>that a qualified immunity means that a court should inquire into whether a police officer made an arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>with \u201cgood faith and probable cause.\u201d The phrase \u2014 \u201cthe inquiry\u201d \u2014 in the second sentence thus referred to what a court should inquire into in determining whether \u201chigher officers of the executive branch\u201d also have satisfied the reasonableness standard of qualified immunity. In the remainder of the long paragraph begun with these sentences the Court essentially established that <em>in applying qualified immunity to higher officers of the executive branch </em>a court must be very sensitive to the demands of their office, <em>e. g., </em>the occasional need for prompt decisive action and the obvious need to rely on facts supplied by others. The Court also emphasized that because the options of these high officials may be so broad and so subtle, their \u201crange of discretion\u201d for purposes of immunity had to be read very widely.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Scheuer </em>concluded from these considerations that the qualified immunity available to officers of the executive branch of government had to vary in scope, \u201cthe variation being dependent on the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office and all the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at the time of the action on which liability is sought to be based.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In sum, then, it appears that the focus of the Court\u2019s attention in <em>Scheuer </em>was upon an appropriate definition of qualified immunity;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the choice between immunities appears to have been made with little discussion and without the systematic approach found in similar cases.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In the various restatements of <em>Scheuer, </em>however, the Court has described that decision in terms of its usual systematic approach, thereby casting some light on what it considered as the common law tradition for the immunity of executive officers. In <em>Wood </em>v. Strickland,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the Court said that it had granted a qualified immunity to the <em>Scheuer </em>defendants, <em>\u201cunder prior precedent </em>and in light- of the obvious need to avoid discouraging effective official action by public officials charged with a considerable range of responsibility and discretion . .\u201d After quoting <em>Scheuer\u2019s </em>formulation of qualified immunity, <em>Wood </em>continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">Common-law tradition, <em>recognized in our prior decisions, </em>and strong public-policy reasons also lead to a construction of \u00a7 1983 extending a qualified good-faith immunity to school board members from liability for damages under that section.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8dt\">The implication from both of these quoted sentences is that the <em>Scheuer </em>outcome of qualified immunity for executive officers accorded with common law precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The next immunity case, <em>Imbler v. Pacht-man, supra, </em>described <em>Scheuer </em>in similar terms. After stating that \u201cthe Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>and other executive officials of a State\u201d had only a qualified immunity under <em>Scheuer </em>for \u00a7 1983 suits, <em>Imbler </em>characterized that process of choice between immunities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">In <em>Scheuer </em>and in <em>Wood, </em>as in the two earlier cases, <em>[Tenney </em>and <em>Pierson], </em>the considerations underlying the nature of the immunity of the respective officials in suits at common law led to essentially the same immunity under \u00a7 1983. See 420 U.S., at 318-321 [95 S.Ct. 992]; 416 U.S. at 239-247 [94 S.Ct. 1683] and n. 4.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ana-dedup-0\">Here, even more clearly than in <em>Wood, </em>the <em>Imbler </em>Court appears to be saying that the executive officials in <em>Scheuer </em>would have been entitled to only a qualified immunity at common law. What is the support for this that the Court finds in its citations back to <em>Scheuer </em>? As already noted, from the point in <em>Scheuer </em>when the Court puts the question as to these executive officials (p. 242, 94 S.Ct. 1683) through the close of the analysis (p. 247, 94 S.Ct. 1683) there is no indication of what the immunity of executive officials would be at common law. <em>Imbler </em>must be drawing its conclusion, then, from the earlier pages of general discussion (239-242, 94 S.Ct. 1683) and from n. 4, which are the portions specifically cited (see quote above). In the text of <em>Scheuer </em>at 239, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1688, official immunity is said to derive from the same considerations that generated sovereign immunity. <em>Scheuer </em>continues: \u201cWhile the latter doctrine \u2014 that the \u2018King can do no wrong\u2019 \u2014 did not protect all government officers from personal liability, the common law soon recognized the necessity of permitting officials to perform their official functions free from the threat of suits for personal liability.\u201d Attached to that last sentence is the cited footnote 4, which described the structure of official immunity at common law. Due to its significance I have set out the entire note as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">4 In England legislative immunity was secured after a long struggle, by the Bill of Rights of 1689: \u201cThat the Freedom of Speech, and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament,\u201d 1 W. &amp; M., Sess. 2, c. 2. See <em>Stockdale </em>v. <em>Hansard, </em>9 Ad. &amp; E., 1, 113\u2014 114, 112 Eng.Rep. 1112, 1155-1156 (Q. B. 1839). The English experience, of course, guided the drafters of our \u201cSpeech or Debate\u201d Clause. See <em>Tenney v. Brandhove, </em>341 U.S. 367, 372-375 [71 S.Ct. 783, 95 L.Ed. 1019] (1951); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>383 U.S. 169, 177-178, 181 [86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681] (1966); <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>408 U.S. 501 [92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507] (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">In regard to judicial immunity, Holds-worth notes: \u201cIn the ease of courts of record ... it was held, certainly as early as Edward Ill\u2019s reign, that a litigant could not go behind the record, in order to make a judge civilly or criminally liable for an abuse of his jurisdiction.\u201d 6 W. Holdsworth. A History of English Law 235 (1927). The modern concept owes much to the elaboration and restatement of Coke and other judges of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. <em>Id., </em>at 234 <em>et seq. </em>See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>12 Co.Rep. 23, 77 Eng.Rep. 1305 (K. B. 1607). The immunity of the Crown has traditionally been of a more limited nature. Officers of the Crown were at first insulated from responsibility since the King could claim the act as his own. This absolute insulation was gradually eroded. Statute of Westminster I, 3 Edw. 1, c. 24 (1275) (repealed); Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. 1, c. 13 (1285) (repealed). The development of liability, especially during the times of the Tudors and Stuarts, was slow; see, e. <em>g., </em>Public Officers Protection Act, 7 Jac. 1, c. 5 (1609) (repealed). With the accession of William and Mary, the liability of officers saw what Jaffe has termed \u201ca most remarkable and significant extension\u201d in <em>Ashby v. White, </em>1 Bro.P.C. 62, 1 Eng.Rep. 417 (H. L. 1704), reversing 6 Mod. 45, 87 Eng.Rep. 808 (Q. B. 1703). Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>(1963); A. Dicey, The Law of the Constitution 193-194 (10th ed. 1959) (footnotes omitted). See generally <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564 [79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434] (1959). Good-faith performance of a discretionary duty has remained, it seems, a defense. See Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Damage Actions, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 209, 216 (1963). See also <em>Spalding v. Vilas, </em>161 U.S. 483, 493 [16 S.Ct. 631, 40 L.Ed. 780] <em>et seq. </em>(1896).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The last two sentences of this footnote are of particular interest. With the reference to the significant extension of liability in 1704, the Court gives one the impression that since 1704, at least, \u201c[t]he immunity of the Crown has traditionally been of a more limited nature,\u201d <em>supra, </em>than the absolute immunity described, <em>supra, </em>for legislators and judges. And then the Court confirms this impression with the last sentence: \u201cGood-faith performance of a discretionary duty has remained, it seems, a defense.\u201d On the basis of these sentences, unqualified by any further language, it would appear, according to <em>Seheuer, </em>that the common law has evolved a rule of <em>qualified </em>immunity for executive officials as to all torts. If, moreover, <em>Seheuer </em>has described the common law as it applies to <em>federal </em>officials, then one wonders whether the absolute immunity of <em>Barr </em>retains all of its force.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">It may be, as I will explore below, that footnote 4 was describing instead the state common law or some traditional, perhaps English, common law, which would then distinguish and leave intact the federal common law of <em>Barr. </em>These must, of necessity, be real possibilities because, as is obvious above, the footnote itself cites to <em>Barr, </em>with apparent neutrality. For various reasons, however, it is not conclusive that footnote 4 was not describing federal common law. Thus, in my estimation, <em>Barr </em>is still put in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The first possibility is that the <em>Seheuer </em>Court was describing the evolution of English common law, apart from the American experience. Contributing to the possibility is the placement of the footnote \u2014 in a paragraph about the origins of official immunity \u2014 as well as its content \u2014 primarily about English cases and statutes. Yet it is not clear that the finishing stroke of the note, that good-faith immunity \u201cremains\u201d as the common law, is meant to pertain only to English law. Most significantly, Justice Powell, writing in <em>Imhler, supra, </em>cited expressly to \u201cn. 4\u201d in support of the underlying proposition that the state executive officials had only a qualified immunity \u201cin suits at common law.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The other possibility, then, is that the Court meant to describe the state common law in its finishing statement of note 4, perhaps in addition to summing up the evolution of British law. Supporting this possibility is the analysis of <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickl</em>and<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> where the inquiry into common law immunity was into what \u201cstate courts have generally recognized . . . under state law.\u201d On the other hand, <em>Pierson v. Ray</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>directed that the search for the common law immunity be for \u201cthe prevailing view in this country,\u201d which would presumably take into account the federal common law. And, most recently, <em>Imhler v. Pachtman</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>considered both the \u201cmajority rule\u201d of the state cases as well as its own view of the federal common law, citing <em>Yaselli v. Goff.</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">One initial conclusion to draw from these cases is that the Court does not look to the particular common law of the defendant\u2019s state as the starting point.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> State law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>consulted in order to find the more settled common law, but even the majority state view is tempered by the federal common law, which is deserving of its own weight. From these sources the Court distills the common law \u201ctradition,\u201d which it then decides whether or not to carry over to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Footnote 4, then, was drawing upon, or including federal common law, <em>i. e., Barr v. Matteo, </em>in describing the immunity for executive officials as qualified. And, according to Professor Jaffe, whose articles were cited in Scheuer<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> as important sources, <em>Barr </em>had to be considered as the \u201cleading case in the field\u201d extending absolute immunity to executives below Cabinet rank.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> While the <em>Barr </em>rule may not have been accepted by the majority of states,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> it was still, as noted, a leading case to assess in distilling the common law for purposes of \u00a7 1983 analysis. It may have been that <em>Scheuer </em>meant to leave <em>Barr </em>entirely intact, as an untraditional, minority view. Footnote 4, after all, cannot be read with complete literalness; it surely did not intend, for example, to suggest that <em>Spalding </em>v. Vilas<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> was no longer the common law.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Yet in <em>Scheuer\u2019s </em>description of the common law as affording only a qualified immunity, at least as to inferior executive officers, I cannot safely assume that the Court was not reflecting some doubt about <em>Barr. </em>If the Court had said there, or in the later cases, that the common law tradition in <em>Scheuer </em>was based upon the majority state view, then <em>Barr, </em>in' my estimation, could be applied with no hesitation. But with <em>Barr\u2019s </em>present status unsettled, I can concur only <em>dubitante.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-16\">. 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\">. 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-18\">. <em>Imbler v.

The remand directed by the panel was based upon a reading of the Supreme Court cases, particularly <em>Barr, </em>as requiring such an individualized balancing. \u00dapon further study and reflection, however, I am now of the view that the balancing engaged in by the Supreme Court was aimed at formulating rules of immunity for categories of officials, as defined by function. The Court\u2019s inquiry into the facts of each case has typically, as in <em>Barr, </em>been for purposes of deciding whether the official in question was acting within the scope of his authority and not for purposes of making an <em>ad hoc </em>balancing as to the appropriate immunity for that official alone. <em>Barr, </em>in other words, was establishing the rule that executive officials at all levels were to be accorded absolute immunity from civil suit for all actions of a discretionary nature within \u201cthe outer perimeter\u201d of the officials\u2019 \u201cline of duty.\u201d 360 U.S. at 575, 79 S.Ct. 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In restudying <em>Barr </em>and the intervening \u00a7 1983 cases, however, I have also come to the view that the language and the logic of the recent cases puts the present validity of <em>Barr </em>into doubt, even as to common law torts. Particularly since the Supreme Court will have occasion next Term in <em>Economou v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>535 F.2d 688 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted sub nom., Butz v. Economou, </em>429 U.S. 1089, 97 S.Ct. 1097, 51 L.Ed.2d 534 (1977), to reconsider <em>Barr, </em>I feel obliged to express my doubts, although, as noted, my view is that the <em>Barr </em>rule represents sound policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\">. Professor Davis, for example, looks for \u201can early overruling\u201d of <em>Barr, </em>citing as \u201cundesirable\u201d and \u201c[un]workable\u201d the distinction between the absolute immunity of <em>Bair </em>for common law torts and the qualified immunity of <em>Scheuer v.

In a concurring opinion in this case, slip op. at 6, Judge Robinson also explains and criticizes the \u201cincongruity between immunities available to the same officer exercising the same functions,\u201d turning only on whether the tort he commits is characterized as constitutional or common law, although Judge Robinson refrains from suggesting that <em>Barr </em>be overruled. <em>See also </em>Vaughn, <em>The Personal Accountability of Public Employees, </em>25 Am.U.L.Rev. 85 (1975), <em>quoting </em>Aeschylus: \u201cFor what mortal is righteous if he nothing fear?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\">. 360 U.S. at 573, 79 S.Ct. 1335. As Judge Leventhal notes, maj. at p.- of 184 U.S. App.D.C. n. 4, p. 291 of 566 F.2d Justice Harlan\u2019s reasoning about absolute immunity won the support of a majority although his opinion was for a plurality of the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 79 S.Ct. at 1342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 79 S.Ct. at 1339.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">. This argument has been made most forcibly with regard to the abuse of basic civil liberties by government officials. Dean Prosser contends, for example, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">it may seriously be questioned whether the removal of the possible deterrent effect of the individual\u2019s tort liability, at least for oppressive and outrageous conduct, would be at all a desirable thing. There once was a disreputable character named John Wilkes, whose newspaper was raided and put out of business, his premises illegally searched, and his property seized and confiscated, all for the worst kind of political motives. The tort actions which arose out of this high-handed piece of oppression were long regarded as a major blow struck for the freedom of the individual against the abuse of governmental power; and so long as cheap and conniving politicians continue to abuse that power, they should not be forgotten.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 132 at 992 (4th ed. 1971).
