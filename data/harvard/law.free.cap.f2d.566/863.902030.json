The complaint was filed in July 1976 and alleged that defendants\u2019 failure to provide plaintiffs an accessible bus transportation system violated the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, 49 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>\u00a7 1601 et seq., and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and various constitutional rights of plaintiffs. The complaint sought equitable and declaratory relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The district judge, after enjoining discovery, granted summary judgment to defendants in March 1977, and dismissed the action. The judge\u2019s brief opinion held in conclusory fashion that defendants had not violated any federal statutory or constitutional provisions and that the action was barred by the doctrines of laches, primary jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">In the district court, defendants took the position that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act did not create a private cause of action, a view which the district court apparently accepted sub silentio.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this court, however, defendants concede that mobility-handicapped persons, who are denied the use of a public transportation system, do have a private cause of action under section 504.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The concession is well warranted. See <em>Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, </em>548 F.2d 1277 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, </em>558 F.2d 413 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Vanko v. Finley, </em>No. C76-1305, 440 F.Supp. 656 (N.D.Ohio 1977); see also <em>Kampmeier v. Nyquist, </em>553 F.2d 296, 299 (2d Cir. 1977). Defendants do not, however, concede that the facts in this case warrant the conclusion that defendants have violated plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Indeed, defendants overwhelm us with a wealth of information regarding the bus transportation system in Rochester, the relevant applications by the local defendants for federal funding and the details of subsequent administrative proceedings thereon, the applicable statutes and regulations, the state of technology regarding the manufacture of buses designed to aid the mobility-handicapped,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the efforts of the local and federal defendants to meet various federal requirements, none of which was discussed in the summary disposition of the trial court. We are also told that two of the applications that plaintiffs attack are somewhere in the administrative process of the UMTA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the district court opinion fails to inform us what has delayed action upon these applications<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and whether the specific aid applied for is consistent with the newest regulations promulgated by the UMTA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellees stress that these regulations were brought to the attention of the district court, but we cannot tell whether the judge considered them \u2014 nowhere does the opinion analyze the \u201cspecial efforts\u201d of the local defendants in planning for the needs of the handicapped, which these regulations require.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>In light of the above and since the two pending applications are part of the overall planning of the transportation system complained of, we think it appropriate to remand this case for a detailed examination<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the local defendants\u2019 special efforts, taking into consideration the new regulations and the development of Transbus. See <em>United Handicapped Federation </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>558 F.2d 413 (8th Cir. 1977) (remand for failure to consider new regulations). Additionally, the district court may retain jurisdiction of this case pending final UMTA action on the applications still before it, cf. <em>Bartels v. Biernat, </em>427 F.Supp. 226, 233 (E.D.Wis.1977), and if this action is found to be unduly delayed, the district court may compel agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1). Furthermore, we hope that close supervision of this action by the district court may bring about a plan which effectively deals with the needs of the handicapped in Rochester and is acceptable to all sides.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. Plaintiff Phoenix Unlimited is an unincorporated association, composed of physically handicapped persons, and is dedicated to advocating the rights of the handicapped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. The court made no explicit mention of this statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. Federal defendants expressly concede this point and local defendants do not appear to contest it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\">. This information includes both the outfitting of existing conventional buses with devices, such as nonskid surfaces, stanchions, and grab rails, designed to aid the handicapped, see also 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.15, as amended, 42 Fed.Reg. 9655 (1977), and special buses, such as \u201cTrans-bus,\u201d the name given to low-floored, ramped buses meeting Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) specifications. Such buses easily accommodate wheel chair users and generally meet the needs of the physically handicapped. We are informed that on May 19, 1977, Secretary of Transportation Adams mandated Trans-bus for all bus procurements utilizing UMTA capital assistance funds after September 30, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b951-14\">. According to the briefs in this court, the local defendants in April 1974 submitted one application involving a five year improvement program. (Project No. NY-03-0064). The UMTA approved two years of the program and encouraged reapplication for the other buses. The local defendants filed a new application, which was subsequently divided into two parts (Project Nos. NY-03-0064-02 and NY-05-0003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b951-15\">. The resubmitted application was dated August 28, 1975, indicating that the applications in one form or another have been pending for over two years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\">. See 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 450 Subpart A (App. B), as amended, 41 Fed.Reg. 18235 (1976); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.15, as amended, 41 Fed.Reg. 45842 (1976) and 42 Fed.Reg. 9655 (1977); and 49 C.F.R. . \u00a7\u00a7 613.100 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. See, e. g., <em>Vanko v. Finley, </em>No. C76-1305, <em>440 </em>F.Supp. 656 (N.D.Ohio 1977). We express no view on whether the defendants\u2019 special efforts, including the pending applications, comply with the regulations. However, this analysis should take into consideration the emerging case law interpreting these regulations. See, e. g., id.; <em>Bartels </em>v. <em>Biernat, </em>427 F.Supp. 226 (E.D. Wis.1977); <em>United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b952-15\">. Appellees also urge upon us the district court\u2019s alternative holding that this suit is barred by laches and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. To the extent that this holding is based upon the apparent failure of the mobility-handicapped appellants to attend a public hearing concerning the April 1974 application for federal funds, see note 5 supra, the holding was error. Plaintiffs concede, however, that the buses already furnished pursuant to that application need not be altered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
