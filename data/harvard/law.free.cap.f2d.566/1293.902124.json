(\u201cAMPI\u201d) appeals from four orders by Chief Judge Adrian A. Spears of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.

This investigation prompted the United States on February 1, 1972 to file a civil antitrust action against AMPI in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Chief Judge Spears presiding. The Government charged AMPI with violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, and sought injunctive relief. Fifteen private treble damage antitrust suits were also filed against AMPI in various federal courts during 1971 and 1972. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, transferred the private suits for pretrial proceedings to Chief Judge John W. Oliver of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The cases were designated JPML Docket No. 83, sometimes referred to by the Government as the Midwest Milk Monopolization Litigation. On February 20, 1974, Chief Judge Spears transferred the Government\u2019s suit against AMPI to Chief Judge Oliver to coordinate discovery with that in JPML Docket No. 83. The Government\u2019s suit was not consolidated with the private actions, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">In January of 1974 the plaintiffs (one of whom was The National Farmers\u2019 Organization, Inc.) in two of the private suits moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b), which pertains to failure to comply with a discovery order, for sanctions against AMPI for allegedly frustrating discovery by refusing to produce material documents. The United States chose not to file a similar Rule 37(b) motion, electing instead to participate only in civil discovery relating to the private plaintiffs\u2019 motions, which are still pending before Chief Judge Oliver. On August 13, 1974, the United States and AMPI filed a proposed consent decree in the Government\u2019s suit. Chief Judge Oliver approved the decree on April 30, 1975. <em>See United States v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., </em>W.D.Mo., 1975, 394 F.Supp. 29, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>8 Cir., 534 F.2d 113, <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>429 U.S. 940, 97 S.Ct. 355, 50 L.Ed.2d 309 (1976). This settlement notwithstanding, attorneys from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice initiated the instant grand jury investigation of AMPI on February 10, 1975 in the Uhited States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Chief Judge Spears supervised the grand jury. The Government directed its investigation to alleged obstruction of justice by AMPI in the discovery stages of the various civil antitrust suits. The Government served AMPI with a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>directing it to appear before the grand jury and produce thirteen different categories of documents. AMPI countered by filing motions to quash or modify the subpoena and to stay the grand jury investigation, as well as motions for an eviden-tiary hearing and an in camera inspection of documents purporting to grant authority to the Antitrust Division attorneys to conduct the grand jury investigation. Chief Judge Spears denied the motions on February 19, 1975 and denied reconsideration of the motion to stay on May 6, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">The grand jury was discharged on August 6, 1976. It did not return an indictment. However, in a letter to the district court, it recommended that the court retain custody of the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings and those personal records of individuals, such as tax returns and calendars, received by the grand jury. It recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>mended further that the business files and records of AMPI received by the grand jury \u201cbe made available to other courts pursuant to an appropriate Rule 6(e) motion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government filed a statement indicating it had \u201cno objection to the entry of such order as the Court deems appropriate to make the grand jury subpoenas, transcripts and documents available to Chief Judge Oliver for such use as he deems appropriate in connection with the [private plaintiffs\u2019] Rule 37 motions and the trial of the JPML 83 cases.\u201d Accordingly, the district court on August 25, 1976 ordered that the \u201cgrand jury subpoenas, transcripts and documents . be disclosed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for such use in pending proceedings as that Court deems appropriate.\u201d AMPI moved the court tq reconsider and it did. On October 1, 1976, Chief Judge Spears modified his order of August 25 and directed the clerk to send Chief Judge Oliver only an inventory of the grand jury materials for his in camera inspection and to forward to him any materials for which he found a \u201ccompelling need.\u201d The district court stayed its order, however, pending this appeal. Meanwhile, The National Farmers\u2019 Organization, Inc., one of the private plaintiffs in JPML Docket No. 83, moved the district court to intervene as of right in this controversy pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 24(a)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court granted its motion on November 4, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">On appeal AMPI raises numerous objections to the district court\u2019s orders of February 19, May 6, October 1, and November 11. AMPI contends that the district court erred in issuing its first two orders because the Department of Justice initiated the grand jury investigation in bad faith \u201cfor improper purposes\u201d and because the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division was without authority to appoint attorneys to conduct a grand jury investigation relating to obstruction of justice allegations. With respect to the third order, AMPI contends that Chief Judge Spears committed numerous procedural and substantive errors of law in transferring an inventory of the grand jury materials to Chief Judge Oliver.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, AMPI contends that the fourth order was erroneous because The National Farmers\u2019 Organization, Inc. is not a proper candidate for intervention under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">II. <em>The Question of Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">We first consider whether AMPI\u2019s appeal is properly before this Court in light of the final judgment requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Section 1291 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-11\">The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\">The final judgment rule has been a part of federal appellate review since the First Judiciary Act, which limited appellate review to \u201cfinal judgments and decrees.\u201d Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22, 25, 1 Stat. 73, 83-85. But for one temporary exception,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> finality continued to be a prerequisite to appealability until Congress passed the Evarts Act in 1891, which provided for review of interlocutory orders \u201cgranting or continuing\u201d injunctions. Act of March 3, 1891, \u00a7 7, 26 Stat. 826, 828. From that initial grant has evolved 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, presently the principal statutory authority for appeals from interlocutory orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the final judgment requirement continues in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 as the dominant rule of federal appellate practice. Justice Frankfurter articulated this fact in <em>Cobbledick </em>v. <em>United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 824-25, 60 S.Ct. 540, 541, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-5\">Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure. It was written into the first Judiciary Act and has been departed from only when observance of it would practically defeat the right to any review at all. Since the right to a judgment from more than one court is a matter of grace and not a necessary ingredient of justice, Congress from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for practical purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administration. Thereby is avoided the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise from its initiation to entry of judgment. To be effective, judicial administration must not be leaden-footed. Its momentum would be arrested by permitting separate review of the component elements in a unified cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\"><em>See, e. g., Di Bella </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 126, 82 S.Ct. 654, 658, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962); <em>Diamond Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Rev., </em>8 Cir., 1970, 422 F.2d 532, 534; J. Moore, B. Ward &amp; J. Lucas, 9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.06 at 105-07 (1975); Redish, <em>The Pragmatic Approach to Appealability in the Federal Courts, </em>75 <em>Colum.L.Rev. </em>89 (1975); Note, <em>The Finality and Appealability of Interlocutory Orders </em>\u2014 A <em>Structural Reform Toward Redefinition, </em>7 <em>Suffolk U.L.Rev. </em>1037, 1039 (1973). <em>See also Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 180-82, 75 S.Ct. 249, 252-53, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">Predictably, the determination of what constitutes a final judgment has been no easy task. Justice Black once stated that \u201cfinal\u201d in the context of appealability is an \u201cabstruse and infinitely uncertain term.\u201d <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 108, 88 S.Ct. 269, 280, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967) (Black, J., concurring). <em>See McGourkey v. Toledo &amp; Ohio Central Railway Co., </em>146 U.S. 536, 544-45, 13 S.Ct. 170, 172, 36 L.Ed. 1079 (1892). Three Supreme Court decisions in particular, however, provide a framework in which to contend with the problem of defining \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>In <em>Cobbledick v. United States, supra, </em>the Court held that a district court order denying motions to quash subpoenas <em>duces te-cum </em>directing three witnesses to appear before the grand jury was not an appeala-ble final judgment. The Court established a stringent standard of finality, one that seemingly encompassed an entire case including collateral parties and issues. Regarding finality as \u201cthe means for achieving a healthy legal system,\u201d Justice Frankfurter, writing for a unanimous Court, stated that \u201c[njeither a party nor a non-party witness will be allowed to take to the upper court a ruling where the result of review will be \u2018to halt in the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation. . . . 309 U.S. at 326, 60 S.Ct. at 541-42, <em>quoting Segurola v. United States, </em>275 U.S. 106, 112, 48 S.Ct. 77, 79, 72 L.Ed. 186 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\"><em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), created an exception to the finality standard of <em>Cobbledick. </em>In <em>Cohen </em>the district court refused to apply a state statute requiring the plaintiff in a stockholder\u2019s derivative action to make a security deposit as a condition of proceeding with the suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court found this to be an appealable final judgment. First, however, Justice Jackson articulated the Court\u2019s continued support of the final judgment rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aih-dedup-0\">The effect of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291] is to disallow appeal from any decision which is tentative, informal or incomplete. Appeal gives the upper court a power of review, not one of intervention. So long as the matter remains open, unfinished or inconclusive, there may be no intrusion by appeal. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-6\">Nor does the statute permit appeals, even from fully consummated decisions, where they are but steps towards final judgment in which they will merge. The purpose is to combine in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when final judgment results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. In this case the district court order was held to be appealable because it fell</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av9b\">in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-9\">337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-26. Moreover, the district court order presented \u201ca serious and unsettled question,\u201d 337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226, which, if reviewed upon final disposition of the merits of the case, would work a serious hardship on the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-10\">When that time comes, it will be too late effectively to review the present order and the rights conferred by the statute, if it is applicable, will have been lost, probably irreparably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-11\">337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. Finally, as if concerned that its deceptively simple finality test might become a mere talisman, the Court emphasized that, as in <em>Cohen, </em>section 1291 is to be given a \u201cpractical rather than a technical construction.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226, <em>citing Cobbledick v. United States, supra, </em>309 U.S. at 328, 60 S.Ct. at 542, <em>United States v. River Rouge Improvement Co., </em>269 U.S. 411, 414, 46 S.Ct. 144, 145, 70 L.Ed. 339 (1926), <em>Bank of Columbia v. Sweeney, </em>26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 567, 569, 7 L.Ed. 265 (1828).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-12\">This \u201cpractical\u201d approach to finality was the touchstone of the Court\u2019s most recent definitive statement on the final judgment rule. In <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), the Court carved out another exception to the rule in holding to be final a district court order providing that the Jones Act supplied the exclusive remedy in plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action. Justice Black stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>[A] decision \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1291 does not necessarily mean the last order possible to be made in a case. . And our cases long have recognized that whether a ruling is \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1291 is frequently so close a question that decision of that issue either way can be supported with equally forceful arguments, and that it is impossible to devise a formula to resolve all marginal cases coming within what might well be called the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of finality. Because of this difficulty this Court has held that the requirement of finality is to be given a \u201cpractical rather than a technical construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">379 U.S. at 152, 85 S.Ct. at 311, <em>citing Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, </em>337 U.S. at 545, 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225, 1226. The Court emphasized further that \u201cin deciding the question of finality the most important competing considerations are \u2018the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other.\u2019 \u201d 379 U.S. at 152-53, 85 S.Ct. at 311, <em>quoting Dickinson </em>v. <em>Petroleum Conversion Corp., </em>338 U.S. 507, 511, 70 S.Ct. 322, 324, 94 L.Ed. 299 (1950). In this marginal case of finality, the scales tipped in favor of review and against the usual result of nonappeala-bility only because the questions presented were \u201c \u2018fundamental to the further conduct of the case.\u2019 \u201d 379 U.S. at 153, 85 S.Ct. at 311, <em>quoting United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>323 U.S. 373, 377, 65 S.Ct. 357, 359, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Using the framework provided by <em>Cob-bledick, Cohen, </em>and <em>Gillespie </em>as our benchmark, we find that the district court orders of February 19, May 6, and October 1 are not final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Accordingly, the appeal of these orders must be dismissed. This is, to be sure, one of those cases falling within \u201cthe \u2018twilight zone\u2019 of finality.\u201d However, the decisions of the Supreme Court and the lower courts\u2019 applications of those decisions indicate to us that the final judgment rule is still to be construed narrowly. Like most rules, it is subject to exceptions, as <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gillespie </em>demonstrate. The flexibility provided by these exceptions is a necessary ingredient of just decisions. <em>See, e. g., Litton Systems, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>5 Cir., 1976, 539 F.2d 418, 425-26. But if the rule is not to be emasculated, its exceptions must be carefully drawn and sparingly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">The district court\u2019s orders of February 19 and May 6 denying AMPI\u2019s motions to quash or modify the grand jury subpoena and to stay the grand jury investigation pending an evidentiary hearing and an in camera inspection, though \u201cfully consummated decisions,\u201d are \u201cbut steps toward final judgment.\u201d The orders address questions which still remain \u201copen, unfinished [and] inconclusive.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. The issues raised by AMPI, which are inextricably linked to the pending private treble damage antitrust actions known as JPML Docket No. 83, have not yet been finally resolved by the district courts involved in this matter. It is true, of course, that Chief Judge Spears has ruled with respect to AMPI\u2019s contentions. But Chief Judge Oliver has not. Should disclosure of the grand jury materials be authorized in the JPML Docket No. 83 pretrial proceedings, AMPI will have yet another opportunity to raise its contentions before Chief Judge Oliver. With such an effective mode of review still available to AMPI, and therefore such a significant distance in the road toward final judgment yet untravelled, this Court is reluctant to intervene now, particularly in light of the importance of AMPI\u2019s contentions in litigation pending in another more interested circuit. <em>Cf. Kerotest Manufacturing Co. v. C-O</em>\u2014Two <em>Fire Equipment Co., </em>342 U.S. 180, 72 S.Ct. 219, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">Additionally, in arguing that we should hear its appeal, AMPI has not demonstrated that later review will prejudice any of its rights, irreparably or otherwise. <em>See Barfield v. Weinberger, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 485 F.2d 696; <em>21 Turtle Creek Square, Ltd. v. New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 31, 33. <em>See generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number><em>United States v.

Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Cohen, </em>it has failed to show satisfactorily that its appeal falls within \u201cthat small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-26. <em>See, e. g., Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack, </em>9 Cir., 1975, 524 F.2d 891, 895-900, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 57, 50 L.Ed.2d 75 (1976); <em>Barfield v.

Similarly, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Gillespie, </em>AMPI has failed to demonstrate that the questions presented by its appeal of these orders, even from a \u201cpractical\u201d perspective, are \u201c \u2018fundamental to the further conduct of the case,\u2019 \u201d or, even from the same pragmatic perspective, that \u201cthe danger of denying justice by delay\u201d in this case outweighs \u201cthe inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review.\u201d <em>Gillespie v.

Gardiner, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 473 F.2d 1228, 1231; <em>Fox v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 383 F.2d 189, 193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">The order of October 1 is not appeal-able at this time for many of the same reasons. In the October 1 order, Chief Judge Spears, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e), directed that the clerk of court send an inventory of the grand jury materials to Chief Judge Oliver for his in camera inspection. Then,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-5\">[i]n the event the transferee judge [Chief Judge Oliver] finds at any time that there is a compelling need for all 'or any part of the said grand jury subpoenas, transcripts and documents, and certifies that the transfer thereof is warranted, the Clerk shall forthwith transfer the requested material to the transferee judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">Chief Judge Spears was careful to indicate in his order that he was not passing on the question of disclosure of the grand jury materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-7\">Nothing set forth in this order, or stated in open court on this date, should be construed as any finding by this Court with respect to the relevancy or materiality of, or the need for, the said grand jury materials, it being the intention of this Court that all such matters shall be solely addressed to, and determined by, the transferee judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">It is thus apparent that the district court order of October 1 was no more than a decision to permit Chief Judge Oliver to decide whether the materials should be disclosed in JPML Docket No. 83. This is precisely the type of \u201ctentative, informal [and] incomplete\u201d interlocutory decision that Congress in passing section 1291 intended to preclude from immediate review. <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. <em>See Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 2149. It is not now apparent whether any, all, or none of the grand jury materials at issue in this case will be disclosed in JPML Docket No. 83. No one has yet been aggrieved and no one will become aggrieved until Chief Judge Oliver acts. Until then there is no appeala-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>ble final order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additionally, as in the case of its appeal from the February 19 and May 6 orders, AMPI has failed to demonstrate satisfactorily how its position comes within the ambit of <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gillespie. See </em>the cases cited on pages 1299 and 1300 <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, review is not proper at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">Finally, we reach the question of whether the order of November 4, which granted the motion of The National Farmers\u2019 Organization, Inc. to intervene as of right pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2), is appealable. It is well settled that \u201c[a]n order allowing intervention is interlocutory and may not be appealed immediately.\u201d <em>In re Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 516 F.2d 480, 484, <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 925, 96 S.Ct. 2637, 44 L.Ed.2d 380 (1976). We therefore cannot entertain the appeal of this order. Accordingly, AMPI\u2019s appeal of the district court orders of February 19, May 6, October 1, and November 4 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">.

As relief from these three alleged erroneous orders, AMPI requests that we remand the case to the district court with directions to return AMPI\u2019s subpoenaed documents and to expunge the other grand jury materials. Alternatively, AMPI requests that we remand with directions to hold an evidentiary hearing and an in camera inspection to allow AMPI to show the Government\u2019s alleged misuse of the grand jury and the alleged absence of prosecutorial authority by the Antitrust Division attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">. In 1875 Congress gave the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over orders of the federal circuit courts of appeals dismissing actions or remanding them to state courts for want of jurisdiction or for jurisdiction improperly or collusively effected. Act of March 3, 1875, \u00a7 5, 18 Stat. 470, 472. Congress repealed this grant in 1887.

To be appealable a district court order must be final or it must fall into one of those specific classes of appealable interlocutory orders provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. The final judgment rule is also subject to statutory exceptions that permit appeals as of right from certain interlocutory orders. See, e. <em>g., </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47 (authorizing appeals in \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1404 and 3731 (authorizing interlocutory appeals by the Government from pretrial orders suppressing evidence). Additionally, the All Writs Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, can serve as a vehicle for obtaining review in appropriate cases of normally nonappealable interlocutory orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">. The purpose of the statute was to make a plaintiff liable for all expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees of the corporate defendants if the plaintiff failed to make good his or her complaint and to entitle the defendants to indemnity before the suit could go forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">. AMPI relies on recently decided <em>State of Illinois </em>v. <em>Sarbaugh, </em>7 Cir., 1977, 552 F.2d 768, as support for its position that the October 1 order is appealable. <em>Sarbaugh </em>is remarkably similar to this case on its facts and issues with one critical exception. The order held appeala-ble by the Seventh Circuit in that case was an order \u201cholding that the requisite particularized showing of compelling necessity had not been made.\u201d 552 F.2d at 771. In this case Chief Judge Oliver has not yet even had the opportunity to reach the question of compelling need. For the same reason, <em>In re Biaggi, </em>2 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 489, <em>Gibson v. United States, </em>1968, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 143, 403 F.2d 166, and <em>United States v. Byoir, </em>5 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 336, are also inapposite to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
