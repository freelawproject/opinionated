Carol Johnson, whose position as Senior Attorney in the State Real Property Bureau was terminated pursuant to that provision, seeks its invalidation, claiming that, on its face and as applied, \u00a7 70 contravenes the due process and equal protection clauses. We are convinced, however, that the retirement provisions are a reasonable expression of state policy and clearly meet constitutional standards. Accordingly, we affirm Judge Goettel\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">Johnson\u2019s involvement with the New York State civil service began in 1962, when he first applied for the position of Senior Attorney \u2014 Realty in the Real Property Bureau of the New York State Law Department. Following his successful completion of the required competitive civil service examination, Johnson was interviewed for and given the post. He reported for work on January 10, 1963 and, according to his complaint, his primary duties consisted of reading title abstracts to determine the ownership of property taken by the State for roadways, parks and recreation centers. Johnson remained in this position for over ten years, and his performance was satisfactory throughout. In fact, when he again took the civil service examination in 1968 to qualify for a transfer from Albany to New York City, he received a perfect score.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">On June 21, 1973, Johnson turned seventy. He was then informed that, pursuant to \u00a7 70 of the Retirement Law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>be mandatorily retired at the end of the month. In pertinent part, \u00a7 70 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\">Any member who attains age seventy shall be retired on the first day of the calendar month next succeeding such event. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">\u00a7 70(c) further qualifies this provision by authorizing the State Civil Commission to \u201ccontinue\u201d an employee until the age of 78 in incremental periods not to exceed two years. To be eligible for such an extension, the civil servant must receive the approval of the head of his department, be certified as fit, and demonstrate that his retention in service would be advantageous because of his expert knowledge and special qualifications. The employment under \u00a7 70(c) of any retired member may be terminated upon sixty days notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 70(c), Johnson successfully applied for two extensions, and was granted continuances of, respectively, six and three months. His efforts at obtaining a third were unavailing, however, and his employment was terminated on March 31, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Exactly three years later, on March 31, 1977, Johnson commenced this action seeking a declaration that \u00a7 70 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. Johnson\u2019s complaint alleged, in exhaustive fashion, that the statutory provision abridges the fundamental right to work; permits the termination of a tenured employee without procedural due process; creates an irrebuttable presumption based upon age; results in a denial of equal protection; impairs the contractual relationship of tenured civil service employees; constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and permits an unconstitutional delegation of authority to those who must administer it. Johnson also claimed that the action of the Attorney General in refusing to grant him a further extension of his employment was arbitrary, and contrary to the spirit of \u00a7 70(c). Beyond a declaration of his rights, Johnson sought an order reinstating him to his position, awarding him back pay and other accrued benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The State moved to dismiss the complaint and, on May 16, 1977, Judge Goettel granted its motion. He held that the counts alleging constitutional violations failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted, and that the remaining counts, attacking the Attorney General\u2019s refusal to continue Johnson in service, did not constitute issues conferring federal jurisdiction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">At the heart of Johnson\u2019s complaint is his claim that \u00a7 70 violates the equal protection clause and creates an impermissible, irre-buttable presumption. Yet, these very contentions have been rejected in a variety of contexts by virtually every court considering them, including the Supreme Court and this court. See <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (mandatory retirement of state police officers at age fifty); <em>McIlvaine v. Pennsylvania, </em>415 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 1583, 39 L.Ed.2d 884 (1974) (mandatory retirement of state police officers at age sixty); <em>Rubino v. Ghezzi, </em>512 F.2d 431 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 891, 96 S.Ct. 187, 46 L.Ed.2d 122 (1975) (manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>tory retirement of state court judges at age 70); <em>Weisbrod v. Lynn, </em>383 F.Supp. 933 (D.D.C.1974), <em>aff\u2019d </em>420 U.S. 940, 95 S.Ct. 1319, 43 L.Ed.2d 420 (1975) (mandatory retirement of federal civil service employees at age seventy).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">These cases uniformly instruct that age is not a suspect classification requiring strict scrutiny of the state\u2019s scheme of age restrictions. See also <em>Weiss v. Walsh, </em>324 F.Supp. 75 (S.D.N.Y.1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>461 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1129, 93 S.Ct. 939, 35 L.Ed.2d 262 (1973). And, in addition, they clearly estab lish that the Constitution does not afford any individual a protected right to public employment. See also <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Accordingly, the state need only articulate a rational basis for its statutory scheme. It would appear without question that \u00a7 70 is reasonably related to legitimate state interests in efficiency and economy. A mandatory retirement policy allows department heads to plan the training and advancement of their employees, and motivates young workers to acquit themselves well and to progress through the ranks. And the statute before us, which permits some employees to continue in their jobs until the age of 78, serves these legitimate state purposes without needless prejudice to the greater number of qualified employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Johnson\u2019s argument that \u00a7 70 establishes an irrebuttable presumption is substantially the same as his equal protection claim. Moreover, it is now clear that the applicability of the so-called irrebuttable presumption doctrine is limited to those cases involving suspect classifications. <em>See Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973); <em>Note, The Irre-buttable Presumption Doctrine in the Supreme Court, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. 1534 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Apart from his substantive attacks on the retirement provision,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson alleges that he was deprived of his tenured civil service position without procedural due process. He claims that he was entitled to a hearing either at the time of his mandatory retirement or at the time his final extension was refused. Appellee suggests that Johnson\u2019s due process argument is wholly misguided since his termination affected neither a protected property or liberty interest. We need not, however, reach the state\u2019s argument. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Johnson\u2019s dismissal affected his property or liberty, a determination of constitutionally mandated procedures requires that the interests of the individual in being afforded such safeguards be balanced against the burden to the state in conducting them. It is clear to us that the administrative cost to the state of providing each retiree with a hearing would be enormous, and by far outweigh the hardship to the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Finally, Johnson claims that the action of the Attorney General in refusing to recommend his continuance was arbitrary and contrary to the spirit of \u00a7 70. This contention raises a question of state law which could have been reviewed in the state courts by way of an Article 78 proceeding. <em>Powell v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, </em>327 F.2d 131, 137 (2d Cir. 1964). Such a claim, simply enough, does not confer federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">In upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 70, we recognize that there are many individuals who wish to continue in their positions past the age of 70 \u2014 perhaps, beyond the age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>of 78. The New York State Retirement Law, however, evidences a legislative weighing of the desire of older employees to retain their jobs against the interests of efficiency and economy in the civil service. We cannot say that the balance struck by the\u2019 legislature is a constitutionally impermissible one. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-16\">. Section 70</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">\u201c(b) Any member who attains age seventy shall be retired on the first day of the calendar month next succeeding such event. .</p>\n<p id=\"b953-25\">(c) Notwithstanding the provision of subdivision b of this section, the state civil ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>vice commission may approve the continuance in service of members who have attained age seventy. Such approvals shall be for periods not to exceed two years each. No such approval shall be given unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">1. The head of the department in which the member is employed shall file a written statement with the comptroller approving such continuance, and</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">2. The medical board shall certify that such member is physically fit to perform the duties of his position, and</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">3. The state civil service commission shall find that:</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">(a) Such member is less than seventy-eight years of age, and</p>\n<p id=\"AQpZ\">(b) His continuance in service would be advantageous because of his expert knowledge and special qualifications. The service of any such member may, however, be terminated at any time by the head of the department in which he is employed, upon sixty days written notice to such member\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">. Johnson also makes the ancillary claim that he has been denied equal protection vis-a-vis those individuals over the age of seventy whose service has been continued pursuant to the statute. The status of those employees, however, is not based upon a classification established by the State, but upon case-by-case determinations made by agency heads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\">. Johnson\u2019s claim that the statute constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is frivolous. It is clear that such a contention has no place in the context of a civil proceeding. <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Equally frivolous is his assertion that \u00a7 70(c) permits an unconstitutional delegation to those who must administer it. The statute, however, does not confer arbitrary discretion. It contains sufficiently defined standards to guide administrators in the exercise of their duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
