M. Sage, trustee in bankruptcy for Guy 0. Foss. Each claims the surplus proceeds of about $7,500 from the tax sale of Foss\u2019s yacht \u201cPrincess Mary,\u201d sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Maddex for $27,500, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-24\">The government\u2019s tax lien was junior to a mortgage held by Marc Venable. Maddex paid $15,000 to Venable to discharge the senior mortgage, and $27,500 to the government, out of which the IRS satisfied its tax lien and paid the costs of sale, totalling together about $20,000. Maddex claims the $7,500 surplus, arguing that he received an \u201cassignment\u201d of the senior mortgage from Venable and that the senior mortgage is next in line for satisfaction. Foss\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy claims the surplus as the remaining owner\u2019s equity. The district court found for the purchaser Maddex. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-25\">Any surplus proceeds remaining after a levy and sale pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6335 are to be paid to the \u201cperson or persons legally entitled thereto.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6342. According to 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6342-1, this means \u201cthe delinquent taxpayer unless another person establishes a superior claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-26\">Foreclosure affects the rights of all mortgagees junior to the foreclosing mortgagee and requires them to look to the proceeds for satisfaction, but it has no effect whatso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>ever upon the interest of senior mortgagees such as Venable. <em>Mansfield v. Excelsior Ref. Co., </em>135 U.S. 326, 10 S.Ct. 825, 34 L.Ed. 162 (1890); <em>Pargament v. Fitzgerald, </em>272 F.Supp. 553, 555 (S.D.N.Y.1967); <em>Horvitz </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>134 F.Supp. 957, 959 (W.D.Pa. 1955). Any surplus after both the foreclosing and junior mortgagees are satisfied goes to the owner of the equity of redemption. R. Powell, <em>The Law of Real Property </em>\u00a7 467 (1977). The above regulation embodies the ancient rule that \u201cupon sale under a junior mortgage, the surplus belongs to the mortgagor, and is not applied to the satisfaction of the prior mortgage; for the equity of redemption which was sold belongs to the mortgagor, and the presumption of the law is, that the purchaser of it only pays for its worth in excess of the prior mortgage debt.\u201d L. Jones, Law <em>of Mortgages </em>\u00a7 2186 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Thus if Maddex had not paid off the senior mortgage, he would have paid $27,-500 for the yacht and held it subject to the $15,000 senior mortgage. <em>See Mansfield v. Excelsior Ref. Co., supra; Pargament </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra; Horvitz v. Granger, supra. </em>The senior mortgagor would look to the yacht for satisfaction. The effect of rewarding Maddex with the $7,500 surplus would be to reduce his price for the yacht, free of encumbrances, from $42,500 to $35,-000. In sum, the existence of the senior mortgage, its discharge by Maddex and its \u201cassignment\u201d to him are simply irrelevant to the disposition of the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Following 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6342, as well as the chancellors of old who created the equity of redemption, we hold that Sage, the trustee in bankruptcy, is entitled to the surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
