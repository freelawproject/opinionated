The issue is whether it amounted to infringement or, as the District Court held, was permissible because limited to information in the public domain. We hold that infringement occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Plaintiff Marion S. Schroeder was the compiler of <em>The Green Thumbook, </em>for which a concededly valid copyright was issued. Defendants are the publisher and the printer of the accused book, <em>The Gardener\u2019s Catalogue. </em>We cannot improve on the description of the books and the manner of their preparation which appears in the opinion of the District Court, 421 F.Supp. 372, 374-376, to which reference is made for a full statement of the facts. A brief synopsis will suffice here. Plaintiffs\u2019 book consists of listings of the names and addresses of suppliers of seeds, plants, publications, and other items useful to gardeners, with information about each supplier listed; and a similar list of plant societies. Defendants\u2019 book is much more voluminous. It includes gardening advice and information, illustrations, and miscellaneous similar material, in addition to listings of plant societies and suppliers of seeds, plants, etc. Without independent checking or verification, the compilers of defendants\u2019 book copied the names and addresses, but not the other information, appearing on 27 of the 63 pages of plaintiffs\u2019 book.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The copied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>names and addresses, which amount to about one per cent of defendants\u2019 book, were publicly available, but plaintiff Marion S. Schroeder had collected and categorized them by her own individual effort. In compiling two of the lists, she had used other published lists, but there was evidence, in the form of testimony and the various lists themselves, that she had not merely copied the other lists but had used them for verification or checking or to obtain sources of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Copyrights on compilations such as plaintiffs\u2019 are provided for in \u00a7 7 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 7: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cCompilations or abridgments, adaptations, arrangements ... or other versions of works in the public domain or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works . . . shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The District Court held that \u00a7 7 protected Marion S. Schroeder\u2019s \u201cdescriptions of the various sources and publications\u201d and \u201cthe totality of her work,\u201d but not the categorized lists of names and addresses otherwise in the public domain. Because the compilers of defendants\u2019 catalogue had \u201climited their copying to information ... in the public domain,\u201d and had eschewed those marks of originality for which Marion S. Schroeder was entitled to \u201cthe reward of a compilation copyright,\u201d they had not infringed the copyright. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment, and defendants cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of their request for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">We hold that plaintiffs\u2019 copyright was infringed. An original compilation of names and addresses is copyrightable even though the individual names and addresses are in the public domain and not copyrightable. <em>Leon v. Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>91 F.2d 484 (9th Cir. 1937); <em>Jeweler\u2019s Circular Pub. Co. v. Keystone Pub. Co., </em>281 F. 83, 87-88 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>259 U.S. 581, 42 S.Ct. 464, 66 L.Ed. 1074 (1922). As the latter case observed, only \u201cindustrious collection,\u201d not originality in the sense of novelty, is required. See also <em>Gelles-Widmer Co. v. Milton-Bradley Co., </em>313 F.2d 143, 146 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U.S; 913, 83 S.Ct. 1303, 10 L.Ed.2d 414 (1963). Thus we reject defendants\u2019 contention, first raised at oral argument, that the \u201cnovelty\u201d requirement of patentability is applicable to copyrights as well. <em>Cf. L. Batlin &amp; Son, Inc. v. Snyder, </em>536 F.2d 486; 490 (2d Cir.) <em>(in banc), cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 857, 97 S.Ct. 156, 50 L.Ed.2d 135 (1976), distinguishing between the \u201cnovelty\u201d required for patentability and the \u201coriginality\u201d necessary for copyright protection. The copyright protects not the individual names and addresses but the compilation, the product of the compiler\u2019s industry. Another is entitled to make his own compilation of the same names and addresses, using information in the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>domain, but he is not entitled merely to copy the copyrighted list. <em>G. R. Leonard &amp; Co. v. Stack, </em>386 F.2d 38, 39 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The validity of plaintiffs\u2019 copyright is not disputed. It is clear from the District Court\u2019s findings that the bulk of the compilations in plaintiffs\u2019 directory were made with substantial independent effort and not by merely copying from other sources. The use of another copyrighted directory to obtain sources of information or for verification and checking, to the extent it occurred, was not wrongful and did not put plaintiffs\u2019 compilation beyond the protection of the statute. See <em>G. R. Leonard &amp; Co. v. Stack, supra, </em>386 F.2d at 39. The compilers of defendants\u2019 book, it is also clear, simply copied into their own book, without any independent effort or even verification, virtually all the names and addresses appearing on 27 of the 63 pages of plaintiffs\u2019 book. The large staff that prepared defendants\u2019 book was saved \u201ca few days\u201d time and effort by this copying at a time when they were working \u201c14 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d to meet a deadline, which they barely met. As the Second Circuit held in <em>Orgel v. Clark Boardman Co., </em>301 F.2d 119, 120, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 817, 83 S.Ct. 31, 9 L.Ed.2d 58 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cAppropriation of the fruits of another\u2019s labor and skill in order to publish a rival work without the expenditure of the time and effort required for independently arrived at results is copyright infringement.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defendants are not exonerated by the fact that the compilers of their book copied only the names and addresses and not the accompanying descriptive material that appeared in plaintiffs\u2019 book. The copyright protected not merely the descriptive material but also \u201cthe selection, the ordering and arrangement\u201d of the names and addresses. <em>Edwards &amp; Deutsch Lithographing Co. </em>v. <em>Boorman, </em>15 F.2d 35, 36 (7th Cir.), <em>cert.denied, </em>273 U.S. 738, 47 S.Ct. 247, 71 L.Ed. 867 (1926). Plaintiffs\u2019 cata-logue would have been copyrightable without the descriptive material. The inclusion of that material, which was also copyrightable, did not destroy the protection the law affords the compilation of names and addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The District Court found it unnecessary to reach defendants\u2019 alternative defense of fair use, see <em>Eisenschiml v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., </em>246 F.2d 598 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 907, 78 S.Ct. 334, 2 L.Ed.2d 262 (1957), but expressed doubt as to the merits of that defense because \u201cthe material taken from plaintiffs\u2019 book, <em>The Green Thumbook, </em>was substantial in quantity and regarded by defendants as \u2018the most important strata\u2019 of <em>The Gardener\u2019s </em>Catalogue.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This doubt was well founded, and we reject the fair use argument for the reasons on which the doubt was based. We add that the value of the material copied is demonstrated not only by the admission referred to by the District Court, but also by the fact that the copying of the material by the compilers without independent checking enabled them to meet an important deadline. See <em>Mathews Conveyor Co. v. Palmer-Bee Co., </em>135 F.2d 73, 85 (6th Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Finally, defendants\u2019 cross-appeal from the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees is frivolous. It is plaintiffs who are entitled to an allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The judgment is reversed and remanded to the District Court for a determination of the appropriate relief and the entry of judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. Whether an injunction is necessary at this time will depend on whether any copies of the infringing edition of <em>The Gardener's Catalogue </em>are still available for sale. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention at oral argument before us, damages need not be measured by the entire profit earned by defendants on the infringing book but may be in an amount commensurate with the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the infringing material in relation to the book as a whole. <em>Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., </em>309 U.S. 390, 402, 60 S.Ct. 681, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\">.
