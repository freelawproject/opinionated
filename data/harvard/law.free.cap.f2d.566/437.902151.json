The district court granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Since we conclude that the bank violated the disclosure provisions of federal law, we now reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-27\">Mr. Gennuso claims that the disclosure of the terms of a consumer loan by the Commercial Bank and Trust Co. (hereinafter Commercial Bank) was not in accordance with the requirements of the Truth-In-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq., </em>and more particularly was not in compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>with Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z, 12 CFR \u00a7 226.1 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">First, Gennuso charges that Commercial Bank failed to identify properly in the Disclosure Statement and in the Note and Security Agreement \u2014 the key documents used in the credit transaction \u2014 a security interest in the proceeds and the unearned premium in a property insurance policy covering the automobile he purchased, and that such failure transgressed \u00a7\u00a7 226.8(a) and 228.-8(b)(5) of Regulation Z. Second, he maintains that Commercial Bank, in violation of these two sections, did not properly disclose a security interest in after-acquired property, namely, accessions to the automobile that was made available as collateral for the loan. Finally, Gennuso asserts that the inclusion of a reference to a warrant to confess judgment in the Note and Security Agreement, when in fact there was no such warrant, abridged \u00a7 226.6(c) of Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The first claim \u2014 that of improper disclosure of a security interest in an insurance policy \u2014 rests on the fact that the Disclosure Statement contains no mention of such an interest. Item 8 of the Disclosure Statement describes the interest of the Commercial Bank as a \u201cnew 1974 Chev. Monte Carlo.\u201d No description of any other security interest is given in the Disclosure Statement, although printed language under Item 8 refers the reader to \u201c. the instrument evidencing the obligation for full description of property to which the security interest relates. . . . \u201d The Note and Security Agreement describes the collateral for the loan as a 1974 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. There is no reference to any interest in insurance at the top of the Note where the collateral is described. However, paragraph 6 of the debtor\u2019s covenants included in the Note and Security Agreement does create a security interest in an insurance policy covering the automobile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gen-nuso alleges that these provisions, taken together, contravene the rule embraced in \u00a7 226.8(a) that disclosure of the terms of consumer loans be made on one document,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and also violate the principle articulated in \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) that descriptions of security interests be set forth clearly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">Gennuso\u2019s second argument \u2014 that Commercial Bank improperly disclosed its security interest in after-acquired property \u2014 is grounded on the proposition that there is no typewritten description of this security interest in the Disclosure Statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only mention of such an interest in the Note and Security Agreement is in printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>language stating that the collateral includes . . all attachments, accessories and parts used or intended to be used with the above described property (\u2018Collateral\u2019) whether now or hereafter installed therein . .\u201d Gennuso claims that the disclosure of the security interest in after-acquired property infringes upon the \u201cone document\u201d rule of \u00a7 226.8(a) and the \u201cclear identification\u201d principle of \u00a7 226.8(b)(5). And he maintains that the disclosure requirement in \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) dealing with a security interest in after-acquired property is not met here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Gennuso\u2019s final contention \u2014 that when a creditor makes reference to a non-existent warrant to confess judgment, he transgresses \u00a7 226.6(c)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 is premised on the fact that the Note and Security Agreement has a clause, printed in bold-face type, referring to a \u201cforegoing warrant of attorney to con-, fess judgment,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> even though there was no clause providing for a warrant of attorney to confess judgment. Indeed, Commercial Bank admitted that no such warrant existed. As a consequence, plaintiff insists, the inclusion of a reference to such a provision constituted \u201cadditional information\u201d stated in such a manner as \u201cto mislead or confuse the customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Rejecting each of these three arguments, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The purpose of the Truth-In-Lending Act, which was passed by Congress in 1968 to help correct what it perceived as widespread consumer confusion about the nature and cost of credit obligations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is \u201c. . . to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Federal Reserve Board is empowered to construe the Act\u2019s provisions and to prescribe regulations carrying out the legislative purpose.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Regulation Z was promulgated pursuant to that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">In evaluating Gennuso\u2019s claim regarding the alleged failure of Commercial Bank to adhere to the \u201cone document\u201d precept of Regulation Z, the district court rested its rejection of plaintiff\u2019s argument on the fact that the creditor used two separate documents, not a single two-sided document. We cannot accept this contrast as a controlling distinction. The plain terms of \u00a7 226.8(a) establish that disclosures are to be made either on \u201c. . . the note or other instrument evidencing the obligation on the same side of the page and above or adjacent to . . . the customer\u2019s signature\u201d or on \u201c(o)ne side of a separate statement which identifies the transaction.\u201d The references to \u201cthe page\u201d and \u201ca separate statement,\u201d read literally, indicate that the regulation requires the disclosures to be made on one document.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Certainly there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>no suggestion in the language of \u00a7 226.8(a) that the requirement applies to two-sided documents but not documents in a series consisting of two or more items.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the primary aim of the Truth-In-Lending Act of avoiding consumer confusion would not be served by an artificial distinction between disclosures spread over two separate papers and those occurring on the front and the back of one document.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Furthermore, the district court erroneously has assumed that this is a situation in which a clear identification of the type of a security interest \u201c. . . cannot properly be made on the disclosure statement due to the length of such identification . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 226.8(b)(5) of Regulation Z does provide that in a limited class of cases a note or other instrument evidencing the obligation may contain a reference to a separate document describing a security interest. However, the terms of this exception apply only to situations where a full and lucid identification of the property <em>\u201ccannot </em>properly be made on the disclosure statement due to the length of such identification . . . \u201d,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and no such excessive length exists in this situation. Both the security interest in the insurance policy and in the after-acquired property could have been identified by a brief description, as Gennuso has suggested.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the district court erred in concluding that the required length of the disclosure of the security interests would be so extensive that no clear identification of the affected property could be made on the disclosure statement alone.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">In light of the determination that the required disclosures are not excessively lengthy, the reasoning of the district court with respect to the language of sec. 226.-8(b)(5) dealing with after-acquired property interests appears to result from a basic misconception. Section 226.8(b)(5) mandates that a security interest in after-acquired property be revealed \u201c. . . in conjunction with the description or identifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>cation of the type of security interest held, retained or acquired.\u201d The district court declared that \u201c(w)here, as here, the length of the identification of the property is such that a clear identification cannot be made on the disclosure statement alone . . ,\u201d the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement of \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) is met, so long as the security interest is set forth on a separate document and a mention of it is made on the disclosure statement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, since possible descriptions of the security interests in insurance and after-acquired property are not so long that their inclusion on the disclosure form would be impossible, the core premise of the district court\u2019s position is invalid.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Gennuso\u2019s third charge \u2014 that the reference in bold print on the Note and Security Agreement to a non-existent warrant of attorney to confess judgment<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was misleading, in violation of \u00a7 226.6(c)\u2014 presents a somewhat closer question than those dealing with the disclosure of security interests in insurance and after-acquired property. In relation to this third matter, however, we conclude that Gennuso also has identified a violation of Regulation Z. That regulation, like the Truth-In-Lending Act under which it was promulgated, is designed to prevent the confusion of credit consumers, and such confusion may occur where, as here, a clause or covenant is referred to in bold print that is not included in the Disclosure Statement or Note. <em>See Kenney v. Landis Financial Group, </em>349 F.Supp. 939, 950-51 (N.D.Iowa, 1972). <em>Cf. Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>522 F.2d 749, 761 (2d Cir. 1975). The fact, relied upon by the district court, that the confession of judgment clause was not in immediate proximity to the disclosures on the two documents is not determinative.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This would appear to be particularly so since the pertinent disclosures of security interests in insurance and after-acquired property violated the provisions of Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The present case admittedly does not involve egregious misconduct on the part of Commercial Bank. Yet under the terms of the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, this Court is constrained to hold as it does in order to vindicate the intent of the Congress and the framers of Regulation Z. Any misgivings about the technical nature of the requirements under the Act or Regulation should be addressed to Congress and the Federal Reserve Board, not to this Court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. At a pretrial conference before Judge McCune, both parties agreed that there was no need for a trial in the case, for the factual basis was not in dispute. The parties concurred at the conference that the court\u2019s scrutiny should be confined essentially to the two documents which were appended to plaintiffs complaint: (1) the Disclosure Statement, and (2) the Note and Security Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">. Paragraph 6 requires Gennuso, in the district court\u2019s language, \u201c. . . (1) to insure the collateral; (2) to cause the insurance policy to contain loss payable clauses in favor of Commercial and plaintiff as their interests may appear; (3) to deposit the policy with Commercial; (4) to assign any return of unearned premiums due upon cancellation of the policy to Commercial; and (5) to appoint Commercial plaintiff\u2019s attorney-in-fact.\u201d Opinion at p. 6. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that these covenants create a security interest in the proceeds and unearned premiums of the insurance policy covering the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-15\">. Section 226.8(a) enunciates the rule that \u201c(a)ll of the disclosures shall be made together on either (1) (t)he note or other instrument evidencing the obligation on the same side of the page and above or adjacent to the place for the customer\u2019s signature; or (2) (o)n one side of a separate statement which identifies the transaction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\">. Section 226.8(b)(5) requires that there be disclosed \u201c(a) description or identification of the type of any security interest held or to be retained or acquired by the creditor in connection with the extension of credit, and a clear identification of the property to which the security interest relates . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-18\">. The sole reference to a security interest in after-acquired property in the Disclosure Statement occurs in a printed statement in Item 8, directing the reader to \u201crefer to the instrument evidencing the obligation for full description of property to which the security interest relates and after acquired property to which the security interest may attach.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. \u201cIf after-acquired property will be subject to the security interest, or if other or future indebtedness is or may be secured by any such property, this fact shall be clearly set forth in conjunction with the description or identification of the type of security interest held, retained or acquired.\u201d \u00a7 226.8(b)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. This provision deals with \u201cadditional information,\u201d and states: \u201cAt the creditor\u2019s option, additional information or explanations may be supplied with any disclosure required by this part, but none shall be stated, utilized or placed so as to mislead or confuse the customer</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">.

See <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 363-69, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b527-21\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b527-22\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b527-23\">. See <em>Lauletta v. Valley Buick, Inc., </em>421 F.Supp. 1036, 1040 (W.D.Pa.1976) (\u201cRegulation Z unequivocally requires that necessary disclosures shall be written and made together on one document.\u201d); <em>Douglas v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Anchorage, </em>334 F.Supp. 1166, 1174-75 (D.Alaska 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">. The requirement that disclosures appear on one side of one document has been clearly enunciated by the Federal Reserve Board in its staff opinion letters. <em>See e. g., </em>public position letters, No. 25 (7/2/69); No. 130 (10/7/69); No. 150 (10/14/69), cited by appellant in the appendix to his brief. And the courts now feel that the staffs opinion letters are entitled to great weight. <em>See Johnson v. McCracken-Stur-man Ford, Inc., </em>527 F.2d 257, 267 n.23 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Philbeck v. Timmers Chevrolet, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 971, 977 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. In addition to his argument based on section 226.8(a), Gennuso maintains that the disclosures in this case violate \u00a7 226.6(a), which requires that disclosures be made \u201cclearly, conspicuously, in meaningful sequence. . . <em>.\u201d See Allen v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Gary, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 797, 801 (7th Cir. 1976). Gennu-so makes it clear in his brief that the lack of \u201cmeaningful sequence\u201d of which he complains is evident in the Note and Security Agreement, which at the outset describes the collateral for the loan as the new automobile, and then in numbered paragraph 6, located more than halfway down the page, sets out the covenants giving rise to a security interest in the proceeds and unearned premium of the insurance policy. Given our view of the dictates of \u00a7 226.8(a), we need not reach this issue. Even if the disclosures in the Note and Security Agreement were said to occur in the requisite \u201cmeaningful sequence,\u201d the fact that all disclosures are not made on the same side of a single document by itself renders the manner of their disclosure violative of Regulation Z.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b528-16\">. <em>See </em>425 F.Supp. at p. 468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b528-17\">. Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b528-18\">. \u201cClear identification\u201d of the property subject to a security interest requires only that \u201c. . . the goods ... be identified so as to preclude any reasonable question regarding the goods to which the security interest attaches.\u201d <em>Kenney v. Landis Financial Group, Inc., </em>349 F.Supp. 939, 945 (N.D.Iowa 1972). As Gennuso points out, the insurance security interest could have been identified clearly by a phrase such as \u201cthis loan is secured by any insurance required or purchased\u201d; similarly, it could have been said that the loan is secured by any after-acquired accessions to the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b528-21\">. If the district court may be said to have found as a matter of fact that the length of the required description of the security interest was too great to permit clear identification on the Disclosure Statement, then appellant has met his burden of persuading this reviewing court that such finding was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a), F.R.C.P. See <em>J. A. Jones Construction Co. v. Englert Engineering Co., </em>438 F.2d 3, 5 (6th Cir. 1971) (burden on appellant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">. <em>See </em>425 F.Supp. at 470-471.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. We are not concerned in this case with a situation, such as that in which a security interest exists in an extended list of household goods, where the length of a full description of the security interest would make a single-page identification impracticable. Thus, we do not express a view on Regulation Z\u2019s requirements in such a context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">. Confessions of judgment, \u201c. . . which have the effect of depriving the debtor of both the right to be notified of a pending action and the right to enter a defense in a judicial proceeding before judgment,\u201d are security interests under the Act. <em>Douglas v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Anchorage, </em>334 F.Supp, 1166, 1171 (D.Alaska 1971). See <em>also Charnita, Inc. v. F. T.

Section 226.6(c) says that disclosures shall not be \u201cstated, utilized, or placed so as to mislead or confuse\u201d the consumer.

Regulation Z unequivocally requires that necessary disclosures shall be written and made together on one document. The drafters of the legislation obviously felt that oral statements by creditors or piecemeal disclosures are. not adequate to ensure the consumer\u2019s protection. Regardless of the wisdom or validity of that proposition, it is not this Court\u2019s prerogative to substitute its own view for that of Congress.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
