Stewart in the Southern District of New York and was sentenced to six months in prison. Specifically, Morales refused to obey court orders directing him to answer questions before a grand jury investigating possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>violations of federal gambling laws. On appeal, he argues (1) that the grand jury before which he refused to testify lacked the power to initiate a prosecution against him without having had the matter referred to it by a district judge; (2) that he was denied an adequate opportunity to contest the legality of electronic surveillance that he alleges was the source of the questions he refused to answer; (3) that his sentence for criminal contempt, imposed after he had already been committed civilly to coerce compliance with the orders to testify, constituted double jeopardy or a denial of due process; and (4) that certain supposed errors committed by his lawyer deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Morales was subpoenaed in early 1977 to testify before a grand jury investigating possible violations of federal statutes prohibiting syndicated gambling. On March 24, Judge Wyatt granted him \u201cuse immunity,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, and ordered him to \u201cgive testimony which he refused to give on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Morales appeared before the grand jury and listened to an explanation of the implications of Judge Wyatt\u2019s order, but he declined to testify, this time on the ground that the Government had engaged in allegedly unlawful electronic surveillance of him. Pursuant to the procedure we outlined in <em>In re Persico, </em>491 F.2d 1156 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 924, 95 S.Ct. 199, 42 L.Ed.2d 158 (1974), the Government submitted to Judge Lasker for his consideration <em>in camera </em>an order by Judge Motley authorizing certain electronic surveillance and supporting affidavits. On April 22, Judge Lasker ruled that this material established the facial validity of the wiretap of which Morales complained and ordered him to testify, warning him at that time that he would be held in contempt if he continued to refuse. No appeal was taken from Judge Lasker\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On April 28, Morales was again brought before the grand jury. The orders of Judges Wyatt and Lasker were called to his attention, and he stated that he understood the obligations those orders created and the availability of sanctions for contempt. Nevertheless, he continued to refuse to testify, repeatedly asserting his privilege against self-incrimination. In a civil contempt proceeding directed by Judge MacM-ahon later that afternoon, Morales listened to yet another explanation of his duty to answer and admitted that his refusal to do so was intentional and knowing. Judge MacMahon thereupon found Morales to be in contempt of court and ordered him committed until he agreed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The commitment resulting from Judge MacMahon\u2019s civil contempt proceeding was short-lived; Morales was released by order of Judge Knapp after only a few days. On May 3, he was indicted by that grand jury for criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Morales\u2019 jury trial, held on July 11 and 12, was a simple one; the Government read into the record transcripts of Morales\u2019 refusal to testify on April 28 and of his admission to Judge MacMahon that the refusal was willful and then rested. No defense witnesses were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\n<em>Grand Jury\u2019s Power to Indict for Criminal Contempt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Morales\u2019 contention that criminal contempt may not be prosecuted by indictment unless a judge first refers the matter of the alleged act of contempt to the grand jury lacks merit. Many cases have tacitly or explicitly recognized the power of grand juries to hand down indictments charging criminal contempt. E. g., <em>United States v. DeSimone, </em>267 F.2d 741, 743-44 (2d Cir.), <em>vacated as moot, </em>361 U.S. 125, 80 S.Ct. 74, 4 L.Ed.2d 70 (1959) (grand jury presentment); <em>Steinert v. United States District Court, </em>543 F.2d 69, 70-71 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Mensik, </em>440 F.2d 1232 (4th Cir. 1971) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Sternman, </em>415 F.2d 1165 (6th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 907, 90 S.Ct. 903, 25 L.Ed.2d 88 (1970); <em>United States v. Eichhorst, </em>544 F.2d 1383 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Bukowski, </em>435 F.2d 1094, 1103 (7th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 874, 27 L.Ed.2d 809 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Reversal would not therefore be warranted unless Morales could demonstrate that his indictment prejudiced him\u2014 for example, by failing to accord him the notice or other rights provided by Rule 42, F.R.Crim.P.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see <em>DeSimone, supra, </em>267 F.2d at 743-44; <em>Mensik, supra, </em>440 F.2d at 1234. Here no such showing has been made. Morales does not claim that the indictment deprived him of notice or any of the other rights provided by Rule 42(b). The record and the jury\u2019s verdict belie his suggestion that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek an indictment was vindictive or arbitrary. Nor can he complain of the fact that he was indicted by the grand jury that witnessed his refusals to testify. We have recently reaffirmed the constitutionality of this practice, <em>Langella v. Commissioner of Corrections, </em>545 F.2d 818, 822-23 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1679, 52 L.Ed.2d 377 (1977), recognizing that a grand jury that has observed a witness\u2019 demeanor on the stand is in \u201ca superior position\" to determine whether his non-immunized testimony should subject him to criminal liability. <em>United States v. Camporeale, </em>515 F.2d 184, 189 (2d Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, absent a showing of specific prejudice, we cannot presume that the grand jury here, an institution designed for the protection of an accused against official oppression, <em>Ex parte Bain, </em>121 U.S. 1, 11, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>L.Ed. 849 (1887); <em>Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 16, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955); <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 1, 9, 79 S.Ct. 991, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959); <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), deprived Morales of any substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Morales also argues that to allow a grand jury to initiate prosecutions for criminal contempt <em>sua sponte </em>would interfere with the courts\u2019 exercise of their power to secure compliance with their orders and to vindicate their authority generally. See <em>United States v. Leyva, </em>513 F.2d 774, 778-79 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>In re Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen, </em>402 F.Supp. 725, 736 (E.D.Wis.1975). Under the circumstances of this case, we disagree. The court below retained the exclusive power, which was exercised without success before the indictment was filed, to coerce the recalcitrant witness to testify, and the indictment in no way limited Judge Stewart\u2019s authority to sentence Morales as he saw fit. Having defied the court, Morales is hardly in a position to assert its interest in vindicating its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>Refusal to Furnish Grand Jury Witness With Documents Pertaining to Court-Authorized Electronic Surveillance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The substance of Morales\u2019 wiretapping claim is that Judge Stewart erred in refusing to require disclosure of the court order authorizing electronic surveillance of him and supporting affidavits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Morales concedes, as he must, that Judge Lasker\u2019s <em>in camera </em>examination of these documents and resulting determination that the Government\u2019s wiretap was facially valid were a sufficient basis for finding him in civil contempt and committing him until he might agree to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>In re Persico, supra; In re Millow, </em>529 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1976). Nevertheless, Morales contends that he became entitled to a more comprehensive inquiry into the legality of the Government\u2019s electronic surveillance when he was charged with criminal contempt, since, he argues, the danger that a full-blown suppression hearing would delay the grand jury\u2019s investigation, admittedly an important factor in our <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>decision, no longer existed by that time. While Morales\u2019 interpretation of <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>has superficial appeal, we think that it rests on an overly narrow view of the considerations we found compelling there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">In <em>Persico, </em>we resolved an apparent conflict in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510, <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>between \u00a7 2515 and \u00a7 2518(10)(a). Section 2515 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anb-dedup-0\">\u201cWhenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any proceeding in or before any . . . grand jury . if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aku-dedup-0\">In <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972), the Supreme Court made this section available as a defense to contempt charges based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>refusal to answer questions derived from illegal wiretapping before a grand jury. Because of the procedural posture of that case, however, the Court could assume for the purposes of its decision that the Government\u2019s wiretap failed on its face to comply with the requirements of Title III. 408 U.S. at 46-47, 92 S.Ct. 2357.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>P\u00e9rsico, </em>by contrast, a grand jury witness persisted in his refusal to testify even after an <em>in camera </em>examination of a court order had established the facial validity of a contested wiretap. Consequently, we had to determine the extent to which Congress had intended to limit the effect of \u00a7 2515 by restricting the class of persons who could move to suppress the fruits of illegal wiretaps, see \u00a7 2518(10)(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We held that grand jury witnesses did not have the right to move for suppression hearings, either before the grand jury or in associated civil contempt proceedings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cWe hold that in contempt proceedings initiated when a witness who has been granted \u2018derivative use\u2019 immunity refuses to answer questions propounded by a grand jury because he claims he is entitled to a hearing to ascertain whether the questions posed are the product of unlawful electronic surveillance the witness is not entitled to a plenary suppression hearing to test the legality of that surveillance. We hold that the refusal would be permissible only if there is an absence of a necessary court order or if there is a concession from the Government that the surveillance was not in conformity with statutory requirements or if there is a <em>prior </em>judicial adjudication that the surveillance was unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 491 F.2d at 1162.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">Morales argues that a different rule should apply in criminal contempt proceedings instituted after the grand jury\u2019s term has expired, since there is no longer any need to facilitate the smooth functioning of the grand jury\u2019s investigation by avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>delays attributable to suppression proceedings. We disagree. In <em>P\u00e9rsico, </em>we also grounded our decision heavily on the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 2515 and 2518(10)(a), particularly the Senate Report, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201cParagraph (10)(a) provides that any aggrieved persons, as defined in section 2510(11), discussed above, in any trial hearing or other proceeding in or before any court department, officer, agency, regulating body or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State may make a motion to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom. This provision must be read in connection with sections 2515 and 2517, discussed below, which it limits. It provides the remedy for the right created by section 2515. <em>Because no person is a party as such to a grand jury proceeding, the provision does not envision the making of a motion to suppress in the context of such a proceeding itself. </em>Normally, there is no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury, which is enforcible by an individual. <em>([United States v.] Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, [16 L.Ed.2d 510] (1965).) There is no intent to change this general rule. <em>It is the intent of the provision only that when a motion to suppress is granted in another context, its scope may include use in a future grand jury proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., printed in 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In our discussion of this report, we made it clear that a civil contempt proceeding is not a proceeding \u201cin another context\u201d in which a motion to suppress can be made by a recalcitrant witness, even though such a person might at first blush appear to be \u201can aggrieved person\u201d to whom \u00a7 2518(10)(a) gives that right. We pointed out that the civil contempt \u201cmechanism is so intimately connected with the grand jury proceedings in which the testimony is desired as to be really a part of those proceedings,\u201d and that the Senate envisaged only that successful motions to suppress made in \u201canother context\u201d would bar the use of the fruits of an illegal wiretap in future grand jury proceedings. 491 F.2d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The same can be said of the criminal contempt \u201cmechanism.\u201d First, criminal contempt prosecutions are \u201cintimately connected\u201d with grand jury proceedings, since the prospect of criminal sanctions could well induce a recalcitrant witness to cooperate with the grand jury during its existence, particularly if its term was about to expire at the time of the witness\u2019 initial refusal to answer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> During that crucial period the court should be in a position to point out to the witness that a refusal to answer would be contemptuous for both civil and criminal purposes. Thus, although the interpretation of \u00a7 2515 and \u00a7 2518(10)(a) urged by Morales would not necessarily interrupt grand jury investigations, it might well hamper a grand jury\u2019s smooth performance of its duties. Second, we think that Congress\u2019 statement that its intent was only to provide a means of barring the use of evidence in \u201cfuture\u201d grand jury proceedings disposes of Morales\u2019 claim that he is entitled to a suppression hearing to legitimate his refusal to answer in past grand jury proceedings. For these reasons we hardly think that Congress intended \u00a7\u00a7 2515 and 2518(10)(a) to be interpreted in a fashion that would permit a single refusal to obey a court order to be treated as contempt in a civil proceeding but not in a subsequent criminal proceeding. Accordingly we conclude that Morales was entitled to no more extended procedure than that which he received \u2014 Judge Lasker\u2019s <em>in camera </em>examination of the relevant documents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\n<em>Miscellaneous Other Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Morales\u2019 remaining contentions may be quickly dispatched. That he was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>in contempt in both a civil proceeding before Judge MacMahon and a criminal proceeding before Judge Stewart, and was confined by both judges for the same acts of contempt, gives rise to no double jeopardy or due process claim. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Yates v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 66, 74-75, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201cThe civil and criminal sentences served distinct purposes, the one coercive, the other punitive and deterrent; that the same act may give rise to these distinct sanctions presents no double jeopardy problem. <em>Rex Trailer Co. </em>v. <em>United States, 350 </em>U.S. 148, 150, [76 S.Ct. 219, 100 L.Ed. 149] (1956); <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 299, [67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884] (1947) . .. Indeed, the more salutary procedure would appear to be that a court should first apply coercive remedies in an effort to persuade a party to obey its orders, and only make use of the more drastic criminal sanctions when the disobedience continues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">See <em>United States v. Marra, </em>482 F.2d 1196, 1202 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Aberbach, </em>165 F.2d 713, 714 (2d Cir. 1948). The Court has since reiterated its statement in <em>Yates </em>to the effect that a judge should always determine first the feasibility of coercing testimony through the imposition of civil contempt sanctions before resorting to criminal sanctions. <em>Shillitani v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 371 n. 9, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966). Thus, the procedure followed in this case was not only not erroneous, it was \u201csalutary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Morales\u2019 argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel stems from the introduction into evidence of the transcript of his admission to Judge MacMahon that his refusal to testify before the grand jury was willful. Morales\u2019 appellate counsel now contends that his trial attorney should have advised him not to make the admission in the first place and should in any event have objected to the use of the transcript at trial. Neither supposed \u201cerror\u201d was such as to \u201cshock the conscience of the Court and make the proceedings a farce and mockery of justice,\u201d <em>United States v. Wight, </em>176 F.2d 376, 379 (2d Cir. 1949), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 950, 70 S.Ct. 478, 94 L.Ed. 586 (1950), or to violate any other more stringent standard that we have considered adopting, <em>Rickenbacker v. Warden, </em>550 F.2d 62, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>petition for cert. </em>filed,- U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 103, 54 L.Ed.2d 85 (1977). Morales\u2019 trial lawyer\u2019s apparent decision that his client\u2019s interests would best be served by a frank colloquy with Judge MacMahon, viewed in light of a massive amount of other evidence of Morales\u2019 willfulness, was certainly not unreasonable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Once Morales had effectively waived his Fifth Amendment privilege before Judge MacMahon, of course, there existed no valid grounds for objecting to the admission into evidence of the transcript. See F.R.Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(2) (admissions against interest not hearsay). It was hardly evidence of incompetence for Morales\u2019 lawyer to have failed to object to admissible evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">. Morales\u2019 reliance on <em>In re Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen, </em>402 F.Supp. 725 (E.D.Wis.1975), which held that a grand jury-lacks inherent power to initiate a prosecution for criminal contempt, is misplaced. In that case, a labor dispute led to charges that members of the union were violating a preliminary injunction. A district court judge referred the matter to a grand jury, which issued a subpoena covering a broad range of union documents. The custodian of the documents moved to quash the subpoena, claiming that it called for production of privileged and irrelevant material. The district court\u2019s statement that the grand jury lacked inherent power to conduct its investigation without direction from a judge was obviously much broader than necessary to dispose of the case. Notably, <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters </em>did not reverse a conviction for criminal contempt. Finally, the case has since been criticized in <em>Steinert, supra, </em>543 F.2d at 71 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. Rule 42(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201c(b) Disposition upon Notice and Hearing. A criminal <em>contempt </em>except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule shall be prosecuted on notice. The notice shall state the time and place of hearing, allowing a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense, and shall state the essential facts constituting the criminal contempt charged and describe it as such. The notice shall be given orally by the judge in open court in the presence of the defendant or, on application of the United States attorney or of an attorney appointed by the court for that purpose, by an order to show cause or an order of arrest. The defendant is entitled to a trial by jury in any case in which an act of Congress so provides. He is entitled to admission to bail as provided in these rules. If the contempt charged involves disrespect to or criticism of a judge, that judge is disqualified from presiding at the trial or hearing except with the defendant\u2019s consent. Upon a verdict or finding of guilt the court shall enter an order fixing the punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The notice requirement safeguards the accused contemnor\u2019s right to due process, in light of the fact that criminal contempt was not traditionally thought to be an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d activating an accused\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to trial upon an indictment, e. g., <em>Green v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 165, 183-87, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958); <em>DeSimone, supra, </em>267 F.2d at 743-44. In <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968), however, the Supreme Court held that a defendant accused of criminal contempt does have a right to a jury trial. There has been some debate as to whether <em>Bloom </em>implicitly gives those in Morales\u2019 position a <em>right </em>to an indictment. Compare 8B Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 42.02(1), at 42-5 to 42-7 (Rev. ed. 1977), with <em>Bukowski, supra, </em>435 F.2d 1099-1102. Whether or not it does, Rule 42(b) does not purport to exclude the possibility of proceeding against con-temnors by indictment. It simply provides an alternative method of instituting criminal contempt proceedings, similar to that provided by statutory authorization to proceed by information rather than indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\">. Morales\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Hinton, </em>543 F.2d 1002 (2d Cir. 1976), is misplaced. In <em>Hinton, </em>a grand jury indicted the defendant of crimes related to matters about which she had testified under a grant of immunity. Here, the grand jury heard no testimony that was immunized and therefore did not face the task of ignoring such testimony while it decided whether to issue an indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>. </em>While his argument is not entirely clear, Morales appears to contend that he would also be entitled to a plenary suppression hearing in the event that he desired to go beneath the order and affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. Of course, Morales\u2019 failure to appeal Judge Lasker\u2019s order foreclosed a new challenge to the facial validity of the Government\u2019s wiretap in this criminal contempt proceeding. <em>Walker v. City of Birmingham, </em>388 U.S. 307, 314-15, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\">. We have already refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus to a recalcitrant witness who claimed that his state conviction for criminal contempt was invalid because he was not given the protection afforded by the <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>procedure. <em>Langella v. Commissioner of Corrections, </em>545 F.2d 818, 821-22 (2d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1679, 52 L.Ed.2d 377 (1977). However, it appears that this is the first time we have had occasion to confront a request for a more comprehensive inquiry than that mandated by <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>in a criminal setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-14\">.
