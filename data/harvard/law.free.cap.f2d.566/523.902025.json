Aguacate originally filed suit in Georgia state court; Deeprock removed to the federal district court for the Northern District of Georgia and moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. \u25a0 The court dismissed the action because the minimum contacts requirement of the Georgia long-arm statute had not been met. Upon motion by Aguacate, the court vacated the order of dismissal and transferred the case to the Middle District of Alabama. Although both venue and personal jurisdiction were proper in the Middle District of Alabama, that court dismissed, holding that the Georgia federal court could not transfer a case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) without first acquiring personal jurisdiction. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Aguacate sought removal to Alabama from Georgia on the authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, </em>369 U.S. 463, 82 S.Ct. 913, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962), the Supreme Court approved transfer under \u00a7 1406(a) even if both proper venue and personal jurisdiction were lacking. Finding that Congress enacted \u00a7 1406(a) to remove obstacles that impede expeditious and orderly adjudication, the Court refused to limit transfers that comported with \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d by imposing the nonstatutorily required barrier of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Deeprock argues, however, that venue was proper in the Northern District of Georgia and, thus, transfer was not appropriate under \u00a7 1406(a), which addresses improper venue. In <em>Dubin v. U. S., </em>380 F.2d 813 (CA5, 1967), this circuit interpreted \u00a7 1406 to permit transfer of cases having proper venue but lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">Looking to the language of \u00a7 1406, the statute is couched in terms of \u201claying venue in the wrong division or district.\u201d The statute does not refer to \u201cwrong\u201d venue, but rather to venue laid in a \u201cwrong division or district.\u201d We conclude that a district is \u201cwrong\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1406 whenever there exists an \u201cobstacle [to] * * * an expeditious and orderly adjudication\u201d on the merits. Inability to perfect service of process on a defendant in an otherwise correct venue is such an obstacle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">380 F.2d at 815. Thus, under Dubin, this case was properly transferred to Alabama under \u00a7 1406(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">Moreover, even without the <em>Dubin </em>interpretation of \u00a7 1406(a), this case could properly have been transferred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Koehring Co. v. Hyde Construction Co., </em>324 F.2d 295, (CA5, 1963), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>382 U.S. 362, 86 S.Ct. 522, 15 L.Ed.2d 416 (1966), we construed the discretionary transfer language of \u00a7 1404(a) to permit transfer for the convenience of the parties and in the interest of justice of cases with proper venue even if no personal jurisdiction existed in the transferring court. Here, as in <em>Goldlawr, </em>several considerations make clear that transfer of this case would advance the interest of justice and the procedural simplification underlying \u00a7\u00a7 1406(a) and 1404(a). Discovery has already occurred and several years have elapsed. Moreover, part of Aguacate\u2019s case may now be barred by the statute of limitations. By filing the case in Georgia, Agua-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>cate demonstrated \u201cproper diligence\u201d and a \u201cdesire ... to begin [its] case.\u201d <em>Goldlawr, </em>369 U.S. at 467, 82 S.Ct. at 916, 8 L.Ed.2d at 42. The appellant should not be penalized for making an erroneous guess about the Georgia long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The fact that this case was originally removed from a Georgia state court without personal jurisdiction does not change the analysis above. Although the jurisdiction of a federal court after removal is, in a limited sense, derivative, removed actions become subject to federal rather than state rules of procedure. Because the federal rules permit transfer, we hold that removed cases meeting the federal standards of \u00a7\u00a7 1406(a) or 1404(a) may also be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. Section 1406(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201cThe district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-14\">.
