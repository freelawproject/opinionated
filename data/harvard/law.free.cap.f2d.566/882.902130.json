Burnsed, a policeman assigned to the vice squad of the police department of the county of Charleston, South Carolina, appeals his conviction for participation in an enterprise affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An essential element of racketeering activity, defined in \u00a7 1961(1)(A), is proof that Burnsed violated a state law involving bribery punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his principal assignment of error Burnsed contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had violated such a state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The evidence disclosed that Burnsed, along with other members of the vice squad, accepted money and the services of prostitutes in return for protecting illegally operated clubs and gambling establishments. The government contends that Burnsed violated \u00a7 16-212 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, which punishes by imprisonment for not more than ten years any executive, legislative, or judicial officer who corruptly accepts a gratuity with the understanding that his opinion or judgment shall be given in a particular manner in any proceeding brought before him in his official capacity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">Burnsed denies that he is an executive officer within the meaning of \u00a7 16-212.. He argues that his conduct violated only \u00a7 16-214 of the Code, which imposes a fine of not more than $300 on sheriffs and other officers who accept a bribe for delaying or failing to arrest a person or to perform the duties of their offices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on that premise, Burnsed asserts that he is not guilty of the federal crime for which he was indicted because \u00a7 16-214 does not impose punishment of more than one year's imprisonment as required by the federal definition of \u201cracketeering activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">The district judge, rejecting Burnsed\u2019s argument, ruled that Burnsed violated \u00a7 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>212. He reasoned that since this statute embraces all three branches of government, it necessarily includes a police officer who, as part of the executive branch, corruptly accepts a bribe to influence his judgment about the manner in which he deals with persons known by him to be violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We believe that the district judge\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 16-212 and 16-214 is correct. One obvious difference between the statutes is that, in order to prove violation of \u00a7 16-212, it is necessary to show that the officer acted \u201ccorruptly.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Meehan, </em>160 S.C. 111, 115, 158 S.E. 151, 154 (1930). In contrast, this require ment is omitted in \u00a7 16-214. This difference in the statutes and the variation in the punishments they impose indicate that the legislature recognized different degrees of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In the absence of a definitive interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 16-212 and 16-214 by the South Carolina Supreme Court, we defer to the conclusion reached by the district judge, whose service as a state and federal judge has made him familiar with the law of South Carolina. <em>See Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., </em>350 U.S. 198, 204, 76 S.Ct. 273, 100 L.Ed. 199 (1956); <em>Williams v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>378 F.2d 7, 8 (4th Cir. 1967). His construction of the statutory language \u201cexecutive . . . officer\u201d as embracing a policeman is confirmed by dictum in <em>State v. Cole, </em>107 S.C. 285, 287, 92 S.E. 624 (1917), where the court quotes approvingly from <em>Corpus Juris:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">\u201cIn any event the modern definition of bribery, whether statutory or otherwise, commonly includes as the subject of it all persons whose official conduct is in any way connected with the administration of the government, general or local, whether judicial, legislative, executive, or ministerial, and persons who execute the functions of a public office or who hold any place of profit or trust under any law of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The district judge instructed the jury about all of the elements, including the meaning of \u201ccorruptly,\u201d essential to prove the crime of bribery as defined by \u00a7 16-212. The evidence was sufficient to show that Burnsed violated this statute. Since \u00a7 16-212 imposes imprisonment of more than one year, we conclude that the government\u2019s proof satisfied the definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Burnsed also complains about the denial of his motion for a severance. We find no abuse of discretion in this ruling of the trial court. <em>Cf. Opper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 95, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-11\">It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-13\">As used in this chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-14\">(1) \u201cracketeering activity\u201d means (A) any act . . . involving . . . bribery, . . . which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"aum-dedup-0\">.
