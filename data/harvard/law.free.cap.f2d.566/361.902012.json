Foley, <em>Chief Judge. </em>Appellant was charged in a one-count indictment with willfully subscribing, under penalty of perjury, a statement of financial information in connection with an Internal Revenue Service settlement, know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ing the statement to be false in two material respects: (1) as to the income report and (2) as to whether appellant had disposed of an asset worth $500 or more for less than full value between the beginning of the taxable period in dispute and the date of the statement. Objection was made at trial and is made on appeal that evidence as to one of the two alleged falsifications \u2014 disposition of an asset \u2014 was insufficient, since the asset in question, a stock certificate, was never delivered and hence not transferred under N.Y.U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8-309, -313 (McKinney 1964). <em>See Wolder </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>493 F.2d 608, 613 &amp; n.5 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 828, 95 S.Ct. 49, 42 L.Ed.2d 53 (1974). No objection has been made here or below, however, to the court\u2019s charge to the jury that it could convict if it found that defendant had falsified the financial statement in either one of the two ways charged in the indictment. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">An indictment is invalidly duplicitous when it joins in a single count two or more distinct, separate offenses. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>310 F.2d 79, 80 n.1 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>United States v. Starks, </em>515 F.2d 112, 116 (3d Cir. 1975). But Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1) permits allegation in a single count that an offense has been committed in a multiplicity of ways; such a count is not duplicitous. <em>See </em>1 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 142, at 307-10 (1969). It has been held, for example, that an indictment charging both \u201caccepting\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d wagers in one count is not improper. <em>United States v. Conti, </em>361 F.2d 153, 157-58 (2d Cir. 1966), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>390 U.S. 204, 88 S.Ct. 899, 19 L.Ed.2d 1035 (1968); <em>Driscoll v. United States, </em>356 F.2d 324, 331-32 (1st Cir. 1966), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>390 U.S. 202, 88 S.Ct. 899, 19 L.Ed.2d 1034 (1968). Thus, had this indictment charged alternatively that appellant had violated the law either by falsely saying he had not disposed of the asset or by falsely omitting to mention that he retained the asset, it clearly would not have been duplicitous. <em>See United States v. Conti, supra, </em>361 F.2d at 158 (\u201c[c]harging alternative ways of violating- a statute in the conjunctive is permissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The alternative falsifications charged here, however, required entirely different proof as to the two matters alleged, even though the crime as to both was willfully making \u201cany return, statement, or other document\u201d that the maker does not believe to be correct \u201cas to every material matter.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). But because no objection or request to elect was made we need not decide whether the indictment was duplicitous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An objection to duplicity is waived if not raised before trial or, at the least, before verdict. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Galgano, </em>281 F.2d 908, 911 (2d Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 U.S. 960, 81 S.Ct. 1916, 6 L.Ed.2d 1253 (1961); <em>United States v. Costner, </em>359 F.2d 969, 974 (6th Cir. 1966); 1 C. Wright, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 145, at 335-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Nor need we decide whether the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury on the asset-disposal question. \u201cThe general rule is that when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, as [appellant\u2019s] indictment did, the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\u201d <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 654, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970); <em>see United States v. Conti, supra, </em>361 F.2d at 158. Here it is undisputed that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the charge that appellant understated his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">. Duplicity, of course, is only a pleading rule and would in no event be fatal to the count. <em>Reno v. United States, </em>317 F.2d 499, 502 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 828, 84 S.Ct. 72, 11 L.Ed.2d 60 (1963); 1 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 142, at 311 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b449-11\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">I concur in the judgment of affirmance on the ground that, when a jury returns a general verdict of guilty on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>with respect to any of the acts charged, as it was here with respect to the charge that Droms had understated his income. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420 (1970); <em>United States v. Conti, </em>361 F.2d 153, 158 (2 Cir. 1966) (Moore, J.), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>390 U.S. 204 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Since in my view no more is needed to justify affirmance of the judgment of conviction, I respectfully dissent from the balance of the opinion which, being largely dictum, is without precedential force.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
