First, does the taint from illegal wiretaps extend to the evidence provided by the testimony of codefendants who, without standing to object to the wiretaps, were convicted as a result thereof and then testified under a grant of use immunity against defendants who did have standing? Second, does the Double Jeopardy Clause of the fifth amendment bar the retrial of defendants whose convictions were reversed because the evidence used to convict them resulted from illegal wiretaps?</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">On October 17, 1974, a jury convicted defendants Martin W. Houltin and Kenneth B. Phillips and codefendants Robert Burke, Duane Morrison, Michael Francis, and Kenneth J. Croucher on two counts of conspiring to import and possess 2,260 pounds of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 960(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The trial judge sentenced each to consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment on each count and imposed varying fines. Defendants and codefendants appealed to this Court, which reversed the convictions of defendants Houltin and Phillips because the police, both federal and state, violated the fourth amendment using illegal wiretaps during the investiga-' tion phase of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We sustained the convictions of the four codefendants, however, because they lacked standing under the fourth amendment to challenge the illegal wiretaps. <em>See United States v. Houltin, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 525 F.2d 943, <em>vacated in part sub nom., Croucher v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 1034, 97 S.Ct. 725, 50 L.Ed.2d 745, <em>modified, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 553 F.2d 991.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">On remand, Houltin and Phillips waived a jury trial. The Government obtained an order from the district court granting use immunity to convicted codefendants Burke, Morrison, Francis, and Croucher. These co-defendants did not actually take the witness stand, however, although they were present in the courtroom. Instead, by stipulation in the record and as a matter of convenience, it was agreed that if they formally testified, their testimony would be the same as that of the D.E.A. agents who had testified at the first trial, but who could not now testify because their knowledge resulted from the illegal wiretaps. Counsel for the Government and defendants also by agreement offered some additional testimony. The district court found Houltin and Phillips guilty and sentenced each to a ten-year term of imprisonment, a special parole term of five years, and a fine. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">\n<em>I. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">Houltin and Phillips argue that the trial court erred in allowing the Government to use the testimony of the four codefendants who testified under a grant of use immunity. The evidence provided by such testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>ny, according to defendants, is \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d <em>see Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), because the Government first learned of the substance of codefend-ants\u2019 testimony as well as obtained their arrests and convictions from evidence discovered through the same illegal wiretaps that could not lawfully be used against Houltin and Phillips in the first trial. Defendants contend, in effect, that by forcing the codefendants to testify through a grant of use immunity the Government is able to circumvent the exclusionary rule and use indirectly against defendants evidence that could not be used against them directly. The Government, on the other hand, argues that the illegal wiretaps did not taint the evidence provided by the codefendants under the order compelling them to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The fourth amendment exclusionary rule was born as a matter of federal law in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914), and extended to state criminal trials in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Its purpose is not to redress the injury to the search and seizure victim\u2019s privacy; reparation comes too late for that. <em>See Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 637, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1742, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). Rather, \u201cthe rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 347, 94 S.Ct. at 619-20. <em>See </em>Pitler, <em>\u201cThe Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\u201d Revisited and Shepardized, </em>56 Calif. L.Rev. 579, 646 (1968). As Justice Stewart pointed out in <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai4-dedup-0\">The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\"><em>Accord, Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Under the exclusionary rule, evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment cannot be used in a criminal trial against the victim of the illegal search and seizure. The Constitution does not require this remedy; it is a doctrine of judicial design. Excluded evidence oftentimes is quite reliable and the \u201cmost probative information bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d <em>Stone v. Powell, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 490, 96 S.Ct. at 3050. Nonetheless, the rule\u2019s prohibition applies to such direct evidence as well as to \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d \u2014 secondary evidence derived from the illegally seized evidence itself. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, supra; Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a) (authorizing the suppression of any unlawfully intercepted wire or oral communication and the evidence derived therefrom). However, as Justice Brennan observed in <em>Wong Sun,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARiQ\">[w]e need not hold that all evidence is \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>371 U.S. at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. at 417, <em>quoting </em>Maguire, <em>Evidence of Guilt </em>221 (1959). Thus, once a defendant demonstrates that the Government discovered evidence through an illegal search and seizure, the court must exclude it unless the Government satisfies one of two exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-5\">First, the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence may \u201cbecome so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>1934, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 268, 84 L.Ed. 307. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>5th Cir. 1967, 382 F.2d 48. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-6\">The second means for \u201cpurging the taint\u201d is discovering the same evidence from an \u201cindependent source.\u201d <em>Silver-thorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>1920, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 64 L.Ed. 319. <em>See, e. g., Agius v. United States, </em>5th Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auk-dedup-1\"><em>United States v. Castellana, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 488 F.2d 65, 67, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 500 F.2d 325 <em>(en banc). See Wong Sun v. United States, supra, </em>371 U.S. at 487, 83 S.Ct. at 417; Note, <em>Fruit of the Poisonous Tree </em>\u2014 A <em>Plea for Relevant Criteria, </em>115 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1136, 1137-38 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">The evidence which defendants contest in this case as fruit of the poisonous tree falls squarely within both of these exceptions. We reach this conclusion in part on the basis of the sound advice in <em>Williams v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 48, 51:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-8\">[T]he significance of the nexus between an illegal search and challenged evidence is one of common sense, . . . to be considered under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\"><em>See Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 268, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>8 Cir., 454 F.2d 813, 818, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 969, 92 S.Ct. 2423, 32 L.Ed.2d 668 (1972). The facts and circumstances of this case indicate first that the evidence used to convict Houltin and Phillips came from a source independent of the illegal wiretaps. It is undisputed that the D.E.A. agents knew the identity of the four codefendants for several years before the illegal wiretaps,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Government did not, however, at that time know all the details of defendants\u2019 and codefendants\u2019 smuggling operation. In the first trial, both probable cause to arrest and evidence to convict all of the conspirators came from the illegal wiretaps. This is not true with respect to the second trial of defendants Houltin and Phillips. In that proceeding the wiretaps played no part. There the overwhelming evidence of defendants\u2019 guilt was derived solely from their codefendants\u2019 stipulated testimony. This testimony came not from the wiretaps but from codefend-ants\u2019 own intimate knowledge of the marijuana smuggling operation in which they participated with d\u00e9fendants. That the Government knew first of the events and activities testified to as a result of the wiretaps is not decisive. The testimony constitutes an independent source. <em>See United States v. Marder, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 474 F.2d 1192, 1196; <em>United States v. Holsey, </em>10 Cir., 1970, 437 F.2d 250, 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">We also find that the evidence derived from the four codefendants\u2019 testimony had \u201c \u2018become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint\u2019 \u201d of the illegal wiretaps. In <em>United States v. Marder, supra, </em>at 1196, this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-14\">[T]he type of evidence seized will undoubtedly determine the circumstances that must be considered in determining whether the original taint has been so attenuated, that its exclusion is no longer mandated. Several factors should be considered in deciding whether the attenuation rule is applicable to \u201clive testimony.\u201d The unpredictability of the human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>will, which is necessarily involved in the use of a witness to prove essential elements of a crime, forecloses the adoption of any rigid rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">One such factor is proof that the witness has come forward \u201cby his own volition, regardless of his identification by the illegal search.\u201d <em>Id., citing United States v. Hoffman, </em>7 Cir., 1967, 385 F.2d 501, 504, <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1031, 88 S.Ct. 1424, 20 L.Ed.2d 288 (1968). Another is \u201cevidence that the witness was completely uncooperative when originally discovered by the illegal search but later changed his attitude and supplied the necessary information.\u201d <em>Id., citing Smith v. United States, </em>1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 4, 324 F.2d 879, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Both factors are present in this case. Defendants make much of the fact that the Government compelled codefendants\u2019 testimony by granting them use immunity. Houltin and Phillips assert that codefendants did not want to testify and did so only because their attorney advised them they had no other legal alternative. This, however, indicates only that their testimony was not volunteered; it does not necessarily render it involuntary. It is true that had the four eodefendants refused to testify, they would have risked being cited for contempt. It also is possible that such refusal might have adversely affected their pending motions for reduction of sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. On the other hand, the codefendants could have reasoned that their truthful testimony might enhance the possibility that the court would grant their Rule 35 motions. In short, eodefendants\u201d choice may have been hard, but it was a choice nonetheless. One source of attenuation, then, is to be found in the exercise of the codefendants\u2019 own wills. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>1966, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 134, 139, 375 F.2d 310, 315, <em>cert. denied, </em>388 U.S. 915, 87 S.Ct. 2133, 18 L.Ed.2d 1359 (1967); Ruffin, <em>Out on a Limb of the Poisonous Tree: The Tainted Witness, </em>15 U.C.L.A.L. Rev. 32, 61-80 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Similarly, the fact that Burke, Morrison, Francis, and Croucher originally were uncooperative, pleading not guilty and contesting the Government\u2019s charge that they were coconspirators in a massive marijuana smuggling operation, but later changed their \u00e1ttitude and testified to the truth of that which they had previously challenged, also points to attenuation. In this sense the instant case is much like <em>Smith v. United States, supra. </em>There the D.C. Circuit found that the testimony of a government eyewitness, whose identity was learned from defendants during their illegal detention, was not fruit of the poisonous tree because the taint had become attenuated. As evidence of attenuation, the court noted the fact that \u201cwhen initially located [the eyewitness] gave no information adverse to appellants; only after reflection and the interaction of [his] faculties of human personality did [he] eventually relate to the jury the events of the night of the killing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>117 U.S.App.D.C. at 4, 324 F.2d at 881-82 n.2. Writing for the majority, then Circuit Judge Burger stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-8\">[T]he living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and volition interact to determine what testimony he will give. The uniqueness of this human process distinguishes the evidentiary character of a witness from the relative immutability of inanimate evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\"><em>Id. </em>117 U.S.App.D.C. at 3, 324 F.2d at 881-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">Our final reason for holding that the evidence derived from codefendants\u2019 testimony is not fruit of the poisonous tree goes to the very underpinnings of the exclusionary rule itself. Judge Wisdom, in the opinion in the first appeal of this case, correctly observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa_\">[e]vidence should be excluded only where the benefit accruing to society from the additional deterrent against unlawful police practices equals or exceeds the detriment to society caused by the release of criminals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\"><em>United States v. Houltin, supra, </em>525 F.2d at 947. We agree. This Court is not convinced that the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to the circumstances presented by this case would justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>the resulting further encroachment upon the public interest. See, e. <em>g., United States v. Calandra, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 351, 94 S.Ct. at 621; <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 174-75, 89 S.Ct. at 967.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And even if we were so convinced, we still would be reluctant \u201cto so extend the exclusionary rule in light of the current debate in the United States Supreme Court about the proper role of the exclusionary rule when one must balance between deterring police misconduct and protecting society by using reliable evidence to convict criminal offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, supra, citing Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">\n<em>II. Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV2v\">Defendants\u2019 second contention is that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the fifth amendment prevents their retrial because the entire evidence used to convict them resulted from illegal wiretaps. Thus, according to defendants, our previous reversal of their convictions because of these wiretaps was a finding of insufficiency of the evidence and we should have remanded their case with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause protects an accused from government harassment by multiple prosecutions for the same offense. <em>See, e. g., Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). Balanced against this right of the accused is society\u2019s interest \u201cin fair trials designed to end in just judgments,\u201d <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949), a balance that generally allows the Government to try a successful appellant again. See, e. <em>g., Bryan v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 552, 560, 70 S.Ct. 317, 321, 94 L.Ed. 335 (1950); <em>State of Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, </em>329 U.S. 459, 462, 67 S.Ct. 374, 375, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947); <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, </em>163 U.S. 662, 671-72, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). Justice Harlan, in <em>United States v. Tateo, </em>377 U.S. 463, 466, 84 S.Ct. 1587, 1589, 12 L.Ed.2d 448 (1964), explained the rule this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-9\">Corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is. the societal interest in punishing one whose guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial. It would be a high price indeed for society to pay were every accused granted immunity from punishment \u2022 because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction. From the standpoint of a defendant, it is at least doubtful that appellate courts' would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution. In reality, therefore, the practice of retrial serves defendants\u2019 rights as well as society\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">Like many general rules developed by balancing conflicting considerations, this rule of double jeopardy has exceptions. One such exception is that the Government may not retry a successful appellant if his reversal results from a finding of insufficiency of the evidence, if the Government can produce no additional evidence, and if the defendant did not move for a new trial in the district court. <em>See Forman v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 416, 425-26, 80 S.Ct. 481, 486-87, 4 L.Ed.2d 412 (1960); <em>Sapir v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 373, 374, 75 S.Ct. 422, 423, 99 L.Ed. 426 (1955); <em>Bryan v. United States, supra, </em>338 U.S. at 559-60, 70 S.Ct. at 321; <em>United States v. Perez, </em>5 Cir., 526 F.2d 859, 863 n.3, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 846, 97 S.Ct. 129, 50 L.Ed.2d 118 (1976); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number><em>States v. Apollo, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 156, 158; <em>United States v. Robinson, 5 </em>Cir., 1972, 468 F.2d 189, 194; <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 963, 966; <em>United States v. Goodson, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 1056; <em>United States v. Nall, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 1177, 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Defendants Houltin and Phillips contend that their case falls within this exception. The record and the law indicate otherwise. A careful reading of this Court\u2019s opinion in defendants\u2019 first appeal clearly establishes that we grounded the reversal of their convictions upon a procedural defect in the trial court \u2014 the admission of evidence resulting from the illegal wiretaps. At no point in our opinion did we state that there was insufficient evidence to convict defendants. Indeed, when defendants, after denial on retrial of their motion to dismiss the indictment, sought clarification from this Court on this same double jeopardy issue, we granted the motion for clarification and, in our order dated April 1, 1976, stated that the Government \u201cmay re-prosecute the appellants Houltin and Phillips, but may not use fruits of the wiretaps that we have declared illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">It is axiomatic that the fifth amendment Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Government from retrying a defendant whose conviction has been set aside on procedural grounds. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 121, 86 S.Ct. 773, 777, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966); <em>United States v. Tateo, supra; Forman v. United States, supra; Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 450 F.2d 317, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 859, 93 S.Ct. 143, 34 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972); <em>United States v. Jasso, </em>5 Cir., 442 F.2d 1054, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 845, 92 S.Ct. 146, 30 L.Ed.2d 81 (1971). That is the case here. Defendants\u2019 argument therefore is without merit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">Justice Holmes, in one.of his typically well-reasoned dissents, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-10\">It is one of the misfortunes of the law that ideas become encysted in phrases and thereafter for a long time cease to provoke further analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\"><em>Hyde v. United States, </em>225 U.S. 347, 391, 32 S.Ct. 793, 811, 56 L.Ed. 1114 (1912) (Holmes, J., dissenting). This, we think, is particularly true with respect to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, and, to a lesser but still very real extent, the often heard cry of double jeopardy. On their face, defendants\u2019 assertions of tainted evidence and multiple prosecutions may seem meritorious. Careful, reasoned analysis demonstrates otherwise.

This result is wholly undesirable and should be minimized whenever possible. Exclusion is not intended to redress a wrong to the defendant by releasing him, but is designed only to curb undesirable police conduct.

The majority opinion at best renders meaningless and at worst overrules, without an en banc hearing, a decision of another panel of this Court, <em>United States v. Houltin, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 525 F.2d 943, <em>vacated in part sub nom., Croucher v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 1034, 97 S.Ct. 725, 50 L.Ed.2d 745, <em>modified </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 991 <em>(Houltin I). </em>In <em>Houltin I </em>we reversed the convictions of Houltin and Phillips because government agents, both federal and state, violated the fourth amendment by using illegal wiretaps; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>two defendants, unlike their convicted co-conspirators, had standing to challenge the inadmissible evidence. Here, by granting immunity to the four convicted coconspira-tors, who were then in effect compelled to testify to the same evidence excluded in the earlier case, the prosecution erased the holding in <em>Houltin I </em>as to Houltin and Phillips, the two defendants-appellants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">This case does not fall within the recognized exceptions to the exclusionary rule, a rule offensive to one\u2019s sense of justice in many cases, but a rule that makes the fourth amendment meaningful over the long term. First, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that the coconspirators\u2019 coerced testimony in this case came from a source independent of an admittedly illegal wiretap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, the connection between the evidence introduced and the primary illegality had not become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint. The majority has ignored the purposes of the exclusionary rule and the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree, and has given law enforcement authorities a substantial inducement to use unauthorized wiretaps in future investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">The majority does not rely on a per se rule that witness testimony can never be tainted. After the leading case of <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>1968, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, some decisions supported that view. <em>Smith and Bowden v. United States, </em>D.C. Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 879; <em>Brown v. United States, </em>1967, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 134, 143, 375 F.2d 310, 319 (Burger, J., concurring) <em>cert. denied, </em>1967, 388 U.S. 915, 87 S.Ct. 2133, 18 L.Ed.2d 1359. But a per se approach did not become the law. Instead, witness eases involving live testimony are to be analyzed as any other derivative evidence cases are analyzed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marder, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1192, 1196; <em>see generally </em>Ruffin, <em>Out on a Limb of the Poisonous Tree: The Tainted Witness, </em>15 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 32 (1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">Evidence that is fruit of the poisonous tree is excluded, as Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, said, because the essence of exclusionary rule is not merely \u201cthat . evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all\u201d. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1920, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 64 L.Ed. 319, 321. The government may avoid the exclusionary rule for derivative evidence if it can show either that the evidence came from an independent source or that the relation of the evidence to the primary illegality is so attenuated that the taint is dissipated. <em>United States v. Castellana, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 65, 67 <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>5 Cir., 500 F.2d 325 (en banc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>The facts and circumstances of this case do not fit within the independent source exception to the derivative evidence exclusionary rule. <em>Wong Sun </em>established that evidence is not fruit of the poisonous tree simply because it would have been undiscovered <em>but for </em>the primary illegality by the police. <em>Wong Sun </em>did not, however, reject a \u201cbut for\u201d inquiry entirely. That inquiry survives as the controlling question for the independent source exception. Ruf-fin, 15 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. at 38. Evidence has an independent source when the prosecution can show it was uncovered in a manner with no connection at all to the primary illegality such as wiretapping. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Villarreal, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 565 F.2d 932 (Wisdom, J., dissenting); <em>United States v. Castellana, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 65, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 550 F.2d 325 (en banc); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bacall, </em>9 Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 1050, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1004, 92 S.Ct. 565, 30 L.Ed.2d 557; <em>Collins v. Beto, </em>5 Cir. 1965, 348 F.2d 823, 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><em>United States v. Holsey, </em>10 Cir. 1970, 437 F.2d 250, a case cited in the majority opinion, serves as an example. In <em>Holsey, </em>the police had illegally searched the 'defendant\u2019s rented house and his automobile. The police found evidence of an automobile purchase by someone using the name Jack Weber which would have advanced their investigation had the police not already known all the facts the evidence revealed. The court refused to hold that testimony by witnesses uncovered by the investigation was tainted. It stressed that \u201csuch knowledge obtained by the search gave the F.B.I. Agents no information they did not have before ...\u201d 437 F.2d at 253.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One commentator, who emphasizes the need for special care when law enforcement officials have used unlawful electronic surveillance, believes that the independent source exception should be available in wiretapping cases only when the government can establish \u201cthat its agents had utilized that source before gaining knowledge by the unlawful method\u201d. Pitter, <em>\u201cThe Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\u201d Revisited and Shepardized, </em>56 Cal.L.Rev. 579, 645 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">Against this legal background it is clear to me that the independent source rule does not permit use of the testimony of the convicted coconspirator. The government did not have a fruitful source for the evidence before the taps. Although the federal agents knew the identities of all the conspirators, they had been unable to develop a case. Indeed, this inability to prove their case caused the investigators to place the illegal wiretap. <em>Houltin I, </em>525 F.2d at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">Furthermore, there are several important connections between the primary illegality and the testimony introduced at the second trial. The witnesses had been confronted with the results of the tap; inevitably this influenced the content of their testimony. <em>See generally </em>Pitter, 56 Cal.L.Rev. at 592-93, <em>cf. Grant v. Wainwright, 5 </em>Cir. 1974, 496 F.2d 1043, 1048 n.5 (repetition may lead witness to believe his own false confession). The prosecution exploited the wiretaps in its grant of immunity to compel the testimony. Only because of the wiretap evidence did the prosecutor have available four witnesses who could be \u201cimmunized\u201d without cost. They were already convicted, so an inability to use their testimony against them was meaningless. The government might have convicted Houltin by immunizing Phillips or vice-versa. Either of those grants of immunity, however, would have required paying the usual costs of the immunity procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The information from the wiretaps made those convictions possible. Moreover, the information from the wiretaps determined who had standing in <em>Houltin I. </em>This in turn identified the witnesses to be given immunity. <em>Cf. United States v. Marder, </em>474 F.2d at 1195; <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number><em>States v. Tane, </em>2 Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d at 848, 853 (testimony of witness identified through illegal tap is tainted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Because a but-for causal link exists between the unlawful wiretap and the testimony introduced at trial, that evidence could be considered only if it had become so attenuated from the unlawful tap that the taint was dissipated. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U.S. at 341, 60 S.Ct. 266. The majority believes the evidence is attenuated because the cocon-spirators came forward by their own volition and because they changed from uncooperative defendants to prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The majority thus adopts the will and volition approach to tainted witnesses. Attenuation is supplied by the human factor involved when evidence comes from witness testimony. Courts employing this analysis \u201cmust determine how great a part the particular manifestation of \u2018individual human personality\u2019 played in the ultimate receipt of the testimony in question.\u201d <em>McLindon v. United States, </em>1964, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 286, 329 F.2d 238, 241 n.2. \u201cThe point to scrutinize, then, is . between the ears of the witness\u201d Ruffin, 15 U.C.L.A.L. Rev. at 50. This approach has been criticized \u2014 in an article Judge Gewin termed \u201cexcellent\u201d in <em>United States v. Marder, </em>474 F.2d at 1196 n.4 \u2014 because it is vague, \u201cspurious and unnecessary\u201d, and so manipulable that any decision can be justified. Ruffin, 15 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. at 39, 64. It has, however, been accepted to some extent in this Circuit. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Marder, </em>474 F.2d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">Even within the framework of the will and volition analysis, I cannot understand how the majority concludes that the testimony below resulted from an independent human decision to testify. The government has the burden of showing the evidence is attenuated. <em>Houltin I, </em>525 F.2d at 947. The witnesses did not come forward voluntarily; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they were arrested, tried, convicted, and then ordered to testify. They had no choice but to obey that order to give evidence; the alternative was a contempt citation, as their lawyer so advised them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">To negate the obvious coercion to testify \u2014 coercion made possible by exploitation of the illegal wiretaps \u2014 the majority can only speculate that the co-defendants chose to testify to enhance the possibility that their then-pending Rule 35 motions for a reduction of sentences would be granted. Of course, the co-defendants had sentences to be reduced only because of wiretap evidence. It is just as easy, as the majority concedes, to conclude that their fear that failure to testify would have an adverse impact on the Rule 35 motions increased the coercion on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">The majority does not cite any support in the record for its theory that attenuation can be found in the exercise of the co-defendants\u2019 own wills, for there is none. To the contrary, in the record the United States Attorney stated \u201cnone of the four [witnesses] want to testify but they recognize under the law they have an obligation to do so\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Transcript at p. 28. The trial judge acknowledged that the witnesses \u201cdon\u2019t want to testify\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">The majority\u2019s argument that attenuation is shown because Burke, Morrison, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>Francis, and Croucher changed from uncooperative to cooperative parties is similarly contradicted by the United States Attorney\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The four never wanted to cooperate by testifying. <em>Cf. Smith and Bowden v. United States, </em>1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 344 F.2d 545 in which the court excluded the testimony of a tainted witness who did not change from uncooperative to cooperative, but who was always cooperative. In contrast, in <em>Smith v. United States, </em>cited by the majority, the witness changed his story voluntarily, without coercion of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">As the majority points out by quoting Mr. Justice Holmes, reliance on phrases such as \u201cindependent\u201d or \u201cattenuated\u201d can lead to superficial legal analysis. One means of avoiding the danger in a derivative evidence case is also to analyze its facts in light of the policy behind the exclusionary rule of deterring official misconduct. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Fruit of the Poisonous Tree </em>\u2014 A <em>Plea for Relevant Criteria, </em>115 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1136 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">My conclusion that the testimony in the case is tainted is buttressed by an examination of the case from this perspective. Allowing this evidence to be introduced will not deter official misconduct; it will encourage illegal wiretaps. After this decision, a government agent investigating a conspiracy case who could not obtain permission to use a wiretap (or who did not seek permission) could place an unlawful tap on one conspirator\u2019s telephone, wait until he overheard an incriminating call to which at least one conspirator lacked standing to attack, and use the call to convict that defendant. After the conviction, that defendant would be granted immunity. He would then be forced to testify against the other conspirators. The wiretap in this case was unlawful only because the investigator failed to comply with a technical requirement of 18 U.S.C. 2516(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nothing in the majority opinion, however, restricts the loophole to good faith misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">The majority ignores this difficulty. Instead, it states its reluctance to extend the exclusionary rule. To my mind, to exclude the testimony in this case would not extend the exclusionary rule, but apply it in exactly the situation the Supreme Court has said exclusion is appropriate: when necessary to control official unlawfulness. <em>See Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>1976, 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3047-49, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067. That no court has ever excluded evidence in a comparable fact situation does not mean a decision to exclude would extend the exclusionary rule. It probably means that no prosecutor has ever dared to attempt to use the procedure sanctioned by the Court today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">Finally, I am concerned that two of three judges on the panel in this case, in effect, eradicate the holding of this Court in <em>Houl-tin I </em>\u2014with respect to Houltin and Phillips. In <em>Houltin I </em>this Court held that Houltin and Phillips had standing to challenge the unlawful taps, and reversed their convictions. That standing is now an empty privilege. The majority here holds that a defendant with standing against the primary illegality can do nothing when the government exploits the tainted evidence not only to convict defendants without standing but to convict the defendant with standing by compelling those without standing to testify. There is no longer any reason for a member of a conspiracy to exercise his right as an individual citizen to protest an unlawful wiretap \u2014 unless all members of the conspiracy share his standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">Houltin and Phillips may be guilty. Ringleaders in a criminal conspiracy have a way of interposing layers of less important conspirators between the criminal offense and the hard proof of the ringleaders\u2019 guilt. <em>See Houltin I, </em>525 F.2d at 951-52. But there is no legitimate evidence here that is admissible against the defendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-14\">It is indisputably a policy of our society that criminals be speedily apprehended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>and justly convicted. But in pursuing this aim we must sedulously avoid prejudicing other, and higher goals. One such goal is certainly a cutting down of the incidence of unlawful conduct against private persons by public officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><em>Collins v. Beto, </em>348 F.2d at 831. The testimony of Burke, Morrison, Francis, and Croucher was tainted by the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The \u201cexclusion of relevant criminal evidence is a high price to pay for judicial enforcement of the fourth amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the admission into evidence of the products of unconstitutional searches (wiretaps) as a means of convicting once-tried defendants whom the prosecutor considers should be retried and convicted can only induce official unconstitutional searches. I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">. The government did not contest on appeal the district court\u2019s ruling that a wiretap of a conversation between Houltin and his wife and another between Mrs. Houltin and Mrs. Phillips were unlawful. <em>United States v. Houltin, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 525 F.2d 943, 945.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">. The majority points to the advice in <em>Williams v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1967, 382 F.2d 48, 51 that \u201cthe significance of the nexus between an illegal search and challenged evidence is one of common sense . . . \u201d This is sound advice, but it can be misunderstood. In derivative evidence cases it is not unusual for the defendant\u2019s counsel to offer sophisticated argument to show a causal connection between information obtained through illicit wiretapping and the government\u2019s proof; and, of course, appellate courts should scrutinize such arguments. <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>1939, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307. \u201cCommon sense\u201d, if it has judicial acceptance in this context, may cut through a lawyer\u2019s quiddities to show that a connection is less significant than the lawyer asserts. <em>Id. </em>But what seems \u201ccommon sense\u201d to individual judges cannot be used as a substitute for accepted standards, rules, policies, and principles. It is certainly no substitute for consideration or analysis of the logical relationship between evidence obtained by an illegal wiretap and the exploitation of the evidence to convict defendants. In the context of this and similar cases, \u201ccommon sense\u201d should serve as a check on the specious reasoning defendants\u2019 imaginative counsel devise for sophistical causation, not as the primary basis for decision. Otherwise, the fate of a criminal defendant varies with the vagaries of the judges who happen to review his case. <em>Cf. Adamson v. California, </em>1947, 332 U.S. 46, 68, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (Black, J., dissenting) (warning of the danger of allowing judges to substitute their own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the language of the Bill of Rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">. <em>United States v. Marder, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1192, the other case cited by the majority, states the independent source exception but did not admit any evidence because of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">. The government might also have immunized Burke, Morrison, Francis, and Croucher before the first trial. That course, however, also might have kept some of the conspirators out of jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">. Houltin and Phillips do not have standing to complain for their coconspirators that the immunity grants were improper. They do have standing, however, to protest any use of the illegal wiretaps which leads to evidence against them, including use of the wiretaps to create the possibility of meaningless immunity and compelled testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">. The majority sees a distinction between \u201cvolunteered\u201d testimony and \u201cvoluntary\u201d testimony. The editors of Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary would not agree. Their definition of \u201cvolunteer\u201d is \u201cto offer or bestow <em>voluntarily </em>or without solicitation or compulsion\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1123-16\">.
