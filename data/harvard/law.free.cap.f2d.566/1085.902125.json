The plaintiff insists upon the primacy of the Tribal constitution; the defendants, per contra, argue that the federal constitution controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-16\">The district court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entertaining motions for summary judgment by both plaintiff and defendants, found that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and concluded that plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. We reverse and remand with instructions to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-17\">The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is an unincorporated tribe of Indians which has accepted the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461, <em>et seq., </em>(hereafter the Act). To implement the purpose of the Act to \u201cencourage Indians to revitalize their self-government,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Act confers upon an accepting tribe various powers of self-government, including the powers to employ legal counsel, to prevent the sale of tribal property without tribal consent, and to negotiate with the federal, state and local governments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-18\">The powers granted and authorized under the Act are not without limitation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Despite the Act\u2019s encouragement of tribal self-government, it is beyond question that Congress possesses plenary powers of control over the unique situation of the tribes. As succinctly stated in our opinion in <em>Wounded Head v. Tribal Council of Oglala Sioux Tribe, </em>507 F.2d 1079, 1084 (8th Cir. 1975), it is \u201cestablished authority that Congress has exclusive and plenary power to enact legislation with respect to the Indian tribes.\u201d The Tenth Circuit has made a similar observation in a reference to <em>Simmons v. Eagle Seelatsee, </em>244 F.Supp. 808 (E.D. Wash.1965), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>384 U.S. 209, 86 S.Ct. 1459, 16 L.Ed.2d 480 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-5\">[I]t was well settled that Congress has plenary control over Indian tribal relations and property, and that such power continues after such Indians have become citizens * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-6\">[and] * * * it was early held that such plenary power of Congress included the power to regulate and determine tribal membership, and in so doing to define and describe those persons who should be treated and regarded as members of an Indian tribe * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\"><em>Groundhog v. Keeler, </em>442 F.2d 674, 680 (10th Cir. 1971) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">The Act authorizes tribal organization and the adoption of a tribal constitution, but places the Secretary of Interior in a regulatory position over these processes. Two sections of the Act relate to elections on ratification and amendment of tribal constitutions, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 476 and 479. They provide in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH52\">\u00a7 476. Any Indian tribe, or tribes, residing on the same reservation, shall have the right to organize for its common welfare, and may adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws, which shall become effective when ratified by a majority vote of the adult members of the tribe, or of the adult Indians residing on such reservation, as the case may be, at a special election authorized and called by the Secretary of the Interior under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe. Such constitution and bylaws, when ratified as aforesaid and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, shall be revocable by an election open to the same voters and conducted in the same manner as hereinabove provided. Amendments <em>to the constitution and bylaws may be ratified and approved by the Secretary in the same manner as the original constitution and bylaws. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-13\">\u00a7 479. The term \u201cIndian\u201d as used in sections * * * 476-478, and 479 of this title shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood * * *. The term \u201ctribe\u201d wherever used in said sections shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation. <em>The words \u201cadult Indians\u201d wherever used in said sections shall be construed to refer to Indians who have attained the age of twenty-one years. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a0r-dedup-0\">Pursuant to his authority under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476 to call these so-called \u201cSecretarial elections,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Secretary has promulgated rules and regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the purpose of which, in part, was \u201cto provide uniformity and order in holding elections to vote on constitutions and bylaws and <em>constitutional amendments, </em>and to facilitate the calling of such elections by the Secretary under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Under these regulations, the Secretary\u2019s supervisory role includes authorizing the election,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> having a representative serve as a member of a three-member election board,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> deciding election contests,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and final approval of the amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">After passage of the twenty-sixth amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Secretary took the position that the twenty-sixth amendment superseded the twenty-one year old voter age requirement set by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 479.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Secretary subsequently amended his regulations to permit otherwise qualified eighteen year olds to vote in Secretarial elections.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Under the provisions of the Act, the Tribe had adopted a constitution. In October, 1976, the Tribal Council presented a tribal resolution to the Secretary of the Interior requesting that he call an election to amend the Tribal constitution. The amendment would restrict future membership of the Tribe to \u201c[a]ll children of Vi or more degree Cheyenne River Sioux Indian blood * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">The Secretary called the election as requested, and in November, 1976, issued a notice which stated that the election \u201cshall be conducted in the manner prescribed under Title 25, Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter G, Part 52,\u201d [governing Secretarial elections]. The notice also announced the following voter qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-7\">If you are over 18 years of age or will be 18 on or before November 30, 1976, you are eligible to register to vote in elections called by the Secretary of the Interior. You are not eligible to vote if a Secretarial Election is held before your 18th birthday, even though you are registered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-15\">The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-16\">All enrolled members of the Cheyenne River Tribe, 21 years of age or over, who have maintained legal residence on the reservation for a period of one year immediately prior to any election shall have the right to vote.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-17\">The question presented is a narrow one, namely the proper age limitation on the right to vote in an election to amend the Tribal constitution. The district court held that the Secretary\u2019s role in the elective process did not amount to a \u201csubstantial federal involvement\u201d and was insufficient to characterize the election as a federal election. The district court declared in substance that the Secretary\u2019s action regarding the voter age was an unwarranted intrusion upon tribal autonomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-18\">Contrary to the opinion of the district court, we agree with the statement by this Court in <em>Wounded Head v. Tribal Council of the Ogiala Sioux Tribe, supra, </em>that \u201cSecretarial elections are specific federal elections regulated by federal statute to which the provisions of the twenty-sixth amendment apply.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1084 (footnote omitted). It is not merely the number or type of federal involvements which characterize these elections as federal; such a test would sweep too broadly, given the variety of the Secretary\u2019s administrative and regulatory functions in tribal affairs. Rather, it is the source of the Secretary\u2019s regulatory authority over these elections, such authority having congressional and not tribal, origin. The Congress, not the Tribe, delegates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>to the Secretary the authority to call and conduct Secretarial elections, and the Congressional definition of \u201cadult Indians\u201d in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 479 leaves no doubt that it intended a uniform <em>federal age </em>qualification for voters in Secretarial elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">The eligible voting age of \u201cadult members\u201d of the Tribe, originally those \u201cwho have attained the age of twenty-one years,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> has, since the passage of the twenty-sixth amendment, become eighteen years. The similarity of the language of the twenty-sixth and fifteenth amendments, coupled with the long-held construction of the latter as a self-executing declaration of right,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> lead us to construe the twenty-sixth amendment to invalidate voter age qualifications which were set higher than eighteen years. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s regulation defining an \u201cadult Indian\u201d as \u201cany Indian who has attained the age of 18 years\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is a proper, indeed unavoidable, use of his power and authority under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 476 and 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">In view of the self-executing nature of the twenty-sixth amendment there can be no reasonable doubt that the Secretary had complete authority, indeed a mandate, to recognize the age of 18 years as the eligible voting age for adult Indians with respect to the adoption of a tribal constitution. But the Tribe would draw a distinction between the adoption of a tribal constitution and its amendment. It argues that \u201cThe language of the Indian Reorganization Act is silent as to the qualifications for voters in an election held to <em>amend </em>a tribal constitution, and does not abrogate the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe\u2019s right to set such qualifications in its Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The distinction asserted is not persuasive. The provision of the Indian Reorganization Act referring to the amendment of a constitution plainly states that it may be \u201cratified and approved by the Secretary in the same manner as the original constitution and bylaws.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The \u201csame manner,\u201d in this context, refers to \u201ca majority vote of the adult members [now 18 years of age] of the tribe * * * at a special election authorized and called by the Secretary of the Interior under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find nothing in the Act, nor in its legislative history, justifying a reading of the statute that would apply one eligible age to the adoption of the constitution and another to the amendment of the same article. Both actions are of equal dignity and importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions that the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">.
