Order No. 539-B,-F.P.C.-, 41 Fed.Reg. 32,883 (1976), establishes 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.41 (1977), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-43\">On and after July [30], 1976, all certificates of public convenience and necessity for the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce shall be conditioned as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQB2\">All persons making jurisdictional sales pursuant to the authority granted by this certificate are hereby given notice that the contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tual obligations between the buyer and the seller are incorporated into the certificate obligations, and that the certificate is further conditioned to require that the seller shall ' observe the standard of a prudent operator to develop and maintain deliverability from reserves dedicated hereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJin\">Order No. 539-B is the third in a series of FERC orders, dealing with the development and maintenance of natural gas reserves. The first, Order No. 539, - F.P.C. -, 40 Fed. Reg. 49,571 (1975), was issued on October 14, 1975, without any notice, comment, or hearing as required for rule-making by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1970). This Order stated the FERC\u2019s intention to enforce \u201cdelivery and supply obligations\u201d purportedly contained in producer contracts and producer and pipeline certificates. The FERC\u2019s General Policy and Interpretations was amended by this Order by adding a new section, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.83 (1975), delineating the FERC\u2019s policy on the enforcement of deliverability of natural gas services. On November 28, 1975, the Commission granted reconsideration of Order No. 539 on the application of a number of producers who asserted, among other grounds, that Order No. 539 misinterpreted both the producer-pipeline contractual arrangements and the existing certificate obligations. Issue was also taken with the institution of \u00a7 2.83 without following rule-making procedures. Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C, \u00a7 553 (1970). On March 26, 1976, the FERC issued a second order, Order No. 539-A, -- F.P.C. -, 41 Fed.Reg. 14,531 (1976), to clarify its previous Order and properly to give notice of the intention of the Commission to promulgate \u00a7 2.83 pursuant to a rule-making procedure. Finally, the FERC issued Order No. 539-B, withdrawing \u00a7 2.83 and instituting \u00a7 157.41, on July 30, 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aab-dedup-0\">The impetus behind the FERC\u2019s actions was the charge made before various subcommittees of Congress that natural gas producers were avoiding the delivery obligations in their contracts of sale in order to realize greater profits. It was claimed that the producers were diverting natural gas from interstate to intrastate sales or withholding it in hope of future deregulation of the industry. No support for this charge appears in the record before us and the FERC stated in oral argument that its investigation has uncovered no evidence that the natural gas producers have been withholding supplies. We have held that when an FERC order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACJE\">originated in a policy decision of the agency and not as the outgrowth of factual determinations, the standard of review is whether the agency\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1967). Under that standard we determine \u201cwhether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Superior Oil Co, </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>563 F.2d 191, at 201 (5th Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"at6-dedup-0\">Section 7(e) of the Natural Gas Act requires the FERC to make findings that a proposed retroactive condition, such as the one imposed by Order No. 539-B, is reasonable and is required by the public convenience and necessity. <em>Pure Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>292 F.2d 350, 352-53 (7th Cir. 1961); <em>see Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>360 U.S. 378, 394, 79 S.Ct. 1246, 1256, 3 L.Ed.2d 1312 (1959) (Harlan, J., concurring) and <em>Texaco, Inc. v. FPC, </em>290 F.2d 149, 157 (5th Cir. 1961). In light of the FERC\u2019s admission that the natural gas producers were not withholding natural gas from interstate commerce, it is questionable whether Order No. 539-B can survive the limited review explicated in <em>Superior Oil Co. </em>We need not reach this question, however, since it will be shown <em>infra </em>that Order No. 539-B is beyond the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b623-37\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b623-38\">Shell Oil Company and other natural gas producers bring this petition to review the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s (FERC) Order No. 539-B,-F.P.C.-, 41 Fed.Reg. 32,883 (1976), which established a regulation requiring a producer to act as a \u201cprudent operator\u201d in developing and maintaining deliverability from natural gas reserves.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The primary issue before us is whether this Order exceeds the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate the transpor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The FERC claims that the \u201cprudent operator\u201d obligation is an implied condition of the certificates of public convenience and necessity that are required under the Natural Gas Act before companies may transport or sell natural gas in interstate commerce. The Commission relies upon the concept expressed as \u201cservice\u201d in the Natural Gas Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to establish its authority to hold certificate recipients to the \u201cprudent operator\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>standard. No separate statutory or regulatory grant of jurisdiction has been cited by the FERC.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The producers, however, argue that the FERC is prohibited from issuing Order No. 539-B by the specific exclusion of \u201cthe production and gathering of natural gas\u201d from the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and that the FERC cannot use the power to issue certificates to extend its jurisdiction into the excluded area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the producers and vacate the FERC\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The jurisdiction of the FERC to regulate the natural gas industry is delineated by \u00a7 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717(b) (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a0o-dedup-0\">The producers are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC when they engage in activities that can be classified as sales or transportation rather than as production or gathering. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. State of Wisconsin, </em>347 U.S. 672, 74 S.Ct. 794, 98 L.Ed. 1035 (1954). Through the years, the \u201cproduction or gathering of natural gas\u201d exemption has been judicially narrowed. The progression can be seen by comparing <em>FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., </em>337 U.S. 498, 69 S.Ct. 1251, 93 L.Ed. 1499 (1949) with <em>United Gas Improvement Co. v. Continental Oil Co. (Rayne Field), </em>381 U.S. 392, 85 S.Ct. 1517, 14 L.Ed.2d 466 (1965). The <em>Panhandle </em>case held that gas leases relate to the production or gathering of natural gas and are thus outside the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Supreme Court narrowly construed <em>Panhandle </em>in <em>Rayne Field </em>when it held that leases that are in essence sales of the gas reserves are within the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. In <em>Rayne Field </em>the producers recast a conventional wellhead purchase of natural gas as a purchase of the leasehold interests in the natural gas field. The Supreme Court described this sale of leasehold interests as \u201cvery close in economic effect to [traditional] sales of natural gas,\u201d <em>id., </em>85 S.Ct. at 1520, and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\"><em>The \u201cproduction or gathering\u201d exemption relates to the physical activities, processes and facilities of production or gathering, </em>but not to sales of the kind affirmatively subjected to Commission jurisdiction. This accommodation of the two relevant clauses of \u00a7 1(b) gives content to the national objectives of the Natural Gas Act as expanded in Phillips, and to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to accomplish them, while in no way interfering with state regulatory power over the physical processes of production or gathering in furtherance of conservation or other legitimate state concerns. <em>Id. </em>381 U.S. at 403, 85 S.Ct. at 1523. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The FERC can enforce \u201cservice obligations\u201d contained in the certificates that it issues to producers, preventing producers from ceasing deliveries from fields admittedly capable of continuing production. This doctrine was developed in <em>Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>364 U.S. 137, 80 S.Ct. 1392, 4 L.Ed.2d 1623 (1960) and <em>Sun Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>364 U.S. 170, 80 S.Ct. 1388, 4 L.Ed.2d 1639 (1960), based on the power to issue certificates, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>and prevents producers from beginning delivery to another party after the initial contracts expire. Another line of cases permits the FERC to regulate the \u201cabandonment of service.\u201d <em>Mitchell Energy Corp. v. FPC, </em>533 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Michigan Consolidated Gas Co., </em>177 F.2d 942 (6th Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>No case has been found, however, that extends FERC jurisdiction directly into the physical activities, processes, and facilities of production and development. The cases recognizing the broad scope of the FERC\u2019s authority have nonetheless also recognized the \u201cproduction or gathering\u201d exclusion. In <em>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>324 U.S. 581, 65 S.Ct. 829, 89 L.Ed. 1206 (1945), after holding that the FERC could include production properties in the rate base of an interstate pipeline company, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apa-dedup-1\">that does not mean that the part of \u00a7 1(b) which provides that the Act shall not apply \u201cto the production or gathering of natural gas\u201d is given no meaning. Certainly that provision precludes the Commission from any control over the activity of producing or gathering natural gas. For example, it makes plain that the Commission has no control over the drilling and spacing of wells and the like. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 65 S.Ct. at 839.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Associated Pipe &amp; Supply Co., </em>447 F.2d 1041, 1052 (5th Cir. 1971), we echoed Mr. Justice Black\u2019s definition of \u201cthe production or gathering of natural gas:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cProduction\u201d of gas [means] the act of bringing gas from the earth, and \u201cgathering\u201d [means] the act of collecting gas after it has been brought forth. <em>Panhan-die Eastern Pipe Line Co., </em>337 U.S. 518, 69 S.Ct. at 1262 (Black, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa7\"><em>See also Northern Natural Gas Co. v.

(Emphasis added.) (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">To hold that the power to issue Order No. 539-B is within the jurisdiction of the FERC would all but eliminate the \u201cproduction or gathering\u201d exclusion and would allow the FERC to encroach on areas reserved to the states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot so extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the authority of the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Af3\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-14\">.

During oral argument, the FERC\u2019s counsel first stated that the FPC could require producers to drill new wells pursuant to Order No. 539-B; counsel later withdrew from this position and stated that the Commission could not do so because such a requirement would be beyond its power. The Commission staff, however, has not adopted a restrictive view of the authority granted to the FERC under Order 539-B. In its initial brief to the FERC in Docket No. RI75-112 (Dec. 6, 1976), the Staff stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_d\">Immediate development of these known proved reserves will serve the public interest by increasing the supply of natural gas available to the interstate market.
