The Association was organized on July 23, 1923 as an adjunct to a cemetery company that operated a cemetery in St. Louis County, Missouri. The purpose of the Association was to create a perpetual care fund to maintain and care for the cemetery in exchange for the cemetery company\u2019s deed of all lots whose serial numbers ended in \u201c0\u201d, as well as an undertaking to remit ten percent of the sales prices of all cemetery lots sold. The Association was also granted deeds to certain roadways, drives, walks, sunken gardens, parks, and basins that were on the Laurel Hill grounds by the cemetery company.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The District Court held on the basis of the facts before it that the Association was not a tax-exempt organization under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(13) as the Association had contended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It further held that the Association was an \u201cassociation\u201d taxable as a corporation, but that it was not entitled to a deduction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162, which permits deductions to corporations for ordinary and necessary business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Having carefully reviewed the briefs and records in this case and having heard argument of counsel, we are convinced that the judgment of the District Court is based upon findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous, that no error of law appears and that an opinion would have no precedential value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm on the basis of the District Court\u2019s opinion. 427 F.Supp. 679 (E.D. Mo.1977); <em>see </em>Local Rule 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(13) provides tax-exempt status for certain cemetery companies operated for the benefit of their membership or on a nonprofit basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-25\">. The relationship between the Association and the cemetery company has been revised, and the issues in dispute on this appeal have no application to subsequent years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
