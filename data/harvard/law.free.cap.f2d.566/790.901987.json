Apart from the jurisdictional issue raised by the second case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the issues in the two cases are virtually identical. For the reasons expressed below, we vacate the Commission\u2019s order and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">After a consolidated hearing involving several parties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the administrative law judge found that petitioner and the others had \u201cwillfully\u201d violated the antifraud provisions of the securities acts in connection with the sale of stock of Interamerican Ltd.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On review, the Commission affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner had violated these provisions by his participation in a \u201cmassive fraud\u201d designed by Interameri-can\u2019s promoter, Hausner. Hausner inflated the price of Interamerican stock by spreading the spurious claim that the company was ready to market an effective oral contraceptive whose \u201csustained release\u201d feature made it suitable for sale in underdeveloped countries. In furtherance of this scheme, Hausner took pains to convince Nassar of the efficacy and potential profitability of this product.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Nassar\u2019s allegedly unlawful activities occurred in his efforts to sell Interamerican stock to customers of his brokerage firm. Essentially, the Commission found that Nassar\u2019s representations concerning the stock were unduly optimistic, lacked an adequate basis in fact, and were made on the basis of a wholly inadequate investigation. In addition, he was found to have made unwarranted predictions about the price to which the stock might rise. The Commission did not find, however, that Nassar was as culpable as Hausner. Indeed, \u201c[f]or present purposes\u201d the Commission accepted as true Nassar\u2019s claim that he himself had been deceived by Hausner\u2019s representations and had sustained heavy losses on purchases of Interamerican stock. J.A. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">After summarizing Nassar\u2019s activities, the Commission found that he had \u201cwillfully\u201d violated \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Commission Rule 10b-5 implementing that section, and \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Act. However, the Commission did not explain which activities violated which provision, or whether all of the activities violated both acts. Moreover, the Commission made no findings regarding Nassar\u2019s scienter; indeed, the order contains no discussion of the mental state required to make out violations of these provisions. The Commission did refer to Nassar\u2019s violation as being \u201cwillful\u201d and his price quotations as being \u201creckless,\u201d J.A. 16, but it failed to explain if it was using these terms in a technical or a descriptive sense. Similarly, the reasons for affirming the suspension of Nassar were not explained in detail, the Commission merely noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">[W]e are unable to take a sanguine view as to the prospect of Nassar\u2019s future honesty. To permit one so prone to irrational euphoria and blatant exaggeration to continue to meddle with other people\u2019s money would be contrary to the public interest. J.A. 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">These cases ensued. While review was pending, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). The Court held that a private action for damages will not lie under \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Commission Rule 10b-5 in the absence of any allegation of \u201cscienter,\u201d which it referred to as intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud. 425 U.S. at 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The only substantive issue presented is whether, after <em>Hochfelder, </em>some form of scienter must be established in an administrative enforcement proceeding under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as well as in a private action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Another panel of this court recently addressed this question and concluded that it should be resolved in the first instance by the Commission itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">The applicability of the <em>Hochfelder </em>decision to enforcement actions brought by the SEC is a question that has not been decided by this court. In addition, we have before us only the views of the attorneys representing the Commission, and not the Commission itself, as to the applicability of the <em>Hochfelder </em>scienter requirement in actions of this type. We emphasize that we intimate no view as to the applicability of the <em>Hochfelder </em>scien-ter requirement to this case. We hold only that the actions of the petitioners must be re-evaluated in light of significant Supreme Court precedents<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rendered since petitioners\u2019 case was decided by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-14\"><em>Collins Securities Corp. v. SEC, </em>183 U.S. App.D.C. 301, at 308, 562 F.2d 820, at 827 (1977). In deference to <em>Collins Securities, </em>therefore, we also remand this case to the Commission for reconsideration in light of <em>Hochfelder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">The Commission attempts to distinguish <em>Hochfelder </em>on the ground that the case under review involves a violation of \u00a7 17(a). In <em>Hochfelder, </em>the Court recognized that on its face Rule 10b-5 covered behavior in which scienter was absent. Since the language of \u00a7 17(a) is virtually the same as that of Rule 10b-5,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commission rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>sons that an action under \u00a7 17(a) will lie even in the absence of an allegation of scienter. Hence, the Commission regards \u00a7 17(a) as adequate support for its order. However, the Commission\u2019s order neither indicates which behavior violated \u00a7 17(a) nor whether violations of \u00a7 17(a) alone would have sufficed to support Nassar\u2019s suspension. Although on remand the Commission may rest on \u00a7 17(a) alone, \u201c[the] administrative order [now under review] can be affirmed on appeal only on the grounds on which the Commission relied.\u201d <em>KIRO v. FCC, </em>178 U.S.App.D.C. 126, 130, 545 F.2d 204, 208 (1976). Because the Commission\u2019s discussion of \u00a7 17(a) is not separate from its discussion of \u00a7 10(b), we cannot affirm its result on the basis of \u00a7 17(a) alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We vacate the Commission\u2019s order and remand the case to the Commission for reconsideration in light of this opinion and such further proceedings, if any, it deems appropriate. In connection with the remand, we note that Nassar maintains that the sanction ordered by the Commission is overly severe and hence arbitrary. We need not reach this issue at this time, since on remand the Commission may find no violation or may decide to impose a lesser sanction. However, should the Commission seek to reinstate this penalty it should articulate its reasons for doing so with greater particularity. The discussion in the order is simply too brief to enable this court to determine if the sanction ordered was based on a consideration of all the relevant factors and is in accord with Commission precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">\n<em>The order of the district court in No. 76-1536 is affirmed. The petition for review in No. 76-1278 is granted and that case is remanded to the Commission for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-23\">. Nassar, Inc. and Mr. Nassar will be referred to either as \u201cpetitioner\u201d or \u201cNassar.\u201d The Commission\u2019s order has not been published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\">. That section states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">A person aggrieved by a final order of the Commission entered pursuant to this title may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the . . . District of Columbia Circuit ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\">. Nassar recognizes that a petition for review in the Court of Appeals is a proper means for obtaining review of the Commission\u2019s order. Nevertheless, he argues that in this case the Administrative Procedure Act also authorizes review in the district court by declaratory judgment. This argument is wholly without merit. Section 703 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703, provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">The form of proceeding for judicial review is the special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject in a court specified by statute or, in the absence or inadequacy thereof, any applicable form of legal action</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">As noted above, \u00a7 25(a) of the Securities Exchange Act provides for review of Commission orders in the Court of Appeals. Since that section also provides that such relief is exclusive, \u00a7 25(a)(3), and Nassar has not shown it to be inadequate in any way, the district court was correct in dismissing the declaratory action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See generally, Investment Company Institute v. Board of Governors of the Federal </em>Reserve <em>System, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 551 F.2d 1270 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-15\">. Nassar argues that his due process rights were infringed by having his case consolidated with others. However, \u201c[n]o principle of administrative law is more firmly established than that of agency control of its own calendar.\u201d <em>Association of Massachusetts Consumers, Inc. v. S.E.C., </em>170 U.S.App.D.C. 118, 121, 516 F.2d 711, 714 (1975). Of course, an agency does not have unlimited discretion to consolidate cases. <em>Id. </em>But petitioner has shown no prejudice from the Commission\u2019s decision to consider his case along with those of others involved in the alleged fraud. The Commission carefully distinguished every aspect of its decision regarding Nassar \u2014 evidence, violation and sanction \u2014 from those of the other parties. Nassar\u2019s other contentions regarding the fairness of his hearing are equally meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-16\">. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a); section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); and Commission Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">. Nassar also raises a spate of constitutional issues. Though we need not reach these issues because of our disposition of this case, we note that they appear meritless. Nor need we decide whether the Commission\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. In addition to <em>Hochfelder, Collins Securities </em>also referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v.

SEC, </em>No. 75-2200, 183 U.S.App. D.C. 301, 562 F.2d 820 (1977), that an order revoking such registration must be based on \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d While that question is not involved in this case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it identifies the care needed as a condition for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Even assuming that a scienter is needed for revocation of registration, that does not mean that what is required is the kind of subjective deceit that <em>Ernst </em>held to be required in an action for damages. As the Commission points out, a broker-dealer may be guilty of intentional misconduct if he deliberately commits certain acts even if he doesn\u2019t know they are forbidden by the Act or regulations. In other words, there is no requirement of specific intent that includes a specific element of knowledge of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>tinent rule of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A broker-dealer is under an obligation to learn the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">A difficult question is raised by the statement in the Commission\u2019s opinion that Nas-sar was engaged in grossly reckless conduct<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in failure to do any reasonable checking of assertions made to him by Hausner (J.A. 120).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\"><em>Hanly v. SEC, </em>415 F.2d 589 (2d Cir. 1969), develops that standards for a securities dealer are strict, because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201che implicitly represents that he has an adequate basis for the opinion he renders\u201d and \u201c[b]y his recommendation he implies that a reasonable investigation has been made . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. <em>See also Hiller v. SEC, </em>429 F.2d 856 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">In <em>Ernst, </em>the court explicitly refrained from deciding whether recklessness might be a basis of scienter for a damages action. 425 U.S. at 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375. However, when we come to the SEC\u2019s control over the broker-dealers, we are dealing with a group that is under intense regulatory control and scrutiny. The Commission serves an important public interest in imposing and monitoring its controls. This function often involves evidence that requires sophisticated and sensitive appraisal. As we pointed out in <em>Collins Securities, supra, </em>in explaining why we refrained from the requirement used in deportation eases that the evidence be \u201cunequivocal\u201d\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">In the present case we have an administrative agency with a charter for protection of the public, and the function of evaluating with sophisticated sensitivity the conduct of those operating in a regulated industry. Two elements appear relevant to the standard we should impose here: (1) the type case (fraud); (2) the heavy sanction (deprivation of livelihood). Given those elements, typical of many SEC cases, and given the type of circumstantial proof on which the SEC most often must rely, it appears to us that the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard is the proper standard here; it will require the SEC to reach a degree of persuasion much higher than \u201cmere preponderance of the evidence,\u201d but still somewhat less than \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing\u201d or \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We think that the insertion of the word \u201cunequivocal,\u201d used by the Supreme Court in deportation-type cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>would require the SEC to meet a standard of proof in alleged market fraud cases which, given the circumstantial nature of the proof almost inevitably necessarily relied upon, would cause the regulatory agency to fail in its proof in any except the most exceptionally blatant case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">It may be that the SEC will conclude that scienter for purposes of this kind of discipline must include intentional violation of a duty specifically imposed by a Commission rule or regulation, and also, and perhaps necessarily, include conduct amounting to gross recklessness when the Commission has imposed a duty to make a careful check.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The agency\u2019s power to cope with broker-dealer recklessness can be expressed in terms of fraud,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and even formally structured in fraud on the ground that the broker-dealer makes an implied representation that he has checked,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which would be false if indeed he has not. But that is not a wholly satisfactory analysis, although it has been used in some instances, for I would suppose that the Commission has the power to discipline a broker-dealer who has not checked as required, even though misrepresentation might be negatived by advising his customers that he has not checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">The law embraces a finding of fault in omissions, as in failure to perform a duty, and in failure to make a statement where silence is tantamount to concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">The concept that recklessness may serve as a surrogate for subjective intent is not new to the law. Indeed even for purposes of defining murder, recklessness may take the place of subjective intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">The fact that a further reflection and refinement is called for at this time should not set the Commission back in its objective of furthering the public interest. This is likely an instance where more ground may be covered with a slow start. While the Commission may resist many efforts to clasp <em>Ernst, </em>it can not free itself completely of the Court\u2019s concerns. Refinement of doctrine is not a scruple, it is a necessity. Set in sound perspective, however, <em>Ernst </em>should not impede the Commission\u2019s efforts to protect the public.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-16\">. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v.

They say that this evidence is not \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d We think it is. But the important thing is that the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard is inapplicable. A preponderance of the evidence is sufficient. See <em>M. V. Gray Investments, Inc., </em>44 S.E.C. 567, 575 (1971); <em>Norman Pollisky, </em>43 S.E.C. 852, 861 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-17\">But these distinctions are outweighed by the similarities between the two cases. Like Span-gler, Nassar was wholly indifferent to the boundaries that separate fact from fiction, naively credulous, and prone to embroider on the falsehoods with which Hausner fed him. In <em>Nassar\u2019s </em>case, as in <em>Spangler\u2019s, </em>we deal with a high-pressure sales effort that lasted for a long time, was unsupported by any semblance of an adequate foundation, and was characterized by grossly reckless price predictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARE9\">Hence we are unable to take a sanguine view as to the prospect of Nassar\u2019s future honesty.
