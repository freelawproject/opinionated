Appellant bases his appeal, as he did his original petition, on the assertion that he was mentally incompetent to comprehend his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that his confession, rendered after his <em>Miranda </em>rights had been properly explained, had been erroneously admitted into evidence at his original state court trial. The district court found Appellant\u2019s reasoning unconvincing and entered summary judgment for the Respondent-Appellee. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Raymond Cooper (Appellant) was convicted, after a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, of murder, robbery, and burglary and sentenced to serve fourteen to eighteen years in prison for his participation in the killing of a Chicago woman, which occurred while he and his cohorts were burglarizing her home on September 28, 1970. The evidence at trial included a statement by Cooper describing how he had \u201cgrabbed [the woman] from behind\u201d as she entered her kitchen door and held her while an accomplice wrapped a towel around her face to keep her from screaming. The woman was strangled.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">Cooper had moved to suppress this statement on grounds that he was mentally incompetent to comprehend the <em>Miranda </em>warnings which he had admittedly been given prior to any police questioning and prior to his statement. He argued that the uncontradicted testimony of expert witnesses established that he could not have understood his <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the form in which they were given and that any asserted waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights should, therefore, not be considered knowing and intelligent. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Cooper made this argument at the original motion to suppress, which was denied, on appeal to the Appellate Court of Illinois, which affirmed his conviction, <em>People v. Cooper, </em>30 Ill.App.3d 326, 332 N.E.2d 453 (1975), and to the Illinois Supreme Court, which denied his petition for leave to appeal, without opinion, on November 24, 1975. His petition for a writ of certiorari was also denied. <em>Cooper v. Illinois, </em>425 U.S. 994, 96 S.Ct. 2206, 48 L.Ed.2d 818 (1976). Cooper again made the same argument in the district court habeas corpus proceedings. Judge Kirkland found no justifiable reason to upset the completed state court process. Nor do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">Far from being \u201cuncontradicted,\u201d the testimony of Cooper\u2019s own expert witnesses (two psychologists and one psychiatrist) was inconclusive, equivocal, and contained its own contradictions. The record of this testimony supports the conclusions that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>although Cooper had a low I.Q. and was \u201cnot spontaneous,\u201d he was able to \u201c . . . go through and read this [his <em>Miranda </em>rights] himself and understand [his <em>Miranda </em>rights] himself as a whole\u201d; (2) he responded \u201cquickly and directly,\u201d and (3) he could \u201cread and understand\u201d his <em>Miranda </em>rights if he were helped and \u201cif he took the time.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">More importantly, Cooper\u2019s own behavior and actions when he testified at the suppression hearing were clearly discernible to the trial judge. Cooper himself never claimed not to have understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the record shows that he was able to respond to the questions of the attorneys at the hearing with no apparent difficulty. One particular colloquy demonstrated a fatal flaw in Cooper\u2019s claim that he failed to comprehend his <em>Miranda </em>rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV2\">Cooper\u2019s Attorney: Did they tell you\u2014 strike that \u2014 when did you ask for a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">Cooper: After when the police told me that if you could not afford an attorney that one would be furnished to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2n\">By this response, Cooper affirmatively demonstrated, in court, that he had comprehended his <em>Miranda </em>rights with sufficient clarity to request an attorney immediately upon his being offered one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The additive impact of these factors on the state trial judge (who personally saw and heard the witnesses), plus the equivocal nature of the expert testimony, placed it well within his discretion to find that Cooper had understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and had knowingly and intelligently waived them.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">On this substantial, written record, the district court had no alternative but to defer to the findings made by the state court after the hearing, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1971), particularly when a state appellate court has made an independent factual review of an adequate record. <em>See, United States ex rel. Harris v. Illinois, </em>457 F.2d 191, 195-96 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 860, 93 S.Ct. 147, 34 L.Ed.2d 106 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">For these reasons, we hold that the district court properly denied this petition for a writ of habeas corpus and that judgment in favor of Respondent-Appellee is</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. The Illinois Appellate Court found it significant that the officer taking the two-page statement testified that the question and answer period associated with the waiver of rights and the statement itself took approximately one hour to complete. <em>People v. Cooper, </em>30 Ill. App.3d at 333, 332 N.E.2d at 458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-26\">. The argument of Appellant\u2019s counsel in this court that Cooper\u2019s testimony came only after a year\u2019s experience in legal proceedings and is, therefore, not indicative of his true intelligence is unconvincing. If Cooper were mentally incompetent, as counsel would have us believe, a year in the county jail would hardly improve his ability to respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
