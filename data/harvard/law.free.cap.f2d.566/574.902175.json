Internal Revenue Service, </em>522 F.2d 284 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>vacated, </em>429 U.S. 1085, 97 S.Ct. 1090, 51 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977), we affirmed an injunc-tive order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>entered pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1970). The order required the Internal Revenue Service to make available to plaintiffs for inspection and copying four basic categories of documents involving certain aspects of the federal manufacturers excise tax imposed upon sales of automobiles and trucks. Generally the categories were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">1) All private letter rulings and technical advice memoranda the Internal Revenue Service issued with respect to a number of questions concerning price, constructive price, and coverage under Sections 4216, 4061 and 6416 of the Internal Revenue Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">2) communications between the Internal Revenue Service and persons outside the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to these private letter rulings and technical advice memoranda;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">3) so much of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s letter ruling indexing systems as would enable the appellees to determine whether additional similar letter rulings and technical advice memoranda have been issued by the Service; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">4) Internal Revenue Service files, including correspondence, analyses and submissions of fact, concerning 23 published revenue rulings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">We held that former \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103 (1970), as <em>amended, </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6103 (Supp.1977), did not exempt from disclosure these categories of documents under exemption three of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1970), as <em>amended, </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we noted that the district court reserved the right, after an <em>in camera </em>inspection, to deny disclosure of specific documents or portions thereof based on any of the FOIA exemptions. 522 F.2d at 287, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">The Supreme Court granted the government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in the light of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (TRA), Pub.L. No. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1520. While we find some aspects of the Tax Reform Act to be applicable to these proceedings, we find nothing therein inconsistent with the order of the district court from which appeal is taken and accordingly reaffirm that order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">Section 1201(a) of the TRA added a new \u00a7 6110 to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110 (Supp.1977), which authorizes public inspection of \u201cwritten determinations\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service and related \u201cbackground file documents,\u201d in accordance with elaborate, specified procedures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWritten determinations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>are defined to mean \u201ca ruling, determination letter, or technical advice memorandum.\u201d With respect to these particular documents, Congress intended that \u00a7 6110 provide the exclusive means of public access, ruling out resort to the regular FOIA procedures. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110(e) (1977); S.Rep.No.94-938, Part I, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 314-15, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3744.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In addition, \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code was extensively amended by \u00a7 1202(a) of the TRA, effective January 1, 1977, to establish the general rule that \u201creturns and return information shall be confidential\u201d and not subject to disclosure, with carefully delineated exceptions. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6103 (Supp.1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The first issue confronting us is to what degree, if any, the revised I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 6110 apply to this action. As to a case on direct review, the general rule is that \u201ca court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 162-65, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Section 1201(b) of the TRA does in fact contain a statutory direction to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">(b) <em>Effect Upon Pending </em>Requests.\u2014 Any written determination or background file document which is the subject of a judicial proceeding pursuant to section 552 of title 5, United States Code, commenced before January 1, 1976, shall not be treated as a written determination subject to subsection (h)(1), but shall be available to the complainant along with the background file document, if requested, as soon as practicable after July 1, 1976.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">\u201cSubsection (h)(1)\u201d refers to I.R.C. \u00a7 6110(h)(1), which is simply that portion of the section dealing with the release procedures for written determinations issued pursuant to a request made before November 1, 1976. The records sought by Frue-hauf fall within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Congress was concerned about the effect on pending lawsuits of inherent delays in the new \u00a7 6110 procedures. These earlier written determinations are to be released only as funds for that purpose have been appropriated and only in a prescribed order. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110(h)(3) (Supp.1977). In addition, persons who have received such determinations can file suit to block disclosure, and persons requesting determinations must pursue administrative remedies and file suit to obtain additional disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>determinations or portions thereof which the Secretary declines to make public. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110(h)(4), (f)(2), (f)(4) (Supp. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">We conclude that \u00a7 1201(b) of the TRA exempts this pending lawsuit from the procedural requirements of \u00a7 6110, insofar as \u201cany written determination or background file document\u201d is concerned. However, the other portions of the TRA, including the revision of \u00a7 6103, do apply to pending cases, as we do not read \u00a7 1201(b) or any portion of the legislative history as clearly indicating the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">While not mentioned by the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, we include in our reconsideration not only the TRA but a recent amendment to exemption three of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1977), <em>amending </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1970), contained in \u00a7 5(b) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub.L. No. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, 1247, which was effective March 13, 1977.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While this amendment narrowed the exemption, we conclude that revised \u00a7 6103 does qualify as an exemption three statute, entitling the Internal Revenue Service to refuse to disclose \u201creturns and return information.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">The government concedes that under \u00a7 1201(b) of the TRA it is required to disclose private letter rulings, technical ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>vice memoranda, and related background file documents. These items comprise the first two categories of documents sought by the plaintiffs. The government informed the court that it had completed delivery of all items in these categories, after deleting certain kinds of information listed in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110(c) (Supp.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Remaining at issue are the two final categories of documents. The Internal Revenue Service urges that they fall within the definition of \u201creturn information\u201d under revised \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code and hence are exempted from disclosure under the FOIA. Fruehauf argues that the indexing systems and the background files of certain published revenue rulings are encompassed within the meaning of written determinations or background file documents under \u00a7 1201(b) of the TRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">From samples of the indices submitted by the government to the plaintiffs, it is clear that they are in substance merely condensations of the rulings and technical advice memoranda already made disclosable by \u00a7 6110. Individual card entries are filed either alphabetically by taxpayers\u2019 names or by subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We tend to think that the indices are encompassed by the \u00a7 6110 definition of \u201cwritten determinations,\u201d and thus disclosable under \u00a7 1201(b) of the TRA. While they are not in fact the precise documents transmitted to taxpayers, their essence is the same. Even if the indices are not technically within that definition, we conclude that they are not exempted \u201creturn information\u201d under revised \u00a7 6103. While such documents fall within the literal language \u201cany other data . . . prepared by the Secretary with respect to the determination of . liability,\u201d nondisclosure would simply be at odds with the statutory scheme. Section 6103 is concerned foremost with protecting tax <em>returns </em>and information directly related thereto. The government does not argue that the indexing systems in question are summaries of returns. While return information does extend to \u201cother data\u201d concerning the existence of tax liabilities, we see no good reason for exempting indices when the more detailed documents themselves are not exempt and must be opened to public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">To support its contention, the government relies upon one sentence of the Senate Finance Committee Report concerning the TRA, which stated that \u201cit is not contemplated that existing IRS indices will be disclosed.\u201d S.Rep.No.94-938, Part I, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 306, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3736. However, we think that this quotation was taken out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Section 6110 makes a distinction between some documents that will be automatically open for inspection in public reading rooms and others that will be available for inspection only upon a specific written request. The Committee intended that a prospective subject matter index would be placed in such public areas. We think that the mention of \u201cexisting\u201d indices was a reference to this distinction and was not intended to prevent an individual\u2019s inspection of such indices upon a written request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus we hold that the letter ruling indices as a category must be made available to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">We turn to the final category of documents composed of background files of certain published revenue rulings. The government argues that the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 6110 do not affect rulings that have been published or their background files, and that such items are included with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>in the definition of exempted \u201creturn information\u201d in \u00a7 6103. We find these contentions to be altogether without merit.. The statute clearly contemplates that the request for a written determination, any written material submitted in support of the request, and any communication, written or otherwise, between the IRS and persons outside the IRS in connection with the determination, shall be available to the public. Because a determination is expressly defined to include \u201ca ruling,\u201d with no distinction between those published and those which are not, the plaintiffs are clearly entitled to the category of materials defined in \u00a7 6110(b). Insofar as these files contain other records, we earlier noted that \u00a7 6103 or other exemptions may be found to apply to a specific document. 522 F.2d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In conclusion we find nothing in the amendments to the Internal Revenue Code or the Freedom of Information Act requiring a vacation or modification of the district court order. We reaffirm our decision that on a categorical basis the plaintiffs are entitled to the four kinds of documents they seek. However, the order permits the government to assert that a specific document, or portion thereof, need not be disclosed by reason of one of FO'IA exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Because the provisions of \u00a7 6110 are not applicable to this action, the authority for disclosure of their documents and the procedures to be followed are still found in the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552 (1977). While the district court may in its discretion permit the agency to make initial deletions of exempted material, as the IRS has already done with respect to documents in the first two categories, \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) empowers the court to determine such matters de novo with an <em>in camera </em>examination of the full contents of the disputed records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we noted in our original opinion, the FOIA permits \u201cpractical alternative remedies to an onerous document-by-document <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial judge.\u201d 522 F.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">For guidance in the future proceedings, we observe that \u00a7 6103 includes within the term return information \u201cany part of any written determination or any background file document . . . which is not open to public inspection under section 6110.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6103(b)(2)(B) (1977). Thus the \u00a7 6103 definition incorporates those portions of written determinations exempted from disclosure under \u00a7 6110(c). The government will therefore be entitled to assert that the matters listed in \u00a7 6110(c) are exempted from disclosure in any document found in the four categories. This would include, for example, the names, addresses, and other identifying details of the person to whom a written determination pertains, whether the particular record is the determination itself or the summary of the determination on a card in the letter ruling indices.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. Former \u00a7 6103(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">(2) All returns made with respect to the taxes imposed by chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 32, subchapters B and C of chapter 33, subchapter B of chapter 37, and chapter 41, shall constitute public records and shall be open to public examination and inspection to such extent as shall be authorized in rules and regulations promulgated by the President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Regulations promulgated by the President afforded only limited access to tax returns. We held that the trial judge erred in assuming that \u00a7 6103(a)(2) applied only to income tax returns, because the language expressly mentions taxes imposed under chapter 32, which relates to excise taxes. However, we decided that the four categories of documents did not fall within the Congressional meaning of \u201creturns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6110 (Supp.1977) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\"><em>(a) General rule. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the text of any written determination and any background file document relating to such written determination shall be open to public inspection at such place as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-17\"><em>(b) Definitions. </em>\u2014 For purposes of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7\"><em>(1) Written determination. </em>\u2014 The term \u201cwritten determination\u201d means a ruling, determination letter, or technical advice memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWN0\"><em>(2) Background file document. </em>\u2014 The term \u201cbackground file document\u201d with respect to a written determination includes the request for that written determination, any written material submitted in support of the request, and any communication (written or otherwise) between the Internal Revenue Service and persons outside the Internal Revenue Service in connection with such written determination (other than any communication between the Department of Justice and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Internal Revenue Service relating to a pending civil or criminal case or investigation) received before issuance of the written determination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6103(b) (Supp.1977) defines \u201creturn\u201d and \u201creturn information\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\"><em>(1) Return. </em>\u2014 The term \u201creturn\u201d means any tax or information return, declaration of estimated tax, or claim for refund required by, or provided for or permitted under, the provisions of this title which is filed with the Secretary by, on behalf of, or with respect to any person, and any amendment or supplement thereto, including supporting schedules, attachments, or lists which are supplemental to, or part of, the return so filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\"><em>(2) Return information. </em>\u2014 The term \u201creturn information\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">(A) a taxpayer\u2019s identity, the nature, source, or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, overassessments, or tax payments, whether the taxpayer\u2019s return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing, or any other data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary with respect to a return or with respect to the determination of the existence, or possible existence, of liability (or the amount thereof) of any person under this title for any tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfeiture, or other imposition, or offense', and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHr\">(B) any part of any written determination or any background file document relating to such written determination (as such terms are defined in section 6110(b)) which is not open to public inspection under section 6110, but such term does not include data in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">. The Senate debate shortly before enactment of the TRA supports this conclusion. One colloquy included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, a question has arisen over the treatment of certain pending freedom of information cases under the new rules governing disclosure of private letter rulings and related materials under section 1201(a) of the bill, which adds section 6110 to the revenue code. I would be grateful if the chairman of the committee could advise me as to whether I am correct, Mr. President, in assuming that under section 1201(b) of the bill, rulings, technical advance memorandums, background files, indexes, and card files which were or are the subject of a judicial proceeding under the Freedom of Information Act are not made subject to these new rules on disclosure? In other words, are cases such as Fruehauf Corp. against Internal Revenue Service, Supreme Court docket 75-679, in any way adversely affected by the changes contained in section 1201(a) of the bill by reason of section 1201(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">Mr. LONG. [Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee], Mr. President, in answer to the Senator\u2019s question, if the Supreme Court or other Federal court, in a pending freedom of information case, affirms a taxpayer\u2019s right to disclosure of private letter rulings, technical advance memorandums, background files, indexes and card files, or other related communications, and correspondence, section 1201(b) assures that section 1201(a) will in no way impede or deter the court ordered disclosure as to all the information sought in the pending cases. Similarly, if a pending freedom of information case is decided against the taxpayer, the taxpayer must look to the new law for its disclosure rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">122 Cong. Rec. S16023 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 1976). It is evident the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee understood that \u00a7 1201(b) would exempt pending suits from the provisions of \u00a7 1201(a), which added the new I.R.C. \u00a7 6110. However, there was no reference to \u00a7 1202(a) of the TRA, revising I.R.C. \u00a7 6103, and therefore no reason to believe that it would be inapplicable to any pending action on its January 1, 1977 effective date.
