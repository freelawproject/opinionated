Platt, <em>Judge, </em>sentencing Miller to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on controlled substance conspiracy conviction after probation violation. Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">On September 5, 1975 Miller pled guilty to a charge of willfully conspiring to manufacture quantities of methaqualone, a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, carrying a maximum possible sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and $15,000 fine. Miller was sentenced to 5 years, suspended after 3 months, 4 years\u2019 probation, and fined $10,000. This sentence took into consideration Miller\u2019s record \u2014 he had no prior criminal conviction \u2014 and individual circumstances \u2014 he ran a small trucking company which required his supervision and he supported a wife. At sentencing Judge Platt told Miller: \u201cWere it not for your good record and were it not for your particular circumstances, you can rest assured the sentence would have been far more severe than it is going to be.\u201d As a condition for probation Miller was obliged to \u201crefrain from violating any law (federal, state and local).\u201d In announcing Miller\u2019s sentence, Judge Platt stated that \u201cin a case of a drug offense, some punishment must be imposed\u201d and indicated that it was his \u201cpolicy\u201d to mete out a \u201csentence\u201d for such offenses. Miller did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">Miller was arrested by the New York Police Department on January 23,1977 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>indicted for grand larceny, burglary, and criminal possession of stolen property. The initial charges against Miller were reduced to petit larceny, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct when the manager of a looted warehouse declined to press charges. Miller pled guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $100. The remaining charges were then dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Miller appeared before Judge Platt on July 1, 1977 for sentencing in connection with probation violation. At a probation violation hearing an off-duty policeman testified that he saw Miller and two accomplices removing merchandise from a damaged warehouse next to other buildings destroyed by fire, that when he approached Miller and identified himself as a peace officer Miller immediately sped away in his van, and that when he was apprehended with the goods Miller offered to return them if no report would be made of his activities. Miller declined to take the stand. Miller faced a maximum of 4 years, 9 months in prison remaining on the original sentence. Judge Platt sentenced Miller to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2), with eligibility for parole when the Parole Commission should determine. In sentencing Miller, Judge Platt referred to his earlier sentence, which he described as lenient, and expressed his \u201cshock\u201d at Miller\u2019s probation violation: \u201cI think you may be the only one that has come back to me on a violation of probation since my three years on this bench, and it was \u2014 it\u2019s a real shock to me.\u201d Miller appeals from this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Miller\u2019s first claim is based on an objection to his initial sentence because Judge Platt indicated that he believed some sentence must be imposed for drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Miller\u2019s second claim is based on Judge Platt\u2019s reference to his initial sentence and Judge Platt\u2019s expression of \u201cshock\u201d at his probation violation. Miller asserts that these statements indicate that Judge Platt abused his discretion when sentencing him for violating his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Probation revocation and modification are matters which call for the exercise of sound judicial discretion. <em>United States v. Mulligan, </em>48 F.2d 93, 94 (2d Cir. 1931). We find no error here, however, either in the original sentence or in that imposed on revocation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">To be sure, the use of the term \u201cpolicy\u201d was susceptible of misinterpretation. We do not approve or permit rigid classifications that prevent the exercise of the judge\u2019s legal discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>487 F.2d 360 (2d Cir. 1973). However, we take the judge\u2019s remarks considered as a whole to mean, not that imprisonment is mandatory in all drug cases, but that the fact of imprisonment in most drug cases in the district was a factor to be considered, in the light of the desirability of some uniformity of treatment among those similarly situated, and that the judge considered drug cases serious enough usually to merit a \u201csentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Here the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks, though brief, indicate that both at the time of the original sentence and the sentence on revocation of probation, the defendant\u2019s background and individual history were given substantial weight in tailoring the penalty. The original offense here was serious indeed, the manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance in large quantities and over an extended period, involving quantities of the drug of the order of 100,000 dosage units per month over a period of some 18 months. Even though the state offense charged was reduced to a relatively minor one in plea bargaining due to the reluctance of the victim to press charges, the offense on which the probation violation was based was shown at the revocation hearing to be in fact the looting of a warehouse located in a complex in which many buildings had been damaged by fire, by any standards a substantial violation of the conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
