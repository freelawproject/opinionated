We have jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Knutson was a general contractor at a large construction site. In that capacity, it subcontracted with Flower City Architectural Metals to furnish and install a curtain wall for the construction project. Flower City, in turn, subcontracted with Allstate Steel Erection, Inc., for the latter\u2019s performance of necessary steel erection.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">In order to perform its work, Allstate rented an aluminum tubular welded scaffold from a scaffold company. Only employees of Allstate worked on the scaffold. The Commission found that Knutson\u2019s employees had access to the zone of danger underneath the scaffold, although Knutson disputes this.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">Knutson employed a safety administrator who periodically performed inspections on the jobsite, for the purpose of discovering safety hazards including OSHA violations. If an unsafe condition was discovered, the safety administrator was to inform the appropriate project superintendent or foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">On January 19,1972, the scaffold used by Allstate collapsed, injuring four Allstate employees who were working on it at the time. Thereafter, the scaffold was inspected by an OSHA area director and a compliance officer. Their inspection revealed a pre-existing crack, which was approximately one inch long and was located on the underside of the scaffold. The pre-existing crack had oxidized, resulting in a dulling of the aluminum. It was determined that the pre-existing crack contributed to the collapse of the scaffold by rendering it incapable of supporting the weight of the four employees. The inspection also revealed that the scaffold was not equipped with toe boards or a standard guard rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-18\">Prior to the accident, Knutson\u2019s safety administrator had inspected the scaffold on two different occasions. His inspection consisted of viewing the scaffold from a distance of approximately twenty feet. As a result of the inspections, the safety ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ministrator observed that the scaffold was not equipped with toe boards and had only a rope guard rail. However, he did not communicate this information to Allstate, or to the project superintendent or foreman. The safety administrator did not observe the crack in the scaffold during his inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On these facts, the Secretary cited Knut-son for violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to his authority under \u00a7 658(a). Knutson was cited for a \u201cserious\u201d violation <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to comply with the Occupational Safety Standards presently at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(7) and (8), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u00a7 1926.451. Scaffolding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">(a) General requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">(7) Scaffolds and their components shall be capable of supporting without failure at least 4 times the maximum intended load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">(8) Any scaffold including accessories such as braces, brackets, trusses, screw legs, ladders, etc. damaged or weakened from any cause shall be immediately repaired or replaced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 666(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Knutson was assessed a penalty of $550 for this violation. Knut-son was cited for a non-serious violation for failure to comply with the Occupational Safety Standard presently at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(4). (Failure to equip a scaffold with guard rails and toe boards.) Pursuant to \u00a7 666(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Knutson was assessed a penalty of $55 for this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">Knutson contested the citations and penalties and a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge vacated the citations for both the serious and non-serious violations on the basis that Knutson had no duty with respect to the safety standard violations by Allstate. Thereafter, discretionary review was granted by the full Commission pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(i). The Commission decided, contrary to the Administrative Law Judge, that Knutson did have a duty with respect to the safety standard violations by Allstate. It concluded that Knut-son had violated its duty with respect to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(4) because, under the circumstances, it could reasonably have known that the scaffold lacked a standard guard rail and toe boards. Accordingly, it reversed the Administrative Law Judge and upheld the Secretary\u2019s citation and penalty for violation of that section. However, the Commission concluded that Knutson had not violated its duty with respect to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(7) and (8) because, under the circumstances, Knutson could not reasonably have known that the scaffold was incapable of meeting the minimum weight requirement. Accordingly, it vacat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ed the Secretary\u2019s citation and penalty for violation of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), the Secretary has petitioned this court to set aside the Commission\u2019s order vacating the citation for violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-451(a)(7) and (8). The basis for its appeal is that the Commission erred in concluding that Knutson could not reasonably have known that the scaffold used by Allstate was in violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-451(a)(7). Alternatively, the Secretary contends that the Commission erred in vacating the citation for serious violation without determining whether Knutson was in non-serious violation of the safety standards. The Commission\u2019s action regarding the citation for violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(4) is not contested on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">An employer has a duty to comply with the safety standards promulgated by the Secretary under the Act arising from \u00a7 654(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the typical case occurring under \u00a7 654(a)(2), the employer has either created or controlled the safety standard violation. The Commission has described the Secretary\u2019s burden of proof in this situation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">In the typical case arising under section 5(a)(2) of the Act (a case involving an employer at a common construction site is atypical) the Secretary carries his burden of proving a violation by establishing (1) that a specific standard applies to the facts, (2) that there was a failure to comply with the specific standard, and (3) that employees of the cited employer had access to the hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">An employer may rebut the Secretary\u2019s allegations by showing (1) that the standard cited by the Secretary as the basis for his charge is not applicable to the situation at issue, (2) that the situation at issue was in compliance with the cited standard, or (3) that its employees did not in fact have access to the hazard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\"><em>Anning-Johnson Co., </em>CCH OSHD par. 20,-690, at 24,783 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The multi-employer construction worksite situation presents an additional consideration regarding employee safety. In' this situation, a hazard created and controlled by one employer can affect the safety of employees of other employers on the site. In light of this facet, the Commission has stated that in this situation an employer will have a duty under \u00a7 654(a)(2) regarding safety standard violations which it did not create or fully control. <em>Anning-Johnson Co., supra </em>at 24,784; <em>Grossman Steel &amp; Aluminum Corp., </em>CCH OSHD par. 20,691, at 24,791 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">The duty as outlined by the Commission in these decisions is a reasonable one. Employers who have no control, or only limited control, over the operations of other employers at the worksite, e. g., subcontractors, have a duty to exert reasonable efforts to protect their own employees from the safety standard violations of others. <em>Anning-Johnson Co., supra </em>at 24,784; <em>Grossman Steel &amp; Aluminum Corp., supra </em>at 24,791. General contractors normally have the responsibility and the means to assure that other contractors fulfill their obligations with respect to employee safety where those obligations affect the construction worksite. Accordingly, the Commission has stated that it will hold a general contractor responsible under \u00a7 654(a)(2) for safety standard violations which \u201cit could reasonably have been expected to prevent or abate by reason of its supervisory capacity.\u201d <em>Grossman Steel &amp; Aluminum Corp., supra </em>at 24,791. Furthermore, the duty of a general contractor is not limited to the protection of its own employees from safety hazards, but extends to the protection of all the employees engaged at the worksite. <em>Id.; Anning-Johnson Co., supra </em>at 24,784.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The Commission here applied this interpretation of \u00a7 654(a)(2) in determining whether Knutson had violated its duty as a general contractor with respect to the safety standard violations by Allstate. The courts have treated the Commission\u2019s interpretations of the Act\u2019s provisions with deference and have not overturned its interpretations where they are reasonable and consistent with the purpose of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Brennan v. OSHRC (Underhill Construction Corp.), </em>513 F.2d 1032, 1038 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Budd Co. v. OSHRC, </em>513 F.2d 201, 204, 206 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Gilles &amp; Cotting, Inc., </em>504 F.2d 1255, 1261-62 (4th Cir. 1974). We think that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 654(a)(2) as it applies to general contractors is reasonable and is consistent with the purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The Secretary does not contest the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the general application of \u00a7 654(a)(2) to the multi-employer construction site situation. Rather, it disagrees with the conclusion which the Commission reached in applying that standard to the particular facts of this case. Specifically, it contends that in light of the degree of control which Knutson exercised over the worksite, Knutson\u2019s duty under \u00a7 654 required it to load test the scaffold used by Allstate or to otherwise assure that the scaffold was capable of supporting four times its intended weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The scope of review for orders issued by the Commission pursuant to \u00a7 659(c) is governed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a) and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. <em>Dunlop v. Rockwell International, </em>540 F.2d 1283, 1287-88 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Horne Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. OSHRC and Dunlop, </em>528 F.2d 564, 567 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Hendrix, </em>511 F.2d 1139, 1141 (9th Cir. 1975). Initially we consider whether the Commission\u2019s factual findings are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d which is the standard of review for questions of fact imposed by \u00a7 660(a). We note that \u201c[substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. N. L. R. B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). After a careful review of the whole record, we have concluded that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The Commission\u2019s conclusion that Knut-son did not violate \u00a7 654(a)(2) is subject to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u00a7 706.

A reviewing court must \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. . . . Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d The agency must articulate a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d . While we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given, ... we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-86, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">With these standards in mind, we turn to the Commission\u2019s decision. Under the Commission\u2019s test in <em>Grossman Steel &amp; Aluminum Corp. </em>for determining whether a general contractor has violated its duty under \u00a7 654(a)(2) with respect to safety standard violations by its subcontractors, the relevant factors to be considered are (1) degree of supervisory capacity, (2) nature of the safety standard violation, and (3) nature and extent of precautionary measures taken. The Commission\u2019s decision indicates that it considered these factors. While its discussion of Knutson\u2019s supervisory capacity falls below the ideal, its consideration of that factor can be adequately discerned from its express application of the \u201csupervisory capacity\u201d test and its finding regarding Knutson\u2019s general safety inspection procedures at the worksite. It made rather extensive findings regarding the cause of the violation. It considered the safety inspection measures taken by Knutson regarding the defective scaffold. The Commission could have articulated <em>its </em>conclusion more precisely in terms of the test which it applied. However, we are able to discern a rational connection between the conclusion it reached and the facts it found. There is sufficient factual basis in the record to support its conclusion. Hence, we cannot say that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously or that it abused its discretion. <em>See Bowman Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Systems, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 290, 95 S.Ct. 438; <em>N.L.R.B. v. Hearst Publications, Inc., </em>322 U.S. 111, 130-31, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); Butz v. <em>Glover Livestock Commission Co., </em>411 U.S. 182, 188, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The Secretary contends that the Commission\u2019s order must be reversed on the basis of our decision in <em>Brennan v. OSHRC and Vy Lactos Laboratories, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 460 (8th Cir. 1974). The <em>Commission </em>placed <em>some </em>emphasis on its finding that Knutson could not have detected the crack which caused the scaffold to collapse in reaching its conclusion that Knutson did not violate its duty. In the <em>Vy Lactos </em>case, we indicated that whether a hazard is a \u201crecognized hazard\u201d under \u00a7 654(a)(2) and whether an employer \u201ccould not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation\u201d under \u00a7 666(j) depends on the foreseeability of the general hazard rather than on the foreseeability of the accident as it actually occurred. 494 F.2d at 463. That case is distinguishable in that it dealt with an employer who had created a safety hazard and had taken no precautionary steps in protecting its employees from the hazard. The general contractor\u2019s duty with respect to safety standard violations by its subcontractors is not necessarily full compliance, but depends on what measures are commensurate with its degree of supervisory capacity. In this situation, the cause of the safety standard violation may be of some relevance in determining whether the general contractor could reasonably have been expected to prevent or abate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The Secretary also attacks the Commission\u2019s action as being an erroneous interpretation of the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d clause of \u00a7 666(j). Section 666(j) determines when a penalty for a \u201cserious\u201d violation must be imposed under \u00a7 666(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It indicates that a serious violation does not occur where \u201cthe employer did not, or could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the presence of the violation.\u201d The Secretary argues as follows. Reasonable diligence required Knutson to load test the scaffold used by Allstate or to otherwise assure that the minimum weight requirement of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451(a)(7) was satisfied. Had Knutson taken these measures, it would have known that Allstate\u2019s scaffold violated the safety standard. Hence, argues the Secretary, Knutson\u2019s conduct supports the assessment of a penalty for a \u201cserious\u201d violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In our reading of the Commission\u2019s decision, it does not reach the issue of whether Knutson\u2019s conduct would support a penalty for a \u201cserious\u201d violation, as defined by \u00a7 666(j). We do not think it was required to do so. For a civil penalty to be imposed against a general contractor under either \u00a7 666(b) (serious violation) or \u00a7 666(c) (non-serious violation) with respect to a safety standard violation by one of its subcontractors, there must first be a violation of its duty under \u00a7 654(a)(2) to comply with the safety standard. Since the Commission concluded that Knutson did not violate its duty to comply with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.-451(a)(7) and (8), and therefore vacated the citation for violation of those safety standards, it was not necessary that it inquire into whether Knutson\u2019s conduct would support a penalty for a \u201cserious\u201d violation of the standards. For the same reason, it was not necessary for the Commission to determine whether Knutson\u2019s conduct would support a penalty for a non-serious violation of the safety standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">\u00a7 654.
