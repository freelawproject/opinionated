Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-15\">RONEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">The National Labor Relations Board found Mangurian\u2019s, Inc. violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1973), while opposing an organizational campaign mounted by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, AFL-CIO, 227 N.L. R.B. No. 28 (Dec. 7,1976). The Board seeks enforcement of its cease and desist order. We grant enforcement for three reasons: (1) substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Mangurian\u2019s discriminated against union solicitation, reprimanded an employee who passed out organizational literature, and threatened to close stores if the union prevailed, (2) the Board properly concluded that an allegation of union racial and other invidious discrimination need not be considered as an affirmative defense, and (3) the election result locked inside a ballot box impounded by the NLRB is irrelevant to this enforcement petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Mangurian\u2019s, Inc. operates a chain of retail furniture stores and supporting warehouses. In late February 1975 the union began a concerted effort to organize the sales and nonsales employees in southeastern Florida. The union filed election petitions on various dates between March 10 and 13. On May 21 the Board\u2019s Regional Director directed that an election be held. On June 9, however, the union filed the unfair labor practice charges which are the subject of this review proceeding. The Board held the election on June 20, but impounded the ballots pending disposition of the unfair labor practice charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\n<em>Discriminatory \u201cNo-Solicitation\u201d Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Prior to the union campaign, the company had no rule prohibiting solicitation by employees at its West Palm Beach store, and collections for various charities regularly occurred. About March 1 the company posted a notice in the store which said that because of the union\u2019s \u201ccampaign to get in here . . . as in all matters which are unrelated to work, no person will be allowed to carry on Union organizing activities on the job\u201d and violations will result in \u201cserious disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The timing of the rule provides a sufficient basis for a Board finding that \u201cthe Company had motives other than maintenance of production or discipline.\u201d <em>Brewton Fashions, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>361 F.2d 8, 17 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 842, 87 S.Ct. 95, 17 L.Ed.2d 75 (1966); <em>see Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 803 &amp; n. 10, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). As such the rule presents a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1), which makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees\u201d in the exercise of their rights to organize. The company removed the notice on March 9, and never enforced it, but those facts only mitigate the degree of coercion. This is not a case where the Board\u2019s only objection to a rule was the company\u2019s discriminatory enforcement. See <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. NLRB, </em>124 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 377-378, 365 F.2d 898, 910-911 (1966). Furthermore, the Board\u2019s misstatement in its complaint which indicated the rule was not posted until after election petitions were filed on March 10 was not a material error and did not deprive the company of adequate notice of the charges against it. <em>See NLRB </em>v. <em>Sunnyland Packing Co., </em>557 F.2d 1157 (5th Cir. 1977). Finally, the approval of a notice containing similar language in <em>Surprenant Manufacturing Co. v. NLRB, </em>341 F.2d 756, 758 (6th Cir. 1965), is not persuasive. There no claim of discriminatory timing was made, and the decision focused on sections of the notice for which this case provides no parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"aea-dedup-0\">\n<em>Reprimand of Employee for Leafleting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">A few days before a union meeting on March 16, employee Rene Proulx passed out leaflets near the exit of a Fort Lauderdale complex containing a company distribution center and a \u201cBig M\u201d store. Proulx was off from work that day. The leaflet invited recipients to \u201chear the real truth\u201d at a given time and place. Above that message was a caricature of a business executive shouting into his intercom \u201cSend me in someone to fire\u201d and printed near his head were the words \u201cWilson, Inc.\u201d Ray Wilson was the company\u2019s president. About two months after the leafleting, Wilson sent Proulx a written warning and reprimand which implied the leaflet demeaned the company and its management in the eyes of its customers and if repeated \u201cmore serious action than this reprimand will be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">An employee has a right to distribute union literature on nonworking time in nonworking areas, absent an affirmative showing of special circumstances \u2014 such as the maintenance of production or discipline \u2014 justifying curtailment of that right. <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, supra; Republic Aluminum Co. v. NLRB, </em>394 F.2d 405 (5th Cir. 1968) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The company claims that its precarious financial position, coupled with the tendency of the leaflet to demean the company in the eyes of its customers, present such a special circumstance. The administrative law judge found, however, on Proulx\u2019 testimony, that only warehouse employees received the meeting announcements. While the language of the leaflet\u2014 \u201cJoin Mangurian\u2019s Employees\u201d \u2014 could support an inference that it was intended for customers, and the company\u2019s operations manager testified Proulx gave the leaflet to customers, the administrative law judge did not credit his testimony. The company received no complaints from customers. In resolving factual disputes, credibility resolutions by the Board are entitled to affirmance on review unless the credited testimony is inherently unreasonable or defective. <em>See NLRB v. American Art Industries, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>415 F.2d 1223, 1227 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1122, 25 L.Ed.2d 397 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Alternatively, the company argues the leaflet was a \u201cwanton attempt to lampoon President Wilson\u201d which was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At_\">so disrespectful of the employer as seriously to impair the maintenance of discipline and thus render the employee unfit for further service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\"><em>NLRB v. Blue Bell, Inc., </em>219 F.2d 796, 798 (5th Cir. 1955) (employer called \u201ca liar\u201d). That conclusion, however, is out of place here. In the context of an organizational campaign hotly contested by both sides, some leeway must be tolerated. <em>See Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, </em>383 U.S. 53, 61, 86 S.Ct. 657, 15 L.Ed.2d 582 (1966). The caricature did no more than express in a humorous fashion the acknowledged power of the president of an unorganized company to hire and fire. The Board\u2019s conclusion is in accord with the facts: \u201cthe literature was not defamatory and did not exceed the limits of appropriate campaign literature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Threats to Close Stores</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">At the time of the campaign, the company had a reputation for unprofitability. It had sustained operating losses for five years, and the company had closed or sold stores in New York, Texas and Colorado, retaining only those in Georgia and Florida. Employees frequently questioned company officials about potential closings. President Wilson, who was hired to reverse the company\u2019s ill fortune, had adopted a policy of optimism. The Board found that during the campaign, however, management officials on three separate occasions unlawfully threatened that a union victory would by itself cause the company to go out of business. Such a statement, unaccompanied by a proven causal link to specific union economic demands, is a coercive threat rather than an honest forecast. <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 619-620, 89 S.Ct. 1818, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The company attacks the sufficiency of the evidence supporting all three findings. Taking the threats in chronological order, the first came on April 28 when company Personnel Director Steven Waldschmidt departed from a prepared speech to eight assembled West Palm Beach store employees and stated that if the union got in, the union could possibly cause the company to go out of business. The company presented witnesses who denied the statement was made, but the administrative law judge found one\u2019s memory imperfect, another\u2019s statement uncertain, and the third\u2019s testimony in part contradicted by facts not in dispute. In contrast, the administrative law judge determined that the testimony of two pro-union employees which established that the statement was made had the \u201cring of truth and certainty.\u201d Even though the judge apparently erred when he also placed reliance on the company\u2019s failure to call witnesses equally available to both sides, his finding that the threat was made is supported by a reasonable credibility choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The company also argues that the threat, even if made, was not a dire prediction amounting to a threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit, but was instead a mere opinion protected by \u00a7 8(c), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(c), and the First Amendment. <em>See Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Consumer Council, </em>425 U.S. 748, 778-779, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346, (Stewart, J., concurring). The case on which the company relies, <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Southwire Co., </em>429 F.2d 1050 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 939, 91 S.Ct. 932, 28 L.Ed.2d 218 (1971), upheld a special master\u2019s determination that a company president\u2019s speech was protected even though it contained the opinion that he was, in the words of the Court, \u201cunsure of the status of the Company, future raises, or of a profit sharing plan\u201d if the union came in. <em>Id. </em>at 1057. While taken in isolation, that language bears some similarity to the statement made here, the holding of the <em>Southwire Co. </em>case emphasizes that protection under the Act depends on whether the statements are based on fact and whether they tend to coerce in the context in which they are made. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The relationship between predictions and fact and their possible impact upon employees is a question of fact and factual findings should not be overturned unless . unsupported by substantial evidence .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1058. Just as the Court in that case deferred to the special master, it is appropriate here to defer to the findings of the administrative law judge. Throughout these proceedings, the company has failed to produce evidence to show how the union, which had not yet even presented its demands, would have caused the company to go out of business. The company bore the burden to produce such evidence. <em>Zim\u2019s Foodliner, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>495 F.2d 1181, 1137 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 838, 95 S.Ct. 66, 42 L.Ed.2d 65 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The second threat occurred in early May, when company controller Jerome Burd visited the North Miami store and engaged salesmen Martin Gorin and Nat Donay in conversation concerning the company\u2019s poor financial condition. Burd noted that L. James Wade, Jr., the chief executive of General Portland, Inc., Mangurian\u2019s parent company, had the power to close stores, and had threatened to close Mangurian\u2019s if the union got in.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The administrative law judge\u2019s decision on this point rested entirely on a resolution of conflicting testimony by Gorin and Burd. In a June affidavit, Gorin detailed the threat as well as his response to it. The company says the judge could not properly rely on that affidavit because it was contradicted by his testimony at the administrative hearing. <em>See NLRB v. Quest-Shon Mark Brassiere Co., </em>185 F.2d 285, 289 (2d Cir. 1950) (dictum). The only contradiction, however, was at trial when Gorin said the threat came from Burd himself rather than Wade. Questioned about the ambiguity, he said his affidavit was correct. The trial judge credited that statement on the ground the affidavit was taken five months before, at a time closer to the incident. At the same time, the administrative law judge found that Burd\u2019s rebuttal testimony only indirectly denied making the threats. Burd said he did not make the statement at the time Gorin said he made it, but he admitted at a later time discussing with Gorin the options Wade would face \u201cabout any adverse situation that might arise\u201d within the company. The Board was entitled to rely on the administrative law judge\u2019s judgment concerning this testimony even though it simultaneously noted the administrative law judge was wrong in giving weight to the company\u2019s failure to call Donay, a witness available to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The third threat was made in early June. Robert Poutre, the company\u2019s labor relations representative, visited the North Miami store and introduced himself to Gorin. During a discussion of the election issues, Gorin asked Poutre if Wade would close the store if the union came in. Poutre responded that Wade \u201cwas crazy enough to close down Mangurian\u2019s, if the union got in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Gorin presented the only evidence that this threat was made. The Board upheld the administrative law judge\u2019s crediting of his version, even though six others present at the Miami store that day offered rebuttal testimony. The judge found Poutre\u2019s denial unreliable, because he described himself at trial as a \u201cmanagement consultant\u201d when in fact he was the company\u2019s labor relations representative. Five salesmen said they did not hear the statement, but the administrative law judge noted that they frequently absented themselves from the conversation to wait on customers. The judge characterized their testimony as \u201cblanket denials devoid of any convincing details to lend credibility.\u201d He further noted that one salesman had denied Poutre had even mentioned unions, which was contrary to Poutre\u2019s stated purpose in visiting the store. The company argues it was an error to give such heavy weight to Gorin\u2019s testimony when, in his June affidavit, Gorin described Poutre\u2019s visit to the store without mentioning the threat. Again, however, the company has failed to make the showing necessary to set aside a credibility choice resolved by the Board. The company has not attempted to rebut any of the factors the administrative law judge found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>discredit the testimony of the six men. Nor has it convincingly impeached Gorin. This Court \u201c[is] not at liberty to displace the Board\u2019s choice if it is between two fairly conflicting views, even though we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Monroe Auto Equipment Co., </em>392 F.2d 559, 561 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 293, 21 L.Ed.2d 270 (1968). The administrative law judge \u201cwrote a full memorandum of decision in which he explained the reasons for his credibility determinations painstakingly and in detail.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Southern Cement Co., </em>417 F.2d 198, 199 (1969). Absent a more pressing showing of bias or error, his affirmation of Gorin\u2019s testimony must stand, and Gorin\u2019s statement provides sufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Striking the Second Affirmative Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In its answer, the company alleged in its second affirmative defense that the union was disqualified from obtaining the Act\u2019s protection because it discriminates on the basis of sex, race, alienage and national origin. Upon the General Counsel\u2019s motion, the administrative law judge struck that defense and the Board approved his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">At the time the judge ruled, the Board was declining to certify as bargaining agent any union shown to be engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. <em>Bekins Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>211 N.L.R.B. 138 (1974). A bargaining order, however, was not part of the remedy sought in this case, and so the allegations of the second affirmative defense were inapposite to the charged company violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1). The Board acted within its authority in rejecting the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">On appeal, the company seeks retroactive application of <em>Handy Andy, Inc., </em>228 N.L.R.B. No. 59, 94 L.R.R.M. 1354 (Feb. 25, 1977), in which the Board reversed the <em>Be-kins </em>decision and held it would consider union discrimination in an appropriate unfair labor practice context. The company, however, does not argue that the Board\u2019s choice of <em>Handy Andy </em>remedy rather than that of <em>Bekins </em>is compelled by statute. The company does argue that the Constitution forbids any Board action which furthers private racial discrimination. <em>See Shelly v. Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). The unfair labor practice order in this case, however, is not drawn along racial lines and arguably does not favor the allegedly offending union over unions generally in their protection from the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices. Furthermore, the Board at any given time is entitled to assume that its other remedies for discrimination are available and will be used. <em>See NAACP v. FPC, </em>425 U.S. 662, 665 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 1806, 48 L.Ed.2d 284 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\n<em>Remand to Count Ballots</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">In some cases, an unfair labor practice charge, filed before the Board directs an election, will \u201cblock\u201d the election until the charge is resolved. In this instance, the Board had already directed the election when the union filed the unfair labor practice charges. Apparently acting pursuant to NLRB Field Manual \u00a7 11730.9b, the Regional Director exercised his discretion to complete the election and impound the ballots pending the outcome of the proceeding. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 18 A.L.R.F. 420, 424 (1974). The company argues that the Court should remand this case to the Board to count the ballots, which it says could make this proceeding moot, presumably because the union may have won.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The election result, however, could not moot this case. In <em>NLRB v. Raytheon Co., </em>398 U.S. 25, 28, 90 S.Ct. 1547, 26 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970), the Supreme Court held a subsequent election certified by the Board to be valid did not moot enforcement of prior unfair labor practice charges arising out of an election campaign. Despite intervening compliance, or in this case, union victory, future misconduct may occur, and enforcement is an essential predicate for a future contempt order. <em>See In re Labor Board, </em>304 U.S. 486, 495, 58 S.Ct. 1001, 82 L.Ed. 1482 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
