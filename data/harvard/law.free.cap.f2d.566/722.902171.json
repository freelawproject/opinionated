The challenged order permits Ohio Barge Lines (OBL) to provide barge service to several Chicago area steel mills belonging to OBL\u2019s parent corporation, United States Steel. The petitioners, common carriers serving the same steel mills, object to the increased competition which will result from the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">The petitioners attack the order on four grounds. They contend first that the Commission erred in not holding hearings to determine whether the order would result in a violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5(14)-5(16) (1970). (These sections were added to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Interstate Commerce Act by the Panama Canal Act of 1912 and will be referred to throughout the remainder of this opinion as \u201cThe Panama Canal Act\u201d). The petitioners also contend that the Commission erred in not following its own precedents; in making arbitrary findings unsupported by the record; and in not reopening the record to consider new evidence proffered by the petitioners. Concluding that none of petitioners\u2019 contentions warrants reversal we affirm. We shall consider each of petitioners\u2019 contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">A. PANAMA CANAL ACT HEARINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We turn first to the petitioners\u2019 argument that the ICC abused its discretion in not, on its own initiative, holding hearings to determine whether the contested permit would result in violations of the Panama Canal Act. That Act mandates that no company shall be permitted to operate rail and water carriers which may compete with each other.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute permits the Commission to conduct hearings to determine whether such competition may arise. The hearings may be conducted either upon application of any carrier or upon the Commission\u2019s own motion. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(15) (1970)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative law judge who heard this case declined to conduct such hearings on his own motion, but invited the petitioners to apply for such a hearing as a separate proceeding. The petitioners have never done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The petitioners nevertheless contend that the ICC should have convened hearings on its own motion. The petitioners reason as follows: United States Steel controls both OBL.and a railroad which serves the same steel mills OBL will serve under its permit, so that OBL\u2019s operation under the permit may violate the Panama Canal Act. If there is such a violation OBL\u2019s application does not meet a major prerequisite to the issuance of a permit; i. e., that the issuance be \u201cconsistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy . . . .\u201d <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(g) (1970). In order to make a finding of consistency with the public interest, the petitioners argue, the Commission must investigate the potential violation of the Panama Canal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">We find the petitioners\u2019 argument unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">First, provided that an agency has considered all the relevant factors, \u201cAn agency\u2019s decision to refrain from an investigation ... is generally unreviewable . . . .\u201d <em>Kixmiller v. S.E.C., </em>160 U.S. App.D.C. 375, 379, 492 F.2d 641, 645 (1974). The Administrative Procedure Act exempts from judicial review agency decisions which, like this one, are \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 27; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (1970). And in considering a provision of the Interstate Commerce Act almost identical to the one at issue in this proceeding, the Supreme Court flatly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">Whether the Commission should make an investigation of a \u00a7 13a(l) discontinuance is of course within its discretion, a <em>matter which is not reviewable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-14\"><em>City of Chicago v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 162, 165, 90 S.Ct. 309, 311, 24 L.Ed.2d 340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>(1969) [emphasis supplied].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the Commission\u2019s refusal to conduct an investigation in this case is similarly unre-viewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Of course, in order to have its decision escape review, the Commission must actually exercise its discretion. If an agency simply ignores issues whose relevance to the public interest is obvious, the agency\u2019s decision may be reversed. <em>Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. F.P.C., </em>108 U.S.App.D.C. 409, 431, 283 F.2d 204, 226 (1960), <em>cert. </em>denied, 364 U.S. 913, 81 S.Ct. 276, 5 L.Ed.2d 227 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In the present case, however, the Commission did not simply ignore the Panama Canal Act, but squarely confronted it. That the Commission\u2019s treatment of this issue is somewhat cursory does not change our conclusion. We do not judge the Commission\u2019s orders like entries in an essay contest. Rather:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">If satisfied that the agency has taken a hard look at the issues with the use of reasons and standards, the court will uphold its findings, though of less than ideal clarity, if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\"><em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F.C.C., </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">In this case the Commission\u2019s path \u201cmay reasonably be discerned\u201d, although its language is convoluted. The Commission noted the number and complexity of elements required to make out a violation of the Panama Canal Act and concluded that there was no indication of their presence in this case. <em>Ohio Barge Line, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 Upper <em>Mississippi River, </em>No. W-406 (Sub-No. 11) ICC Div. 1, at p. 1 (January 27, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">We conclude that the Commission has affirmatively exercised its discretion in refusing to investigate possible violations of the Panama Canal Act. As we have noted above, such decisions are unreviewable. We hold that the Commission\u2019s refusal to conduct an investigation (either as part of the present case or during separate hearings) is not subject to review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Even if the Commission\u2019s decision were reviewable, we would be compelled to affirm as to this issue on at least two separate grounds. First, the Commission\u2019s refusal to conduct an investigation is clearly supported by the record. The record contains no evidence of any competition between OBL and the railroads owned by United States Steel (USS). There is no evidence or allegation that OBL and any USS railroad would serve common points of both origin and destination, or that there is any cargo for which OBL and any such railroad might compete. Consequently, we cannot say that the ICC abused its discretion in declining to make further inquiry into possible competition between OBL and any railroad owned by United States Steel. When, as in this case, an agency\u2019s action is supported by an adequate basis, this court must affirm even if the court might arrive at a different conclusion were it to consider the case <em>de novo. Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F.C.C., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">Finally, the petitioners raise their Panama Canal Act argument before the wrong forum. The petitioners were invited to apply to the Commission for a separate hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ing and presumably may still do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having failed to exhaust this administrative remedy, petitioners are foreclosed from obtaining relief in this court. <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">In summary, we hold that the ICC\u2019s decision not to make further inquiry into possible violations of the Panama Canal Act is neither arbitrary nor subject to review in this court, and that petitioners\u2019 remedy in any event is to apply to the ICC for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">B. FAILURE TO REOPEN THE RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We turn next to the petitioners\u2019 contention that the ICC abused its discretion in refusing to consider evidence proffered by the petitioners after the record had been closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The evidence which the\u2019 petitioners sought to introduce concerned the impact of permits granted to four barge operators in the Chicago area while this case was pending before the agency. The petitioners argue that the presence of four new common carriers will enable the common carriers as a group to provide service better than that offered by OBL. The ICC based its grant of a permit to OBL upon a finding that OBL would provide better service to United States Steel than had the common carriers (including petitioners) then serving United States Steel. Hence, the petitioners argue, the ICC should have considered the impact of the four new permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The petitioners face the heavy burden of demonstrating that the ICC abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the record. The Supreme Court directs that federal courts decline to require reopening the record \u201cexcept in the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation Company, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 296, 95 S.Ct. 438, 447, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974). The reasons for this policy are clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">\u201cAdministrative consideration of evidence . always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the administrative decision is promulgated. . . If upon the coming down of the order litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because some new circumstance has arisen . . . there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 95 S.Ct. at 446 <em>(quoting I.C.C. v. Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 514-15, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">So strong is this policy that the Supreme Court has only once remanded a case because of an agency\u2019s refusal to reopen evidentiary hearings. <em>Id., </em>419 U.S. at 295, 95 S.Ct. 438 (citing <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 248, 52 S.Ct. 146, 76 L.Ed. 273 (1932)). And the one case in which the Supreme Court did reverse (the <em>Santa Fe </em>case above) involved the setting of freight rates for grain throughout the western United States, based upon economic conditions which were drastically changed by the advent of the depression shortly after the close of the hearings. <em>United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., </em>288 U.S. 490, 492-94, 53 S.Ct. 406, 77 L.Ed. 914 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">In contrast, the Supreme Court has held that no reopening of the record will be ordered in cases which involve only a few points of origin and destination and revenue loss which, \u201cwhile substantial, is far less than that effected by the order in the Santa Fe proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 53 S.Ct. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">These pronouncements by the Supreme Court impel this court to affirm the Commission\u2019s refusal to reopen the record. Our conclusion is bolstered by the petitioners\u2019 lack of diligence. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence proffered by the petitioners concerned four permits which were granted by the ICC well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>before the record was closed in this case. The petitioners did not seek to introduce evidence concerning the permits until March of 1975, eight months after the record was closed and two months after the administrative law judge\u2019s initial decision. As the Supreme Court noted under similar circumstances, \u201c[W]e think the carriers\u2019 lack of diligence in bringing this matter to the Commission\u2019s attention deprived them of any equity to complain of the refusal of their petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 53 S.Ct. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">C. FIDELITY TO COMMISSION PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Petitioners next contend that even if the Commission did not err in refusing to hold hearings on the Panama Canal Act issue or in refusing to reopen the record, the Commission\u2019s grant of a permit to OBL is inconsistent with two sets of precedents established by Commission decisions. If the ICC has been inconsistent as alleged, then the Commission\u2019s order must be reversed as arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. F.C.C., </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 175, 454 F.2d 1018 (1971); <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F.C.C., </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 444 F.2d 841 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The Commission addressed both sets of precedents invoked by the petitioners, and explained at length why those precedents do not apply to this case. <em>See Ohio Barge Line, Inc. Extension </em>\u2014 Upper <em>Mississippi River, </em>No. W-406 (Sub-No. 11) at 17-18, 21-22 (December 20, 1974) (initial decision by administrative law judge in this case) <em>Ohio Barge Line, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 Upper <em>Mississippi River, </em>No. W-406 (Sub-No. 11) ICC Div. 1, at p. 2 (January 27, 1976) (Commission order adopting conclusions of initial decision). We see no need to reproduce the Commission\u2019s explanation; it is enough to say that we find the reasoning compelling and we therefore reject the petitioners\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">D. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">The petitioners argue finally that the Commission was not supported by the evidence in concluding that OBL would provide better service than the petitioners and that the resulting loss of revenue to petitioners would not impair their operations. We have carefully considered the record and conclude that the Commission\u2019s findings have ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Uncontroverted testimony revealed that the grant of authority to OBL would cause petitioners to lose only a tiny percentage of their revenues, and that even that loss would be made up quickly by petitioners\u2019 rapidly growing business. The Commission quite reasonably concluded that impairment of petitioners\u2019 operations would be minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">The Commission\u2019s conclusion that OBL would provide better service than the petitioners is also supported by the record. The record shows that OBL will dedicate its barges exclusively to United States Steel, will advance or delay sailing dates as requested, will offer special low rates for uninsured cargo, and will not levy demur-rage charges. Petitioners cannot match any of these advantages. Furthermore, United States Steel has experienced difficulties in obtaining barges when requested from petitioners and has frequently had to order barges it did not need in order to ensure their availability when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Testimony favorable to the petitioners reveals that they offer larger, faster tugs than OBL. In the balance, however, we conclude that the Commission was supported by substantial evidence in deciding that OBL would provide United States Steel with better service than petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">In summary, we conclude that the Commission was justified in refusing to reopen the record or to convene Panama Canal Act hearings, that the Commission did not deviate impermissibly from its own precedents, and that the Commission\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">The order of the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">\n<em>affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">.

We do not reach the petitioners\u2019 argument that they have no statutory right to apply for a separate hearing. That argument would, of course, be irrelevant if the petitioners applied for a hearing and the Commission elected to grant the application. Until the time such an application is refused by the Commission the question is not ripe for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"azn-dedup-1\">BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aty-dedup-0\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"Aus\">I concur with the majority, but add a word on the Panama Canal Act issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The Commission\u2019s brief incorrectly assumes that the dispositive issue is whether its decision not to initiate <em>sua sponte </em>a Panama Canal Act hearing is non-reviewable. In actuality, the more significant issue is whether the Commission could properly grant OBL its operating authority in light of the Panama Canal Act allegations. Section 309(g) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 909(g), provides that authority may be granted only when the Commission finds that the service to be provided will \u201cbe consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy declared in this Act.\u201d Simply stated, the Commission could not have granted the OBL authority if petitioners\u2019 evidence demonstrated that doing so would have placed OBL in violation of the Panama Canal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Petitioners claim the Commission disregarded what they characterize as a \u201cprima facie\u201d violation of the Canal Act. In fact, the Commission's order did briefly advert to their allegation of violation, stating it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvD7\">overlooks the complexity of [the Canal Act] issues including the fact that more than potential competition must exist and many factors such as service differences or prevailing rate differences may preclude a finding of competition. <em>Southern Ry.

In affirming the Commission, the majority concludes that this language indicates the Commission has \u201csquarely confronted\u201d the Panama Canal Act. Maj.Op. at-of 185 U.S.App.D.C., at 725 of 566 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Evidently, petitioners\u2019 theory is that the Canal Act is presumptively violated whenever a commonly owned railroad and barge operator service two common points.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If so, then the Commission\u2019s discussion is adequate for the authority cited clearly indicates that this theory is legally deficient. Service of two common points is necessary too, but does not by itself establish a violation. On the other hand, petitioners claim to have been denied discovery on their Panama Canal Act claim. So they may have been proceeding under a proper theory but were unable to develop the facts adequately. If so, the Commission has not articulated the basis of its decision with sufficient precision to enable this court to perform its limited review function.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">As the majority indicates, the basis of an agency decision need not be stated with ideal clarity. But it must be discernible from the agency\u2019s order; the reviewing court cannot be expected to scour the record to ascertain it. <em>Citizens Ass\u2019n of Georgetown, Inc. v. Zoning Com'n of D. C., </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 239, 477 F.2d 402, 408 (1973). However, in order to expedite resolution of this case, I have had the benefit of an unguided examination of the 2,300 page joint appendix. Having done so, I suspect that petitioners\u2019 theory was and was found to be legally deficient. I have doubts on this matter. But I can put aside those doubts and vote to affirm the Commission because petitioners are free still to petition the Commission for a full hearing on their Panama Canal Act allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>J.A. 263, exceptions of intervening protestants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\">. Although petitioners at one point moved to have OBL\u2019s authority proceeding held in abeyance until a motion for a Panama Canal Act hearing had been filed, petitioners never actually requested such a hearing. The reason for this, they now claim, is that they are not legally qualified to do so. Since both the Commission and OBL represent that petitioners are legally qualified, there is no reason to suspect that a petition for a hearing will be challenged on standing grounds. And since in its brief the Commission argues that petitioners\u2019 proper remedy is in a Panama Canal Act hearing, it evidently does not regard its decision in this proceeding as res judicata on the question of Canal Act violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b814-13\">SPOTTSWOOD W.

I agree, too, that since the Commission may permit only such water-carrier operations as are consistent with the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>policy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it may not license service that would run afoul of the Panama Canal Act unless and until it has determined that the public interest will be furthered and competition on the water route will be preserved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely to my colleagues, however, I think the Commission should be required to do just that in this very proceeding. So, while joining in the disposition made of the other issues raised on appeal, I would remand this case to the Commission for that purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Ohio Barge Line sought the authority in controversy in order to haul to and from three steel mills located in the Chicago area and owned by United States Steel Corporation, Ohio Barge Line\u2019s parent. United States Steel also controls several railroads having trackage so located that routes over which they operate likely encompass points in common with the expanded overwater service<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that Ohio Barge Line seeks to provide. No one pretends that the iron and steel traffic in which Ohio Barge Line would engage is unattractive to railroads.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If, then, the co-owned rail lines do in fact participate in parallel routings, there is a prima facie violation of the Panama Canal Act, and Ohio Barge Line can be granted the requested authority only after the Commission has made the investigation<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and findings<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that the Act requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Petitioners asked for discovery from United States Steel as to what railroads served its Chicago-area mills<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in order to ascertain whether parallel routings exist.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Their request was rejected by the administrative law judge<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and in turn by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Commission<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on the ground that issues stemming from the Panama Canal Act are not germane to Ohio Barge Line\u2019s application for operating authority. Both the judge<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the Commission<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> invited petitioners to initiate an independent proceeding centering on the Panama Canal Act questions,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and thereby to hazard such harm as the allegedly illegal conduct might inflict for as long as it takes the Commission to conclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Judge Bazelon and I concur in the view that exclusion of those issues from the then-pending proceeding was erroneous. But both of my colleagues would relegate petitioners to a separate proceeding if the issues are to be litigated at all. That position derives in large measure from the Commission\u2019s claim that \u201cmany factors such as service differences or prevailing rate differences may preclude a finding of competition\u201d under the Panama Canal Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This assertion, however, is not borne out either by the Commission\u2019s own precedents<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or, so far as the record reveals, by the facts of this case. Indeed, accompanying as it does the Commission\u2019s untenable limitation on the scope of the ongoing proceeding, it hardly appeals as a particularly well-conceived attempt at justification. I would remand this case to the Commission so that it may either give the Panama Canal Act issues the consideration they deserve or demonstrate that such consideration lay behind its cryptic catalogue of circumstances that \u201cmay preclude a finding of competition.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-16\">.

And, like Judge Bazelon, I have no difficulty in concluding that the Commission\u2019s action in this regard is judicially reviewable. I realize that the courts have no role when an agency possesses and has appropriately exercised a discretion as to whether a particular inquiry will be conducted, but there is no occasion to consider whether the Commission\u2019s authority to <em>sua sponte </em>investigate Panama Canal Act questions falls within that realm.
