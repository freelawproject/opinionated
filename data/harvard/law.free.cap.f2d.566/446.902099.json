We hold that, because review is in the court of appeals, the judgment of the district court dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is affirmed. \u25a0 In Nos.: 76-1474 and 76-2057, treated in an accompanying opinion, we deal with further threshold issues pertaining to the scope of EPA\u2019s \u00a7 316(b) regulations, and whether proper procedures were employed in their adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Section 316(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), requires that \u201c[a]ny standard es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tablished pursuant to \u00a7 301<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or \u00a7 306<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of this Act and applicable to a point source<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\u201d [footnotes added]. The regulations in question, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.-10-402.12, essentially provide, in determining whether the best available technology is employed in the manner required by \u00a7 316(b), that \u201c[t]he information contained in the Development Document shall be considered.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Fifty-eight electric utility companies (the utilities) filed a timely petition in this court for review of the above regulations, in accordance with \u00a7 509(b) of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon consideration of the Development Document referred to in \u00a7 402.12, however, petitioners state they became convinced that jurisdiction properly resided in the district court. Accordingly, they filed a motion suggesting lack of jurisdiction in this court, and asked us to rule on our jurisdiction in advance of briefing on the merits. At the same time, petitions for review of the regulations were filed by the same utilities in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. It is from the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">A number of courts have already undertaken in some detail to chart a course through the rather complex, and often confusing,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> language of the 1972 amendments to the Water Pollution Control Act. See, e. g., <em>E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Train, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>430 U.S. 112, 97 S.Ct. 965, 51 L.Ed.2d 204 (1977); <em>American Frozen Food Institute v. Train, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 539 F.2d 107 (1976). We will attempt to limit our duplication of those efforts. The logical starting point for our inquiry is \u00a7 509(b)(1)(E), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(E), which provides that \u201c[rjeview of the Administrator\u2019s action . (E) in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 301, 302, or 306\u201d may be had in the United States Courts of Appeals. Since EPA relies on \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 306, in addition to \u00a7 316(b), as authority for the challenged regulations,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the question at this point is whether the regulations constitute \u201ceffluent limitation[s] or other limitation[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 509(b)(1)(E). See <em>du Pont, </em>supra, <em>American Petroleum Institute v. Train, </em>526 F.2d 1343 (10th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">No contention is raised that the \u00a7 316(b) regulations are themselves effluent limitations. It is obvious that they are not, for the statute defines \u201ceffluent limitation\u201d as \u201cany restriction established by a State or the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters . . ..\u201d \u00a7 502(H).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The regulations involved here are concerned with structures used to withdraw water for cooling purposes, not with discharges of pollutants into the water. The question remains, thus, what are \u201cother limitation[s]\u201d under \u00a7 509(b)(1)(E), and do the questioned regulations fall within them.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The legislative history reveals that the phrase \u201cother limitation\u201d was adopted from file original House version of the Act. H. R. Rep. No. 92-911, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972). It did not appear in the Senate bill. S-2770, Leg. Hist. Vol. 2, p. 1712. While no guidance is given as to the content of the phrase, we cannot assume that its inclusion was meaningless or inadvertent; other provisions from the same section relating to judicial review in the House bill do not appear in the statute as finally enacted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The utilities\u2019 arguments against construing the \u00a7 316(b) regulations as \u201cother limitation[s]\u201d are twofold, and will be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">First, it is contended that the regulations are not actually limitations until, in the words of \u00a7 316(b), they are \u201cstandards established pursuant to section 301 or section 306 of this Act and applicable to a point source.\u201d The utilities claim that, while the regulations are presumptively applicable to individual point sources, the presumption may be rebutted, on a case-by-case basis, in \u00a7 402<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> permit proceedings. It is therefore argued that a limitation under \u00a7 301 or \u00a7 306 cannot be deemed applicable prior to its adoption in an individual permit proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The above reasoning in part proceeds from a premise that we think has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>du Pont </em>decision. The Court made clear that standards of performance for new point sources under \u00a7 306 are not merely presumptively applicable; rather, they are binding on the permit issuing authority. 430 U.S. at 137, 97 S.Ct. 965. Even with respect to limitations on existing point sources, however, for which variance proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>dures do exist,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the utilities\u2019 reasoning cannot, in our opinion, be reconciled with the <em>du Pont </em>decision. In that case, the Court considered effluent limitations for existing point sources issued under \u00a7 301, and standards of performance for new sources under \u00a7 306. The effluent limitations for existing point sources, though only presumptively applicable, were nevertheless held to be reviewable in the court of appeals under \u00a7 509(b)(1)(E). The challenged regulations in the present case were issued under \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 306, as well as \u00a7 316(b), and though in part they may only be presumptively applicable, that does not distinguish them from the effluent limitations considered in <em>du Pont </em>for jurisdictional purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Secondly, the utilities contend that the regulations do not constitute limitations in any sense, but are merely intended to provide guidance to the permit issuer. They point to the absence in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.10-402.12 of specific numerical limitations or standards for individual point sources or classes of sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Notwithstanding that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.12 does not impose specific structural or locational requirements upon cooling water intake structures, we find the utilities\u2019 argument unconvincing both as a matter of statutory construction and from the standpoint of policies influencing judicial review. In the first place, the regulation is mandatory in terms that it requires certain information to be considered in determining the best available technology for intake structures. This in itself is a limitation on point sources and permit issuers, for we construe that term as a restriction on the untrammeled discretion of the industry which was the condition prior to the passage of the statute. The same term, \u201crestriction,\u201d we find in the statutory definition of effluent limitation, \u00a7 502(11). In <em>American Iron and Steel Institute v. EPA, </em>543 F.2d 521 (3d Cir. 1976), the court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review net-gross regulations, which may permit a point source to discharge more pollutants than effluent limitations would otherwise allow, if there are pollutants in the intake water. The court noted that the regulations \u201cneither prescribe specific number limitations for any pollutant, nor do they list the factors which must be considered in determining the control measures which individual point sources must employ.\u201d 543 F.2d at 527. In contrast, the \u00a7 316(b) regulations here do refer to information that must be considered in determining the type of intake structures that individual point sources may employ, and, by that token, they are limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Moreover, \u00a7 316(b) itself seems to indicate its limitations are to be adopted under \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 306. It. states that, \u201cany standard established pursuant to section 301 or 306 . . . shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\u201d If a limitation other than an effluent limitation can exist under \u00a7 301 or \u00a7 306, which we must assume it can, we think a regulation implementing the requirements of \u00a7 316(b) must qualify as an \u201cother limitation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 509(b)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Finally, the regulations issued under \u00a7 316(b) are so closely related to the effluent limitations and new source standards of performance of \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 306 that we think it would be anomalous to have their review bifurcated between different courts. Cf. <em>du Pont, </em>supra, at 136. It bears emphasis that \u00a7 316(b), which the regulations under consideration here implement, requires \u00a7 301 and \u00a7 306 standards to deal with cooling water intake structures. Just as this court<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court in <em>du Pont </em>indicated the lack of statutory justification for bifurcating review of new source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>and existing source standards under the Act, there is no convincing reason to do so here with respect to regulations issued at least in part under the same statutory sections, some of which limit intake structures, others, effluent discharges.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We think this result is consistent with the jurisdictional scheme of the Act, which in general leaves review of standards of nationwide applicability to the courts of appeals, thus furthering the aim of Congress to achieve nationally uniform standards. See <em>American Frozen Foods, </em>supra, at 118-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that jurisdiction to review these regulations properly lies in the court of appeals rather than the district court. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">.

Subsection (b) goes on to require the achievement of effluent limitations for existing point sources in two stages: a 1977 stage requiring application of the best practicable technology currently available, and a 1983 stage requiring application of a generally more strin- \u25a0 gent standard of the best available technology economically achievable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. Section 306, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316, basically deals with new point sources, those whose construction is commenced after regulations are published establishing standards of performance to which they must conform. The section directs the Administrator to publish within 90 days of enactment a list of categories of point sources that discharge pollutants, and within one year thereafter, to publish regulations establishing federal standards of performance for new sources within each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u201cStandard of performance\u201d is defined by \u00a7 306(a)(1) as \u201ca standard for the control of the discharge of pollutants which reflects the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best available technology . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">. \u201cPoint Source\u201d is defined by \u00a7 502(14), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14), as \u201cany discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or m^y be discharged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b534-15\">. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.12 provides in full: \u201cThe information contained in the Development Document shall be considered in determining whether the location, design, construction and capacity of a cooling water intake structure of a point source subject to standards established under section 301 or 306 reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\u201d The remainder of the regulations, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.10 and 402.11 contain a statement of scope and certain definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">The Development Document is a 263 page work issued by EPA entitled \u201cDevelopment Document for Best Technology Available for the Location, Design, Construction and Capacity of Cooling Water Intake Structures for Minimizing Adverse Environmental Impact.\u201d It largely consists of information of a technical nature, as the title suggests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b534-17\">.

This 90-day period has been construed as a statute of limitations, considering \u00a7 509(b)(1)(F), barring review after its expiration in <em>Sun Enterprises, Ltd., </em>v. <em>Train, </em>532 F.2d 280 (2d Cir. 1976), and even jurisdictional, considering \u00a7 509(b)(1)(D), in <em>Peabody Coal Co. v.

Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>du Pont </em>holding, much litigation, and a split in the circuits, had arisen over whether \u00a7 301 was an independent source of authority for the issuance of regulations establishing limitations on point sources. This was because the section states that certain effluent limitations \u201cshall be achieved,\u201d but does not clearly state who is to issue them and at what stage in the proceedings. <em>du Pont </em>resolved the conflict in favor of EPA authority to issue generally applicable limitations by regulation under \u00a7 301.
