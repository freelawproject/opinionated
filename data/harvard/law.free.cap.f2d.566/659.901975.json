The district court determined that Title'-VII does not embrace transsex-ual \u2014 discriminaficmr AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">Holloway was first employed by Arthur Andersen in 1969 and was then known as Robert f\u00edojloway. In 1970, appellant began to receive female hormone treatments. In February of 1974, appellant was promoted to the position of Head Multilith Operator. At this time, appellant informed Marion D. Passard, her supervisor, that appellant was undergoing treatment in preparation for anatomical sex change surgery. In June of 1974, during 'a\u00f1fraal 'review, an official of the company suggested that appellant would be happier at a,.new-4eb-where-dier transsexualism would be unknown. However, Holloway was still given a pay raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">In November, 1974, at her request, Holloway\u2019s records were changed to reflect her present first name. Shortly thereafter, on November 18,1974, Holloway was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Holloway filed a complaint alleging that she was fired for her transsexuality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging\u201d jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a.claim. Holloway then filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. On April 5, 1976, after a hearing on both motions, the district court issued a memorandum decision which held that tr\u00e1nssexualism was not encompassed within the;7tefimtlon''of~^s\u00e9x\u201das thetemrappears in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Therefore, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction, so that judgment issued in defendant\u2019s favor. Holloway timely filed a motion to amend the judgment, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-19\">It is clear from the record that the district court did not reach the merits of Holloway\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the .sole issue before us is whether an employee may be discharged, consistent with Title VII, for initiating the process of sex transformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-20\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-21\">(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axe-dedup-0\">(1) . . . to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, .terms, conditions, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . sex <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Appellant contends that \u201csex\u201d as used above is anonymous with \u201cgender,\u201d and gender would encompass transsexuals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee claims that the term sex should be given the traditional definition based on anatomical characteristics.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">There is a dearth of legislative history on Section 2000e-2(a)(1), which was enacted as \u00a7 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, P.L. 88-352. The major concern of Congress at the time the Act was promulgated was race discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sex as a basis of discrimination was added as a floor amendment one day before the House approved Title VII, without prior hearing or debate. <em>Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Co., </em>507 F.2d 1084, 1090 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Employment <em>Discrimination and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, </em>84 Harv.L.Rev. 1109, 1167 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">The 1972 Amendments to Title VII in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 left the language of \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) unchanged, but the clear intent of the 1972 legislation was to remedy the economic deprivation of women as a class. 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2137, 2140-2141. The cases interpreting Title VII sex discrimination provisions agree that they were intended to place women on an equal footing with men. See <em>Baker v. California Land Title Company, </em>507 F.2d 895, 896 n.2 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1046, 95 S.Ct. 2664, 45 L.Ed.2d 699 (1975); <em>Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Company, </em>444 F.2d 1219, 1225 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Giving the statute its plain meaning, this court concludes that Congress had only the traditional notions of \u201csex\u201d in mind. Later legislative activity makes this narrow definition even more evident. Several bills have been introduced to <em>amend </em>the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against \u201csexual preference.\u201d \u25a0 None have been enacted into law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Congress has not shown any intent other than to restrict the term \u201csex\u201d to its traditional meaning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, this court will not expand Title VII\u2019s application in the absence of Congressional mandate. The manifest purpose of Title VII\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination in employment is to ensure that men and women are treated equally, absent a bona fide relationship between the qualifications for the job and the person\u2019s sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S.Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The Constitution contains no specific equal protection guarantee against the federal government; but the substance of such a guarantee has been implied in the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Appellant contends that had Congress chosen to expressly exclude transsexuals from the coverage of Title VII, there woujd be a violation of equal protection. Appellant further claims that a restrictive interpretation of the language of Title VII acts to exclude transsexuals as a class and \u201cat the very least necessarily\u201d raises equal protection problems. Therefore, argues appellant, because the narrow interpretation of the language of Title VII raises such equal protection issues, we must follow the \u201ccardinal principle\u201d of statutory construction as expressed by Justice Brandeis in <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936). That principle is that one must construe statutes so that constitutional questions may be avoided if at all possible. Therefore, the proper construction of Title VII, according to appellant, is that transsexuals are protected, thus avoiding all possible equal protection problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">Assuming briefly that appellant has properly raised an equal protection argument, we find no merit to it. Normally, any rational classification or discrimination is presumed valid.' That is, a statute is constitutional if the classification or discrimination it contains has some rational relationship to a legitimate government interest, unless the statute is based upon an inherently suspect classification, in which case the statute requires close judicial scrutiny. <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 371-72, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">This court cannot conclude that transsexuals are a suspect class. Examining the traditional indicia of suspect classification, we find that transsexuals are not necessarily a \u201cdiscrete and insular minority,\u201d <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 372, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971); nor has it been established that transsexuality is an \u201cimmutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth\u201d like race or national origin. <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 686, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1770, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). Furthermore, the complexities involved merely in defining the term \u201ctranssexual\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would prohibit a determination of suspect classification for transsexuals. Thus, the rational relationship test is the standard to apply. In applying this standard to this statute, it can be said without question that the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>of employment discrimination between males and females and on the basis of race, religion or national origin is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">An equal protection argument is clearly not appropriate here, however. Pursuant to this court\u2019s construction, Title VII remedies are equally available to all individuals for employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or national origin. Indeed, consistent with the determination of this court, transsexuals claiming discrimination because of their sex, male or female, would clearly state a cause of action under Title VII. Holloway has not claimed to have treated discriminatorily because she is male or female, but rather because she is a transsexual who chose to change her sex. This type of claim is not actionable under Title VII and is certainly not in violation of the doctrines of Due Process and Equal Protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">A transsexual individual\u2019s decision to undergo sex change surgery does not bring that individual, nor transsexuals as a class, within the scope of Title VII. This court refuses to extend the coverage of Title VII to situations that Congress clearly did not contemplate. Therefore, the judgment of the district court dismissing Holloway\u2019s action for failure to state a claim is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-16\">. Ms. Passard\u2019s affidavit detailed many of the personnel problems created by appellant\u2019s transitional appearance (red lipstick and nail polish, hairstyle, jewelry and clothing), his use of the men\u2019s room and his behavior at social functions. We note that the district court failed to consider the facts when making its determination, even though Ms. Passard stated that Holloway was not terminated because of transsexualism, \u201cbut because the dress, appearance and manner he was affecting were such that it was very disruptive and embarrassing to all concerned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-24\">. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\">. Holloway defines transsexual to be a condition where \u201cgender reversal ... is present as soon as any behavior that can be called masculinity or femininity begins, even,as early as one year of age,\u201d or as including those \u201cpersons not readily classifiable as male or female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">However, there is no generally accepted definition of the term transsexual. Psychiatric judgments about male-to-female transsexuals have varied from the opinion that a request for a sex change is a sign of severe psychopathology to the opinion that these persons are psychologically normal but misclassified as to gender so that any psychological condition is the direct result of physical misclassification. These views reflect the many different opinions on the origin and development of transsexualism. Some feel that transsexual identification arises from psychosocial learning and others feel that the condition comes from inherited or genetic causes.

Three such bills were presented to the 94th Congress: HR 5452, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975); HR 166, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975) and HR 2667, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975). Seven have been presented to the 95th Congress: HR 451, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977); HR-2998, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977); HR 4794, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977); HR 5239, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.

(1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-17\">One court has found that Title VII does not protect homosexuals. In <em>Smith v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>395 F.Supp. 1098 (N.D.Ga.1975), the court concluded that Title VII does not currently encompass discrimination against homosexuals and refused to extend the scope of the Act: \u201cWhether or not the Congress should, by law, forbid discrimination based upon \u2018affec-tional or sexual preference\u2019 of an applicant, it is clear that Congress has not done so. The Civil Rights Act is not just the \u2018starting point\u2019 for this Court\u2019s extension of limitations upon employers; it is both the starting point and the ending point.\u201d 395 F.Supp. at 1101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">. The few transsexual cases also support a restricted view of Title VII. The district court in <em>Voyles v. Ralph K. Davies Medical Center, </em>403 F.Supp. 456 (N.D.Cal.1975), reached the same conclusion as the court below, but <em>Voyles </em>is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. In <em>Grossman v. Bernards Township Board of Education, </em>[1975] 11 E.P.D. (CCH) \u00b6 10,686 (D.N.J. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>538 F.2d 319 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 897, 97 S.Ct. 261, 50 L.Ed.2d 181 (1976), the plaintiff, a schoolteacher, had sex change surgery and thereafter lost her job. Though plaintiff was clearly considered to be a female after surgery, the trial court, restricting sex to its \u201cplain meaning,\u201d found no sex discrimination. The court instead concluded that plaintiff was not terminated because she was a woman, but because she had changed her sex. 11 E.P.D. \u00b6 10,686 at pp. 6884-6885.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Ay8U\">. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b750-7\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8d\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">While I agree with the majority in the belief that Congress probably never contemplated that Title VII would apply to transsexuals, I dissent from the decision that the statute affords such plaintiffs no benefit. I would not limit the right to claim discrimination to those who were born into the victim class.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The only issue before us is whether a transsexual whose condition has not yet become stationary can state a claim under the statute if discharged because of her undertaking to change her sex. I read from the language of the statute itself that she can.</p>\n<p id=\"AZt\">This is not a \u201csexual preference\u201d case; this is a case of a person completing surgically that part of nature\u2019s handiwork which apparently was left incomplete somewhere along the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">By its language, the statute proscribes discrimination among employees because of their sex. When a transsexual completes his or her transition from one sexual identity to another, that person will have a sexual classification. Assuming that this plaintiff has now undergone her planned surgery, she is, presumably, female, at least for most social purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">This plaintiff alleges that she was discharged from employment while she was in the process of assuming her new sexual identity. Had the employer waited and discharged the plaintiff as a postsurgical female because she had changed her sex, I suggest that the discharge would have to be classified as one based upon sex. I fail to see any valid Title VII purpose to be served by holding that a discharge while an employee is in surgery, or a few days before surgery, is not as much a discharge by reason of sex as a discharge a few days after surgery. The result is the same, whenever the employer sends the discharge notice. Plaintiff alleges that she was fired for being (or becoming) female under circumstances that allegedly disturbed her fellow workers and therefore motivated her employer to terminate her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">It seems to me irrelevant under Title VII whether the plaintiff was born female or was born ambiguous and chose to become female. The relevant fact is that she was, on the day she was fired, a purported female. She says she was fired for having become female under controversial circumstances. The employer says these circumstances are disconcerting to other employees. That may or may not be true. Plaintiff says that how she became female is not her employer\u2019s business. That may or may not be true. Those are questions that ought to be answered in court, in a trial; they should not be precluded by summary judgment or Rule 12 dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>If the plaintiff is, as the majority holds, claiming only that she was discharged for undertaking a course of medical treatment to achieve a future sex change and is not claiming that she was discharged for becoming a female, then she should be allowed to amend her pleading to conform to the evidence that ordinarily would be developed in pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Because I believe the plaintiff is entitled to win or lose on her statutory claim, I would not discuss the alleged constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">I would vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
