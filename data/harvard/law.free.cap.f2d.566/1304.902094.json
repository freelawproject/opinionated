Without objection from defendant, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard defendant\u2019s alleged reason for possessing the weapon. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Finding no plain error in the court\u2019s instruction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">In deciding this case we must look at the facts in the light most favorable to defendant, since defendant is entitled to jury instructions relating to a theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence. <em>United States v. Young, </em>464 F.2d 160, 164 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Perez v. United States, </em>297 F.2d 12, 15-16 (5th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-17\">Defendant shared a house with Willie Joe Martin and Isaiah Jones. On the morning of December 28, 1976, after a night of heavy drinking, the three men arose and began drinking again. On this occasion the men were joined by William \u201cCountry\u201d Hawkins, who' was a frequent early-morning visitor to the house. According to defendant\u2019s trial testimony, the conversation between the men became heated, and defendant insisted that Hawkins leave. Hawkins resisted, and when defendant attempted to assist him out, Hawkins cut defendant on the nose with a pocketknife. Defendant retrieved an unloaded shotgun from Jones\u2019 bedroom and ran across the street, where he waited until Hawkins came out of the house and drove away. Defendant reentered the house, but did not call the police, although he maintains that he was afraid Hawkins would return. A short while later, two police officers, who had been summoned by Jones without defendant\u2019s knowledge, apprehended defendant in the bathroom with the weapon still in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">At the close of the trial the district court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime without objection from defendant. During the course of its deliberations, the jury sent to the trial judge a written note which read: \u201cWe all agree that the defendant had the weapon in his hands. This was stated in the defendant\u2019s testimony. Are we to take into account the reason for possession?\u201d The trial judge responded simply, \u201cNo.\u201d Defendant did not object to the court\u2019s response at the time it was made, nor did he ask for a more detailed answer. His task on appeal, therefore, is to convince this Court that the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>response amounted to plain error. Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>468 F.2d 828 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 983, 93 S.Ct. 1501, 36 L.Ed.2d 178 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">As defendant correctly points out, and as the trial judge charged the jury, the possession prohibited under \u00a7 5861(d) must be \u201cknowing.\u201d Defendant contends that \u201cknowing\u201d possession means possession not justified by some innocent reason. In effect, defendant\u2019s interpretation would require the Government to prove, as an element of the offense under \u00a7 5861(d), not only that defendant willfully possessed the weapon, but that he had no good reason to justify his possession. The plain reading of the statute and the decided cases are to the contrary. The Government need only show that defendant willfully and consciously possessed an item which he knew to be a firearm. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>476 F.2d 730, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 836, 94 S.Ct. 181, 38 L.Ed.2d 72 (1973); <em>Sipes v. United States, </em>321 F.2d 174, 179 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 913, 84 S.Ct. 208, 11 L.Ed.2d 150 (1963); <em>see United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">The question then is whether defendant can assert an innocent reason for knowing possession as a defense to the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the facts of this case, as stated by defendant, do not demonstrate a legal defense to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">Section 5861(d) makes it unlawful \u201cto receive or possess\u201d an unregistered firearm. The statute is written in absolute terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That possession is momentary is immaterial. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>462 F.2d 122 (6th Cir. 1972). In the instant case defendant states he purposely obtained the gun and ran out of the house in an effort to protect himself from Hawkins. From a position of safety across the street, he watched Hawkins come out of the house, get in his car, and drive away. Yet, by defendant\u2019s own admission, when he reentered the house, he continued to hold the gun in his hands and \u201cjust [walk] around with it.\u201d Indeed, defendant admitted possessing the gun for up to 30 minutes and apparently would have possessed it indefinitely had the police not arrived. Under these circumstances, the statute does not permit a defense theory that the receipt and possession of the gun could be legally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">The Government argues that criminal liability under \u00a7 5861(d) is absolute for those receiving or possessing illegal firearms regardless of how innocent or exigent the circumstances. We need not decide now whether a defendant may ever <em>in defense </em>allege some justification based on the circumstances attending his illegal possession of an unregistered firearm. No such defense was available to defendant under the facts of this case. The trial court in this case was therefore correct in advising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>jury that it could not take into consideration the reasons for defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">. Section 5861(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmC\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person . . . (d) to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\u201d \u201cFirearm\u201d is defined under the Act to include \u201ca shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5845(a).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">. This case was orally argued at the same time as <em>United States v. Hammons, </em>566 F.2d 1301 (5th Cir. 1977), No. 77-5262. The statute there prohibited a felon from receiving a firearm. Defendant Hammons, a convicted felon, maintained that he had taken a firearm from one Bridges in order to prevent Bridges from harming a third person. A jury convicted Hammons under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(h), which in absolute terms forbids a convicted felon \u201cto receive any firearm . . . which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d On appeal Hammons contended that the jury should have been allowed to consider the circumstances attending his receipt of the firearm. This Court affirmed Hammons\u2019 conviction, finding no foundation in the evidence for a defense of legal justification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">. We note parenthetically that \u00a7 5861 was originally enacted as \u00a7 5851, which in pertinent part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-11\">It shall be unlawful for any person . to possess any firearm which has not been registered as required by section 5841. Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of such firearm, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">The last clause of the prior statute is conspicuously absent from \u00a7 5861.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
