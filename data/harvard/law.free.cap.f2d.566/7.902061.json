Jameson, Senior District Judge for the District of Montana, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b93-20\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">Plaintiff appeals from a summary judgment that his claims of employment-related racial harassment were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. We reverse that judgment with respect to claims based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and affirm it with respect to claims based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>Only the \u00a7 1981 claims are dealt with in this opinion. The remaining issues are disposed of by an unpublished order [see table 566 F.2d 1176].</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">Plaintiff has been employed in various positions with the defendant Caterpillar Tractor Company since 1949. In October 1975 he brought this action against Caterpillar and his union, defendant United Auto Workers Local 974. In his amended complaint he alleges racial discrimination generally and several specific incidents of discrimination. After plaintiff\u2019s deposition had been taken, both defendants moved for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed an affidavit in opposition. Defendants submitted no affidavits in response, but relied solely on plaintiff\u2019s deposition and affidavit in asserting their statutes of limitations defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-23\">When the District Court ruled on the timeliness of plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims, the law of the circuit was that such claims were subject to the state statute of limitations which would govern the most analogous state cause of action. See <em>Jones v. Jones, </em>410 F.2d 365, 366-367 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. <em>denied, </em>396 U.S. 1013, 90 S.Ct. 547, 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>L.Ed.2d 505 (1970). The District Court viewed the allegation here as akin to the personal tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and accordingly held that plaintiff\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 were barred by the Illinois two-year statute of limitations. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 83, \u00a7 15 (1975). Although this ruling was correct when made, it must now be reversed because of this court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Beard v. Robinson, </em>563 F.2d 331 (7th Cir. 1977). <em>Beard </em>overruled <em>Jones </em>and held that henceforth the Illinois general five-year statute of limitations, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 83, \u00a7 16 (1975), would apply to all \u201cstatutory claims brought under the Civil Rights Acts.\u201d <em>Beard v. Robinson, supra, </em>563 F.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The fact that <em>Beard </em>arose under \u00a7 1983 does not distinguish it. The reasoning of the <em>Beard </em>opinion, which was that analogizing the facts of a statutory Civil Rights Act claim to a common law cause of action fails to recognize significant and fundamental differences between the two, 563 F.2d at 336-337, applies equally to a \u00a7 1981 claim. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 460-461, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975); <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 422-435, 441 n.78, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968). We note also that the court in <em>Beard </em>was aware of and cited <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), which affirmed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s application of Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations for all personal injuries to \u00a7 1981 claims. <em>Beard, supra, </em>563 F.2d at 337. The Court in <em>Runyon </em>said that it was \u201cnot disposed to displace the considered judgment of the Court of Appeals on an issue whose resolution [was] so heavily contingent upon an analysis of state law . . . <em>Runyon v. McCrary, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 181, 96 S.Ct. at 2599.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In light of <em>Beard </em>this action, which was filed on October 3, 1975, was timely as to \u00a7 1981 claims arising after October 3, 1970. We accordingly reverse and remand for trial of those claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
