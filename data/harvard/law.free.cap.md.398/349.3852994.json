We hold that the court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motion because the police did not have an articulable reasonable suspicion to stop Lewis based upon the fact that he \u201calmost\u201d hit the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">On April 27, 2005,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at approximately 10:45 p.m., Sergeant Jeffery Jocuns, Detective Anthony Vaith, and Officer Tisha Anderson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Baltimore City Police Department were in a marked police cruiser near the intersection of Oswego Avenue and Park Heights Avenue in Baltimore City, an area described as an \u201copen air drug market,\u201d and \u201cknown for violent crime and drug distribution activity.\u201d Sergeant Jocuns accompanied Detective Vaith and Officer Campbell while they were looking for a rape suspect described in a \u201cflyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Detective Vaith, the driver, and Sergeant Jocuns, the passenger in the front seat, observed a tan sports utility vehicle parked on the side of the road, which was occupied by two individuals: a man in the driver\u2019s seat, later identified as Lewis, and a woman in the front passenger\u2019s seat, subsequently identified as Ms. Parksdale. According to the officers, Lewis and Ms. Parksdale started acting nervously, abruptly pushing their hands down under the vehicle\u2019s console. Sergeant Jocuns testified that he immediately thought about the flyer and was concerned that a rape could be in progress. According to Sergeant Jocuns, the officers then proceeded past Lewis\u2019s vehicle, and stopped the police cruiser \u201cin the street ... not at the curb,\u201d \u201ca little bit in front of the SUV.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Detective Vaith, the driver, recounted the events that transpired thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">[W]e pulled down a little bit farther. I didn\u2019t want to stop the vehicle directly next to the defendant\u2019s vehicle because I didn\u2019t know if there was a weapon and I didn\u2019t want to put myself or anyone else in the vehicle in harms way. So I pulled down. At that point the defendant activated his turn signal and started to pull out into the street nearly striking the back of my vehicle. That was\u2014at that point that\u2019s when Sergeant Jocuns said \u201c[H]e almost hit your vehicle what\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d So I pulled to the side and parked and got out as well as Sergeant Jocuns. We both approached the vehicle. Sergeant Jocuns advised that he observed the defendant still making movements in the console area. At that point for officer safety Sergeant Jocuns requested the defendant to exit the vehicle. When he did so a cell phone and a plastic bag fell to the ground. My attention was diverted at that point. Because at that point the vehicle was not placed in gear and it started to drift down the street. I ran and jumped in the vehicle. Put the brakes on it. Put the car in park. Sergeant Jocuns was dealing with the defendant at that point. I walked around the other side of the vehicle and requested that the passenger exit the vehicle. And then that\u2019s when I was notified by Sergeant Jocuns that there was marijuana in the vehicle\u2014 or it came out of the vehicle when the driver exited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">I went back to the vehicle to see if there was anything in the general area that I observed the defendant making movements at, which was a console area. And there was between the passenger side seat and the center console was a marijuana cigarette. I recovered that. There was no other items found in the vehicle. When I returned back to the area where the defendant\u2014Ms. Parksdale was I began to explain the situation that there was marijuana found falling from the defendant as he exited the vehicle. And then there was marijuana found in the passenger side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>vehicle. And that\u2019s when the defendant had said everything in the vehicle was his. She didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. And explained on several occasions that it was all his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">This testimony, thus, reflects that after seeing the two individuals in a car parked on Oswego Avenue, the officers drove the police cruiser slowly by Lewis\u2019s SUV and stopped the police cruiser while in the street just in front of the SUV. At that point, Lewis activated his left turn signal and started to pull his vehicle into the street, almost striking the back of the police cruiser. Lewis thereupon stopped his vehicle, and Detective Vaith pulled to the side of the street and parked the police cruiser fifteen to twenty feet in front of the SUV. Detective Vaith and Sergeant Jocuns both got out, and Sergeant Jocuns requested that Lewis get out of the vehicle after he and the Detective observed more movements in the console area. When Lewis stepped out, a plastic bag containing marijuana fell to the ground, and the SUV, driverless, drifted approximately twenty feet down Oswego Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Lewis was subsequently charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, marijuana, in violation of Section 5-601(c)(2) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to trial, Lewis</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>filed a motion to suppress the marijuana that was seized from him, as well as the subsequent statements. During the hearing on the motion, only Sergeant Jocuns and Detective Vaith testified.. Following this testimony, the State argued that the incident with Lewis was equivalent to an investigatory traffic stop because the officers had the right to stop Lewis when his SUV \u201calmost\u201d hit the police cruiser when Lewis pulled away from the curb. The State also asserted that it was appropriate for officer safety for Sergeant Jocuns to ask Lewis to get out of the SUV. Additionally, the State postured that the plastic bag of marijuana provided the officers with probable cause to arrest Lewis and, therefore, the subsequent search of his vehicle qualified as a search incident to an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Conversely, Lewis\u2019s counsel argued that the fact that Lewis put on his turn signal, looked at the officers, and then pulled into the street \u201calmost\u201d hitting the police car did not provide reasonable articulable suspicion to effectuate a stop because there was no traffic infraction. His counsel also asserted that Lewis was not issued any traffic citation, reflecting that he broke no law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the Judge granted the suppression motion as to the evidence of the discarded marijuana cigarette and Lewis\u2019s statements of ownership,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but denied the motion as to the plastic bag of marijuana that fell from the vehicle when Lewis got out of the SUV; the judge, in so doing, ruled that the officers had a reasonable suspicion to stop Lewis because he \u201calmost\u201d hit the police car:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>I find from the evidence that the police officers were cruising in northwest Baltimore in the vicinity of Park Heights Avenue and Oswego Avenue. When they made a turn into Oswego and saw a vehicle being operated by the defendant, which was stopped or parked. And they saw some hand motions, which gave them some suspicion. I won\u2019t call it reasonable suspicion. I\u2019ll call it a hunch. There was utterly no evidence whatsoever or no reason to think there was any possible attempted rape going on. And, but for one fact I would rule that the police officer had no right to ask the defendant to come out of the car. However, once the car moved forward, which it had a right to do and according to\u2014well, I\u2019m going to Officer Vaith\u2014he said\u2014one of them said what\u2019s wrong with this guy, what\u2019s he up to. Almost hitting the police car. Saying what\u2019s this guy doing. It was Officer Vaith\u2019s testimony. They had a right to investigate for purposes of a traffic stop. Now, before then I would say they did not have articulable suspicion based on same hand movement. The most troubling part for is does he have a right to ask the defendant to get out of the car. Okay. A high crime area. We know that some people do have weapons. They do have guns. We know that police officers have been killed made traffic stops by people who had guns. I don\u2019t remember the year, but there was a State Trooper, his I believe was Wolf, I think recently the defendant or one of the defendant\u2019s in this case was denied post-conviction relief. Not to the fact that case has anything to do with this other than would it be appropriate for officer safety to ask him to get out of the car? I say, yes. Now, but with the fact that according to the testimony the marijuana just rolled out\u2014it just fell out at that point in time. Asking him to get out for the investigative purpose in my view at that juncture was not a seizure. When the drugs rolled out there was reason to believe that a crime had been committed. Possession of a controlled dangerous substance, marijuana. Cause the reason I stated I\u2019m not granting the motion to suppress that marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Lewis was subsequently convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, marijuana, and sentenced to one year imprisonment. Lewis noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and subsequently this Court issued, on its own initiative, a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>396 Md. 11, 912 A.2d 647 (2006). Lewis\u2019s brief presents the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">Did the trial court err in denying Appellant\u2019s .motion to suppress the marijuana?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We hold that the trial court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana because the police did not have justification to conduct the investigatory traffic stop based upon the fact that Lewis \u201calmost\u201d hit the police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we ordinarily consider only the information contained in the record of the suppression hearing, and not the trial record. <em>Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 345, 885 A.2d 785, 791 (2005); <em>State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 581, 861 A.2d 62, 67 (2004); <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 533, 842 A.2d 773, 779 (2004); <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 607, 826 A.2d 486, 493 (2003); <em>State v.

State, </em>367 Md. 447, 457, 788 A.2d 646, 651 (2002): Further, we view the \u00e9vidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Whiting, </em>389 Md. at 345, 885 A.2d at 791; <em>Nieves, </em>383 Md. at 581, 861 A.2d at 67; <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533, 842 A.2d at 779; <em>Green, </em>375 Md. at 607, 826 A.2d at 493; <em>Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 207, 821 A.2d at 444; <em>Carter, </em>367 Md. at 457, 788 A.2d at 651. \u201cAlthough we extend great deference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we review, independently the application of the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law and, accordingly, should be suppressed.\u201d <em>Whiting, </em>389 Md. at 345, 885 A.2d at 791; <em>Nieves, </em>383 Md. at 581-82, 861 A.2d at 67; <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533-34, 842 A.2d at 779-80; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 207, 821 A.2d at 444; <em>Carter, </em>367 Md. at 457, 788 A.2d at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Lewis contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana discovered when the plastic bag containing such fell from his lap while he was getting out of his car. Lewis argues that a seizure occurred when the police stopped their cruiser and asked him to get out of his SUV, because he was prevented from driving away by the police\u2019s presence, and that such seizure was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment; Lewis maintain that, even if he \u201calmost\u201d hit the police ear, he did not violate any law, and therefore his actions did not provide the police with a reasonable suspicion that he was operating his vehicle unlawfully. Additionally, Lewis suggests that a \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d justification for conducting an investigatory traffic stop is not recognized under Maryland law, and even if it were, was not applicable in this case because the police were acting within their investigative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The State, conversely, argues that the trial court did not err in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana contained in the plastic bag. The State primarily argues that the police had justification to stop Lewis and conduct an investigatory traffic stop because they had a reasonable suspicion to believe that Lewis was operating his vehicle unlawfully, pointing to the fact that Lewis almost hit the police cruiser when pulling into Oswego Avenue. This \u201calmost\u201d accident, according to the State, afforded the officers the right to conduct an investigatory traffic stop for the purpose of determining whether Lewis was negligently or recklessly driving in violation of Section 21-901.1 of the Transportation Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>driving under the influence in violation of Section 21-902 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, the State opines that the officers, out of a concern for their own safety, had the right to request that Lewis get out of his vehicle. Alternatively, the State argues that the seizure was justified under the police\u2019s community earetaking function, articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d 89, 95 (1996); <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 550, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1875, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, 507 (1980); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 8, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 898 (1968). The Supreme Court has iterated that the \u201c[t]emporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of \u2018persons\u2019 within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment].\u201d <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 809-10, 116 S.Ct. at 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The Fourth Amendment, however, is not \u201ca guarantee against <em>all </em>searches and seizures, but only against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605, 613 (1985) (emphasis added). Therefore, \u201c[t]he touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security\u2019 \u201d. <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 108-09, 98 S.Ct. 330, 332, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 335 (1977), quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19, 88 S.Ct. at 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d at 904. In assessing the reasonableness of a traffic stop, the Supreme Court has adopted a \u201cdual inquiry,\u201d examining \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first plaee.\u201d <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d at 613, quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905. The case <em>sub judice </em>concerns the first inquiry\u2014whether the police had justification to stop Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">A traffic stop is justified under the Fourth Amendment where the police have a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity is afoot. <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 812-13, 116 S.Ct. at 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d at 97-98; <em>Myers v.

Thus, a traffic stop violates the Fourth Amendment where there is no</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">reasonable suspicion that the car is being driven contrary to the laws governing the operation of motor vehicles or that either the car or any of its occupants is subject to seizure or detention in connection with the violation of any other applicable laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 650, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1394, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, 665 (1979); <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 433, 769 A.2d 879, 884 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We have recognized that the reasonable suspicion standard requires the police to possess \u201ca particularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. <em>Myers, </em>395 Md. at 281, 909 A.2d at 1060; <em>Nathan v.

Further, Justice Byron White, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">By hypothesis, stopping apparently safe drivers is necessary only because the danger presented by some drivers is not observable at the time of the stop. When there is not . probable cause to believe that a driver is violating any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations\u2014or other articulable basis amounting to reasonable suspicion that the driver is unlicenced [unlicensed] or his vehicle unregistered\u2014we cannot conceive of any legitimate basis upon which a patrolman could decide that stopping a particular driver for a spot check would be more productive than stopping any other driver. This kind of standardless and unconstrained discretion is the evil the Court has discerned when in previous cases it has insisted that the discretion of the official in the field be circumscribed, at least to some extent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 661, 99 S.Ct. at 1400, 59 L.Ed.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We also had the opportunity to address the unreasonableness of a traffic stop based upon mere hunches in <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. at 272, 753 A.2d at 519, in which the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>stopped a vehicle lawfully driven by Cartnail based upon a suspicion that he and his passenger were involved in a robbery; the police subsequently discovered that Cartnail\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been revoked. Cartnail challenged the validity of the traffic stop, and we agreed, holding that the suppression hearing record \u201cfails to establish that a reasonable and prudent police officer would have reasonable suspicion to stop Petitioner and, therefore, the stop was constitutionally illegal under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 753 A.2d at 528-29. In reaching our conclusion, we applied the LaFave factors, noting that Cartnail \u201cwas not engaged in any suspicious activity, that there was no reason to believe that [Cartnail] was involved in another criminal case, and that he appeared to be operating his vehicle in compliance with the apparent rules of the road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 753 A.2d at 529. Further, we explained that lawfully operating a vehicle was an \u201cinnocent activity,\u201d which could only raise an articulable reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot when coupled with suspicious circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">Here, a reasonable police officer had only facially innocent activity to generate reasonable suspicion because no suspicious activity had been personally observed. In <em>Ferris, </em>we considered the issue of innocent activity and when it can lead to a reasonable articulable suspicion if placed in proper context. We observed that the Supreme Court, in <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>[448 U.S. 438, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980)], explained that \u201cfactual circumstances which \u2018describe a very large category of presumably innocent travelers\u2019 cannot, in and of themselves, justify a seizure.\u201d We contrasted <em>Reid </em>against <em>Sokolow </em>where the Court explained that a series of acts which could appear naturally innocent if viewed separately may collectively warrant further investigation by grounds of reasonable suspicion. <em>Ferris </em>reconciled the two parallel decisions by adopting the reasoning of <em>Karnes v. Skrutski, </em>[62 F.3d 485 (C.A.3,1995)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">The Third Circuit reasoned that, although the factors relied upon in <em>Sokolow </em>to find reasonable suspicion were consistent with innocent travel, they were nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201c \u2018out of the ordinary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Karnes </em>emphasized the distinction between individual factors which are consistent with innocent travel, but nonetheless out of the ordinary, and individual factors which are both consistent with innocent travel and too commonplace to be probative in tending to show criminal activity. The Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Karnes </em>also recognized that the reasonable suspicion standard, as applied to the totality of the circumstances, must be narrow enough to eliminate a great number of objectively innocent individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\"><em>Reid and Sokolow, </em>[490 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (U.S.Hawai\u2019i, 1989)], taken together, demonstrate it is not enough that law enforcement officials can articulate reasons why they stopped someone if those reasons are not probative of behavior in which few innocent people would engage\u2014the factors together must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers before the requirement of reasonable suspicion will be satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[although the nature of the totality of the circumstances test makes it possible for individually innocuous factors to add up to reasonable suspicion, it is \u2018impossible for a combination of wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">The record clearly shows that Petitioner gave no indication he was engaged in criminal activity, nor did he commit a moving traffic violation, that would have triggered immediate police reaction. For as much as the suppression hearing record reveals, Petitioner\u2019s vehicle evidenced no outward violations of motor vehicle laws, such as a malfunctioning light, missing license plate, or the like. We note that despite the fact that there are usually less people in public during the early morning hours, a driver is still entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>privacy at any time of the day and should not be disturbed by the police without constitutional authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Cartnail, </em>359 Md. at 290-91, 294, 296, 753 A.2d at 529-30, 531, 532 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We have upheld investigatory traffic stops of vehicles being operated lawfully, however, when lawfulness was accompanied by suspicious behavior or information regarding criminal activity. In <em>Mosley v. State, </em>289 Md. 571, 425 A.2d 1039 (1981), the police observed two young men, one of them later identified as Mosley, standing outside of a department store, pacing back and forth, glaring through the window in the direction of the store\u2019s cash registers, and alternately entering the store several times, walking around the cash registers, and then venturing outside. The men subsequently walked to their vehicle and proceeded slowly down the shopping center parking lot in their car. The police stopped the vehicle and subsequently discovered evidence linking the men to an armed robbery. Mosley challenged the legality of the stop; we found that Mosley\u2019s, and his companion\u2019s, conduct was \u201cso similar to the suspicious conduct involved in the <em>Terry </em>case that we believe that opinion is clearly dispositive of Mosley\u2019s fourth amendment contention,\u201d and that their actions outside of the department store provided the police with \u201cspecific and articulable facts that would warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that criminal activity was afoot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 575, 576, 425 A.2d at 1041, 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cAlmost\u201d committing a traffic violation, however, does not justify a traffic stop. In <em>Rowe, </em>363 Md. at 439, 769 A.2d at 888, a state trooper witnessed a vehicle traveling south on Interstate 95 at a speed less than the 65 miles per hour speed limit; the vehicle also crossed the white shoulder line onto the rumble strip and swerved back into the lane, only to subsequently return and touch the shoulder line again. The trooper stopped the car for failing to drive in a single line in violation of Section 21-309 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ing whether Rowe\u2019s operation of his vehicle was unlawful, we noted that Section 21-309 does not render conduct not endangering other vehicles or individuals unlawful, so that Rowe\u2019s conduct did not constitute an infraction, and his \u201calmost\u201d violation could not alone justify the stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">The cases in which courts have upheld traffic stops based on violation of statues [statutes] similar to \u00a7 21-309 involve conduct much more egregious than that in which the petitioner engaged in this case____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u25a0 We conclude that the petitioner\u2019s momentary crossing of the edge line of the roadway and later touching of that line <em>did not amount to an unsafe lane change or unsafe entry onto the roadway, conduct prohibited by \u00a7 21-309, and, thus, cannot support the traffic stop in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 439, 441, 769 A.2d at 888, 889 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">What the State in the present case attempts to do, however, is \u201cskirt\u201d hunch, cruise past \u201calmost\u201d unlawful, and arrive at \u201calmost\u201d accident to permit investigatory traffic stops in situations in which a driver of a car is \u201calmost\u201d involved in a traffic accident. The State\u2019s attempt to do so runs afoul of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence because there is no basis for conducting an investigatory traffic stop when it is evident that the driver is lawfully operating his vehicle without any accompanying illegal activity. The State\u2019s proposed principle would permit the police to exercise unrestrained discretion when deciding to make a traffic stop, based upon a belief that the driver has \u201calmost\u201d been involved in a traffic accident. Such a standardless chimera practically destroys the objective basis of the reasonable suspicion require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Almost causing an accident could include driving less than the speed limit, passing another car appropriately or merely parallel parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In the present case, Lewis was stopped on the road and pulled into the street, activating his left turn signal. That he \u201calmost\u201d hit the police car did not constitute a traffic infraction nor illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">A number of our sister states have reached a similar conclusion, not permitting investigatory traffic stops amidst an alleged \u201calmost\u201d accident, absent a violation of the law. In <em>State v. Smith, </em>21 S.W.3d 251 (Tenn.Crim.App.1999), the police effectuated a traffic stop after a vehicle changed lanes to pass another vehicle, without signaling. In assessing the reasonableness of the traffic stop, the court remarked that such passing, when done when there is minimal traffic on the road, \u201cis [not] an unusual occurrence,\u201d and that making a lawful lane change could not give an officer \u201creasonable suspicion to believe that an [individual] is either drunk or tired\u201d or that the individual is unlawfully operating the vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVa\">Similarly, Trooper Norrod did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that the Defendant was involved in or about to be involved in criminal activity, which would have also justified the seizure. He apparently suggested to the Defendant that he thought the Defendant might have been drunk or tired, but he insisted in the suppression hearing that the only reason he stopped the Defendant was because of an \u201cimproper\u201d lane change. As already noted, the Defendant did not violate any traffic provision by changing lanes without signaling. Making a \u201clawful\u201d lane change, which we equate somewhat to a \u201cproper\u201d lane change, as described herein, could not give any officer reasonable suspicion to believe that an individual is either drunk or tired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">There was no evidence that the Defendant was driving erratically, weaving, or otherwise causing a hazard to other vehicles.... <em>We are reluctant to conclude that a person driving in a manner that an officer deems \u201cimproper,\u201d when the driving is not erratic or haphazard and does not create a dangerous situation, is subject to seizure while proceeding along a highway in a lawful manner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 257, 258 (emphasis added). <em>See State v. Brew, </em>593 So.2d 447, 451 (La.Ct.App.1992) (remarking that traffic stop was justified after officer witnessed traffic violation, and the fact that violation \u201calmost caused an accident\u201d did not have any bearing on whether the stop was justified); <em>Whitson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, </em>346 N.W.2d 454, 456 (S.D.1984) (stating that the stop was justified for committing a traffic violation by carelessly cutting in front of other vehicles approaching an intersection, which only incidently \u201calmost\u201d caused an accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">In another attempt at justification, the State also contends that the police appropriately stopped Lewis in order to foil an attempted rape, pursuant to their community care-taking function, postulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. at 433, 93 S.Ct. at 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d at 706. In <em>Cady, </em>the Court addressed the reasonableness of a warrantless search of the trunk of an impounded vehicle, and held that the search was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because the police, in searching the trunk, were not collecting evidence, but were acting out of \u201cconcern for the safety of the general public who might be endangered if an intruder removed a revolver from the trunk of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 93 S.Ct. at 2531, 37 L.Ed.2d at 718. In reaching its conclusion, the Court discussed the community caretaking function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Because of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic, and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways, the extent of police-citizen contact involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ing automobiles will be substantially greater than police-citizen contact in a home or office. Some such contacts will occur because the officer may believe the operator has violated a criminal statute, but many more will not be of that nature. Local police officers ... frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Here the justification [for the search] ... was as immediate and constitutionally reasonable as those in <em>Harris [v. U.S., </em>390 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (U.S.Dist.Col., 1968)] and <em>Cooper [v. State of Cal., </em>386 U.S. 58, 87 S.Ct. 788, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (U.S.Cal., 1967)]: concern for the safety of the general public who might be endangered if an intruder removed a revolver from the trunk of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">The Court\u2019s previous recognition of the distinction between motor vehicles and dwelling places leads us to conclude that the type of caretaking \u201csearch\u201d conducted here of a vehicle that was neither in the custody nor on the premises of its owner, and that had been placed where it was by virtue of lawful police action, was not unreasonable.... Where, as here, the trunk of an automobile, which the officer reasonably believed to contain a gun, was vulnerable to intrusion by vandals, we hold that the search was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 93 S.Ct. at 2531, 37 L.Ed.2d at 714-15, 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The State, extolling the application of the logic utilized by the Supreme Court in <em>Cady, </em>points to <em>Stanberry v. State, </em>343 Md. 720, 684 A.2d 823 (1996), and <em>Rowe, </em>363 Md. at 424, 769 A.2d at 879, contending that we also have recognized a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>munity caretaking justification for investigatory traffic stops. In <em>Stanberry, </em>the police conducted a drug interdiction investigation at a highway rest stop. During the investigation, the police, without first obtaining a warrant, searched a \u201csuit bag\u201d found on a luggage rack of a bus, after none of the bus\u2019s passengers claimed ownership of it, and discovered heroine and cocaine. We concluded that the warrantless search implicated the Fourth Amendment guarantees and was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 739, 740, 684 A.2d at 832, 833. Moreover, although we recognized that the community caretaking function was not involved in the case, we articulated, in dicta, the distinction between the caretaking function and the investigatory role of the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Moreover, although we find today that, under the circumstances presented in the instant case, the police search of Petitioner\u2019s luggage was unlawful, we stress that our holding is limited to the conduct of the police when they are acting in their criminal investigatory capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZM\">In essence police officers function in one of two roles: (1) apprehension of criminals (investigative function); and (2) protecting the public and rescuing those in distress (care-taking function). Courts have noted that preservation of human life is paramount to the right of privacy protected by the fourth amendment. Thus, the [community care-taking function] is justified because the motivation for the intrusion is to preserve life rather than to search for evidence to be used in a criminal investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">Our holding does not apply to situations in which the police are acting to protect public safety pursuant to their community caretaking function....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 742-43, 684 A.2d at 834 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In <em>Rowe, </em>however, we rejected the community caretaking function as a justification for a traffic stop to ensure the safety of the occupant. After we determined that the traffic stop was not justified as an observed traffic violation, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Several states have recognized that, under the community caretaking function discussed in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>a police officer may stop a vehicle to ensure the safety of the occupant without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Neither this Court nor the General Assembly has adopted the community caretaking function in this context, and the State has not urged us to do so in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 769 A.2d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Whether or not the community caretaking function h as been recognized b y this Court, in dicta or in a holding, it is not applicable in the present case. Although the State argues that the police had justification to conduct the traffic stop under the community caretaking function to protect the general public because the police were looking for a suspect wanted in connection with a rape, and to protect Ms. Parksdale because Sergeant Jocuns testified that he thought that a rape could be in progress, the suppression hearing judge totally rejected such factual findings in stating \u201cthere was utterly no evidence whatsoever or no reason to think there was any possible attempted rape going on.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In conclusion, the police did not have an articulable reasonable suspicion to stop Lewis based upon the fact that he \u201calmost\u201d struck a police car and so, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

Detective Vaith stopped the police cruiser in the westbound traffic lane, sufficiently beyond the SUV to take the police cruiser out of the direct line of fire by an occupant of the SUV, in the event that the situation turned bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Detective Vaith described what then occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cAt that point the defendant activated his turn signal and started to pull out into the street nearly striking the back of my vehicle. That was\u2014at that point that\u2019s when Sergeant Jocuns said, \u2018[H]e almost hit your vehicle[. Wjhat\u2019s this guy doing?\u2019 So I pulled to the side and parked and got out as well as Sergeant Jocuns. We both approached the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The unarticulated, but necessarily included, fact in this description is that Mr. Lewis stopped the SUV without any order by the police to stop. Detective Vaith\u2019s testimony that he and Sergeant Jocuns \u201capproached\u201d the SUV means that they approached it on foot. Consequently, the SUV remained stopped while Detective Vaith pulled from the second westbound lane and parked and while the officers alighted the cruiser. In other words, the SUV did not swing fully past the police cruiser in order to proceed westerly on Oswego.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>When the officers approached the SUV, Mr. Lewis was ordered to step out of the vehicle. It was at that point that there was a police initiated traffic stop. Mr. Lewis got out of the driver\u2019s side, and his cell phone and the plastic bag of marijuana fell to the ground. Mr. Lewis apparently failed to secure the parking brake when he exited the SUV. It began to drift westerly on Oswego. Detective Vaith pursued on foot and was able to get into the SUV, stop it, and put the vehicle in park gear.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Mr. Lewis\u2019s operation of the SUV, as above described, falls within the prohibition of Maryland Code (1977, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 21-901.1(b) of the Transportation Article (TR) which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u201cA person is guilty of negligent driving if he drives a motor vehicle in a careless or imprudent manner that endangers any property[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The opinion of the Court in this case would have the reader conclude that the \u201calmost\u201d accident, above described, was no more than the successful navigation of the narrow clearances regularly encountered in traffic-congested, urban areas. The suppression court, as I believe it properly could do, focused on Detective Vaith\u2019s description of what Sergeant Jocuns said, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[H]e almost hit your vehicle[. WJhat\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d The testimony has the reliability indicia of an excited utterance. The suppression court saw and heard the witnesses, and was in a better position than is this Court to consider the volume and inflection of the voice in which the quoted testimony was given.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Defense counsel also saw and heard the witnesses. Reviewing the evidence in argument to the court, defense counsel described the testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cYou have Officer Jocuns[\u2019s] testimony that he looked\u2014that he saw the car <em>coming </em>into\u2014saw Mr. Lewis\u2019s car <em>coming into </em>their car. You had Officer Vaith\u2019s testimony that Officer Jocuns looked back and saw Mr. Lewis almost <em>coming into </em>their car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">(Emphasis added). Defense counsel argued that little or no weight should be given to this evidence because Mr. Lewis activated his left turn signal before pulling away from the curb and because the police officers issued no traffic citations.</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">To this argument the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cThere\u2019s n\u00f3 traffic citations. But, if somebody is in a car and they almost hit another or almost hit a police car that\u2019s not reason enough to make a further inquiry?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: What are you supposed to do; ignore it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACG\">The majority bolsters its conclusion that, as a matter of law, the suppression court could not find a violation of TR \u00a7 21-901.1(b), by noting that \u201c[n]either officer ever suggested reckless or negligent driving as the basis for the stop.\u201d Slip opinion at 22 n. 11. Of course, once the drugs hit the street, the officers had a more serious offense with which to be concerned. Apropos is <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>450 F.2d 835 (5th Cir.1971), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\u201cThat the officer elected to charge Atkinson with the more serious of the two crimes involved does not prevent the validity of the arrest from resting on the lesser crime---- Any other rule would force police officers to routinely charge every citizen taken into custody with every offense they thought he could be held for in order to increase the chances that at least one charge would survive the test for probable cause. Such a clogging of the criminal process already heavily encumbered, would be pointless. We thus decide that there was probable cause to arrest for the improperly displayed license tag, and we look no further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 838 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">In any event, the constitutionality of a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment is to be determined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>objective facts and is not limited to the legal theory which the police officer believed, even erroneously, justified the invasion. <em>See Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>543 U.S. 146, 125 S.Ct. 588, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004) (sustaining, because of probable cause to believe arrestee was impersonating a police officer, warrant-less arrest assertedly for violation of state privacy statute); <em>Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 669, 537 A.2d 235, 248 (1988) (\u201cNor is a search incident analysis ... precluded by Officer Baughman\u2019s belief that his legal justification for opening the gym bag was a protective search for weapons.\u201d); <em>Marbury v. United States, </em>540 A.2d 114, 115 (D.C.App.1985) (upholding traffic stop as supported by the evidence and findings by the trial court, although the arresting officer \u201cstated that he had <em>not </em>pulled appellant\u2019s car over because of a traffic violation (driving without lights); and he made no mention of the traffic violation in any police department form.\u201d); 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 1.4(d) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Based on Sergeant Jocuns\u2019s excited exclamation, on the position of the vehicles when the SUV \u201calmost\u201d hit the police cruiser, and on Mr. Lewis\u2019s recognition that he should stop, rather than proceed westerly on Oswego, the suppression court could conclude that there was justification for the traffic stop. In the language of TR \u00a7 21-901.1(b), the suppression court could find that Mr. Lewis had driven the SUV \u201cin a careless or imprudent manner that endanger[ed]\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I find it unfortunate that the theme, recurring throughout the majority opinion, is that the subject occurrence was merely an \u201calmost\u201d accident. This case will be cited for the proposition that there can be no traffic stop for violating the prohibition against negligent driving, unless there has been a collision. TR \u00a7 21-901.1(b) makes plain that the negligent driving need merely <em>endanger </em>person or property. There is no requirement for impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Particularly unfortunate, in my opinion, is the majority\u2019s reinforcement of its position by finding the police officers\u2019 testimony in this case too subjective to satisfy Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. The factual premise of the argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>that the lack of any illegal activity is \u201cevident.\u201d Opinion at 368-69, 920 A.2d at 1091. I have discussed this, above. In the majority\u2019s view, to allow a traffic stop based on an officer\u2019s belief that there has \u201calmost\u201d been a collision \u201cpractically destroys the objective basis of the reasonable suspicion requirement.\u201d Opinion at 368-69, 920 A.2d at 1091. There are, of course, rules of the road that similarly could be criticized as being subjective. For example, a motorist may violate a speed restriction when traveling below the posted speed limit. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 21-801(a) (\u201cA person may not drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed that, with regard to the actual and potential dangers existing, is more than that which is reasonable and prudent under the conditions.\u201d). <em>See also </em>TR \u00a7 21-310(a) (\u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle may not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of the other vehicle and of the traffic on and the condition of the highway.\u201d). These are the kinds of violations that can lead to the apprehension of motorists driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Judges RAKER and HARRELL authorize me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. It is immaterial whether Mr. Lewis, to avoid the collision, either suddenly applied his brakes and stopped just short of the rear of the cruiser or whether he swerved at the last split-second and stopped with some part of the SUV beyond the rear of the cruiser. The point is that Mr. Lewis\u2019s driving was such that it provoked an excited utterance from Sergeant Jocuns.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
