In <em>Abrams v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 146, 919 A.2d 1223 (2007), this Court considered a petition by Stephen A. Abrams (\u201cAbrams\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenging the eligibility of Thomas E. Perez (\u201cPerez\u201d) to hold the office of the Attorney General. In <em>Abrams, </em>a case of first impression for this Court, this Court was required to interpret Article V, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cNo person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney-General, who is not a citizen of this State, and a qualified voter therein, and has not resided and <em>practiced Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Concluding that Perez had not met the eligibility requirements, <em>ie., </em>he had not been a member of the Maryland Bar for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the requisite period, we reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, 398 Md. at 150-51, 919 A.2d at 1225-26, which had ruled that Perez met the necessary qualifications to run in the 2006 Gubernatorial Primary Election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The instant challenge was brought by Nikos Stanford Liddy (\u201cLiddy\u201d), the appellant, against Douglas F. Gansler (\u201cGansler\u201d), one of the appellees, the victor in the September 12, 2006 primary election, thus the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for the office of the Attorney General. In addition to Gansler, the appellant also named Linda H. Lamone (\u201cLamone\u201d), the State Administrator of Elections, and the State Board of Elections (\u201cthe State Board\u201d), collectively, the appellees, as defendants. It was filed on October 20, 2006, more than three months after the Abrams suit, almost two months after this Court\u2019s Order in that case, and just 18 days prior to the November 7, 2006 general election. In the complaint, he asserted that Gansler, like Perez, was ineligible to run for the office of the Attorney General, arguing that Gansler has not \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">There is, however, a threshold issue which must be addressed, whether the appellant waited too long to bring this action and, thus, is barred, by the equitable doctrine of laches, from bringing it now.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall hold that this action is barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As stated earlier, in order for one to run for the office of the Attorney General, one must be qualified to do so. Article Y, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution prescribes those qualifications. In addition, under the current Election Law Article, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (2003, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 1-101, <em>et seq., </em>a candidate wishing to hold the office of the Attorney General must register his or her candidacy by filing, with the State Board, pursuant to \u00a7 5-301(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a certificate of candidacy, under oath.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 28, 2006, Gansler filed his certificate of candidacy, in which he certified that he is \u201ca registered voter and a citizen of Maryland and meet[s] all other requirements for the ... office [of the Attorney General].\u201d The State Board accepted Gansler\u2019s certificate and, pursuant to \u00a7 5-601(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article, placed h is name on the ballot for the 2006 Gubernatorial Primary Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The Election Law Article also provides that any registered voter may seek judicial relief if he or she alleges that an \u201cact or omission relating to an election, whether or not the election has been held, is inconsistent with th[e Election Law AJrticle or other law applicable to the elections process and may change or has changed the outcome of the election,\u201d provided that the action is filed \u201cwithin the earlier of 10 days after the act or omission or the date the act or omission became known to the petitioner or 7 days after the election results are certified, unless the election was a gubernatorial primary or special primary election, in which case 3 days after the election results are certified.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As stated earlier, Liddy brought a challenge to Gansler\u2019s qualifications. He did so on October 20, 2006, when he sought declaratory and injunctive relief against Gansler, Lamone, and the State Board because, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>claimed, Gansler\u2019s legal experience did not satisfy Article V, \u00a7 4\u2019s requirement that a candidate for that office \u201cpractice[ ] Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Gansler filed a Motion to Dismiss Or, In The Alternative, for Summary Judgment, contending that he met all eligibility requirements for the office. Moving to dismiss and expedite scheduling, the other appellees contended that Liddy\u2019s action was barred by limitations and by laches. In support, they alleged that their sole interest in the action was to ensure an orderly administration of the election process, the deadlines of which would be jeopardized if the action were not adjudicated expeditiously.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Following a hearing at which it heard extensive testimony pertaining to the merits of Gansler\u2019s constitutional eligibility for the office of the Attorney General, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County denied the dispositive motions filed by the appellees and Gansler.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the Circuit Court ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>dressed, in addition to laches, the issues of the applicable statute of limitations and the merits of the case, we will confine our discussion to the equitable doctrine of laches.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">On the issue of laches, the appellees argued that the appellant\u2019s claim was \u201can eleventh hour lawsuit that threaten [ed] to disrupt the entire elections machinery, to sew doubt in the minds of voters, to create voter confusion and uncertainty, and generally to defeat voters\u2019 choices.\u201d The appellees maintained \u201cvoters ought to be able to make their choice intelligently and based on the ballots that have been created and in accordance with the election law.\u201d The appellees\u2019 paramount concern was the prejudice this action would have on the electorate and its choice of Attorney General candidates. In addition, they outlined the various procedures which had already taken place, and which were in the process of taking place, and insisted that the appellant\u2019s claim was simply brought too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>close to the general election to allow any changes or alterations to be made. The process was well underway, and to grant the appellant the relief he requested, <em>i.e. </em>the removal of Gansler\u2019s name from the general election ballot, at such a late stage \u201cwould lead to an unmanageable disruption of the general election and disenfranchise thousands of voters.\u201d Conversely, the appellant argued that the constitutional issue, the interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 4, outweighed any merit found in the laches defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In rejecting the appellees\u2019 arguments, the Circuit Court, citing <em>Ross v. State Board of Elections, </em>387 Md. 649, 671, 876 A.2d 692, 705 (2005), held that application of laches was inappropriate in a situation such as the case <em>sub judice. </em>It determined that Liddy was \u201cnot responsible for any inexcusable delay in the processing of his complaint [and found] it inappropriate to allow the general election to go forward without examining whether a candidate who may become this State\u2019s next Attorney General is constitutionally eligible to hold that office.\u201d The court further noted, on the issue of prejudice, that \u201cMr. Gansler cannot be prejudiced because if, in fact, he does not meet the eligibility requirements, he ought not to be on the ballot. The Sftate] B[oard of] Ejections] is not prejudiced because it is undisputed that at this late date, there is nothing that can be done to alter the makeup of the ballot for this election.\u201d On the other hand, the court noted that \u201cPlaintiff [Liddy] and similarly situated voters would be prejudiced if an ineligible candidate were to remain on the ballot because of a delay in finding out about the lack of eligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Although the appellant prevailed on the dispositive motions, the Circuit Court ultimately ruled in favor of Gansler and his continued candidacy for the office of the Attorney General. The appellant, pursuant to \u00a7 12-203(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Election Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Article, in response, noted an appeal to this Court and to the Court of Special Appeals. In addition, he filed, in this Court, a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>Liddy v. Lamone, </em>395 Md. 420, 910 A.2d 1061 (2006). The appellees and Gansler subsequently filed a Joint Cross-Petition for Writ of Certiorari. Oral argument was heard on November 2, 2006, and, on that same day, the Court issued its Order vacating the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanding the case to that court with directions to dismiss it on the ground of laches. We now set forth the reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Laches is one of the affirmative defenses recognized and expressly listed in M d. Rule 2-323.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Generally, it must be pled, but it can be invoked by a court on its own initiative. <em>See, e.g., Ipes v. Board of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>180, 183, 167 A.2d 337, 339 (1961) (recognizing that laches is a proper ground for refusing to issue a writ of mandamus); <em>Baltimore County v. Glendale Corp., </em>219 Md. 465, 468, 150 A.2d 433, 435 (1959) (noting that, although it is essential to raise the defense of laches in the pleadings, \u201cequity may decline relief for a stale claim after the facts are fully developed\u201d); <em>Warburton v. Davis, </em>123 Md. 225, 231, 91 A. 163, 165 (1914) (recognizing that a court, in a proper case and on its own motion, may refuse to grant relief to a complainant who on the final hearing appears to have been guilty of laches, although the defense was not interposed by the defendant), <em>citing Syester v. Brewer, </em>27 Md. 288, 319 (1867).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This Court has held that laches \u201cis a defense in equity against stale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>claims, and is based upon grounds of sound public policy by discouraging fusty demands for the peace of society.\u201d <em>Ross, supra, </em>387 Md. at 668, 876 A.2d at 703, <em>quoting Parker v. Board of Election Supervisors, </em>230 Md. 126, 130, 186 A.2d 195, 197 (1962); <em>Buxton v. Buxton, </em>363 Md. 634, 645, 770 A.2d 152, 158 (2001); <em>Berman v. Leckner, </em>193 Md. 177, 187, 66 A.2d 392, 396 (1949); <em>Kaufman v. Plitt, </em>191 Md. 24, 28, 59 A.2d 634, 635 (1948). In its application, \u201c[tjhere is no inflexible rule as to what constitutes, or what does not constitute, laches; hence its existence must be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 669, 876 A.2d at 704, <em>quoting Parker, </em>230 Md. at 130, 186 A.2d at 197, <em>citing Brashears v. Collison, </em>207 Md. 339, 352, 115 A.2d 289, 295 (1955); <em>Bowie v. Ford, </em>269 Md. 111, 122, 304 A.2d 803, 810 (1973); <em>Day v. Day, </em>237 Md. 229, 236, 205 A.2d 798, 803 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">It is, however, well settled that laches \u201capplies when there is an unreasonable delay in the assertion of one\u2019s rights and that delay results in prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Frederick Road Ltd. Partnership v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 117, 756 A.2d 963, 985 (2000), <em>citing Inlet Assoc. v. Assateague House Condominium Ass\u2019n, </em>313 Md. 413, 438-39, 545 A.2d 1296, 1309 (1988); <em>See Ross, </em>387 Md. at 669, 876 A.2d at 704 (\u201c[L]aches must include an unjustifiable delay and some amount of prejudice to the defendant\u201d); <em>Schaeffer v. Anne Arundel County, </em>338 Md. 75, 83, 656 A.2d 751, 755 (1995) (\u201c[LJaches is an inexcusable delay, without necessary reference to duration in asserting an equitable claim\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Simpers v. Clark, </em>239 Md. 395, 403, 211 A.2d 753, 757 (1965) (\u201c[F]or the doctrine [of laches] to be applicable, there must be a showing that the delay [in the assertion of a right] worked a disadvantage to another\u201d); <em>Hungerford v. Hungerford, </em>223 Md. 316, 320-21, 164 A.2d 518, 521 (1960) (\u201cOnly two requisites are necessary in order to invoke the doctrine of laches. There must have been some lapse of time during which plaintiff failed to assert his rights, and the lapse must have caused some prejudice to the defendant\u201d). Prejudice is \u201cgenerally held to be any thing that places- [the defendant] in a less favorable position.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 670, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>876 A.2d at 704, <em>quoting Buxton, </em>363 Md. at 646, 770 A.2d at 159; <em>Parker, </em>230 Md. at 130, 186 A.2d at 197; <em>Roberto v. Catino, </em>140 Md. 38, 43, 116 A. 873, 875 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Moreover, this Court has recognized that in the context of election matters, \u201cany claim against a state electoral procedure must be expressed expeditiously,\u201d Ross, 387 Md. at 671, 876 A.2d at 705, <em>quoting Fulani v. Hogsett, </em>917 F.2d 1028, 1031 (7th Cir.1990) (noting that \u201c[a]s time passes, the state\u2019s interest in proceeding with the election increases in importance as resources are committed and irrevocable decisions are made\u201d), <em>cert. denied </em>501 U.S. 1206, 111 S.Ct. 2799, 115 L.Ed.2d 972 (1991); <em>Kay v. Austin, </em>621 F.2d 809, 813 (6th Cir.1980), without unreasonable delay, so as to not cause prejudice to the defendant. <em>Fulani, </em>917 F.2d at 1031. <em>See, e.g., MacGovern v. Connolly, </em>637 F.Supp. 111, 115 (D.Mass. 1986) (stating that \u201cin awarding or withholding relief, a court should ... endeavor to avoid a disruption of the election process which might result from requiring precipitate changes that could make unreasonable or embarrassing demands on a State in adjusting to the requirements of the court\u2019s decree\u201d), <em>quoting Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 585, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, 541 (1964); <em>Farnum v.

Morris, </em>342 F.Supp. 153, 160 (D.Md.1972) (stating that although \u201cthe election process is one fraught with uncertainty[, i]t does not follow [ ] that a court should add a further element of wholly unanticipated uncertainty into the process at the eleventh hour\u201d); <em>cf. Ross, </em>387 Md. at 671 n. 9, 876 A.2d at 705 n. 9 (outlining instances where the application of laches in the election context may not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We note that, in reviewing the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, the issue of laches, in this case, is a mixed question of fact and law. Whether the elements of laches have been established is one of fact, <em>see, e.g., Schmidt v. Farm Credit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Services 977 </em>F.2d 511, 516 (10th Cir.1992) (noting that whether a party\u2019s delay is unreasonable is a question for the trier of fact); <em>Harman v. Masoneilan International, Inc., </em>442 A.2d 487, 503 (Del.1982) (stating that a finding of unreasonable delay is a factual question); <em>Everett v. Bosch, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 648, 50 Cal.Rptr. 813, 820 (1966) (noting that whether there has been delay amounting to laches is a fact question); <em>Leathers v. Stewart, </em>108 Me. 96, 79 A. 16, 18 (1911) (\u201cThe circumstances in a given case which are claimed to constitute laches is, of course, a question of fact\u201d), while the question of whether in view of the established facts, laches should be invoked, is a question of law. <em>See, e.g., Waddell v. Small Tube Products, Inc., 799 </em>F.2d 69, 77 (3d Cir.1986) (\u201c[T]he conclusion that a delay is \u2018inexcusable\u2019 comprehends both the application of a legal standard and an exercise of the trial court\u2019s sound discretion in assessing the equitable circumstances of a particular case\u201d), <em>quoting Churma v. United States Steel Corp., </em>514 F.2d 589, 593 (3d Cir.1975); <em>Freeman v. Martin Robowash, Inc., </em>61 Tenn.App. 677, 457 S.W.2d 606 (1970) (\u201cThe question whether in view of the established facts, relief is to be denied-that is, whether, it would be inequitable or unjust to the defendant to enforce the complainants\u2019 right-is a question of law\u201d); <em>Leathers, 79 </em>A. at 18 (\u201c[T]he conclusion whether upon the facts it would be inequitable to enforce the right, and whether the claimant is barred by laches, involves a question of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Maryland Rule 8-131, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cc) Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. <em>It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, </em>and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d (emphasis added),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">governs the standard of review for questions of fact, <em>i.e. </em>whether the elements of laches have been established. In addition, this Court has held that questions of law, <em>i.e. </em>whether the facts taken together are sufficient to sustain the defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>laches, are subject to review under the <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. 402, 411, 906 A.2d 898, 903 (2006); <em>Ehrlich v. Perez, </em>394 Md. 691, 708, 908 A.2d 1220, 1230 (2006); <em>Renbaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 43, 871 A.2d 554, 563 (2005); <em>Mohan v.

Sears Roebuck, </em>370 Md. 38, 48, 803 A.2d 482, 487 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">With respect to the standard of review for mixed questions of fact and law, in <em>Bowers v. Eastern Aluminum Corp., </em>on the other hand, we held that this Court must affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on mixed questions of fact and law when \u201cwe cannot say [that its findings] were clearly erroneous [,] ... [a]nd we find no error in [its] application of the law to the facts.\u201d 240 Md. 625, 214 A.2d 924 (1965). Thus, we have stated that mixed questions of fact and law are entitled to deferential review on judicial review. <em>See, e.g., Charles County Dept. of Social Services v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 296, 855 A.2d 313, 319 (2004) (noting that when an agency decision under judicial review involves a mixed question of fact and law, the reviewing court applies the same standard of review it would apply to the review of an agency factual finding); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, Income Tax Div., </em>313 Md. 118, 133-34, 544 A.2d 764, 771 (1988) (stating that a reviewing court must defer to a tax court\u2019s expertise on determinations involving mixed questions of fact and law); <em>Pemberton v. Montgomery County, </em>275 Md. 363, 368, 340 A.2d 240, 243 (1975) (asserting that, on questions of mixed fact and law, it is not the function of the appellate court to substitute its assessment of the facts, as they relate to the issues of a particular case, for those of the administrative agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Where, however, an administrative agency decision is not being reviewed and, thus, the expertise of the decision-maker is not implicated, critical or germane, we have held that the <em>de novo </em>standard of review is appropriate, <em>see Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519, 525 (2000) (\u201cIssues of law and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo </em>\u201d), at least with respect to application of law to facts. <em>See also Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 345, 885 A.2d 785, 791 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(2005) (\u201cAlthough we extend great deference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we review independently the application of the law to those facts\u201d); <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 310-11, 765 A.2d 97, 116 (2001) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination of whether a confession was made voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. As such, we undertake a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial judge\u2019s ultimate determination on the issue of voluntariness\u201d) (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The latter formulation is precisely this case. A trial court is in no better position to apply, and has no more expertise in applying, the law to facts, even those it has found, than an appellate court. <em>See United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>issue is whether a party is precluded by laches from challenging an action of another party, we shall review the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination of the issue <em>de novo, </em>just as we do in similar circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that the Circuit Court erred in not invoking the doctrine of laches as a bar to the appellant\u2019s untimely claim when it placed the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>a candidate\u2019s eligibility ahead of the urgency of the election itself and the possible disenfranchisement of Maryland voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As stated earlier, \u201cany claim against a state electoral procedure must be expressed expeditiously.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 671, 876 A.2d at 705. The reason for this is plain. As the Supreme Court of the United States stated recently in <em>Purcell v. Gonzalez, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 5, 166 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006), reversing a lower court\u2019s injunction, in an election case, enjoining operation of voter identification procedures just weeks before an election, \u201c[a] State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 7, 166 L.Ed.2d at 4, <em>quoting Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., </em>489 U.S. 214, 231, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1024, 103 L.Ed.2d 271, 287 (1989). The Court articulated further that \u201c[cjonfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.\u201d -U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 7, 166 L.Ed.2d at 4. The <em>Purcell </em>Court, moreover, addressed the issue of the applicability of laches on an election challenge, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">\u201c[the lower court] was required to weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an injunction, considerations specific to election cases and its own institutional procedures. Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. <em>As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">The Supreme Court, ultimately, held that, \u201c[g]iven the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputes, [its] action [ ] shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 8, 166 L.Ed.2d at 5. Thus, it made clear that injunctive relief may be inappropriate in an elections case if the election is too close for the State, realistically, to be able to implement the necessary changes before the election. It is such pragmatic imperatives related to the implementation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the elections process, coupled with the statutory scheme governing the process itself, that result in the need for expedited resolutions of disputes. <em>See also Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 585, 84 S.Ct. at 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d at 541 (stating that \u201ca court is entitled to and should consider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of state election laws, and should act and rely upon general equitable principles\u201d); <em>Wells v. Rockefeller, </em>394 U.S. 542, 547, 89 S.Ct. 1234, 1237, 22 L.Ed.2d 535, 539-40 (1969) (finding no error when court allowed an election that was only three months away to proceed \u201cdespite its constitutional infirmities\u201d); <em>Kilgarlin v. Hill, </em>386 U.S. 120, 121, 87 S.Ct. 820, 821, 17 L.Ed.2d 771, 774 (1967) (affirming ruling to allow an election, \u201cconstitutionally infirm in certain respects,\u201d to proceed).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court is faced with the same quandary as the <em>Purcell </em>Court and must contemplate the \u201cconsiderations specific to election cases,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>the potential harm to the appellees and, more important, to the electorate, which, we believe, the Circuit Court failed to do. The Circuit Court, citing <em>Ross v. State Board of Elections, </em>and relying more specifically on <em>Melendez v. O\u2019Connor, </em>654 N.W.2d 114 (Minn.2002), dismissed the appellees\u2019 laches argument, concluding that \u201cit would be inappropriate to allow the general election to go forward without examining whether a candidate who may become this State\u2019s next Attorney General is constitutionally eligible to hold that office.\u201d We do not agree. To be sure, this Court has stated, <em>see Ross, </em>387 Md. at 671 n. 9, 876 A.2d at 705 n. 9, that there may be instances where laches would be inapplicable, and even further, that, perhaps, a dispute concerning the eligibility requirements of a candidate to run for office should not be given a laches analysis, <em>id., </em>the facts presented by the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, do not constitute such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In <em>Melendez, </em>the court held that a petition brought by citizens to have a candidate for state representative removed from the ballot on the grounds that he did not meet the residency requirements was not barred by laches. 654 N.W.2d at 117. The court reasoned that \u201cregardless of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>er there has been an unreasonable delay by petitioners in filing their petition, there would be no prejudice to [the candidate] or others in granting the relief ... [t]here is nothing in the record indicating that [the candidate] was prejudiced by the timing of the filing of the petition.\u201d <em>Id. Melendez </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>for two distinct reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">First, the citizens\u2019 petition in <em>Melendez </em>was filed on October 2, 2002, over a month before the November 5, 2002 general election was to take place. Here, the appellant brought his challenge on October 20,2006, only 18 days before the November 7, 2006 general election, claiming that it was proper under the statutory provisions governing the election. The case was heard October 25, 2006 in the Circuit Court and then on November 2, 2006 in this Court, leaving only 5 days remaining before the general election. The time constraints thus placed on this Court, as well as the Circuit Court, were substantially different than those of the <em>Melendez </em>Court. Moreover, notwithstanding that the appellant\u2019s filing may have been within the governing statutory provisions outlined in the Election Law Article, his failure diligently to pursue his challenge left this Court, as well as the court below, a very brief time in which to consider and decide this matter. <em>See Lubin v. Thomas </em>213 Ariz. 496, 144 P.3d 510, 512 (2006) (noting that \u201cmerely complying with the time limits [of a state statute] for filing notice of appeal may be insufficient if the appellant does not also promptly prosecute the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Second, it is clear that the court in <em>Melendez </em>was more concerned with the prejudice to the candidate than it was with prejudice to the electorate itself. This, perhaps, can be attributed to the additional time afforded to the court in making its decision, again, over a month, and the additional time available to the State\u2019s Election Division Director of the Secretary of State to make the requisite changes to the ballot, as well as any other election processes that had already taken place.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>This Court, however, was not afforded that luxury. This Court could not, without causing a substantial encumbrance to the State\u2019s entire elections process, address the merits of this case. Moreover, and more important, the harm caused by the appellant\u2019s tardy filing did not only extend to the candidate himself, but to the State Board and the millions of voters of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">On the issue of prejudice, the Circuit Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cMr. Gansler cannot be prejudiced because if, in fact, he does not meet the eligibility requirements, he ought not to be on the ballot. The SBE is not prejudiced because it is undisputed that at this late date, there is nothing that can be done to alter the makeup of the ballot for this election. In fact, if this Court were to determine that Mr. Gansler is not eligible to run for the office of the Attorney General, other remedies are available to preserve the integrity of the election process and to give the voters the choice of qualified candidates that they deserve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Again, we do not agree. To begin, Gansler relied on the State Board\u2019s initial certification of his candidacy and, later, its certification of the results of the primary election, which confirmed him as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for the office of the Attorney General in the general election. For Gansler, the appellant\u2019s dilatory challenge was, indeed, prejudicial, as it could have been brought long before not just the general election but the primary election as well. The appellant\u2019s challenge, in fact, could have been brought at any time after Gansler\u2019s June 28, 2006 filing of his certification of candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Next, the State Board also relied upon the accuracy of the ballots for both the primary and general elections. At the time the instant case was filed, the State Board had completed extensive, and was proceeding with other, elections preparations. The State Board, more specifically, had printed ballots, received back tens of thousands of absentee ballots, and completed most of its programming and testing of electronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>voting machines.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Contrary to the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling, we believe that, with just five days until the election, the State Board\u2019s inability to \u201calter the makeup of the ballot\u201d was, in fact, cause for prejudice. With insufficient time to reprogram, install, and test voting machines, and to redesign, reorder, reprint, and distribute absentee and provisional ballots, the State Board was, indeed, prejudiced, particularly since, once again, the appellant\u2019s action could have been brought long before the eve of the general election. This Court, moreover, does not agree with the Circuit Court that the State Board, in fact, did have \u201cother remedies\u201d available to it, and would posit, further, that eleventh-hour, ballot-access challenges such as the one in the case <em>sub judice </em>threaten the exercise of the most fundamental right granted to Maryland citizens as members of a free society.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Last, and paramount to this case, the appellant\u2019s delay prejudiced the electorate as a whole. The relief sought by the appellant, <em>i.e. </em>the removal of Gansler\u2019s name from the ballot, or, in the alternative, signs being posted to indicate Gansler\u2019s ineligibility to voters, would have caused a great deal of uncertainty in the entire election process. The confusion that would have resulted from such last-minute changes would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>have, indubitably, interfered with the rights of Maryland voters, particularly those who had already cast absentee ballots, causing them to be disenfranchised and the value of their votes diluted as they would not be able to vote again. The <em>Lubin </em>Court commented on the importance of absentee voting in the context of election challenges, and, in fact, articulated a more stringent guideline for those bringing such claims. The court stated that \u201c[t]ime is of particular importance because all disputes must be resolved before the printing of absentee ballots.\u201d 144 P.3d at 512. The court went on to say that \u201c[u]nreasonable delay can therefore prejudice the administration of justice by compelling the court to \u2018steamroll through ... delicate legal issues in order to meet\u2019 the ballot printing deadlines.\u201d <em>Id., quoting Mathieu v. Mahoney, </em>174 Ariz. 456, 851 P.2d 81, 84 (1993); <em>State ex rel. Fidanque v. Paulus, </em>297 Or. 711, 688 P.2d 1303, 1308 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">While we recognize and respect the seriousness of the appellant\u2019s claim, we hold that the Circuit Court erred in failing to apply the equitable doctrine of laches to bar the appellant\u2019s claim, as his actions, coupled with the less favorable position in which Gansler, the State Board, and the electorate as a whole were placed, were too disruptive of the election apparatus to be consistent with the objective of an orderly election. Allowing challenges to be brought at such a late date would call into question the value and the quality of our entire elections process and would only serve as a catalyst for future challenges. Such delayed challenges go to the core of our democratic system and cannot be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">It is for the forgoing reasons that we vacated the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\">. Abrams filed his action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on July 13, 2006. In it, he sought an order declaring that Perez did not have the qualifications required for the office of the Attorney General and injunctions requiring Perez to withdraw his certificate of candidacy and prohibiting Linda H. Lamone, in her official capacity as the State Administrator of Elections, and the State Board of Elections from placing Perez\u2019s name on the ballot as a candidate for the office of the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. This Court filed a Per Curiam Order on August 25, 2006, holding that Perez was not qualified to run for the office of the Attorney General and that his name was to be removed from the primary election ballot. The appellees sought modification of the portion of the Order that required Perez\u2019s name to be removed from the ballot because they claimed, with only 18 days remaining before the primary election, that it was impossible for them to reprogram voting machines or reorder paper ballots for absentee and provisional voters in order to prepare an entirely new ballot. This Court granted the appellees\u2019 motion and issued a modified Per Curiam Order on August 29, 2006. That Order directed the local boards of elections to post notices conspicuously in each polling location to inform voters that Perez was not a candidate for the office of the Attorney General and that any votes cast for him would not be counted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">. The appellees, Lamone and the State Board, claimed, in addition, that the appellant\u2019s action is barred by \u00a7 12-202 of the Election Law Article, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>specifically \u00a7 12-202(b)(2), <em>see infra </em>note 7, at <em>4, </em>the applicable statute of limitations. They argued that the action needed to have been brought within three days of the certification of the primary election results by the State Board. Because that occurred on September 26, 2006, the appellant, they submit, should have brought his action by September 29, 2006. We, however, need not address this issue, as we are disposing of the appellant\u2019s claim on the equitable theory of laches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">.

It is important to note that we do not express an opinion as to the merits of the case <em>sub judice. </em>Unlike the application of law to facts, findings of fact are entitled to substantial deference. <em>See Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420, 429 (2001) (\"We extend great deference to the fact finding of the [trial] court and accept the facts as found by that court unless clearly erroneous\"). <em>See also Friendly Finance Corp. v.

In that case, the court articulated the policy concerns that underlie standard of review jurisprudence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\"Structurally, appellate courts have several advantages over trial courts in deciding questions of law. First, appellate judges are freer to concentrate on the legal questions because they are not encumbered, as are trial judges, by the vital, but time-consuming, process of hearing evidence. Second, the judgment of at least three members of an appellate panel is brought to bear on every case. It stands to reason that the collaborative, deliberative process of appellate courts reduces the risk of judicial error on questions of law. Thus, de novo review of questions of law, like clearly erroneous review of questions of fact, serves to minimize judicial error by assigning to the court best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>positioned to decide the issue the primary responsibility for doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In addition, on the appropriate standard of review for a lower court\u2019s application of law to facts, the court specifically enunciated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201d[T]he concerns of judicial administration will generally favor the appellate court, justifying de novo review. This is so because usually the application of law to fact will require the consideration of legal concepts and involve the exercise of judgment about the values underlying legal principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">.
