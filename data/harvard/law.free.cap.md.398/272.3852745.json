Miller, </em>169 Md.App. 321, 901 A.2d 229 (2006), in favor of the Comptroller of Maryland, respondent. In simple terms, this case involves whether an employee of the State is entitled to be paid as \u201cwork time\u201d for the entire time spent driving from home directly to an out-of-regular workplace site, or whether the employee\u2019s normal commute time to the regular workplace is to be deducted from the time spent driving to the out-of-workplace site. To resolve this issue, we must examine the relationship between two regulatory schemes pertaining to State employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The problem in this case arises because the provision of the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) that regulates the entitlement of \u201ctime\u201d compensation requires that such compensation be awarded \u201cin accordance\u201d with the provisions of another regulatory scheme that regulates the entitlement to mileage compensation. Petitioner asserts that the time compensation statute should not be deemed to be qualified by the limitation language of the mileage compensation. Respondent argues otherwise, in the process pointing out certain absurd results that might occur if the Court were to adopt petitioner\u2019s position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In separate proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, petitioner\u2019s position prevailed. The Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>reversed. We granted certiorari. <em>Miller v. Comptroller, </em>395 Md. 56, 909 A.2d 259 (2006). Before this Court, petitioner presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cI. Does COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j) entitle employees to compensation for all time spen[t] traveling between home and a work site other than the assigned office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cII. Does the law require that Petitioner's] remedy be limited to compensation for 20 days prior to the filing of her grievance?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We answer no to the first question, yes to the second and, in so doing, affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Petitioner\u2019s job in the Comptroller\u2019s office, Financial Compliance Officer, required her to conduct audits at field locations going directly to remote locations from her home. At the time petitioner began working in that office, the Comptroller\u2019s policy was that an employee who was required to drive directly to a remote work site from her home was entitled to time compensation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for only that period of time that exceeded her normal commute time by thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Approximately two years after she began her employment, she met with a representative of the Maryland Classified Employees Association who informed her that the Comptroller was required to pay her for the time from when she left her home, until she arrived at a remote audit location. Petitioner then filed a grievance with the Comptroller in which she sought payment for her time from home to the remote audit location. A decision was issued in the first step of the grievance process which authorized compensation for all travel time <em>in excess of petitioner\u2019s normal commute time, </em>but the period of such compensation was limited to commutes taking place within a 30 day period prior to the filing of the griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>anee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner appealed that first-step decision, contending that she should be entitled to compensation for the entire period of her travel to a remote site and not just the period of time in excess of her normal commute. She also challenged the 30 day limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The decision in the second-step appeal was rendered by a Deputy Comptroller who affirmed the first-step decision except that he reduced the 30 day period to 20 days in order to comply with Maryland Code (1993, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 12-203(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In affirming the commute-time issue, the Deputy Comptroller recognized the interrelationship between the two regulations at issue here and quoted with approval the finding of the Director of the Compliance Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201c T believe that COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), incorporating the Standard Travel Regulations, is intending to apply the quoted mileage reimbursement concept in determining whether an employee is on work time or commute time. Applying that concept to this situation, for those days when Ms. Miller does not travel to her assigned office, she would properly be viewed as being on work time for all time directly connected with the business trip, in excess of her normal commute time.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Petitioner then filed a third-step appeal to the Secretary of Budget and Management, who delegated the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings. Petitioner\u2019s position appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>be that she was entitled to financial time compensation for every minute of time she was driving directly from her home to a remote work site, even if the commute time to the remote site was less than her normal commute time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Comptroller argued that adopting petitioner\u2019s position on this point could lead to absurd results. Petitioner also asserted that she was entitled to back compensatory pay despite the limitation of the 20 day period that had been one aspect of the Deputy Comptroller\u2019s decision. Both sides, with an important exception, then proffered testimony with respect to their positions to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The exception was that petitioner chose not to put on evidence of the actual hours for which she contended she was entitled to compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On the primary issue, the ALJ decided on behalf of petitioner and against the Comptroller. In pertinent part, the ALJ opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cThe Board of Public Work\u2019s Standard Travel Regulations apply to all executive branch State employees. CO-MAR 23.02.01.02B(14) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">\u2018(14) \u201cTravel status\u201d means the condition of a State employee while traveling on State business. An employee is not in travel status while commuting from home to the employee\u2019s assigned office, regardless of the length of time of that commute.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Thus, by promulgated regulation, it is the policy of all executive agencies in the State (unless otherwise exempted) that an employee traveling from home to a field site, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>not to the employee\u2019s assigned office, is on \u201cwork time\u2019 and in \u2018travel status.\u2019 An employee is to be paid or compensated for \u2018work time.\u2019 When traveling to a field site, an employee is working for the State, \u2018on the clock\u2019 so to speak, from the time the employee leaves the residence or the place from which the normal commute to the assigned office would begin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201cWith regard to reimbursing travel time, the Agency currently subtracts out the estimated, round trip travel time to the assigned office on those days when an employee does not commute to the employee\u2019s assigned office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThere is no direct legal authority to allow the agency to deduct from an employee compensation for the work time while on travel status.... I am not persuaded by the agency\u2019s argument on that point. I conclude that [petitioner] has met her burdens to show that the Agency misapplied the statewide policy in formulating its own travel time policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201c[Petitioner] offered no credible evidence regarding the calculation of uncompensated work hours.... \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Ultimately, however, the ALJ dismissed the grievance, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201cI conclude, as a matter of law, that [petitioner] demonstrated that the Agency\u2019s revised travel time policy did not conform to law and regulation. I further conclude, however, that [petitioner] did not meet her burdens with regard to demonstrating that she is entitled to compensation for certain, uncompensated work time.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Both parties sought judicial review. The Circuit Court agreed with the ALJ that the Comptrollers revised travel policy was not supported by law. That court, however, remanded the case back to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a further hearing, presumably in order for petitioner to present evidence before an ALJ to establish what compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>sation she was due. The Comptroller appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and that court reversed the decision of the Circuit Court and the decision of the AL J.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">II.

In <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\n<em>A Compensation for Commuting to a Non-Regular Work Site.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">This case requires us to interpret the rules of an agency of this State.

Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 592-93, 457 A.2d 1146, 1149 (1983), that \u201cthe interpretation of an agency rule is governed by the same principles that govern the interpretation of a Statute.\u201d We have often stated the rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature. <em>Fish Market v.

The only logical interpretation of that language, used in this context, is that the regulation contemplates the application of the requirements of the Standard Travel Regulations.

Compensating employees for their entire travel time to a remote work site, without consideration of regular commute time, would lead to unjust enrichment of the employee, who would ordinarily have spent a portion of that time traveling to the regular work site. Commute time is not work time, and an employee who is on travel status is not entitled to compensation for either the mileage or the time that the employee regularly spends to commute. We decline to endorse a facially absurd result that is blatantly unfair to the taxpayers and results in a windfall to the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Miller, </em>169 Md.App. at 352, 901 A.2d at 247. We too decline to endorse a result that would require employees to be paid for non-work time just because they were at a remote work site when they would not be entitled to be paid for non-work time if they were assigned and traveling to their regular work site. Such a result is clearly illogical and absurd. The only logical interpretation for the inclusion in the regulation at issue here of the requirement that the Standard Travel Regulations apply, was to make the process of mileage and time compensation consistent. We affirm the Court of Special Appeals on the first issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>B. Twenty Day Limitation on Filing of Grievances.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">There is no authority for petitioner\u2019s claim, by way of the grievance process, for an award of any compensation claimed prior to 20 days from the filing of her grievance. Petitioner is entitled to be compensated as provided in Deputy Comptroller Cordi\u2019s November 12, 2003, \u201cManagement Decision.\u201d In order to comply with \u00a7 12-303(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, Deputy Comptroller Cordi correctly changed the Comptroller\u2019s policy to allow a grievant to recover for acts occurring within 20 days prior to the filing of the grievance (as opposed to the previous, and incorrect, 30 day limitation). Thus, the Deputy Comptroller\u2019s decision cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>rectly allowed petitioner to be compensated for all acts occurring within the 20 days prior to her filing a grievance on August 7, 2003. We affirm the Court of Special Appeals on this second question as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j) does not entitle employees to compensation for all time spent traveling between home and a work site other than their assigned office and that \u00a7 12-203(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article requires a remedy to be limited to compensation for claims existing within 20 days prior to the initiation of a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

As far as we know, the time compensation at issue in this case involves financial compensation, or not, for the time expended. We need not address time for time compensation in this case. They may, or may not, be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. At approximately the same time, the Comptroller formally changed the policy, eliminating the compensation condition that limited compensation to periods of time in excess of thirty minutes of an employee's normal commute. The new policy permitted compensation for any such period that was in excess of normal commute times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">.

By this point in the proceedings, the Deputy Comptroller had brought the pre-grievance period from 30 days down to 20 days in order to comply with the statute mentioned, <em>supra. </em>Additionally, the Office of the Comptroller had conceded that its former policy of not compensating for any time until an employee had exceeded the period of his normal commute by more than 30 minutes was incorrect and had changed the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">. Apparently, petitioner had elected to address the issue of the actual entitlement after a ruling by the ALJ, if that ruling was in her favor, by then submitting time sheets and the like to the Office of the Comptroller or other appropriate agency. This lack of evidence would impact one aspect of the ALJ's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\">.

There is no dispute of fact in the present case that is pertinent to our present inquiry. The issues before this Court involve pure questions of law. Moreover, we have been directed to no prior agency, or AU decisions, construing the statutes at issue here and their relationship with each other. There appears to be no longstanding, or any prior, position at the administrative level in respect to these statutes, thus, this appears to be a case of first impression. As such, in the present case, the decision of the agency below is owed less deference then that owed to longstanding positions of administrative bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">In cases such as that here presented, where the delegated ALJ takes a position exactly opposite of the position directly taken by the Agency, an issue can also arise as to what entity does a court owe deference (if any is due). This is a determination that will ultimately need to be decided. In light of our decision, it need not be done in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Dissenting Opinion by BATTAGLIA, J., which HARRELL, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The crux of the present case requires us to determine whether a State employee is entitled to be paid for the time spent driving from home to a work site other than the assigned workplace. The majority holds that an employee is not entitled to be paid for the entire commute, but only for the amount of time exceeding the employee\u2019s normal commute. Additionally, the majority finds that an employee seeking compensation for that time would only be entitled to compensation for acts occurring twenty days prior to the filing of the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">In the present case, the Administrative Law Judge determined that under COMAR 17.04.11.02 B(l)(j), an employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to be compensated for \u201cwork time\u201d when traveling between home and a work site other than the assigned office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">No statute directly addresses how executive branch agencies are to define, and compensate employees for, \u201cwork time,\u201d \u201ccommute time\u201d or \u201ctravel time.\u201d COMAR 17.04.11.02B provides ... \u201cWork time includes time during which an employee ... [tjravels between home and a work site other than the assigned office, in accordance with the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 23.02.01.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">The Board of Public Work\u2019s Standard Travel Regulations apply to all executive branch State employees. COMAR 23.02.01.02B(14) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">(14) \u201cTravel status\u201d means the condition of a State employee while traveling on State business. An employee is not in travel status while commuting from home to the employee\u2019s assigned office, regardless of the length of time of that commute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Thus, by promulgated regulation, it is the policy of all executive agencies in the State (unless otherwise exempted) that an employee traveling from home to a field site, and not to the employee\u2019s assigned office, is on \u201cwork time\u201d and in \u201ctravel status.\u201d An employee is to be paid or compensated for \u201cwork time.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(a) through (l) (list of instances that qualify as compensable work time). When traveling to a field site, an employee is working for the State, \u201con the clock\u201d so to speak, from the time the employee leaves the residence or the place from which the normal commute to the assigned office would begin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">In the instant case, under its revised policy (Joint Ex. # 2) the Agency automatically, subtracts out (refuses to compensate for) time equal to an employee\u2019s normal, estimated commute time from home to the employee\u2019s assigned office and back home again when the employee travels to a field site. The Agency argues that the policy is analogous to the Private Mileage Reimbursement policy contained in the Department of Budget and Management\u2019s Vehicle Fleet policy (Joint Ex. # 3, p. 17-18). That policy is one in which mileage equal to an estimated, average round trip commute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to an assigned office is subtracted out of the total miles traveled to and from a field site, for purposes of reimbursing an employee who uses a personal automobile for travel to a field site. With regard to reimbursing travel time,, the Agency currently subtracts \u25a0 out the estimated round trip travel time to the assigned office on those days when an employee does not commute to the employee\u2019s assigned office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">I conclude that the present policy of the Agency is arbitrary and inconsistent with law and regulations. There is no direct legal authority to allow the Agency to deduct from an . employee compensation for the work time while on travel status. Moreover, if an employee has two or more residences, or two or more places from which an estimated commute to the assigned office begins, the automatic deduction policy becomes unmanageable. The Agency attempted to argue that if the travel time to a field site were shorter than the estimated commute time to the assigned office, then the employee would somehow be unjustly compensated and therefore that interpretation of the law and regulations would lead to an absurd result. I am not persuaded by the Agency\u2019s argument on that point. I conclude that [Ms. Miller] \u2022 has met her burdens to show that the Agency misapplied the statewide policy in formulating its own travel time policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City agreed with the Administrative Law Judge that the Comptroller\u2019s revised travel policy was not supported by law; the Circuit Court, however, remanded the case back to the Office of Administrative Hearings'for further hearings to establish the appropriate remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATf\">The Court has further reviewed the entire record and finds that there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Administrative Law Judge that the Comptroller of Maryland (the Agency) misapplied the statewide policy in formulating its own travel policy (A.L.J: Decision at 8). The Court further finds that the Administrative Law Judge applied the correct principles of law to this matter. The Court, though, is not persuaded that the Comptroller of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Maryland, on these facts, should prevail in having the grievance denied and complaint dismissed by the Administrative Law Judge because of a finding that Petitioner Miller offered no credible evidence regarding the calculation of uncompensated work hours. Accordingly, this Court remands the case to the Administrative Law Judge for further proceedings to determine what, if any, compensation should be awarded Petitioner Miller for travel she undertook to any remote work site. Consistent with all other aspects of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, Petitioner Miller\u2019s grievance will be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed with the Circuit Court and the Administrative Law Judge, and reversed; the majority affirms the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">What the majority does is fail to apply the appropriate standard of review and it further confuses our jurisprudence, which we recently correctly explicated in <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmX\"><em>\u201cA </em>court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u2018 \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">\u201cDespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u2018substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.

The majority concludes, however, that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision in the present case permitting payment to the employee for the entire time she is at a remote work site and in transit thereto should be given only slight deference \u201cat best.\u201d Op. at 282, 920 A.2d at 472-73. This is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">As pointed out in <em>Banks, </em>\u201c[djespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a \u2018court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency\u201d \u2019.\u201d 354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 381 (footnote omitted). Judge Eldridge, writing for this Court in <em>Noland, </em>further agreed that such language is disapproved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">The \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d language is misleading and inaccurate for several reasons. It suggests, with respect to legal issues, that no deference whatsoever is owed to the agency\u2019s decision. That is not the law. In an action for judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision, the \u201ccourt must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it,\u201d and \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid.\u201d In addition, the agency\u2019s interpretations and applications of statutory or regulatory provisions \u201cwhich the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>\u201cFurthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In the context of a determination by an agency or official in the Executive Branch o f the State Government, the term \u201cjudgment\u201d is often used to mean the exercise of discretion, such as an official exercising \u201cgood judgment.\u201d Obviously a court may not substitute its exercise of discretion for that exercised by the Executive Branch agency or official.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">If there is a need to articulate a \u201cstandard\u201d for judicial review of an agency\u2019s legal rulings, it is sufficient to say that a reviewing court must \u201cdetermine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGp\"><em>Id. </em>at 573-74 n. 3, 873 A.2d at 1155-56 n. 3 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).

A </em>grievance procedure must be initiated by an employee within 20 days after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">(1) the occurrence of the alleged act that is the basis of the grievance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">(2) the employee first knew of or reasonably should have known of the alleged act that is the basis of the grievance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Maryland Code (1993, 2004 RepLVol.), Section 12-203 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. The remedies available to a successful grievant are enumerated under Section 12-402, which in part provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">the remedies available to a grievant under this title are limited to the restoration of the rights, pay, status, or benefits that the grievant otherwise would have had if the contested policy, procedure, or regulation had been applied appropriately as determined by the final decision maker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), Section 12-4102 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that a grievant\u2019s remedy is limited to recovery for acts occurring within the twenty days prior to the filing of the grievance, however, creates an unfounded connection between Sections 12-203 and 12-402. Section 12-303 delineates the requirement of when an individual must file a grievance, and Section 12-402 independently supplies the remedies available if the grievance is successful, without any twenty-day limitation. We have noted the independence of the state employee grievance system steps, remarking in <em>Walker v. Department of Human Resources, </em>379 Md. 407, 842 A.2d 53 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>With certain exceptions, \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 through 12-205 create a three-step procedure for resolving grievances. Step 1, provided for in \u00a7 12-203, is the filing of a written grievance with the employee\u2019s \u201cappointing authority\u201d within 20 days after (1) the occurrence of the alleged act that is the basis of the grievance, or (2) the employee first knew or should have known of that act. Within 10 days after receiving the grievance, the appointing authority, through its designee, is required to confer with the employee and attempt to resolve the grievance, and within 10 days after that conference, to issue a written decision in which any relief permissible under \u00a7 12-402(a) may be awarded. That relief is limited to restoration of rights, pay, status, or benefits that the employee otherwise would have had if the contested policy, procedure, or regulation had been properly applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 410, 842 A.2d at 55. <em>See also Wilson v. Simms, </em>380 Md. 206, 225, 844 A.2d 412, 424 (2004) (\u201cIn a grievance proceeding, an administrative law judge or final decision maker is authorized by Section 12-303 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.) to grant \u2018any appropriate remedy\u2019 available under Section 12-402(a).... Section 12-402(a) defines the remedies that may be provided to aggrieved state employees\u201d); <em>Comptroller v. Nelson, </em>345 Md. 706, 710 n. 6, 694 A.2d 468, 470 n. 6 (1997) (remarking that Section 12-102 provides the remedies available successful grievants under the state employee grievance system). The General Assembly could not have intended the remedies available under Section 12-402 to be restricted by Section 12-203\u2019s filing requirements when the grievant, such as Ms. Miller in this case, timely files her grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">By holding as it does, the majority adopts a view of \u201cwork time\u201d unsupported by the express definition of the term and impermissibly restricts the statutorily prescribed remedies available to successful grievants. I disagree, and would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Judge HARRELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">. The majority\u2019s holding also may have ramifications, unfortunately, for the doctrines*of vicarious liability and <em>respondeat superior. </em>By sanctioning the interpretation that some amount of time during which an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>employee is traveling to a remote work site at the direction of her employer is not compensable, the majority appears to be saying that she would not be acting within her scope of employment. Our jurisprudence has supported the notion that a person traveling to a remote work site, other than her normal commute, is acting within the scope of employment, without eliminating the normal commute distance. <em>See Regal Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>A.S. Abell Co., </em>163 Md. 525, 163 A. 845 (1933). In <em>Regal Laundry Co., </em>the contention was that a reporter for the Baltimore Sun was not acting in the scope of employment when he was traveling to Crisfield and back on Sunpaper business. We held that he was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident when he was returning from his assignment to the Sunpaper\u2019s office in Baltimore. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 163 A. at 848. <em>See also Dhanraj v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>305 Md. 623, 631, 506 A.2d 224, 228 (1986) (recognizing that remote work place travel, if authorized by the employer, and in employee\u2019s vehicle as authorized by the employer, can be the basis for <em>respondeat superior </em>liability).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
