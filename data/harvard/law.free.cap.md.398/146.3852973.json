Perez (\u201cPerez\u201d), an attorney and law professor, one of the appellees, to run for the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Attorney General of Maryland in the 2006 Gubernatorial Primary Election. Article V, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution prescribes the qualifications for that office. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201cNo person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney-General, who is not a citizen of this State, and a qualified voter therein, and has not resided and <em>practiced Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">MD CONST, art. V, \u00a7 4 (emphasis added). Today, we address whether a combination of membership in the Maryland Bar for five years, fewer than the ten years prescribed, and the practice of law for more than ten years, much of it being done at the federal level, suffices to meet the constitutional requirements of Article Y, Section 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In analyzing past and present bar admission requirements of this State, the historical role of the Attorney General, and other Constitutional provisions which were in existence at the time of Article V, Section 4\u2019s adoption, we shall hold that a candidate for the office of the Attorney General must be a member of the <em>Maryland </em>Bar for at least ten years and must be a practitioner of law in <em>Maryland </em>for an identical requisite period.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Perez announced his candidacy for the office of the Attorney General on May 23, 2006. Before doing so, recognizing that there was a potential question as to his eligibility, i.e. the sufficiency of his professional credentials, to serve as Attorney General, in a letter dated May 8, 2006 and \u201cin the continued spirit of thoroughness and due diligence ... as to whether [he] met the eligibility requirements of [Article V,] Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he requested an advisory opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ion from the office of the Attorney General.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that letter, Perez related his career, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1987, Perez was admitted to the New York Bar in 1988 and clerked for a federal judge in Colorado until 1989. He moved to Maryland after the clerkship and accepted a position with the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), through its Attorney General\u2019s Honors Program. He remained in that position, performing various functions within the Department, until 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In his first position, as a federal prosecutor in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, which he held from 1989 to 1994, and which was based in the District of Columbia headquarters of the Department, Perez investigated and prosecuted criminal civil rights cases nationwide. In that capacity, he was \u201cresponsible for directing the investigation of the case, discussing the matter with the local Assistant United States Attorney, FBI agent or other investigator, making a determination of whether a case merited prosecution, and then prosecuting the case, if [it] merited prosecution.\u201d Some of the cases on his docket were Maryland cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In 1994, Perez was promoted to the Deputy Chief of the Section. His responsibilities in that position included supervising all cases that occurred in Maryland. This required him to consult with \u201cany attorney in the Section desiring to pursue an investigation or prosecution in Maryland[.]\u201d He also reviewed briefs and discussed strategies with the attorneys he supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In 1995, while remaining a DOJ employee, Perez was detailed from the Civil Rights Division to the minority staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a fluctuating basis, i.e. he worked in both positions, staying, on an alternating basis, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>few months in each. While with the Judiciary Committee, Perez worked on various bills that had widespread impact in areas such as juvenile crime, immigration, and civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In 1998, Perez was appointed the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, one of the four highest ranking positions in the Division. In that position, he oversaw the Criminal, Education, and Employment Sections, which entailed roughly 30% of all litigation activities within the Division. Several of the cases had a geographic anchor in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In 1999, Perez left the Justice Department and became the Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In that capacity, Perez \u201cled a 220 person agency whose mission was to enforce civil rights laws in the health and human service context across the country,\u201d acting as a \u201clegal strategist, case supervisor, manager, and policy maker.\u201d His nationwide caseload included cases from Maryland involving Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. None of the Maryland cases involved litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Perez left federal service in January, 2001. He joined the faculty of the University of Maryland School of Law as an Assistant Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Law Programs in April 2001. Also in that year, Perez took the Maryland lawyer\u2019s bar examination and was admitted to practice in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">As Director of Clinical Law Programs, Perez supervised students who handled real cases and were permitted to appear in court pursuant to Maryland\u2019s student practice rule (Rule 16).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He supervised those programs from 2001 until 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>When, in 2003, Perez was elected to the Montgomery County Council, he resigned his position of Clinic Director, although he remained a member of the faculty. Perez recently was promoted from Assistant Professor of Law to Associate Professor of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Based on the information provided by Perez,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Attorney General, on May 19, 2006, issued an opinion, 91 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>99 (2006), concluding that Perez was qualified to hold the office of the Attorney General. Attorney General Curran reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u2018While the State Constitution explicitly requires that a candidate for Attorney General have practiced law in the State for 10 years and implicitly requires that the candidate be admitted to the State bar, it neither explicitly nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>implicitly requires that a candidate have accumulated all of that experience while a member of the State bar. Practice in Maryland authorized by federal and State law counts toward the durational experience requirement in the Maryland Constitution, even if that work was performed while the attorney was not a member of the Maryland bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdU\"><em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Relying on this opinion, Perez, as we have seen, announced his candidacy for the office of the Attorney General and, on June 19,2006, formally registered his candidacy with the State Board of Elections (\u201cthe State Board\u201d). By filing, pursuant to \u00a7 5-301(a)(l)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article, a certificate of candidacy, he certified, under oath,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that, among other things, he was \u201ca registered voter and a citizen of Maryland and [met] all other [constitutional] requirements for the ... office [of the Attorney General].\u201d The State Board accepted Perez\u2019s certificate and, pursuant to \u00a7 5-601(1)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article, placed his name on the ballot for the 2006 Primary Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>On July 13, 2006, Mr. Stephen N. Abrams (\u201cAbrams\u201d), the appellant, a registered voter in Maryland and a Republican candidate for the office of Comptroller of Maryland,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> filed, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, an action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 9-209(b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 12-202(b)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Election Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Article, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against Perez, Ms. Linda H. Lamone (\u201cLamone\u201d), in her official capacity as the State Administrator of Elections, and the State Board, collectively, \u201cthe appellees.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Abrams sought an order declaring that Perez did not have the qualifications required for the office of the Attorney General, an injunction requiring Perez to withdraw his certificate of candidacy, and an injunction prohibiting Lamone and the State Board from placing Perez\u2019s name on the ballot for Attorney General. He argued that, under \u00a7 5-301 (b)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article, it was the State Board\u2019s duty to determine whether Perez met all of the qualifications prescribed by the election laws, including constitutional requirements as to his eligibility to run for, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>thus, to hold the office of the Attorney General.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The appellees, defendants below, responded by filing dispositive motions. Perez filed a Motion to Dismiss and/or Motion for Summary Judgment, principally on the ground that he met the qualifications prescribed by Article V, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution. Lamone and the State Board filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Expedite Scheduling. They contended that Abrams\u2019 action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and by laches and that their sole interest in the action was in ensuring an orderly administration of the election process, the deadlines of which would be jeopardized if the action were not adjudicated expeditiously. The Circuit Court held a hearing on the motions, at the conclusion of which it issued its oral opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The Circuit Court first addressed the issue of the timeliness of the appellant\u2019s action under \u00a7 12-202(b) of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court rejected the appellees\u2019 argument that the relevant \u201cact or omission\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>was Perez\u2019s filing of his certificate of candidacy, which occurred on June 19, 2006, and their contention that the appellant should have known about that filing earlier. Instead, the Circuit Court concluded that the operative and critical date and, therefore, the relevant, statutory determinant was July 3, 2006, the filing deadline.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It explained, \u201cto the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>there may have been errors ... [the filing deadline] is sort of the closing bell, if you will.... \u201d There was, in the court\u2019s opinion, no other more reliable measure of the appellant\u2019s knowledge than the filing deadline itself, when the appellant would be charged with knowledge of Perez\u2019s candidacy. Because, the court ruled, the appellant\u2019s motion was filed on July 13, 2006, within ten days of the filing deadline, it was within the period prescribed for filing for judicial review, and, therefore, timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Circuit Court also was not persuaded by the laches argument advanced by Lamone and the State Board. Noting that laches' would apply \u201cif the claimant neglected to prosecute the matter in such a way that it cause[d]\u2014as a result of [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>passage of time ... the adversary to be prejudiced,\u201d it was satisfied that the appellant was not, in any way, dilatory in his actions<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, thus, that the State Board was not prejudiced. Accordingly, the Circuit Court denied the motion to dismiss for laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The Circuit Court, finally, addressed the constitutional issue of Perez\u2019s eligibility to hold the office of the Attorney General, pursuant to Article V, \u00a7 4. Believing the question to be whether Perez has \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years,\u201d more specifically: \u201c[d]o you have to be a Maryland Bar member for at least 10 years because only a Maryland Bar member can practice law in the State of Maryland?,\u201d the Circuit Court answered, \u201cno.\u201d It reasoned, relying on <em>Kennedy v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Montgomery County, </em>316 Md. 646, 561 A.2d 200 (1989), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bridges, </em>360 Md. 489, 759 A.2d 233 (2000) and <em>In the Matter of R.G.S., </em>312 Md. 626, 637, 541 A.2d 977, 982 (1988), that one \u201ccan practice law in the State of Maryland without being a member of the Maryland Bar\u201d and that Perez\u2019s federal practice does, indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>satisfy the \u201cpracticed Law\u201d requirement under Article V, \u00a7 4. <em>Kennedy, </em>it stated, stood for the proposition that one \u201ccan have essentially a federal practice in the State of Maryland even if [one] is not a member of the Maryland Bar,\u201d while <em>Bridges, </em>citing, with approval, <em>Sperry v. Florida, </em>373 U.S. 379, 83 S.Ct. 1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428 (1963), recognized an attorney\u2019s right to maintain a legal practice restricted to the federal courts prior to admission to that state\u2019s bar. The Circuit Court concluded, as to <em>R.G.S.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cI also find it significant that the Court of Appeals in that case cited with approval an Attorney General\u2019s opinion, '68 opinion/[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] And cited among other things the provision of that opinion that recognized that the phrase such as \u2018practice of law\u2019 may mean different things in different contexts and specifically as used in Article 5, Section 4 of the Constitution relating to the qualifications for the Office of the AG, the phrase ... \u2018means something quite different and less restricted than the meaning of the phrase \u2018practice of law1 for the purpose of Rule 14 or any unauthorized practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Circuit Court also observed that \u201cthe plain language [of Article V, \u00a7 4] says absolutely nothing about being a member of the bar because frankly that had a whole different import back in that day than it may have now.\u201d Recalling the history of bar admissions in Maryland, the Circuit Court noted that there was no formal, state\u2014wide bar admission process until 1898,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that, at the time, there was no \u201cfederal law\u201d as we know it today, and despite the fact that the framers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Maryland Constitution could not have contemplated a situation in which the phrase \u201cpracticed Law in this State\u201d could have meant something other than what they intended it to mean\u2014 the practice of state law in Maryland, the Circuit Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201c[T]he plain language ... leads ... to the inescapable conclusion that it [the phrase \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years\u201d] simply requires that someone have practiced for at least ten years in the State of Maryland, but that [it is] not tantamount to being a member of the Maryland Bar ... [and] that as a factual matter he [Perez] has practiced law. That as a legal matter that practice occurred in Maryland. And accordingly that under Section 4 of Article 5 of the Maryland Constitution he is eligible to stand for election as Attorney General.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The court thus granted Perez\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and denied the appellant\u2019s cross-motion. In response to that ruling, the appellant noted an appeal both to this Court, pursuant to \u00a7 12-203(a)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article, and to the Court of Special Appeals. In addition, he filed, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Court, a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>Abrams v. Lamone, </em>393 Md. 478, 903 A.2d 417 (2006). Oral argument was heard on August 25, 2006, and, on that same day, the Court issued its Order reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court. We now set forth the reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">When the framers of the Maryland Constitution assembled in 1774 to formulate a response to the Boston Port Act,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> they did not contemplate that just two short years later they would meet again, this time to produce a Constitution, a document that would govern the citizens of the State of Maryland. The office of the Attorney General<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was established by constitutional provision at the 1776 Maryland Convention. Section 48 of the 1776 Maryland Constitution provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\"><em>\u201cThat the governor, for the time being, with the advice and consent of the council, may appoint the chancellor, and all judges and justices, the attorney general, </em>naval officers, officers in the regular land and sea service, officers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>militia, registers of the land office, surveyors, and all other civil officers of government ... and may also suspend or remove any civil officer who has not a commission during good behaviour____\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The office of the Attorney General was later abolished by Constitutional amendment<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> proposed in 1816, Chapter 247, Acts of 1816, and ratified, February 5, 1817.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It was reestablished in 1818, pursuant to Chapter 146, Acts of 1817.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In 1821, the constitutional provision pertaining to the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>General was repealed and reenacted. <em>See </em>Chapter 126, Acts of 1821 (ratified Jan. 7, 1822). Although very similar to the previous provision pertaining to the office, of. the Attorney General, the amendment, as proposed and ratified, outlined the duties of the Attorney General in greater detail and provided for the appointment of deputies, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\"><em>\u201c[T]he governor shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the council, appoint and commission a person of sound legal knowledge, who shall be styled attorney general of Maryland, </em>and who previous to, and during his acting as such, shall reside in this state; and it shall be the duty of the said attorney general, to prosecute and defend on the part of the state, all cases now depending, or which may hereafter be brought in, or removed to <em>any of the counties of this state by or against the state, or wherein the state shall or may be interested, in the same manner, </em>as the attorney general heretofore was accustomed to do or could do; and he shall have, exercise and use all and every the powers and authorities in and relating to the same, as the attorney general heretofore had used and exercised, or can have, use and exercise in similar cases; and he shall give his opinion and advice whenever he shall be required by the general assembly, or either branch thereof, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>governor and council, or by the treasurer of the Eastern and Western Shore, or any deputy he may appoint, on any matter or subject depending before them.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">That provision remained unchanged for the next 30 years, until 1851, when, as a result of the Constitutional Convention of 1850,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the office of the Attorney General once again was abolished.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> According to Article V, \u00a7 3 of the 1850 Constitution, the Attorney General\u2019s duties were to be discharged by the state\u2019s attorney in each county and in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It provided, as pertinent, that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s Attorney shall perform the duties and receive such fees and commissions as are now prescribed by law for the Attorney General and his Deputies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The office of the Attorney General was not reestablished as part of the Maryland Constitution until 1864 when, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>first time in Maryland history, it was made an elective office.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, Article V of the 1864 Constitution, captioned, \u201cAttorney General and State\u2019s Attorney,\u201d provided a detailed statement of the duties of the office of the Attorney General, Article V, \u00a7 3, and, although prior provisions had required residency and, by implication, suggested that a candidate for Attorney General be skilled in the legal practice, as the duties included prosecuting and defending cases involving the State or in which the State had an interest, for the first time, the qualifications for the position were articulated.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEk\">Article V, \u00a7 4 of the 1864 Constitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cNo person shall be eligible to the office of attorney general who has not resided and <em>practiced law in this State for at least seven years next preceding his election.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The Maryland Constitution was revised once again, just three years later.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Although the essence of Article V, \u00a7 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>remained the same, the new provision changed the length of both the residency and practice of law requirements from seven to ten years, the length it has remained to this day. Article V, \u00a7 4 of the 1867 Constitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cNo person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney-General, who is not a citizen of this State, and a qualified voter therein, and has not resided and <em>practiced Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">MD. CON ST. 1867 art. V, \u00a7 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The appellant asserts that the Circuit Court erred in applying a broad interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 4, to find Perez eligible to hold the office of the Attorney General. He first argues, as he did below, that, under the canons of constitutional interpretation there can be only one reading of the phrase \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d That is so, the appellant submits, because the phrase is clear and unambiguous; in order to be eligible to \u201cpractice Law in this State,\u201d <em>one </em>necessarily must be admitted to the bar of the State. In sum, the appellant argues that Perez could not have been practicing law in Maryland when he was not admitted to its bar, because to have done so, he would have had to, in effect, engage in the unauthorized practice of law. The appellant, moreover, contends that the phrase should not only be given its plain, ordinary meaning but should not be liberally construed to mean anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The appellant next argues, alternatively, that, if Article V, \u00a7 4 is ambiguous, resort to its legislative history supports his contention that the framers intended the office to be held by a person admitted to the bar of the State. The historical role of the Attorney General, coupled with essential principles of bar admission in this State, confirm his position, he proffers. He asserts, further, that the 1867 Constitution, with its enumeration of the prerequisites for holding the office of the Attorney General, was clearly understood to pertain to a person admitted to practice in Maryland and, when considered in connection with the duties of the office it prescribes, to one who, due to experience, was competent to hold the office. Thus, he concludes, Article V, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> which outlined the duties of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Attorney General, was explicit in its requirement that the Attorney General had to discharge all of the duties prescribed therein <em>personally. </em>It is logical, then, the appellant argues, that the General Assembly contemplated that the Attorney General be a member of the Maryland Bar, as such membership would have permitted him to appear in the courts of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Moreover, the appellant argues that the framers of the Constitution were precise in their choice of language. Looking at other provisions of the Constitution, <em>ie. </em>Article V, \u00a7 10 and Article IV, \u00a7 2, pertaining respectively to the eligibility requirements for State\u2019s Attorney and judicial candidates, he emphasizes the difference in the language of the provisions. In both latter instances, the provision specifies expressly bar membership as a prerequisite to running for, and holding, the office. In the case of the office of the Attorney General, however, instead of an express reference to bar membership, the provision specifies the practice of law in this State for a specified period of time. This, the appellant says, supports his position. The framers, he asserts, did not omit a bar admission requirement at all; rather, they understood that such a requirement necessarily is subsumed in the phrase, \u201cpracticed Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Finally, the appellant denies that Perez\u2019s federal bar membership, and, ultimately, his practice of law as an official in the Justice Department and a member of the Maryland federal bar, even if done physically in Maryland, meet the eligibility requirements of Article V, \u00a7 4 and, therefore, makes him eligible to be Maryland\u2019s Attorney General. Federal and state bar memberships are two very distinct privileges, he posits. Thus, the appellant urges that Perez can not be said to have practiced law in Maryland, within the contemplation of the constitutional provision, at least not until he became a member of the Maryland Bar in 2001. In sum, it is the appellant\u2019s position that being a Justice Department official authorized to protect the interests of the United States throughout the country and, in that capacity and for that purpose, to appear in the state courts of Maryland, or being a member of the bar of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland does not authorize an individual not admitted to the bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland to practice law in Maryland in the sense intended by Article V, \u00a7 4, the Supremacy Clause notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Although Article V, \u00a7 4 has been considered in other contexts,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the disputed question presented for our resolution, the meaning of \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years\u201d has not been decided previously by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The general tenets of constitutional interpretation are well settled and frequently stated. \u201cGenerally speaking, the same rules that are applicable to the construction of statutory language are employed in interpreting constitutional ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>biagef.]\u201d <em>Brown v.

There can be no meaning attached to this phrase, as used in the context of Article V, \u00a7 4, other than that practicing law in Maryland requires admission to the bar of this State. The practice of law in Maryland and Maryland bar admission are coterminous; one follows from and, indeed, is dependent on the other. This has long been the case in this State. The first formal bar admission in Maryland took place in 1666 when William Calvert, Daniel Jenifer, and John Morecroft were accepted to practice by the Provincial Court. That court, formed in 1637 and consisting of the Governor and his council, was the highest court of common law in the colony, having both original and appellate jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., </em>J. Hall Pleasants, Ed. \u201cEarly Maryland County Courts\u201d <em>Proceedings of the County Court of Charles County, </em>1658-1666 (Baltimore, 1936) at xliii (\u201cIn the Provincial Court, beginning in the sixties, are to be found a few \u2018sworn attorneys\u2019 of the court,\u2019 men trained in their profession, who were formally admitted to practice, and enrolled as such in the court records\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Act of April, 1715, ch. 48, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13 (Maxcy ed., vol. 1, p. 132 (1811)) which provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cAnd be it further enacted, <em>by the authority advice and consent aforesaid, </em>That from and after the end of this present session of assembly, <em>no attorney, or other person whatsoever, shall practise the law in any of the courts of this province, without being admitted thereto by the justices of the several courts, </em>who are hereby empowered to admit and suspend them <em>(salvo jure </em>coronae) until his majesty\u2019s pleasure shall be known therein ... Provided always, That nothing in this act shall extend, or b e construed to extend, to give right to any courts of this province to admit any attorney, or other person practising the law, to practise in any court that has been already refused so to do by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>excellency, and his majesty\u2019s honourable council.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This State has had formal state\u2014-wide bar admission requirements dating back to the early 19th century. On March 10, 1833, the General Assembly enacted Laws of Maryland, Chapter 268 entitled \u201cAn act regulating the admission of Attorneys to practice law in the several Courts of this state.\u201d Chapter 268 provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cWHEREAS, under the existing laws of this state, it is in the power of the several courts of law and equity, to regulate the admission of attorneys according to their discretion, by which different rules prevail in different courts; and it is proper and right, that the mode and terms of admission should be uniform throughout this state:\u2014Therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That all applications for admission as attorney, to practice the law in this state, <em>shall be made to some one of the county courts, courts of equity or courts of appeals thereof in open court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">Sec. 2. And be it enacted, That upon every such application for admission to practice law as aforesaid ... it shall be the duty of the court to whom such application shall be made, to examine said applicant upon some day during the regular session thereof, touching his qualification for admission as an attorney, and they shall also require and receive evidence of his probity and general character, and if upon such actual examination, and being satisfied that he has been a student of law, at least two years as aforesaid, and having heard evidence as to his probity and general character, the said court shall be of opinion that said applicant is qualified to discharge the duties of an attorney and worthy to be admitted, they shall admit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Sec. 3. And be it enacted, That upon the admission of any applicant to practice law in any of the courts of record in this state as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the court so admitting him, to certify the same with their own proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>signatures, which certificate shall be recorded, and a copy thereof authenticated with the county seal of the county in which the party shall be admitted, shall be available and <em>sufficient to entitle said applicant so admitted, to practice in any of the courts of this state.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Chapter 268, Acts of 1831 (ratified March 10, 1833) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Bar membership, thus, has been, and remains, a threshold requirement for the authorized practice of law in Maryland. Although, the process by which one is \u201cadmitted to the Bar\u201d has changed over time,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the requirement of bar membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>never has. Accordingly, beginning with its adoption in 1864, and continuing to today, the phrase \u201cpracticed Law in this State\u201d has required that a person seeking to practice law in Maryland lawfully be admitted to the Maryland Bar. We, thus, reject the Circuit Court\u2019s rationale that it was not until 1898 that any uniform standards for bar admissions existed, and, accordingly, when the 1867 Constitution was adopted, the framers could not have intended that an individual who was not admitted to the bar could hold the office of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">We also reject Perez\u2019s argument that this Court should construe the eligibility requirements for a candidate seeking to hold the office of the Attorney General liberally merely because Article V, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution does not expressly require that a candidate for that office be \u201cadmitted to\u201d or be \u201ca member of\u2019 the Maryland Bar. In support of his argument, Perez relies on authority from other jurisdictions. <em>See State ex rel. Kelly v. Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 413, 639 N.E.2d 78, 79 (1994) (\u201cWords limiting the right of a person to hold office are to be given a liberal construction in favor of those seeking to hold office, in order that the public may have the benefit of choice from all those who are in fact and in law qualified\u201d), <em>quoting State ex rel. Schenck v. Shattuck, </em>1 Ohio St.3d 272, 439 N.E.2d 891, 893 (1982); <em>Sears v. Bayoud, </em>786 S.W.2d 248, 251 (Tex.1990) (\u201cWe have repeatedly recognized the principle that constitutional provisions which restrict the right to hold public office should be strictly construed against ineligibility\u201d). <em>See also </em>91 <em>Opin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>ions of the Attorney General </em>at 103 (stating that language should be resolved in favor of eligibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">This Court is not persuaded that a liberal construction of Article V, \u00a7 4 is appropriate. Indeed, we have construed eligibility requirements strictly, where the language of the constitutional provision is clear. In <em>Oglesby v. Williams, </em>372 Md. 360, 812 A.2d 1061 (2002), for example, we held that a candidate for State\u2019s Attorney did not meet the residency requirement prescribed by Article V, \u00a7 10 of the Maryland Constitution. That provision required that a candidate for State\u2019s Attorney have \u201cresided for at least two years, in the county, or city, in which he may be elected.\u201d MD CONST, art. V, \u00a7 10. In concluding that the candidate had \u201cresided\u2019 in Worcester County for less than the constitutionally prescribed residency period, approximately one year and eleven months, this Court rejected Mr. Oglesby\u2019s argument that his intent should be the determining factor. We instead applied the plain meaning of the constitutional language itself. We were clear in our holding, moreover, that \u201c[t]he words reside or resident mean domicile unless a contrary intent is shown,\u201d 372 Md. at 373, 812 A.2d at 1068, <em>quoting Roberts v. Lakin, </em>340 Md. 147, 153, 665 A.2d 1024, 1027 (1995), giving a strict interpretation to the terms, \u201creside\u201d and \u201cdomiciled,\u201d as it pertained to the residency requirement. Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we shall interpret the phrase, \u201cpracticed Law,\u201d consistent with its plain meaning; we refuse to interpret it otherwise as there is no semblance of any contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Perez nevertheless contends that this Court\u2019s historically broad interpretation of what it means to practice law supports his argument and his position. Furthermore, he says, that, because the meaning of \u201cpractice of law\u201d has evolved over time, this Court should apply the current usage of the term, which, in his view, is that bar membership is not required under Article V, \u00a7 4. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">To be sure, this Court has held that a variety of activities may very well constitute the \u201cpractice of law,\u201d but we have never suggested, much less held, that those activities were so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>constituted in this context. On the contrary, we have addressed this issue only in the context of attorney discipline, <em>see, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 397-98, 681 A.2d 510, 514 (1996) (\u201c[T]he preparation of legal documents, their interpretation, the giving of legal advice, or the application of legal principles to problems of any complexity are considered the practice of law\u201d), <em>quoting Lukas v.

We drew a distinction between \u201cpractice of law,\u201d as used in that Rule and as it pertains to the unauthorized practice of law, proscribed by Maryland Code (1989, Repl.Vol.2004, 2006 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 10-601 <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.

The purpose of the practice requirement in Rule 14, as we have seen, is to assure a minimum degree of legal competence: to support a presumption ... that ...

The opponents of voting machines contended that it was impossible for the term \u201cballot\u201d to include voting machines, as such machines did not exist when Article 1, \u00a7 1 was adopted. We do not disagree with the theory upon which Perez bases this argument. We do not agree, however, with the result he reaches. Our analysis causes us to reach a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In <em>Norris, </em>we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201c[W]hile the principles of the constitution are unchangeable, in interpreting the language by which they are expressed, it will be given a meaning which will permit the application of those principles <em>to changes in the economic, social, and political life of the people, which the framers did not and could not foresee </em>.... In determining the true meaning of the language used, the courts may consider the mischief at which the provision was aimed, the remedy, the temper and spirit of the people at the time it was framed, the common usage well known to the people, and the history of the growth or evolution ... [and the] long continued contemporaneous construction by officials charged with the administration of the government, and especially by the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 192 A. at 535 (citations omitted); <em>Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 633, 887 A.2d 525, 535 (2005); <em>Boyer v. Thurston, </em>247 Md. 279, 292, 231 A.2d 50, 57 (1967); <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 386, 86 A.2d 892, 894 (1952). This Court further asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201c[W]here the meaning of the words employed is susceptible of expansion so as to include a significance in complete harmony with the spirit and purpose of the instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>which will gratify a legislative intent or serve a present need, they may be so interpreted.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">172 Md. at 676, 192 A. at 535.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Nor is this case at all analogous to <em>Norris. </em>Although correct in his assertion that the meaning of \u201cpractice of law\u201d has evolved, the case <em>sub judice </em>does not involve a \u201cchange\u201d in the \u201cpractice of law.\u201d What it means to \u201cpractice law in this State\u201d has remained consistent. As noted earlier, albeit the process by which one becomes authorized to practice law and the authorizing authority may have been different when the Maryland Constitution was adopted, nonetheless, there were some formal admission requirements for an individual to practice law in the State.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Someone, anyone could not simply walk into a court of law and try a case. His or her qualification to do so had to be evaluated by a judge. It would be illogical, therefore, for this Court to hold, as Perez and the Circuit Court contend the case to be, that the evolution of the law thus far lends credence to the proposition that one who seeks to hold the office of the Attorney General need not be a member of the Maryland bar at all. This \u201clogic\u201d would, in effect, undermine, and ultimately change, the basic principle of construction as we knew it in 1867 and as we know it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">This Court is not averse to looking at the evolution in circumstances as they relate to the practice of law. Having done so, however, we cannot, and will not, simply by reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to those circumstances, and in complete disregard of the constitutional language, expand, or restrict, the requirements for the practice of law. To this extent, we agree with the appellant that the Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 4 is too broad. It is true that the <em>Norris </em>court cautioned that we are not to be too restrictive in our interpretation of statutes or constitutional provisions; however, neither it nor logic demands that we so broadly interpret a constitutional provision as to make that provision \u201cabsurd or unworkable.\u201d <em>See Montgomery County Comm\u2019rs v. Supervisors of Elections of Montgomery County, </em>192 Md. 196, 208, 63 A.2d 735, 740 (1948). <em>See also Bienkowski, </em>386 Md. at 548, 873 A.2d at 1141 (\u201c[I]t is a well settled principle of statutory or constitutional construction that a provision should not be construed so as to render it nugatory\u201d); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., Inc., </em>285 Md. 527, 539, 404 A.2d 1045, 1053 (1979) (\u201cResults that are unreasonable, illogical or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided and an interpretation should be given which will not lead to absurd or anomalous results\u201d). We reject Perez\u2019s argument that this Court should take a liberal view of what it means to \u201cpractice law\u201d as this would go against the intent of the framers and the purpose of the provision as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Thus, the Circuit Court correctly observed that Perez was not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when he was performing his duties as a Justice Department lawyer. It does not follow, however, that, as that court concluded, merely because the practice was authorized by another licensing authority and then for a limited purpose and the practice occurs physically within the confines of the State, that that practice suffices as the \u201cpractice of law in this State,\u201d as the term is used in Article V, \u00a7 4. As we have concluded, such practice, by its plain meaning, implies actual bar membership in the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The appellant\u2019s next argument relies on the legislative history of Article V, \u00a7 4. This Court has held that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>attempting to discern the intention of the Legislature in proposing a particular constitutional provision, \u201cit is <em>permissible </em>to inquire into the prior state of the law, the previous and contemporary history of the people, the circumstances attending the adoption of the organic law, as well as broad considerations of expediency.\u201d <em>Brown </em>287 Md. at 278, 412 A.2d at 399.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Luppino v. Gray, </em>336 Md. 194, 204 n. 8, 647 A.2d 429, 434 n. 8 (1994) (\u201cOne of the sources to which the court may look to discern the framers\u2019 purpose in enacting the [constitutional] provision is the proceedings of the constitutional convention\u201d), <em>citing Reed v. McKeldin, </em>207 Md. 553, 561, 115 A.2d 281, 285 (1955); <em>Cohen v. Governor of Maryland, </em>255 Md. 5, 16, 255 A.2d 320, 325 (\u201cThe intention [of a constitutional provision] \u201cis primarily discovered by considering the words used by the draftsmen\u201d); <em>McMullen v. Shepherd, </em>133 Md. 157, 160, 104 A. 424, 425 (1918) (\u201cIn construing the Constitution we are to consider the circumstances attending its adoption and what appears to have been the understanding of the people when they adopted it, and one of the useful and most helpful sources is the debates of the Convention\u201d). Accordingly, we look, now, to the history and purpose of Article V, \u00a7 4 in an attempt to determine the scope and applicability the framers and the people intended it to have to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The appellant argues that the Attorney General could not discharge the duties of the position, as outlined in Article V, \u00a7 3, unless he were a member of the Maryland Bar, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>appearance in the courts of the state and the ability to practice law without restriction are necessary to being able to do so. Consequently, he contends that the framers must have intended for the Attorney General to be admitted to practice in the State. Perez, on the other hand, argues that the language of Article V, \u00a7 3, in fact, granted the Attorney General the power to appear in state courts, thus, allowing him to do so under constitutional mandate, rather than through the traditional bar admission process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">There is no conflict between Article V, \u00a7 3 and Article V, \u00a7 4. The appellant correctly asserts that, when the constitutional provisions pertaining to the office of the Attorney General were adopted, the Attorney General was required to appear <em>personally </em>in the courts o f this State and that he could not have done so unless he were a member of the Maryland Bar. Perez\u2019s contention, on the other hand, that Article V, \u00a7 3 was intended to circumvent the bar admission procedures simply is unpersuasive. Article Y, \u00a7 3, enumerating the duties of the Attorney General, does not address and, indeed, is irrelevant to the qualifications of a candidate to contest for the office of the Attorney General; it has no application until a candidate has been declared the winner and, as a result, assumes the office. That is to say, Section 3 does not come into play until one actually becomes the Attorney General. Thus, contrary to Perez\u2019s argument, the qualification requirements of the Attorney General, as prescribed by Article V, \u00a7 4, are not superseded by the duties that are outlined in Article V, \u00a7 3. Reading Article V, \u00a7 4 in context with the historical role of the Attorney General leads to the consistent conclusion that the framers did, indeed, intend for the office to be held by one who is admitted to practice law in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In interpreting Article V, \u00a7 4, in addition to its current language, which is the reason for the dispute in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the parties examine the changes that language has undergone, over time, since its initial adoption.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To be sure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Article V, \u00a7 4 has undergone various changes. There was a very distinct difference between what was proposed with regard to Attorney General eligibility, in their several iterations, and what ultimately was adopted. As proposed, Article V, \u00a7 4 would have read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201cNo person shall be eligible to the office of attorney general, <em>who has not been admitted to practice the law in the State, </em>and who has not practiced the law for_years, and who has not resided for at least _ years in the State.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">As adopted, the bar admission and length-of-practice provisions were merged into a single requirement, that the candidate have practiced law for the specified period. It is that merger which is the point of contention in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Both sides offer justification for the Convention\u2019s merger of qualifications. Viewing it as an apparent omission of the phrase \u201cwho has not been admitted to practice law in the State\u201d from the final version of the enactment, the appellant argues that the framers did not mean to remove the bar admission requirement at all, but, instead, recognized that it was not necessary, that to provide explicitly that the Attorney General be admitted to the bar to practice law in Maryland would have been duplicitous. On the other hand, Perez, proceeding on the same premise, contends that the phrase was omitted because the framers did not intend that such a requirement apply to candidates for the office of the Attorney General. He asserts, relying on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kadan v. Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore County, </em>273 Md. 406, 329 A.2d 702 (1974), that, if the framers had intended to impose a bar membership requirement on Attorney General candidates, they, like the framers in numerous other states, would, and could, have retained that express language.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>In <em>Kadan, </em>candidates for the office of judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court, who were members of the Maryland Bar, brought an action against the State Board to prohibit it from placing on the ballot the names of candidates for that office who were not members of the Maryland Bar. The plaintiffs maintained that Article IV, \u00a7 40<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> required judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court to be members of the Maryland Bar. This Court did not agree. We held, instead, that candidates for judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court were not required to be lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Perez argues that, as in <em>Kadan, </em>the lack of express language requiring bar membership as a prerequisite qualification is an indication that a candidate for the office of the Attorney General need not be a member of the Maryland Bar. We do not quarrel with, indeed, agree with, Perez\u2019s analysis of <em>Kadan. Kadan </em>does not support his argument in this case, however. It is, in fact, distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>Article IV, \u00a7 40 does not make <em>any </em>reference whatever to the practice of law or, for that matter, to any indicia that would suggest, much less indicate, that bar membership is a prerequisite for being an Orphans\u2019 Court judge. Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Kadan, </em>there simply was nothing that could be inferred about the issue, from the constitutional provision, the words used or omitted, as there is in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Kadan, </em>in other words, this Court was not faced with the interpretation of specific language pointing to a qualification, the perimeters of which are in dispute, as in this case. Rather, this Court had to discern the significance of the absence of any language tending to support the claimed qualification. Although the election was for a \u201cjudge,\u201d the only qualifications enumerated were citizenship and residency. The provision did not refer at all to bar membership or law practice. Here, to the contrary, Section 4 explicitly provides that the candidate have \u201cpracticed Law in this State.\u201d Consequently, given the law and rules pertaining to the practice of law, that provision reasonably may be construed expressly and clearly to contemplate, albeit perhaps by implication, bar admission. The l\u00e1ck of any express language at all with respect to bar admission or law practice, as in <em>Kadan, </em>simply can not be equated with the situation <em>sub judice, </em>where there is a clear requirement of the practice of law in the State, for some length, but no explicit requirement that the candidate be \u201cadmitted to the bar.\u201d Article V, \u00a7 4, in other words, is not devoid of all language that would require a candidate for the Attorney General to be a lawyer, thus, arguably opening the position to non-lawyers. On the contrary, it reflects, we believe clearly, the purposeful merger of two requirements, which, taken together, make clear that being an attorney is a necessary requirement to being able to run for, and hold, the office of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">This Court interprets the framers\u2019 actions as an attempt to avoid being repetitive. The rewording of the provision was not, as Perez claims, a result of an attempt to change the meaning of the. language or to change the eligibility requirements for the office of the Attorney General. Confirmation of our interpretation is provided by the proceedings of the debates. During the debates of the 1850 Constitutional Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>vention, Delegate Benjamin C. Howard<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> of Baltimore County, albeit discussing the eligibility requirements of prosecuting attorneys, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cIn framing a Constitution <em>... it [is] altogether unnecessary to introduce all the matters of detail, when we ought to content ourselves with laying down certain general rules or principles for the guidance of the legislature. </em>If we are to go on in this way, it will end in making a book which the people will no more understand than they do the old Constitution itself, and after all, it will be found impossible for us to provide for all contingencies. To specify that a man who is elected to the office of prosecuting attorney must be a practitioner of laws is entirely superfluous. It is preposterous to fill the Constitution with details of this sort ... it was generally understood that the applicant for the office must know something of the business, that he must be a practitioner of law. If we are apprehensive that the people may elect some one who is entirely incompetent to perform the duties of the office, it will be better that we should not give them the right to elect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"><em>Debates I </em>at Vol. II, 14 (emphasis added). <em>See also The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Maryland </em>(\u201cDebates II\u201d), 369 (Annapolis, 1864) (Mr. DUVALL. \u201cIf it is correct to say \u2018frequent, maintain, or contribute,\u2019 then the \u2018or\u2019 between \u2018frequent\u2019 and \u2018maintain\u2019 is superfluous.\u201d); Debates II at 1601 (Mr. SCHLEY said: I have no objection to the proposition as it stands; but deeming it superfluous, I vote \u201cno\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Perez also relies on Article IV, \u00a7 2 and Article V, \u00a7 10 of the Maryland Constitution, which, respectively, require judicial candidates to \u201chave been admitted to practice law in this State\u201d and candidates for the office of State\u2019s Attorney to have \u201cbeen admitted to practice law in this State.\u201d His argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the framers\u2019 use of express language requiring bar membership in these provisions is indicative that their intent, as expressed in Article V, \u00a7 4, was not to require it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Perez and the Circuit Court read Article IV, \u00a7 2 and Article V \u00a7 10 to mean that only candidates for state\u2019s attorney and judge are required to be admitted to the bar and that is because the constitutional provisions governing each say so. On the other hand, he continues, the absence of the same or similar language in Article V, \u00a7 4 indicates that it is possible for the Attorney General candidate to practice law without ever having been admitted to the Maryland Bar. We decline to so interpret the framers\u2019 intent. That would mean that state\u2019s attorney and judicial candidates are required to be admitted to the bar, while the State\u2019s lawyer, the \u201ctop\u201d lawyer for the State\u2014and at times the <em>only </em>lawyer for the State in civil, Federal, and appellate proceedings\u2014need not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Moreover, the assumption underlying this argument may not be correct. It is not at all clear that requiring candidates for judge and state\u2019s attorney to be members of the bar was imposed as a more stringent requirement than that for Attorney General. To this Court, it is far more likely that it was intended to be, rather, a more relaxed one. The framers\u2019 intent was to require of candidates for State\u2019s Attorney and judge solely that they be admitted to the bar. That is to say, they very deliberately did not impose on those seeking to be a state\u2019s attorney or a judge the requirement of having actually \u201cpracticed law,\u201d whether in Maryland or elsewhere, just that they be members of the bar. The opposite is true for the office of the Attorney General. Because the Attorney General was, and is, intended to be the foremost lawyer for the State, it is not surprising that a candidate for that office would be required to have more qualification than simply a bar membership, that it would be required that a person aspiring to that position would be required to be both learned in the law, as evidenced by his or her bar membership, and experienced in its practice, as reflected in his or her length of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>As stated earlier, constitutional provisions need to be read in context and as a whole. <em>See Mohler, supra, </em>318 Md. at 225, 567 A.2d at 932, <em>quoting Rucker, supra, </em>315 Md. at 565, 555 A.2d at 1063; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>281 Md. at 596, 380 A.2d at 1055. The appellant concedes that a candidate for the office of the Attorney General need only be a member of the bar in order to be eligible and urges this Court to so hold. On the other hand, Perez urges this Court to hold that \u201cpractice\u201d for the requisite time period is all that is required. Thus, the appellant reads out of Article V, \u00a7 4, the \u201cpracticed Law\u201d language,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and Perez reads that same language narrowly and in a constrained manner, refusing to give it its common and ordinary signification. Neither, in other words, reads Article V, \u00a7 4 as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Turning again to the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1864, Delegate Archibald Stirling Jr. of Baltimore City, while discussing the salary of the Attorney General, stated that \u201c[the citizens of Maryland] <em>must have for the attorney general a man who is </em>accustomed to trying cases, or he will not be fit for the office.\u201d Debates II at 1461. During the same debate, Delegate Peter Negley of Washington County and Delegate John E. Smith of Carroll County also spoke to the \u201ckind\u201d of individual who should occupy the office of the Attorney General. Delegate Negley observed that \u201cif [the framers] put in an insufficient salary, [they could] not get the services of a man whose services [would] be worth anything. And rather than have a second or third rate man in the office, [they should] strike out the provision entirely,\u201d <em>Debates II </em>at 1460, while Delegate Smith stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cI think a man who is called upon to fill this responsible position, ought to have practiced law for ten years at least. <em>It is one of the most important and responsible positions in the State. </em>And from the circumstances that now surround us, from the changes proposed to be made by this constitution, it is <em>evident that we require in this position the services of one who has occupied a leading position, in the profession for ten years at least.\u201d Debates II </em>at 1465. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Delegate Smith stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cI know there are instances of rather extraordinary men. But a gentleman may be learned in the law, and yet not knowing about the duties of attorney general. I think ten years is short enough time to require of one who will be called upon to apply himself to <em>the practice of law in all its branches. </em>\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">It is apparent that the framers, viewing the position of Attorney General as a highly important one, requiring the practice of law in all the government\u2019s branches, desired to have an experienced attorney fill that role, measured by a term of ten years. A mere member of the bar for a few years would be insufficient\u2014while they recognized that there may be instances of brilliant attorneys who could perform the duties of the Attorney General without ten years of bar membership, the framers felt secure in promoting a seasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>practicing attorney for the position, one who was admitted to the Maryland Bar and had, in fact, practiced for the prescribed period.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The framers did not ever contemplate that the office would be held by an individual who did not, at the least, possess a professional record of the length prescribed, upon which the voters could base their decision. Thus, we hold, a candidate for the office of the Attorney General must be both a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years and a practitioner of law in Maryland for ten years.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The appellant\u2019s final argument addresses Perez\u2019s federal bar membership. Perez argues that, because he has practiced federal law in Maryland for over 20 years, he meets the \u201cpracticed Law in this State\u201d requirement. That is so, Perez contends, because his federal bar membership and his position with the Justice Department authorized him to practice law in this State and that his oversight of cases involving Maryland and any appearances in the federal courts in Maryland was evidence that he has practiced law \u201cin this State,\u201d within the meaning of Article V, \u00a7 4. Again, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Perez bases his argument on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 (2007) and Rule 701(l)(b) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (2007). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cThe Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, <em>or in a court of a State, </em>or to attend to any other interest of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">To be sure, Perez is correct that he was authorized, beginning in 1989 and continuing until he left federal government service, to appear in any State or in any federal court in which a suit affecting the interests of the United States was pending, even those to whose bar he had not been admitted to practice, \u201cto attend to the interests of the United States.\u201d That authorization, however, does not equate to the practice of law in this State, as contemplated by Article V, \u00a7 4. A member of the bar of any state may be admitted to the federal bar of any state, whether or not admitted to the bar of the state in which the federal court is located physically.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>entry of appearance in a federal court located in this State by someone not admitted by this Court to practice here is not tantamount to practicing law in this State.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Nor is the appearance in Maryland state courts \u201cto attend to the interests of the United States\u201d authorization to practice law in this State for purposes of Article V, \u00a7 4. As with <em>Pro Hac Vice </em>admissions, <em>see </em>Rule 14,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> its duration is fixed and its purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>defined\u2014it ordinarily is limited to the pending case. Until he became a member of the Maryland Bar in 2001, Perez simply did not have carte blanche authorization to practice law in the state of Maryland; he could practice only in federal court or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>state court in the interest of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 does not obviate the Maryland requirement that one desiring to practice law in Maryland must be admitted to the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Perez fares no better under Rule 701(l)(b) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Rule 701(l)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cAn attorney who is a member of the Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, the Office of the United States Attorney for this District, or other federal government lawyer, is qualified for admission to the bar of this District if the attorney is a member in good standing of the highest court of any state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Rule 701(l)(b) outlines the qualifications an attorney who wishes to become a member of \u201cthe bar of this District,\u201d must meet. It does not address the bar admission rules or requirements of Maryland, the State in which it is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Unlike 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 517, however, Rule 701(l)(b) draws expressly a distinction between federal bar admittance and state bar admittance. This is significant and consistent with our approach to the federal/state practice issue. This Court has held that a lawyer admitted to the federal bar in this State is not authorized to practice law in the State courts, unless also admitted to the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">As the Circuit Court noted, <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>316 Md. 646, 561 A.2d 200 and <em>Bridges, supra, </em>360 Md. 489, 759 A.2d 233, permit a non-Maryland lawyer, admitted to the bar of another state and to the federal bar, to maintain a federal practice in this State. They do not stand for the proposition that the maintenance of such a practice satisfies the practice of law requirement of Article V, \u00a7 4, however. <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Bridges, </em>in fact, illustrate the difference between maintaining a federal practice in this State and practicing law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In <em>Kennedy, </em>an attorney, who was a member of the federal bar and of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, but not a member of the Maryland bar, was determined to have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>when he advised clients and prepared documents in connection with matters involving state law and state legal issues, in his principal office, located in Maryland. 316 Md. at 663, 561 A.2d at 208. In holding that the attorney\u2019s argument \u201cturn[ed] on the substantive law applicable or potentially applicable to the client\u2019s matter,\u201d Id. at 662, 561 A.2d at 208, we differentiated between the federal practice he was permitted to have and the state law practice, which was not permitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cKennedy may not utilize his admission to the bar of the federal court in Maryland, or his admission in Washington, D.C., as a shield against injunctive relief by asserting that he will operate a triage. He is not permitted to sort through clients who may present themselves at his Maryland office and represent only those whose legal matters would require suit or defense in a Washington, D.C. court or in the federal court in Maryland because the very acts of interview, analysis and explanation of legal rights constitute practicing law in Maryland. For an unadmitted person to do so on a regular basis from a Maryland principal office is the unauthorized practice of law in Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 666, 561 A.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Bridges </em>was to like effect. In holding that an attorney admitted to practice in a number of jurisdictions, other than Maryland, including the Maryland federal bar, did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law in Maryland before his admission to the Maryland Bar, this Court examined the substance of Bridges\u2019 activities. 360 Md. at 511, 759 A.2d at 245. We concluded that, rather than engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, he limited his practice in this State very specifically to federal court and federal law. <em>Id. See also Harris-Smith, supra, </em>356 Md. at 83-84, 737 A.2d at 573 (holding that an attorney admitted to the federal district court in the State, but not to the State bar, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when she screened her firm\u2019s clients for her bankruptcy practice and held herself out to the public as a general practitioner); <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 363 Md. at 628, 770 A.2d at 148 (holding that an attorney admitted to the federal bar engaged in the unauthorized practice of law when he met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>with, and advised, clients in a Maryland office, made telephone calls to clients from his Maryland home, executed retainer agreements in Maryland and did not include his jurisdictional limitations on the firm\u2019s letterhead, which bore only a Maryland address).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Perez, finally, relies on <em>Sperry, supra, </em>373 U.S. 379, 83 S.Ct. 1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428, to support his argument that his federal bar membership allowed him to practice law in this State and that practice counts toward his eligibility to be the Attorney General. In <em>Sperry, </em>the Supreme Court of Florida held that the petitioner, a non-lawyer registered to practice before the United States Patent Office, had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by maintaining an office in the State, preparing legal documents, and by holding himself out to the public as a Patent Attorney. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>State may not enforce licensing requirements which, though valid in the absence of federal regulation, give \u2018the State\u2019s licensing board a virtual power of review over the federal determination\u2019 that a person or agency is qualified and entitled to perform certain functions, or which impose upon the performance of activity sanctioned by federal license additional conditions not contemplated by Congress. \u2018No State law can hinder or obstruct the free use of a license granted under an act of Congress.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">373 U.S. at 385, 83 S.Ct. at 1326, 10 L.Ed.2d at 432-33, <em>quoting Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>54 U.S. 518, 566, 13 How. 518, 566, 14 L.Ed. 249, 269 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Perez\u2019s reliance on <em>Sperry, </em>and, in effect, on the Supremacy Clause, is misplaced. While we agree with the principles enunciated in <em>Sperry, </em>in context, the case simply is inapposite. It is true that a non-lawyer was authorized to practice law in Florida pursuant to federal law and regulations; however, that practice was limited to a specialized federal practice and federal law. What the Florida Supreme Court did, which the Supremacy Clause did not permit, was to prohibit what federal law allowed; it denied Sperry the right to do in Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>what federal law permitted him to do there. On the other hand, the federal law that permitted Sperry to practice patent law, even though he was a non-lawyer, did not, and did not purport to, authorize Sperry to engage in a State law practice in Florida or to enable him to avoid the State bar admission requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The statute relevant to this case, 28 U.S.C. 517, and Local Rule 701(l)(b), as in <em>Sperry, </em>authorized Perez to \u201cpractice\u201d in Maryland, but only to protect the interests of the United States or, in the case of the rule, in federal court; neither authorized, or purported to, the unrestricted practice of law or, more to the point, a Maryland State law practice. Unlike in <em>Sperry, </em>therefore, not construing Perez\u2019s federal practice, even that which occurred in Maryland and that may have involved Maryland issues, as the practice of law in this State for purposes of his qualifying to be the Attorney General of this State in no way denied Perez the rights the federal statute and the local rule gave him. Just as the ruling in <em>Sperry </em>did not give the petitioner more rights than those that were already conferred upon him, our ruling simply does not confer on Perez rights to which he is not entitled by virtue of the federal statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">To be clear, it is not this Court\u2019s holding that Perez has not practiced law for the requisite ten year period. Indeed, we agree that he has continuously been practicing law since his admission to the New York Bar in 1988. Rather, we decline to construe Article V, \u00a7 4 so as to credit all of that \u201cpractice\u201d as complying with the provision\u2019s \u201cpracticed Law in this State\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On this point, Perez contends that the framers were not concerned with the person occupying the office of the Attorney General having sufficient legal experience in connection with Maryland, but, instead, that he or she were \u201cmerely steeped in the law, of sufficient legal maturity to undertake the duties of the office.\u201d <em>See </em>68 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>at 54. He argues, moreover, that because his federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>practice took place in Maryland, he has, in fact, been practicing law \u201cin this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We reject this argument. Article V, \u00a7 4, read in conjunction with the duties delineated in Article V, \u00a7 3, clearly reflects the intent of the framers that the Attorney General be a Maryland lawyer, with a specified amount of experience. The Attorney General\u2019s first and foremost duty is to \u201cprosecute and defend <em>on the part of the State </em>all cases in the <em>appellate courts of the State, </em>in the Supreme Court of the United States or the inferior Federal Courts, <em>by or against the State, or in which the State may be interested </em>.... \u201d MD CON ST. art. V, \u00a7 3(a)(1) (emphasis added). In addition, the Attorney General is required to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201c(2) Investigate, commence, and prosecute or defend <em>any </em>civil or criminal suit or action or category of such suits or actions in any of the Federal Courts or in <em>any Court of this State, or before administrative agencies and quasi legislative bodies, on the part of the State or in which the State may be interested, </em>which the General Assembly by law or joint resolution, or the Governor, shall have directed or shall direct to be investigated, commenced and prosecuted or defended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201c(3) When required by the General Assembly by law or joint resolution, or by the Governor, <em>aid any State\u2019s Attorney or other authorized prosecuting officer in investigating, commencing, and prosecuting any criminal suit or action or category of such suits or actions brought by the State in any Court of this State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201c(4) Give his opinion in writing whenever required by the General Assembly or either branch thereof, the Governor, the Comptroller, the Treasurer or any State\u2019s Attorney on <em>any legal matter or subject.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">MD CONST, art. V, \u00a7 3(a)(2)-(4) (emphasis added). In order for the Attorney General to discharge the various duties prescribed by Article V, \u00a7 3, he or she would have to be not merely steeped in the law, generally, but steeped in Maryland law, both as a member of its bar and as an active practitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>who, as a result, has acquired a familiarity with the relevant procedures enveloped therein. Given the Attorney General\u2019s responsibility for litigation and transactions on behalf of the State in state courts, coupled with his or her administrative duties, it was quite logical for the framers to require that candidates for the office of the Attorney General to have practiced law in the State for ten years, thereby ensuring that they are conversant and familiar with Maryland law and its practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The critical holding in this case is that the relevant condition of eligibility set forth in Article V, \u00a7 4, that the person have \u201cpracticed law in this State for at least ten years,\u201d is not satisfied unless the person (1) has been admitted by this Court to practice law in Maryland for that period, and (2) pursuant to that admission, has, in fact, practiced here for that period. We do not mean, in this Opinion, to determine, in any categorical sense, what activity does or does not constitute practicing law in this State for purposes of Article V, \u00a7 4. Two things are important to note, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The first is to make clear that we are <em>not </em>creating a Federal-State dichotomy. We are <em>not </em>holding that a person who has been admitted by this Court to practice in Maryland does not, in fact, practice here simply because he or she practices mostly, or even only, in the Federal courts or devotes his or her practice to matters involving Federal law. The practice of law in Maryland <em>does </em>include practice in Federal court and before Federal agencies. Many cases in Federal court, and especially in the Bankruptcy courts, involve Maryland law. Lawyers admitted by this Court to practice in Maryland who are employed by Federal agencies in the State, such as the United States Attorney\u2019s Office or the Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, do indeed practice law in Maryland for purposes of Article, V, \u00a7 4. A lawyer who works for a Federal agency outside of Maryland, however, will not be regarded as practicing law in this State simply because he or she is authorized by Federal law to represent the Government in litigation in any State, including Maryland, and may, on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>few isolated occasions over an extended period, have some involvement in a case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The second point is that a person may be regarded as practicing law even if the person never appears in <em>any </em>court. Lawyers do not have to be litigators, and many are not. It is not the kind of law or the nature of the practice that counts, but only that the person, for at least ten years, have been admitted by this Court to practice law in Maryland and that he or she, for that period of time, has, on a regular basis, done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The problem for Mr. Perez, first, is that he was not admitted by this Court to practice in Maryland for ten years. Second, and equally significant, his work, in Washington, for the Department of Justice from 1989 to 1999 and, on a part-time basis, for the Senate Judiciary Committee, though it included an occasional involvement over that 10-year period with an unquantified but apparently small number of cases in Maryland, does not qualify as practicing law in this State for that period, within the contemplation o f Article V, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that Perez has, in fact, \u201cpracticed Law in this State for ten years,\u201d thereby making him eligible to run for the office of the Attorney General of Maryland. Perez\u2019s admission to the Maryland Bar in 2001, coupled with his lengthy, but primarily, federal practice of law is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the office of the Attorney General as prescribed in Article V, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution. We, thus, hold Perez ineligible as a candidate for Attorney General of Maryland in the 2006 Gubernatorial Primary Election.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Concurring Opinion by ELDRIDGE, J., which RAKER, J., joins; HARRELL and GREENE, JJ., join in Parts I and II only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-14\">.

As mentioned earlier, the appellant\u2019s Complaint was also filed pursuant to \u00a7 9-209(b) of the Election Law Article. The Circuit Court found that this ground did not apply, a finding that the appellant is not challenging.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. The appellees, including Perez, who preferred to have the issue resolved on the merits, pressed their contention that Abrams waited too long to file this action under \u00a7 12-202, prompting a lengthy discussion in the Circuit Court on the point. They argued that Abrams should have known that Perez had filed to run for Attorney General. Citing, <em>e.g., Could Technicality Boot Montgomery Official from Attorney General Race? </em>Washington Post, May 7, 2006. at C4; <em>Perez OK\u2019d in Race for Attorney General, </em>Baltimore Sun, May 20, 2006, at 5B; <em>AG Opinion Finds Perez Candidacy Constitutional, </em>The Gazette, May 19, 2006; <em>Perez is Eligible to Run for Attorney General, </em>Washington Post, May 20, 2006, at B 10, they noted that the occasion was highly publicized. The appellees further argued that Abrams had a duty to remain informed about the election, and he failed so to do. Moreover, they asserted, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>should be precluded from claiming that he had no knowledge of what was transpiring merely because he was on vacation, particularly with technological advances, such as the Internet, at his disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Abrams countered by testifying that he did not have personal knowledge of Perez\u2019s formal filing until after he returned from a three-week vacation and checked the State Board\u2019s website on July, 5, 2006. He submitted that it was then that he \"knew\u2019 that Perez had filed. Moreover, he claimed that no major newspaper in the area where he was vacationing reported that Perez had formally filed his certificate of candidacy and that the State Board's website was the best place for him to ascertain who was running. He contended, however, that he did not check the website until after the actual filing deadline because he was not interested in finding out who \"may\u201d have been in the race as there was the possibility that candidates could withdraw at anytime before the close of the filing deadline. Abrams contended that he was only interested in the final list of candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We agree, on this point, with the appellees. Section 12-202 of the Election Law Article must be interpreted in a reasonable, but practical manner. A reasonable interpretation would place an obligation on a registered voter seeking to challenge the qualifications of a candidate to keep informed as to the relevant acts and omissions of that candidate. A voter may not simply bury his or her head in the sand and, thereby, avoid the triggering of the 10-day statutory time period, prescribed by \u00a7 12-202, in which .to \u201cseek judicial review from any act or omission relating to an election.\u201d The State Board\u2019s website, along with media coverage, would have been the principal places from which Abrams would have been able to find information pertaining to Perez\u2019s candidacy. It was incumbent upon Abrams to avail himself of these sources. Being on vacation is not an adequate, or . even good, excuse for not being informed, as being on vacation did not bar him from utilizing these sources to keep informed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\">. On this point, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cNow I certainly understand that ... everything involving the electoral process is on a very very tight time line. And I recognize that every day that passes creates the potential for greater problems and greater expense to the State Board. However, in large part those timing issues are not triggered by anything that Mr. Abrams did or didn\u2019t do in this case. I mean the fact of the matter is that there is just a whole lot of stuff that needs to get done and a relatively short time to do it ... I think within the context of this case and given the complicated nature of the issues and so forth, what he did was certainly within reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Neither Lamone nor the State Board filed a cross-appeal challenging these adverse rulings.

The original mode of amending the Constitution was that amendments were to be made by an Act of Assembly passed at one session and a confirmatory Act at the next. <em>See </em>MD CONST. 1776 sec. 59. With the adoption of the 1851 Constitution, all Constitutional amendments were to be made by Conventions, which were elected for that purpose.

This Court\u2019s examination of the legislative history of Article V, \u00a7 4 should not be misconstrued as an attempt, on our part, to resolve an ambiguity in the provision. As we have stated, it is this Court\u2019s holding that the phrase, \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years,\u201d is clear and unambiguous. We inquire into the legislative history as both confirmation of our interpretation and in response to the arguments offered by both parties. <em>See, e.g., Mayor and City Council of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 131, 756 A.2d 987, 993 (2000) (\"[T]he resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute\u201d); <em>Morris v.

Perez cites to provisions governing eligibility for the office of the Attorney General contained in other states\u2019 constitutions. To be sure, other states have used more explicit language to reach the conclusion advanced by the appellant, <em>see, e.g., </em>Connecticut Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 3-124 (requiring that Connecticut Attorney General be \"an attorney at law of at least ten years\u2019 active practice at the bar of this state.\u201d); Colorado <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 4 (requiring nominees for Supreme Court justice to have been licensed to practice law in Colorado for at least five years, and requiring Attorney General nominees to be a licensed attorney in good standing); Code of Virginia \u00a7 24.2-501 (requiring nominees for Attorney General to have been admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth for at least five years directly preceding the election); however, we are not persuaded that bar admission was not necessarily encompassed in the \"practiced Law in this State\" language of Article V, \u00a7 4, and, thus, a requirement. Therefore, Perez\u2019s comparison of this provision to other more explicit provisions does not compel a different result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Article IV, \u00a7 40 governs the eligibility requirements for Orphans\u2019 Court judges and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\"The qualified voters of the City of Baltimore, and of the several Counties, except Montgomery County and Hartford County, shall elect three Judges of the Orphans' Courts of City and Counties, respectively, who shall be citizens of the State and residents, for the twelve months preceding, in the City or County for which they may be elected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">MD CONST, art. IV, \u00a7 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">. Delegate Howard was a congressman. His study of law was interrupted by his service in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, where he reached the rank of brigadier general before returning to Maryland to complete his legal studies. He was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1816 and ran for Governor in 1861.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\">. The appellant argues that if Perez had been a member of the Maryland Bar, rather than the New York Bar for the past 17 years and possessed the same professional qualifications, he would be eligible to hold the office of the Attorney General. We do not agree. As noted earlier, one who seeks to hold the office of the Attorney General must be both a member of the Maryland Bar for at least ten years and must have practiced law in Maryland for at least ten years; thus, Perez\u2019s eligibility to be Attorney General under the appellant\u2019s hypothetical is at least an open question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">. Delegate Smith's proposal that a candidate for the office of the Attorney General needs to have practiced law in this State for ten years was rejected by a vote of 24 yeas and 26 nays. The Convention, ultimately rejecting Delegate Smith\u2019s as well as Delegate Frederick Schley\u2019s proposal that the minimum length of practice should be 5 years, settled on seven years as the requirement, adopting the proposal by Delegate Ezekiel Forman Chambers of Kent County. The minimum practice required of a candidate for the Attorney General subsequently was changed to ten years with the adoption of the 1867 Maryland Constitution. It was proposed at the 1967 Constitutional Convention that the practice period be reduced to five years. <em>See Constitutional Convention of Maryland 1967-1968 Comparison of Present Constitution and Constitution Proposed by Convention, </em>77-78, 157 (Baltimore, 1968). That proposal was rejected, however. The language of Article V, \u00a7 4, thus, has remained unchanged for over a century.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\">. It can be deduced from these debates that the framers, in fashioning the \"practiced Law\u201d requirement in Article V, \u00a7 4, felt that ten years was an adequate amount of time after which an attorney, having practiced the entire time, would be sufficiently tested and, thus, capable of handling the duties of the Attorney General. The change of length requirement from 1864 to 1867, requiring an additional three years, only confirms this Court's holding that a candidate for the office of the Attorney General must be an experienced attorney admitted to practice law in Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. An examination of the past Attorneys General of the State of Maryland, from 1864 to the present, the period from which the eligibility requirements were first articulated to now, reveals that all those who have occupied the office of the Attorney General have been members of the Maryland Bar and have had the requisite practice experience. <em>All </em>of this State's past Attorneys General practiced law in Maryland, as members of the Maryland Bar, for a period of at least ten years. This Court, thus, declines to depart from what has been, and continues to be, the clear, unambiguous eligibility requirements for this office. To allow an individual who does not meet the qualifications, as prescribed by Article V, \u00a7 4, to become the Attorney General of this State would serve to undermine not only the intent of the framers but also the long history of those competent individuals who have performed the duties of this important office.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The following is a list of Maryland\u2019s Attorneys General from 1864 to the present, detailing their requisite professional experience: <em>Alexander Randall </em>(1865-1867), admitted to the Bar in 1824, engaged in private practice from 1824-41; <em>Andrew K.

Our use of the differences in the language used in those provisions was, as indicated, for comparison and illustrative purposes. The expression \u201cadmitted to practice law,\u201d as opposed to \u201cpracticed Law,\u201d is strikingly different, with the latter, contrary to the concurring opinion of Judge Eldridge that \u201cthe language of the Maryland Constitution furnishes a stronger basis for this Court to review the professional activity of candidates for judicial office than it does for the Court to review the professional activity of candidates for Attorney General,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 221-22, 919 A.2d at 1270, imposing an additional, if not a more stringent requirement, for those who would run for the office of the Attorney General. If the framers had intended for the Attorney General to be simply a member of the bar, they could, and most likely would, have said so. By using the word, \u201cpracticed,\u201d they indicated that much more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The term, \u201cpractice of law,\u201d as we have already acknowledged, has, in the past, been defined by this Court in a variety of ways. <em>See supra </em>at 180-82, 919 A.2d at 1244-45. It is not inconceivable that judicial service might well be included within those definitions. It would be incongruous for one who calls the balls and strikes on those who \u201cpractice law\u201d and, thus, occupies an oversight, if not a superior, position not to be credited, for qualification purposes, with practicing him or herself. Judges, like law professors, <em>see </em>68 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>at 65 (concluding that Dean of law school had \"practiced Law\u201d), are continually involved, if not engaged, in the practice of law, and they use their legal knowledge and skill on a daily basis. <em>See R.G.S., supra </em>at 14, 36, 312 Md. at 637-38, 541 A.2d at 983, <em>citing Gazan v. Heery, </em>183 Ga. 30, 187 S.E. 371, 378 (1936) (holding that judicial service \"may enhance [a candidate\u2019s] qualifications more than an active practitioner at the bar during the same period\u201d). While defining the practice of law to include \"judging\u201d is not at all inconsistent with this Court's opinion in this case, it is an issue with which we need not concern ourselves at this time; neither of the candidates for the office of the Attorney General in this year\u2019s election were former judges, whose tenure as such is critical to the eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The concurring opinions state that we have unnecessarily decided a constitutional issue. 398 Md. at 215-16, 919 A.2d at 1266 (Eldridge, J., concurring); 398 Md. at 232, 919 A.2d at 1276 (Harrell, J., concurring) (2007). Judge Eldridge's concurrence proffers that \"[t]he Court\u2019s unanimous decision that Mr. Perez is ineligible to be a candidate for Attorney General, on the ground that he has not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years, is dispositive of this case. There is no reason for the Court to go beyond that holding and rule on a perceived additional constitutional requirement under the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4.\u201d 398 Md. at 215, 919 A.2d at 1266 (Eldridge, J., concurring), while Judge Harrell states, \"Mr. Perez failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of Art. V, Sec. 4 of the Maryland Constitution in that he had not been admitted to the Bar of Maryland for at least ten years. That is as far as the Court need (and ought) go in order to decide the present case. The criterion that is dispositive of this matter is thus straightforward and easy for all to understand.\u201d 398 Md. at 232, 919 A.2d at 1276 (Harrell, J., concurring). The concurrences are incorrect. We have interpreted Article V, \u00a7 4, nothing more. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Indeed, the only issue this case presents to this Court is a constitutional issue\u2014determining the meaning of the phrase we have construed. The meaning of that phrase, although having two prongs, cannot be, and should not be, determined by parsing or otherwise separating those prongs. This Court's holding is that in order for one to be eligible to hold the office of the Attorney General, one \"must be a member of the <em>Maryland </em>Bar for at least ten years and must be a practitioner of law <em>in Maryland </em>for an identical requisite period.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 151, 919 A.2d at 1226; see <em>supra </em>at 175, 199, 208, 919 A.2d at 1240-41, 1254-55, 1261. Perez\u2019s bar membership may well be independently dispositive in this case, but it is, in fact, but one prong of the interpretation of a single phrase, \"practiced Law in this State.\u201d Bar membership is not, as the concurrences would have it, the only criterion for eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Judge Eldridge\u2019s concurrence spends a great deal of time focusing on who would not be eligible to hold the office of the Attorney General under this Court's ruling, <em>see </em>398 Md. at 159, 166-67, 919 A.2d at 1230-31, 1235 (Eldridge, J., concurring), however, in doing so, it constantly reads out of the interpretation of the pertinent statutory provision the \"in this State\u201d language. He claims that \"the opinion\u2019s emphasis on being 'steeped in Maryland law\u2019 is not consistent with the nature of many modem law practices, which in several respects is nation-wide or world-wide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 919 A.2d at 1230-31. We, however, disagree. At no time has this Court stated, or inferred, that someone lawfully practicing law, <em>i.e. </em>admitted to practice by this Court, in this State, whether solely Maryland, or a mixture of Maryland law, provided that it is for the requisite period, would be ineligible to run for, and thus, hold the office of the Attorney General. <em>See supra </em>at 207-OS, 919 A.2dat 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Judge Eldridge's concurrence goes on to state that the phrase \"practiced law\u201d is analogous to \"learned in the law.\u201d <em>See </em>398 Md. at 220-23, 919 A.2d at 1269-71 (Eldridge, J., concurring) This Court addressed the issue of \"leamedness in the law,\u201d <em>see supra </em>at 195-97, 919 A.2d at 1253-54, and largely does not disagree with what Judge Eldridge is saying. Leamedness, however, simply goes to the bar membership requirement; it does not equal, and cannot be equated to, the practice of law. This is, once again, in line with the framers\u2019 intent. <em>See supra </em>at 196-97, 919 A.2d at 1254. The references in his concurring opinion to the Constitutional debates, <em>see </em>398 Md. at 224-26, 919 A.2d at 1271-73 (Eldridge, J., concurring), in support of his position\u2014as proof that \"practiced law\u201d is the equivalent of \"leamedness in the law\u201d\u2014actually only solidifies this Court\u2019s position. Judge Eldridge\u2019s reference to the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1864 reinforces the fact that the framers wanted an individual holding the office of the Attorney General to have \"practiced law,\u201d as they used that phrase numerous times. In fact, it would be impossible for one to \"give up\" something, which he or she has never done. Judge Eldridge\u2019s concurring opinion speaks to the \u201cquality\u201d of the individual whom the framers were seeking, <em>see id. </em>at 225-27, 919 A.2d at 1272-73, but that quality was based, by the framers\u2019 own words, on the individual\u2019s practice experience. <em>See supra </em>at 196-97, 919 A.2d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Moreover, the cases Judge Eldridge cites do not support the proposition that the two phrases are analogous. In fact, those cases, <em>see, e.g., Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Ala. 38, 181 So.2d 105, 108-109 (1965); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Heathscott v. Raff, </em>973 S.W.2d 799, 803 (Ark. 1998); <em>In re Scarrella, </em>300 Minn. 500, 221 N.W.2d 562 (1974); <em>In re Daly, </em>294 Minn. 351, 200 N.W.2d 913, 917, 920 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1041, 93 S.Ct. 528, 34 L.Ed.2d 491 (1972); <em>State ex rel.

Wiggin, </em>12 S.D. 16, 80 N.W. 137 (1899), are not contrary to what we have said on the issue. They simply define \"learned in the law\u201d in terms of bar membership; they do not suggest, not to mention demonstrate, in any manner, that the phrase should, and can be, used interchangeably with \"practiced law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In addition, those cases cited by him which required that a candidate have \"practiced law\u201d similarly offer little assistance. In <em>Whitmer v. Thurman, </em>241 Ga. 569, 247 S.E.2d 104 (1978), the court applied a constitutional provision, also codified by statute, prohibiting a person from being a district attorney \u201cunless at the time of his election he shall have ... practiced law for three years next preceding his election.\u201d The trial court having ruled that he had not met the three-year practice requirement, the appellant proffered his admission to the California Bar, arguing that it should be considered in determining the practice time requirement. The Supreme Court of Georgia rejected that argument, reiterating its prior holding on the issue, \"that the language 'shall have practiced\u2019 contemplated lawful practice and defined lawful practice as the practice of law as 'an active member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing,\u2019 \" <em>quoting Wallace v. Wallace, </em>225 Ga. 102, 166 S.E.2d 718, 720 (1969), and, particularly relevant to this case, stating;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\"Appellant's argument that the practice requirement include legal practice in other states directly conflicts with the judicial policy of Georgia that lawyers licensed to practice in other states will not be admitted to practice law in Georgia on the basis of comity. Rule 2-101 of the Rules and Regulations for Organization and Government of the State Bar of Georgia, Title 9 Appendix of the Georgia Code Annotated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">\"It is clear that the intent of the legislature when it imposed this practice requirement was to insure that the individuals who were elected to the office of district attorney would be experienced in the practice of law before the courts in which they would be required to perform their functions as district attorneys. It would be contrary to this intent to allow individuals who have not been licensed to practice before our superior courts to include their practice time in other states as partial satisfaction of Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-4201 and 24-2901, the three-year practice requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\"><em>Whitmer, </em>247 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In <em>Littlejohn v. Cleland, </em>251 Ga. 597, 308 S.E.2d 186 (1983), the Supreme Court of Georgia examined the qualifications of a candidate who was \"not [then] nor ha[d] he ever been a member of the State Bar of Georgia,\" 308 S.E.2d at 187, to run for office as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia. The State Constitution provided that \"[n]o person shall be a Justice of the Supreme Court ... unless, at the time of his election, he shall ... have practiced law for seven years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in original). The court held the candidate constitutionally ineligible to run, explaining \u201c[s]ince a person may not practice law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>unless he or she is a member of the State Bar, a person cannot qualify for an office requiring law practice unless he or she is a member of the State Bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In context, the court did not, as Judge Eldridge\u2019s concurring opinion would have it, define \"practiced law\u201d as requiring bar membership only. It was the candidate's complete lack of bar membership that led the court to conclude that the candidate \"[did] not meet the constitutional requirement to seek or hold the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme of Georgia,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that is a far ciy from defining what it means to practice law when someone is actually a member of the bar of a particular state. <em>See also Daly, </em>200 N.W.2d at 914 (recognizing that none of the persons seeking to become judge was admitted to the Minnesota Bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Furthermore, so far as appears in the record of the cases cited in Judge Eldridge\u2019s concurring opinion, the only provision bearing on the meaning of the phrase being construed was the constitutional provision itself. Unlike in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there does not appear to have been other constitutional provisions containing different, but related, language which bore on and informed the meaning of the subject provision. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 4, as stated earlier, is informed by Article V, \u00a7 10 and Article IV, \u00a7 <em>2, supra </em>at 193-96, n. 54 at 208-12, 919 A.2d at 1252-54, n. 54 at 1261-64, both of which define the qualification for office in terms of bar admission, rather than \"practice of law.\u201d Not to consider these provisions would run afoul of a basic principle of constitutional interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b254-5\">ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amv\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">I agree with the result in this case on the ground that Mr. Perez has not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years. I disagree, however, with Chief Judge Bell\u2019s opinion which is joined by two other members of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution of Maryland sets forth the qualifications for a person to be eligible for the office of Attorney General of Maryland. Section 4 provides (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201cSection 4. Qualifications of Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">No person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney General, who is not a citizen of this State, and a qualified voter therein, and has not resided and <em>practiced Law in this State for at least ten years\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The dispute in this case is over the meaning of the final clause in \u00a7 4, containing the single professional requirement that, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, a person must have \u201cpracticed Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Chief Judge Bell\u2019s plurality opinion takes the position that the final clause in \u00a7 4 actually contains two professional requirements, namely that a person, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, (1) must have for ten years been a member of the Maryland Bar and (2) must have for ten years engaged in professional activity in Maryland which is sufficient, in this Court\u2019s view, to be deemed the \u201cpractice of law\u201d in Maryland. The opinion states (opinion at 196-97, 919 A.2d at 1254) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cThus, we hold, a candidate for the office of the Attorney General must be <em>both </em>a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years <em>and </em>a practitioner of law in Maryland for ten years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\"><em>See also </em>opinion at 150-51, 919 A.2d at 1225-26. At other places, the plurality opinion says that a candidate for Attorney General must \u201chave more qualification than simply a bar membership\u201d and must be \u201cexperienced in its [the law\u2019s] practice\u201d (opinion at 194-95, 919 A.2d at 1253). The three judges constituting the plurality \u201cdo not agree\u201d that, \u201cif Perez had been a member of the Maryland Bar, rather than the New York bar for the past 17 years and possessed the same professional qualifications, he would be eligible to hold the office of Attorney General\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 195, n. 47, 919 A.2d at 1253, n. 47). The plurality opinion states \u201cthat a candidate for the office of the Attorney General must be an <em>experienced </em>attorney\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 197, n. 49, 919 A.2d at 1254, n. 49, emphasis added), and that a person, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, must \u201cbe not merely steeped in the law, generally, but steeped in Maryland law, both as a member of its bar and as an active practitioner\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 206-07, 919 A.2d at 1261). Chief Judge Bell concludes that, even if Mr. Perez had been a member of the Maryland Bar from 1989 to 1999, his work for the Department of Justice and the Senate Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ciary Committee \u201cdoes not qualify as practicing law in this State for that period, within the contemplation of Article V, \u00a7 4\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 207-08, 919 A.2d at 1261).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">As previously indicated, I agree with the plurality that the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution means that, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, a Maryland resident is required to have been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years. It is true that \u00a7 4 does not expressly require Maryland Bar membership; consequently, in my view, \u00a7 4 is to some extent ambiguous. Nevertheless, when \u00a7 4 is read in conjunction with the constitutional duties of the Attorney General prescribed in Article V, \u00a7 3, of the Maryland Constitution, admission to the Maryland Bar would seem to be required. The constitutional duties of the Attorney General, which have remained essentially unchanged since 1867, could only be performed by a member of the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Furthermore, except for an out-of-state attorney being given permission by the court to try or argue one specific case, the concept of an attorney legally practicing law in a state, without being a member of that state\u2019s bar, was likely unknown in 1864 and 1867 when the language of Article V, \u00a7 4, was formulated and adopted. The statute authorizing a United States Department of Justice attorney to represent the United States in, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe courts of any State,\u201d was not enacted until 1870. <em>See </em>Act of June 22,1870, Ch. 150, 16 U.S. Statutes At Large 162, 163 (1870). Cases dealing with the concept of legally practicing law in certain fields, in a state where the attorney was not a member of the bar, came much later. <em>See, e.g., Sperry v. Florida, </em>373 U.S. 379, 83 S.Ct. 1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428 (1963); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Bridges, </em>360 Md. 489, 508-511, 759 A.2d 233, 243-245 (2000); <em>Kennedy v. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>316 Md. 646, 661-668, 561 A.2d 200, 208-211 (1989), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Consequently, the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, should be read as if it said \u201cand [admitted to] practice [ ] Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d Since Mr. Perez has not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years, he does not at this time meet the professional eligibility requirement set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In nay view, this is the <em>only </em>proper basis for this Court\u2019s prior order that Mr. Perez does not meet the eligibility requirements specified in Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Preliminarily, it is puzzling why the three-judge plurality ventures beyond the holding that Mr. Perez fails to meet the eligibility requirements of Article V, \u00a7 4, on the ground that he has not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThis \u2018Court\u2019s established policy is to decide constitutional issues only when necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable, </em>339 Md. 596, 614, 664 A.2d 862, 871 (1995), quoting <em>Mercy Hospital v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 565, 510 A.2d 562, 566 (1986). <em>See also Christopher v. Department of Health, </em>381 Md. 188, 217, 849 A.2d 46, 63 (2004); <em>Murrell v. Baltimore, </em>376 Md. 170, 191 n. 8, 829 A.2d 548, 560 n. 8 (2003); <em>Baltimore Sun v. Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 659, 755 A.2d 1130, 1134 (2000), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Court\u2019s unanimous decision that Mr. Perez is ineligible to be a candidate for Attorney General, on the ground that he has not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>dispositive of this case. There is no reason for the Court to go beyond that holding and rule on a perceived additional constitutional requirement under the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The plurality opinion, however, goes beyond the dispositive issue of Maryland Bar membership and states that Mr. Perez, even if he had been a ten-year member of the Maryland Bar, would still be ineligible under Article V, \u00a7 4, because his professional activity did not constitute \u201cpracticing law in this State\u201d for ten years, (opinion at 207-08, 919 A.2d at 1261). The plurality\u2019s justification for unnecessarily deciding this latter constitutional issue is that \u201c[w]e have interpreted Article V, \u00a7 4, nothing more\u201d and that the bar membership issue is \u201cbut one prong of the interpretation of a single phrase, \u201cpracticed Law in this State.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion at 208-12, n. 54, 919 A.2d at 1261-64, n. 54). Under the circumstances here, this is not a valid justification for deciding the second constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Many state and federal constitutional requirements are set forth as single phrases. For example, the constitutional phrases \u201cdue process of law\u201d or \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d or \u201ctwice put in jeopardy\u201d are each single phrases. Nevertheless, if a court interprets and applies one of these phrases to decide that particular action violates the constitutional provision in one respect, and if that decision is dispositive of the case before the court, it is not necessary for the court to further interpret the single phrase and decide whether the action violates the same phrase in some other respect. Exploring all aspects of a constitutional phrase may be appropriate for a treatise or law review article. It does not, however, reflect the type of judicial restraint which should characterize appellate opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Not only does Chief Judge Bell\u2019s opinion reach a constitutional issue unnecessarily, but it rules upon an issue that was not presented to the Court. The appellant-petitioner, Steven N. Abrams, presented the following two questions to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201cQUESTIONS PRESENTED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201cI. Does the Constitution of Maryland require that a candidate for Attorney General be admitted to practice law before all of the courts of the State courts of Maryland for at least ten years prior to his or her commencing their term as Attorney General?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cII. Does the State Board of Elections have any duty to inquire into the representations made by a candidate for any office in Maryland when the candidate certifies under oath to the State Board of Elections that he or she meets the Maryland Constitutional requirements?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Mr. Abrams\u2019s sole constitutional argument was that Mr. Perez was ineligible to be Attorney General because he had not been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years. Mr. Abrams stated in his brief (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cIn short, because the phrase \u2018practiced Law in this State\u2019 has a well-understood, common, and ordinary meaning that necessarily implies admission to practice law in Maryland, that meaning should be adopted, <em>and there should be no need for further </em>analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">During oral argument before this Court, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201cJudge Cathell: If a person passes the Maryland Bar and is admitted to the Maryland Bar by this Court, has a job right out of law school with a federal judge in the District of Columbia, goes directly to the District of Columbia and works for that federal judge.

The only constitutional issue raised and argued in this Court was whether Article V, \u00a7 4, required membership in the Maryland Bar for ten years. Under the circumstances of this case, the judges of this Court should not reach any other constitutional issue. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 8-131 and 8-504; <em>Simmons v.

McNeece, </em>311 Md. 194, 213, 533 A.2d 671, 680 (1987) (concurring opinion). I strongly disagree with Chief Judge Bell\u2019s second constitutional ruling that, in addition to membership in the Maryland Bar for ten years, a ten-year resident of Maryland, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, must also have engaged in such professional activity that, in the judgment of the judiciary, renders the person \u201ca practitioner of law in Maryland for ten years\u201d or an \u201cactive practitioner\u201d who is \u201csteeped in Maryland law.\u201d (opinion at 197, 206-07, 919 A.2d at 1254, 1260).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">This position, adopted by three members of the Court, is neither supported by the language of Article V, \u00a7 4, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>supported by the constitutional history of that provision. The position also violates the principle that provisions should not be interpreted in a manner leading to unreasonable results. Numerous long-time Maryland lawyers could be disqualified from being Attorney General if the views of the three judges were to prevail in the future. Another result of the plurality opinion would be that this Court, every four years, might have to evaluate the nature or quality of the legal work performed in Maryland over a ten-year period, by each candidate for Attorney General, to determine whether such work meets the standard of actively practicing Maryland law in this State. Moreover, as Judges Harrell and Greene intimate in their concurring opinion, the plurality\u2019s requirements concerning the nature or quality of the law practice by a ten-year member of the Maryland Bar, in order for that member to be a candidate for Attorney General, would be difficult, if not impossible, for the State Board of Elections to administer. Finally, the plurality\u2019s interpretation of the state constitutional provision might raise questions as to its validity under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Article V, \u00a7 4, setting forth the single professional requirement that the Attorney General must have \u201cpracticed law in this State for at least ten years,\u201d contains no language furnishing any basis for a court to review and evaluate the ten-year professional \u201cexperience\u201d of a Maryland Bar member seeking to become Attorney General, or reject a candidate for the office of Attorney General on the grounds that he was not sufficiently \u201cactive\u201d as a \u201cpractitioner\u201d or not sufficiently \u201csteeped in Maryland law.\u201d A member of the Maryland Bar representing the United States Government is \u201cpracticing law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The plurality opinion, at one place, correctly acknowledges that the phrase \u201c \u2018practice of law* \u201d encompasses \u201ca variety of activities\u201d (opinion at 180-81, 919 A.2d at 1244). The opinion goes on to discuss several of this Court\u2019s opinions holding that the meaning of the phrase varies depending upon the context. <em>(Id. </em>at 180-86, 919 A.2d at 1244-48). Then, somewhat inconsistently, the plurality opinion states that the meaning of the phrase \u201c \u2018practice law in this State\u2019 has remained consistent\u201d and that the phrase \u201cis clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 186, 188 n. 42, 919 A.2d at 1247-48, 1248 n. 42). Later, the opinion adopts a narrow definition of the phrase, taking the position that Mr. Perez would not have been practicing law in this State even if he had been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years (opinion at 208, 919 A.2d at 1261), and that only a lawyer who is \u201csteeped in Maryland law\u201d as an \u201cactive practitioner\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 210-11, 919 A.2d at 1263) is eligible to be Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">This Court\u2019s prior opinions have consistently taken the position that there are many different definitions of the phrase \u201cpractice of law,\u201d depending upon the context and the circumstances. <em>See In re Application of Mark W., </em>303 Md. 1, 7-18, 491 A.2d 576, 579-584 (1985) (\u201cNumerous definitions of what constitutes practice of law are to be found.\u201d * * * \u201cThese definitions have arisen in a variety of circumstances.\u201d * * * \u201c \u2018[Attempts to define the practice of law have not been particularly successful\u2019 \u201d), and cases there cited. The predominant professional activities of many lawyers, such as legal research, teaching law, etc., are regarded as the \u201cpractice of law,\u201d although such activities would not constitute the \u201cunauthorized practice of law\u201d if done by non-lawyers. As indicated previously, the plurality\u2019s limited definition of the phrase might render a large number of Maryland lawyers ineligible to be Attorney General. Moreover, despite the plurality\u2019s disclaimer, the opinion\u2019s emphasis on being \u201csteeped in Maryland law\u201d is not consistent with the nature of many modem law practices, which in several respects is nation-wide or worldwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">As earlier discussed, the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, when considered in light of Article V, \u00a7 3, reasonably means that a candidate for the office of Attorney General must be admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to \u201cpractice[ ] Law in this State for a least ten years.\u201d Except for the ten-year period, this interpretation makes the professional qualification for Attorney General the same as the professional qualifications for judges<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and State\u2019s Attorneys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nothing in the language of Article V, \u00a7 4, requires a professional qualification over and above membership in the Maryland Bar for ten years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In fact, the language of the Maryland Constitution furnishes a stronger basis for this Court to review the professional activity of candidates for judicial office than it does for the Court to review the professional activity of candidates for Attorney General. Article IV, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution, unlike Article V, \u00a7 4, contains more than one professional qualification for judges. Article IV, \u00a7 2, requires that district, circuit, and appellate judges \u201cbe selected from those [1] who have been admitted to practice law in this State, and [2] who are most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>knowledge.\u201d No one has ever suggested that this Court is authorized to review the careers of judicial candidates to determine if they meet the qualitative standards contained in the last clause of Article IV, \u00a7 2. Instead, it is for the Governor and/or the voters to decide upon such qualifications. Similarly, if a ten-year Maryland resident, seeking the office of Attorney General, has for ten years been a member in good standing of the Maryland Bar, it should be for the voters to decide whether the candidate\u2019s professional activity is sufficient for him or her to be elected to the office of Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The words \u201cpracticed law,\u201d or the more frequently used phrase \u201clearned in the law,\u201d found in state constitutions, have regularly been construed to mean simply admission to the bar of the particular state involved. To the extent that such constitutional phrases have been viewed as providing for a higher level or quality of legal experience, courts have held that the matter is for the voters and/or appointing authorities and not a subject for judicial review. <em>See, e.g., Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Ala. 38, 40-42, 181 So.2d 105, 108-109 (1965) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018learned in the law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as used by the framers of the Constitution\u201d did \u201c \u2018not contemplate[ ] that ... qualifications of a candidate ... should be determined by a referee or jury in a contested election case,\u2019 \u201d but means \u201clawyers admitted to practice in Alabama\u201d); <em>Heathscott v.

It is contrary to the cases in other jurisdictions. As long as a candidate for Attorney General has been a member of the Maryland Bar, in good standing, for ten years, the judiciary should not further review the candidate\u2019s professional activity. Such review is a matter for the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The constitutional history relied on in the plurality opinion does not support its conclusion that the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, contains two distinct professional qualifications, both of which are judicially reviewable. Although I agree that the constitutional history supports the holding that a candidate for Attorney General must have been a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years, the history actually refutes the plurality\u2019s position that there is an additional professional qualification, pursuant to which this Court may evaluate the professional activity of an Attorney General candidate, who is a ten-year member of the Maryland Bar, to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>candidate is sufficiently \u201cexperienced\u201d and is an \u201cactive practitioner\u201d who is \u201csteeped in Maryland law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Chief Judge Bell points out that an earlier proposed version of Article V, \u00a7 4, contained two expressed professional requirements, namely that the Attorney General have \u201cbeen admitted to practice law in the State\u201d and that the Attorney General had \u201cpracticed law\u201d for a certain number or years. (Opinion at 190, 919 A.2d at 1250). The plurality opinion then observes that the two professional eligibility requirements \u201cwere merged into a single requirement\u201d <em>{ibid.). </em>The opinion goes on to say that it \u201cinterprets the framers\u2019 actions as an attempt to avoid being repetitive\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 191-92, 919 A.2d at 1251).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">I fully agree with the plurality that the bar admission requirement and the practice of law requirement were viewed as meaning the same thing and were merged into a single requirement to avoid repetition. Later in the opinion, however, Chief Judge Bell takes the position that there are two separate professional eligibility requirements and that the final clause of Article V, \u00a7 4, means that \u201cthe Attorney General must be both a member of the Maryland Bar for ten years and practitioner of law in Maryland for ten years.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 196-97, 919 A.2d at 1254). This later position taken by the plurality is flatly inconsistent with its earlier position based on the- legislative history. In my view, the sparse legislative history of the provision indicates that there is a single professional eligibility requirement in Article V, \u00a7 4, which is membership in the Maryland Bar for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The plurality also relies upon the debates at the 1864 Constitutional Convention regarding the salary of the Attorney General and the ten-year bar membership. Thus Delegates Negley and Bond stated <em>{The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1861 </em>at 1460):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akz\">. \u201cMr. Negley. I am as much in favor of keeping down salaries as anybody. But you better strike out this provision altogether than to put in an inadequate salary. Because if you put in an insufficient salary, you cannot get the services of a man whose services will be worth anything. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>And rather than have a second or third rate man in the office, you better strike out the provision entirely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cThree thousand dollars a year is little enough for such an officer. They are the younger members of the bar who are elected State\u2019s attorneys, and they will be continually calling upon the attorney general for his opinion, and perhaps require his personal assistance at the trial. He is to be besides the legal adviser of the governor, comptroller, treasurer, and even of the legislature; he will have his hands full. Three thousand dollars a year is not too large. Let us have salary enough to secure a good officer, or let us have none at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cMr. Bond. In my judgment, a salary of three thousand dollars a year is little enough for a good lawyer. The attorney general, by this report, is forbidden to receive any other fee or compensation whatever, except his salary. As has been well remarked by the gentleman from Washington county (Mr. Negley,) you better strike out this provision entirely, than not get a good man in this office; and you cannot get a good one, unless you give him a good compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Delegate Stirling commented <em>(id. </em>at 1460-1461):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201cMr. Stirling. I think the views of my friend from Washington (Mr. Mayhugh) are correct so far as the general principle is concerned. I have myself on several occasions voted here not to put these salaries too high. I have no objection to putting the salary of the attorney general at $2,500, though I think that is full low. But I suggested that sum, because I know there is an indisposition to pay large salaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201cNow you must have for attorney general a man who is accustomed to trying cases, or he will not be fit for the office. And any man who has a good practice trying cases makes a considerable sum of money every year by trying cases against the State. But if such a man accepts this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>office, he must give up entirely that portion of his practice. Taking all these things into consideration, I believe a competent attorney general at three thousand dollars a year will be a saving to the State at least a thousand dollars a year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7N\">Later, with regard to the ten-year requirement, Delegate Smith emphasized the importance of the position and the type of lawyer who should be Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">It is important to keep in mind what these debates related to and what they did not. The debates concerned the <em>salary </em>needed to <em>attract </em>good and experienced lawyers and concerned the ten-year bar admission requirement. The delegates were <em>not </em>suggesting that a ten-year member of the Maryland Bar must have a certain type or quality of experience in order to be eligible to seek the office of Attorney General. On the contrary, they were afraid that, if the salary were too low, the highest quality Maryland lawyers would not be candidates for the office and that lesser quality attorneys would be candidates and would be elected Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The need to attract higher quality candidates by setting a high salary is inconsistent with the notion that a court could declare ineligible ten-year members of the Maryland Bar based upon the court\u2019s evaluation of their professional experience. Instead of prescribing qualitative experience requirements which might be judicially reviewable, the framers of Article V, \u00a7 4, sought to attract high quality applicants for the office of Attorney General by setting what was then considered a high salary and by a ten-year Maryland bar membership requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Consequently, the constitutional history discussed in the plurality opinion undermines the opinion\u2019s conclusion that a court can review the quality or nature of the professional activity of a ten-year Maryland Bar member.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">This Court, time after time, has emphasized that, in interpreting enactments and other legal provisions, we \u201cgive them their \u2018most reasonable interpretation, in accord with logic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>common sense,\u2019 \u201d and that we \u201cavoid constructions that are \u2018illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v.

State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994). The Court refrains from a construction of enactments that leads to \u201cconsequences [that] would be quite strange.\u201d <em>Ponte v. Investors\u2019 Alert, </em>382 Md. 689, 717, 857 A.2d 1, 18 (2004). <em>See also, e.g., Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 663, 911 A.2d 1245, 1250 (2006); <em>Twine v.

Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>385 Md. 440, 462, 869 A.2d 822, 835 (2005). This principle is violated by the plurality\u2019s interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 4, requiring something more than ten-year Maryland residency and ten-year membership in the Maryland Bar for one to be Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The plurality opinion could result in the exclusion of numerous Maryland lawyers who have been, for ten years or more, Maryland residents and members of the Maryland Bar. For example, it would apparently render ineligible for Attorney General ten-year Maryland residents and Maryland lawyers who, for part of the ten-year period, were employed by federal government agencies in the District of Columbia or law firms in the District of Columbia or in nearby states.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The plurality opinion, if ever adopted by the majority of this Court, could also lead to an unprecedented and totally unreasonable non-judicial function to be performed by this Court every four years. To reiterate, the opinion takes the position that, even if Mr. Perez \u201chad been a member of the Maryland Bar, rather than the New York [B]ar for the past 17 years and possessed the same qualifications,\u201d his practice would \u201cnot qualify as practicing law in this State for [ten years], within the contemplation of Article V, \u00a7 4.\u201d (Opinion at 195, n. 47, 208-09, 919 A.2d at 1253, n. 47, 1261-62). This conclusion is based on the plurality\u2019s evaluation of the nature of Mr. Perez\u2019s professional activity, upon discounting Mr. Perez\u2019s law practice in Maryland as an attorney for the United States Department of Justice, and upon the view that \u201cappearance in Maryland state courts \u2018to attend to the interests of the United States\u2019 \u201d is <em>not </em>the \u201cpractice [of] law in this State for purposes of Article V, \u00a7 4.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 199-200, 919 A.2d at 1256). .</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The type of professional evaluation indulged in by the plurality could well set a precedent for future elections for Attorney General. Every four years, long-time members of the Maryland Bar, filing certificates of candidacy for the office of Attorney General, could be challenged in court on the theory that their ten years or more professional activity in Maryland was qualitatively insufficient for them to be eligible Attorney General candidates. In light of the nature of such cases, they will always find their way to this Court. I cannot believe that the framers of Article IV or Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution ever contemplated that the courts should be involved in this type of politically-charged evaluation activity. This is for the electorate; it is not the appropriate business of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It is a settled \u201c \u2018principle that a court will, whenever reasonably possible, construe and apply [an enactment] to avoid casting serious doubt upon its constitutionality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burch v.

During the oral argument before this Court in the present case, counsel for the appellee Perez was asked by the Court whether Mr. Perez had challenged in the trial court, or was challenging in this Court, the validity under the United States Constitution of the final clause in Article V, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution, providing that the Attorney General must have \u201cresided and practiced Law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d Counsel\u2019s attention was specifically directed to the federal constitutional equal protection principles applied in <em>Board v. Goodsell, </em>284 Md. 279, 286-293, 396 A.2d 1033, 1036-1040 (1979), and the Supreme Court opinions and other opinions discussed in <em>Goodsell. See also Green Party v. Board of Elections, 377 </em>Md. 127, 162-163, 832 A.2d 214, 234-235 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Counsel for Mr. Perez responded by stating that Mr. Perez had not challenged in the trial court, and was not challenging in this Court, the validity of Article V, \u00a7 4, under the Constitution of the United States. Consequently, no issue regarding the federal constitutional validity of Article V, \u00a7 4, is directly presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">. It should be noted that Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights mandates that federal law \"shall be the Supreme Law of the State. Consequently, \"federal law\u201d is \"Maryland law.\u201d <em>See R.A. Ponte Architects, Ltd. v.

Article IV, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">\"Section 2. Qualifications of judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\"The Judges of all of the said Courts shall be citizens of the State of Maryland, and qualified voters under this Constitution, and shall have resided therein not less than five years, and not less than six months next preceding their election, or appointment, as the case may be, in the city, county, district, judicial circuit, intermediate appellate judicial circuit or appellate judicial circuit for which they may be, respectively, elected or appointed.

Article V, \u00a7 4, contains two ten-year requirements, namely residence in Maryland for ten years and membership in the Maryland Bar for ten years. The plurality would impose a third ten-year requirement, <em>i.e., </em>activity for ten years which meets the three judges\u2019 concept of practicing law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\">. As the Supreme Court of Arkansas discussed in the <em>Heathscott case, </em>334 Ark. at 253, 973 S.W.2d at 802, similar language appeared in the Magna Carta of 1215, and the specific phrase \"learned in the law\u201d was used in a 1344 English statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">. Another group of ten-year Maryland Bar members who might be ineligible to be Attorney General under the plurality opinion consists of appellate, circuit, and district judges who did not practice law in Maryland, in accordance with the plurality\u2019s standards, for ten years prior to becoming judges. Although the Chief Judge\u2019s opinion says that \"[i]t is not inconceivable that judicial service might well be included\u201d in its definition of \"practice of law\u201d (opinion at 208-09, n. 54, 919 A.2d at 1261-62, n. 54), it is clear that judges are by law prohibited from practicing law. Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 l-203(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\"[N]o judge may during his term of office practice law, maintain an office for the practice of law, or have any interest in an office for the practice of law, whether conducted in whole or in part by himself or by others. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Concurring Opinion by WILNER, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">I concur with and join Chief Judge Bell\u2019s Opinion and write separately only to respond to Judge Eldridge\u2019s peculiar conclusions that the Constitution does not mean what it plainly says and that, even if it did, the Court shouldn\u2019t say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Article V, \u00a7 4 of the Constitution states with marvelous clarity and simplicity that a person is not eligible to the office of Attorney General who has not \u201cpracticed law in this State for at least ten years.\u201d Now, one may fairly debate whether, for purposes of that provision, certain conduct constitutes the practice of law in this State\u2014teaching law at a law school, for example, or serving as a judge or arbitrator, or administrative law judge or hearing examiner. But to conclude that it does not require the practice of law at all in Maryland is simply extraordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Judge Eldridge thinks that all that is required is that a person have been admitted to the Maryland Bar for ten years. That is not what the Constitution says, however. As Chief Judge Bell points out, in other sections, the Constitution explicitly makes membership in the Maryland Bar the effective criterion. In defining the qualifications of the Attorney General, however, the People deliberately chose a different requirement. Upon the recommendation of the Convention delegates, they determined that, to be eligible for the office of Attorney General, a person must have actually practiced law in this State for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Under Judge Eldridge\u2019s view, a person could pass the Bar Examination, be admitted to practice, open a liquor store, never do anything that could conceivably, under any definition, constitute the practice of law, become politically active, and ten years later be elected as Attorney General of Maryland. The notion that that is what the Convention delegates or the People had in mind in 1864 and 1867 is really absurd. It is belied by the plain language of the Constitutional provision and is belied as well by the debates in the Constitutional Conventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The challenge to Mr. Perez\u2019s candidacy was that he had not practiced law in Maryland for ten years. The focus on his not being admitted to the Maryland Bar for that period was part of the argument by Abrams that Perez had not lawfully practiced law here, for, except to the extent that a person is permitted by Federal law to appear in Federal courts and before Federal agencies without being admitted to the Bar of the State in which such appearances are made or is admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>to participate in a particular case, one must ordinarily be admitted to the Bar of Maryland by this Court before he or she may lawfully practice law here. That Mr. Perez had not been admitted to practice for the requisite ten years is strong evidence that he had not, in fact, practiced law here for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Chief Judge Bell correctly concludes that the two go together; the Constitution anticipates that a candidate for Attorney General will have lawfully practiced law in Maryland for ten years, and that necessarily requires that the candidate have been admitted to practice here for that period. Because the condition of eligibility is that the candidate have practiced law, and because the sole challenge to Mr. Perez\u2019s candidacy is that he had not done so, it is necessary that this Court examine and resolve whether he engaged in lawful practice in Maryland for that period. Merely holding that Mr. Perez had not been admitted for ten years does not answer the question presented and therefore does not adequately or properly decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Judge Eldridge suggests, without any support, that a ten-year practice requirement may create Federal Constitutional issues because it discriminates against persons in Federal Government employment. I am not aware that the Supreme Court has ever held, or even intimated, that a State could not impose such a requirement for its chief legal officer, chosen to advise and represent the State and its officials and agencies, but even if such a requirement <em>did </em>raise such issues, they would be raised as well by a requirement that the person practice law here, or even be admitted to practice law here, for one year. The conjured ghost of a Federal issue is, to me, the reddest of red herrings. If the General Assembly believes that the requirement should be changed\u2014that ten years is too long or that \u201cpracticed law in this State\u201d should be better defined\u2014it may propose to the People an appropriate amendment to Article V, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Concurring Opinion by HARRELL and GREENE, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Concurring Opinion by HARRELL and GREENE, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We agree generally with Parts I and II of Judge Eldridge\u2019s concurring opinion. Mr. Perez failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of Art. V, Sec. 4 of the Maryland Constitution in that he had not been admitted to the Bar of Maryland for at least ten years. That is as far as the Court need (and ought) go in order to decide the present case. The criterion that is dispositive of this matter is thus straightforward and easy for all to understand. The State Board of Elections may administer such a requirement by reference to the objective Bar admission records of this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
