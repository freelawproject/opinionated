RODOWSKY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The issue presented by the parties in this delinquency case is whether the juvenile respondent triggered the requirement for a pre-adjudicatory hearing, mental competency evaluation, as that requirement was imposed by Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-8A-17.1 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall hold that the juvenile sufficiently raised the issue of competency to oblige <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the court to make a finding whether to order an evaluation. Because this was not done, we shall vacate the adjudication of delinquency and the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On November 16, 2005, appellant, Lakeshia M., was age fifteen. That evening her stepfather, Steven D., entered the home and found Lakeshia sitting in a recliner in the living room with a butcher knife lying on each leg. An argument ensued, during which Lakeshia \u201ctook a swipe\u201d at Steven D. with one of the knives. She was close enough to him at that time that he had to back up to avoid the blade. He called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The State filed a juvenile petition against Lakeshia on December 20, 2005, in the Circuit Court for Washington County. The adjudicatory hearing was held on January 25, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">That hearing opened with the following request by counsel for Lakeshia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cYour Honor, this is going to be a Public Defender request for a postponement. Her mother came in to qualify late, had her daughter call me yesterday. She also is diagnosed with the highest level of bi-polar disorder. It\u2019s something I need to look into. I can\u2019t really, she can\u2019t really assist me with her mental health status now. There\u2019s a current CI\u00d1A case, her CINA social worker is here. She\u2019s under the jurisdiction of Judge Boone. I\u2019d ask to postpone this matter thirty days to allow me to meet with her, review discovery and discover this diagnosed ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: She\u2019s out of control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">In response, counsel said that Lakeshia\u2019s mother believed that, if the court were to order the juvenile to take her medicine, she would remain properly medicated. Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>further advised that, because of the pending CINA action, the social worker assigned to Lakeshia\u2019s case could petition the court at any time \u201cfor shelter,\u201d if that became necessary. The court denied the request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Counsel, however, stood his ground.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, then <em>I\u2019d have to note competency because she can\u2019t communicate with me about this process. </em>Your Honor, you can talk to her mother, you can talk to her ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well you said that she was taking her medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: With respect to her ability to conform, anger issues, but I don\u2019t have a mental health background at all. <em>When I talked to her yesterday, she wasn\u2019t able to explain to me the basic junction of my role, the prosecutor\u2019s role. </em>I let her know I\u2019d talk to her today. I\u2019ve talked to her today. I\u2019ve talked to her DSS worker: And I let her know that I\u2019d be seeking to postpone it to make th\u00e1t evaluation. At this point, there\u2019s nothing I can do except ask for that postponement. <em>I\u2019m not comfortable not asserting competency. </em>After having her meet with the social worker from my office, I may, based on what the mother told me in the CINA case, <em>it screams out competency issues. The highest level of bi-polar disorder. </em>I\u2019ve never heard that before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Does she admit or deny her participation in the assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019d have to deny on her behalf. I don\u2019t think, I deny and I\u2019d assert competency and ask that the State meet its burden with respect to her competency for this hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The State took the position that competency had not been formally raised. It advised the court that, if a continuance were granted, it would seek a shelter , order because there was a bed immediately available at the Thomas B. Finan Center, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>where medication and competency issues could be addressed. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201cOf course, that was the recommendation by the Department even if we got to disposition, was to get her to Finan and get some intervention as well as a psychological evaluation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">When the court further commented, \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary, and why delay it,\u201d defense counsel replied, \u201c[B]e-cause I don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of being adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The court said that the matter could be bifurcated, with the court first determining whether Lakeshia committed acts that would be criminal offenses if perpetrated by an adult, and that \u201c[ajgency is another issue.\u201d The court repeated that \u201c[sjhe\u2019s out of control, and she needs to be out of the community into a professional environment that she\u2019ll either respond to or she won\u2019t.\u201d After further colloquy, the court again denied the \u201crequest for a continuance\u201d and directed that the matter proceed on the bifurcated issue and not on the issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">A shelter review hearing was held on February 15, 2006. Finan Center had been unable to complete their psychological evaluation because Lakeshia was \u201cso out of control.\u201d Consequently, the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) had no plan and no recommendation. Although the prosecutor initially suggested transfer to Crownsville Hospital, she learned in the course of the hearing that an independent psychological evaluation could be done by a Dr. Kane in Frederick. The court, apparently referring to an interim report from the Finan Center that is not in the record, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cThe Finan people say it\u2019s all manipulative. Everything that she\u2019s doing is her own selfishness and a manipulation. There is a history at Brook Lane. I think we do need to have an independent evaluation[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The court placed Lakeshia in the custody of her mother, subject to community detention and \u201cintensive\u201d supervision by DJS. There were numerous conditions, including that she cooperate with Dr. Kane in his evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The disposition hearing was held on April 5, 2006. Dr. Kane had submitted an evaluation that the State considered to be \u201cvery thorough.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The disposition was probation for an indefinite period in the custody of her mother, but supervised by DJS and subject to numerous conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Lakeshia timely appealed. This Court issued the writ of certiorari on its own motion, before consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>In re Lakeshia M., </em>396 Md. 11, 912 A.2d 647 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Appellant presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201c1. Whether the trial court erred when it refused to stay the adjudicatory hearing and order a competency evaluation after defense counsel asserted that he had concerns about the appellant\u2019s competency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201c2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a continuance?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201cIt is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 439, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2574, 120 L.Ed.2d 353, 359 (1992). Lakeshia submits that \u201c[although [Maryland appellate courts have not] addressed the issue, numerous courts from across the country have recognized that juveniles have a similar fundamental, due process right not to be adjudicated delinquent if they are mentally incompetent.\u201d Brief of Appellant at ll.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we rest our decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>statutory grounds, we do not reach the constitutional level of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">When the delinquency petition was filed in the instant matter, there was no Maryland statute directly addressing the competence of a juvenile to stand trial for a delinquent act. Chapter 580 of the Acts of 2005 enacted substantial changes to CJ Title 3, Subtitle 8A, \u201cJuvenile Causes\u2014Children Other Than CINAs and Adults.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Effective December 31, 2005, this legislation added, as defined terms, \u201cIncompetent to proceed\u201d and \u201cCompetency hearing.\u201d The former means \u201cthat a child is not able to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u201c(1) Understand the nature or object of the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u201c(2) Assist in the child\u2019s defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">CJ \u00a7 3-8A-01(q). The latter means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud9\">\u201ca hearing under this subtitle to determine whether a child alleged to be delinquent is mentally competent to participate in a waiver hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-06 of this subtitle, an adjudicatory hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-18 of this subtitle, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>disposition hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-19 of this subtitle, or a violation of probation hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">CJ \u00a7 3-8A-01(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Lakeshia bases her argument primarily on new \u00a7 3-8A-17.1, as enacted in 2005. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) At any time after a petition alleging that a child has committed a delinquent act is filed with the court under this subtitle, the court on its own motion, or on motion of the child\u2019s counsel or the State\u2019s Attorney, shall stay all proceedings and order an evaluation of the child\u2019s mental condition and developmental levels if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201c(i) There is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the delinquent act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201c(ii) There is reason to believe that the child may be incompetent to proceed with a waiver hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-06 of this subtitle, an adjudicatory hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-18 of this subtitle, a disposition hearing under \u00a7 3-8A-19 of this subtitle, or a violation of probation hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201c(2) An evaluation ordered under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be performed by a qualified expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">\u201c(3) This subsection may not be construed to prohibit the State or the child from calling other expert witnesses to testify at a competency hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">\u201c(b) <em>Service of notice of </em>motion.\u2014Any motion questioning the child\u2019s competency to proceed, and any subsequent legal pleading relating to the child\u2019s competency to proceed, shall be served on the child\u2019s counsel, the State\u2019s Attorney, the Department of Juvenile Services, and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Appellant submits that the representations of her counsel to the court were sufficient to trigger the court\u2019s duty to proceed under CJ \u00a7 3-8A-17.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The State initially contends that the appellant waived any right to a competency evaluation because she moved only for a continuance. The State further argues that the trial court acted within its discretion in bifurcating the case. Because Lakeshia presented no evaluation at the adjudicatory hearing, it is said that the court appropriately proceeded with adjudicating delinquency. The State construes the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[ajgency is another issue\u201d to mean that \u201cquestions relating to Lakeshia\u2019s mental status could be addressed at disposition.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We shall not reject, on the ground of waiver, the argument submitted by appellant. The State reads appellant\u2019s request too grudgingly. The reason assigned for the requested continuance was to enable the defense to obtain an evaluation of competence. It appears that counsel was seeking an expert opinion on which to base the lack of competence argument. Then, when the court first ruled that the motion was denied, defense counsel directly alleged that Lakeshia was not competent. He proffered that, in his interview of his client, she \u201cwasn\u2019t able to explain to [him] the basic function of\u2019 defense counsel or the role of the prosecutor. Lakeshia\u2019s mother had informed counsel that the child suffered from \u201c[t]he highest level of bi-polar disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Section 3-8A-17.1(b) does not express a legislative intent that only written motions \u201cquestioning the child\u2019s competency to proceed\u201d are to be considered. Although subsection (b) addresses motions that are to be served, there is no language in the statute limiting motions to those that are written. There is no indication in the statute that the historic circuit court practice of allowing oral motions in open court is inapplicable to juvenile causes, despite Maryland Rule 1\u2014101(b) (excluding juvenile causes from circuit court civil rules). <em>Cfi </em>Rule 2-311(a) (\u201cAn application to the court for an order shall be by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing [.]\u201d). The purpose of subsection (b) of \u00a7 3-8A-17.1 is to expand service of a written motion beyond the immediate parties to the juvenile cause so as to include, as well, the two state agencies identified in subsection (b). In any event, a written motion by the juvenile is not required, because the issue of the child\u2019s competency can be raised by the court on its own motion. \u00a7 3-8A-17.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We hold that Lakeshia effectively moved for a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Role of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Under \u00a7 3-8A-17.1(a), if a competency issue has been generated, the circuit court must first make two determinations, (1) whether there is \u201cprobable cause to believe that the child has committed the delinquent act\u201d and (2) whether there is \u201creason to believe that the child may be incompetent to proceed[.]\u201d If the court finds that those factors are present, the court does not proceed to determine competence; rather, it \u201cshall stay all proceedings and order an evaluation of the child\u2019s mental condition[.]\u201d Next, \u201c[t]he court shall set and may change the conditions under which the examination is to be conducted.\u201d \u00a7 3-8A-17.2. The examination is to be conducted by a \u201cqualified expert,\u201d who is to opine on competence. \u00a7 3-8A-17.3(a)(l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Here, the State had ample evidence to demonstrate probable cause that Lakeshia had committed the assault, although that evidence was introduced as part of the adjudicatory hearing. The court, however, never made a determination whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that Lakeshia may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>be incompetent to proceed. Defense counsel\u2019s representation that Lakeshia did not understand his role, or that of the prosecutor, and that she suffered from the highest level of bipolar disorder were sufficient to draw into question the presumption of competence, to require an inquiry by the court, and to require a finding on whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that Lakeshia may be incompetent to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">What seems to have happened here is that the trial court focused on getting Lakeshia, as promptly as possible, to the then available bed at the Finan Center, resulting in a violation of the new legislation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Because the circuit court proceeded to an adjudication after competency had been raised, but without determining whether there was \u201creason to believe\u201d that Lakeshia may be incompetent, we vacate the judgment and remand this matter for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY VACATED.

It appears from the record at the adjudicatory hearing that, after the assault, Lakeshia was taken to Brook Lane, a private facility in Hagerstown for the treatment of mental illnesses. She stayed there for two weeks. There is no evidence in the record in this case that the court had received and reviewed an evaluation, if any, from Brook Lane prior to holding the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\">. In the course of this hearing, the court, speaking to Lakeshia, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">\"We have all kinds of reports and everything, and I know that there was a lot of effort, originally, through your defense counsel, that you didn\u2019t know what you were doing, and you were incompetent, and that you had all of these other problems.
