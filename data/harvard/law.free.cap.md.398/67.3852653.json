It arises from the birth of Teonna Boyce, the appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by emergency cesarian section (\u201cc-section\u201d) at the University of Maryland Hospital on November 12, 1992. UMMS is the parent corporation of the hospital. The appellant presents two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c1. Whether the court erred by excluding as hearsay certain entries in the Defendant\u2019s own medical records pertaining to the medical history of the minor child and her mother at the Defendant Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201c2. Whether the court erred by excluding certain entries in the Defendant\u2019s own medical records pertaining to the medical history of the minor child and her mother at the Defendant Hospital on the basis they were not relevant to corroborating the testimony and rehabilitating the credibility of the minor child\u2019s mother?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Underlying these issues is the factual dispute with respect to the appellee\u2019s culpability for the appellant\u2019s injuries and damages. The appellant contends that her mother sought treatment at UMMS and waited in the hospital, without treatment, for approximately five hours before the emergency c-section was performed. The appellee, on the other hand, maintains that the appellant\u2019s mother arrived at the hospital just prior to her emergency c-section. The trial court resolved the dispute, when ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>filed by the appellee, by excluding from the appellant\u2019s medical records, created by the hospital, two entries tending to corroborate the appellant\u2019s contention that her mother was seen by someone at the hospital at approximately 2:00 a.m. on November 12, 1992. Thereafter, in a bifurcated trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of UMMS on the issue of liability. The appellant noted this appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but, prior to.that court\u2019s consideration of the matter, we, on our own motion, issued a Writ of Certiorari. <em>Hall v. UMMS, </em>383 Md. 211, 857 A.2d 1129 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Answering the first question in the affirmative, we shall hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law by excluding the two entries in the appellant\u2019s medical records on the grounds that they were hearsay. The entries met the requirements of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and they were pathologically germane to the diagnosis or treatment of Teonna Boyce. In light of our holding and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>subsequent procedural disposition of the case, we need not, and thus do not, address the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">On November 12, 1992, sometime before 7:03 a.m., Joyce Boyce, the appellant\u2019s biological mother, was admitted to the University of Maryland Hospital for an emergency c-section. The c-section began at 7:03 a.m., and the appellant was delivered at 7:06 a.m. She did not have a heartbeat at birth, was having difficulty breathing, and her Apgar scores were low (0 at one minute, 3 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellant had a breathing tube inserted, was placed on a ventilation machine, and was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (\u201cNICU\u201d). Among other disabilities, the appellant currently suffers from cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and developmental delay. Apparently, a placental abruption (a premature separation of the placenta from the uterus) created the need for the emergency c-section and caused her disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On August 20, 2002, the appellant filed with the Health Claims Arbitration Office of Maryland a medical malpractice action against UMMS. She subsequently waived her right to arbitration in accordance with Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-2A-06B(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the matter was referred to the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>for Baltimore City, where the appellant, on August 22, 2003, filed an amended complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The amended complaint asserted that the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s prenatal evaluations were consistent with a normal pregnancy and with normal fetal development until the evening of November 11-12, 1992.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On that day, it asserted further, the appellant\u2019s mother, having developed abdominal pain at home, was seen at University of Maryland Hospital at approximately 2:00 a. m. on the morning of November 12, 1992\u2014approximately five hours before her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>emergency c-section. Additionally, the complaint alleged that, even though her mother was having abdominal pain and was near the end of her term, she stayed at the hospital for several hours without fetal monitoring, fetal ultrasonography, or obstetric evaluation being ordered. In other words, the appellant alleges that, after her mother initially made contact with a hospital medical employee at approximately 2:00 a.m., she was not seen or treated by the hospital staff until approximately 6:45 a.m. According to the appellant\u2019s complaint, the hospital\u2019s actions (or inactions) did not comply with the requisite standard of care and were the direct and proximate cause of the appellant\u2019s aforementioned disabilities resulting from the placental abruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The appellee disputed the appellant\u2019s version of events. Specifically UMMS asserted that Joyce did not arrive at the hospital until minutes before 6:45 a.m. on November 12, 1992, when she was taken directly to labor and delivery. Simply put, UMMS asserts that it did not become aware of Joyce\u2019s difficulties until she arrived at the hospital shortly before 6:45 a.m. (not the approximately five hours earlier alleged by Teonna) and that it complied with the requisite standard of care once it became aware of Joyce\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The parties agreed that liability was dependent on one factual issue\u2014when the appellant\u2019s mother presented and was treated at the hospital, <em>ie. </em>whether she was in the hospital for approximately five hours without treatment or whether she arrived just prior to being taken directly to labor and delivery-, which would be resolved by a jury. Thus, all other facts having been stipulated, the jury was asked to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">\u201cDo you find, more likely than not, that Joyce Boyce waited in the University of Maryland Emergency Room for approximately five to six hours without treatment until she was taken to Labor and Delivery at approximately 6:45 a.m.?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">On the evidence admitted, the jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Prior to the commencement of the liability phase of the trial, UMMS filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>entries in Teonna\u2019s medical record and any testimony about the entries from, as relevant to this case, the appellant\u2019s mother or the doctors who made them. The basis for the motion was the appellee\u2019s contentions that the entries were inadmissible double hearsay that did not fall within an exception to the hearsay rule, that they were not pathologically germane, and that the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s own testimony contradicted the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The first disputed entry was made by the attending neonatologist, Dr. Renee Fox, at 4:45 p.m. on November 12, 1992. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cMother apparently developed abdominal pain at 2 a.m. Reportedly seen by Family Practice. Returned to ER and reevaluated and brought to Labor and Delivery and fetal heart rate less than 100.\u201d[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The second disputed entry was made by third-year resident, Dr. Kevin Seymour, who wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cMom reported to be seen in ER around 2 a.m. for abdominal pain, evaluated, discharge, returned and referred to OB. Where fetal HR found to be much less than 100 necessitating a stat C-section.\u201d [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">At her deposition, Dr. Fox testified that she had no firsthand information regarding the admittance of the appellant\u2019s mother. When asked to explain the above quoted entry, Dr. Fox initially stated that it was <em>a </em>history,- after which the following exchange occurred:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. Let\u2019s go to your next sentence. \u2018Mother apparently developed abdominal pain at 2 a.m.\u2019 Do you know where -you obtained that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201cA. No. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know if you read it somewhere in the medical record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cA. I\u2014I suspect that I was told it on rounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cQ. And why do you suspect that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cA. Because I typically do not go back to the mother\u2019s medical record personally. I rely on the data that is provided to me by residents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201cQ. So when you write your note, you are, just as you said, relying on information that\u2019s provided to you, and you don\u2019t go back to verify it in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cA. I do at times when\u2014when I don\u2019t have the information .... I would have had to walk someplace else, pull up her [Joyce\u2019s] chart ... I know that I did not do that very often, unless I had\u2014you know, somebody hadn\u2019t bothered to do their job. My job is to supervise residents and ensure that they get information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201cQ. And [the residents] acquire [this kind of history] from what source?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cA. They acquire it\u2014typically, they acquire it from an obstetrical resident telling them something.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">The rest of Dr. Fox\u2019s deposition testimony regarding the above quoted portion of her entry is substantially the same, explaining how she most likely gathered the information for the entry in the medical record from forms arriving in the NICU or from Dr. Seymour.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">At his deposition, Dr. Seymour testified, as relevant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cQ. Now, I understand that residents perform rounds with the attending. Can you describe what that process was like in [19]92?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\">\u201cA. For each infant in the NICU, we would go around and discuss what had happened the night before, in order to pass the information so that we would have continuity of care. The rounds would include the attending, the residents that were assigned to the NICU, the nurses, the residents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that were on call the night before, and usually NICU fellows, both the one that\u2019s there during the day and the one that was on call the night before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. And, during those rounds, who would be, if you will, presenting the patient? Would the attending be doing the presenting or would the residents be doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cA. Usually, it\u2019s the residents doing the presenting or the NICU fellow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cQ. Assuming the baby arrives sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 [a.m.], would your rounds taking practices have changed any for that child, in all likelihood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cA. In all likelihood, if the child showed up while rounds were due to begin, the procedures may have been different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\u201cQ. Ho w would they have been different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cA. The rounds may have continued for the rest of the patients, with\u2014some of the physicians may not have been in those rounds. They would have been assigned to care for the new baby. And then, ordinarily, if it\u2019s a patient that comes\u2014again to the best of my knowledge. If it\u2019s a patient that came during rounds, that would often be the last patient, so that the folks would have a chance to stabilize the baby and gather some information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cQ. But still the baby would be part of the rounds process, eventually? \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Dr. Seymour was then asked about his recollection of his discussion with Dr. Fox regarding the appellant\u2019s admission to the NICU and the quoted entry he made in her medical record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cQ. Well, at the time you were speaking and discussing with her, would she have the note in front of her to review?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">\u201cA. No. It would have been the speaking and discussing was done prior to the writing of the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201cQ. Would you have discussed the patient\u2019s history with her as well? The history you obtained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201cA. I cannot recall in this instance. The history would have been obtained through the report that we received. So, we may have received the history at the same time together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201cQ. What report would you have received\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cA. This would have been the rounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. Would you agree with me that Dr. Fox\u2019s history is different, in some respects, than the history you recorded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cA. I would agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\u201cQ. Would it have been a standard practice of yours, if you obtained a different history than another health care provider, especially [one] that your attending had obtained, to point that out to your attending?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cA. The history again, for a NICU baby, is a little different. Because, again, you can\u2019t obtain the history from the child itself. So, the history is often second or third hand obtained on rounds. And the urgency of the care may require that we [would] be just taking care of the baby, without having obtained a complete history as to the events prior to birth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">\u201cQ. Have you ever obtained a history, for a NICU patient, from a mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">\u201cA. I would have to say yes, but it was not a frequent occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">\u201cQ. On those instances, when you obtained a history directly from the mom, what language did you use to document it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t understand. Oh, what\u2014how did I say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">\u201cQ. Did you say mom reported?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cA. If I\u2014right. If my reading of that line, looking back on it from all these years, and knowing how I 'write and what I would have written, as I look at it, if I had received it directly from mom, I think I would have said; mom reported being seen in the emergency room, as I would have put it more directly from mom. By my reading, [\u2019]mom reported to be seen[\u2019], tells me that I [got] [ ] that [information] [ ] from staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cQ. Where are the places that you would obtain a history from, on a NICU patient? Or, when I say the places, let me be more precise. Whom would you ordinarily obtain histories from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cA. It\u2019s often a synthesis of information obtained from the residents on rounds. The nurses made some report[s]. There may have been some paperwork from upstairs that came down as well. But it would have been residents and nurses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cQ. All of whom have the responsibility to go and take an accurate history?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201cA. Not all of whom. Because again, depending on where they are in the chain, sort of coming from OB down to the NICU, they may have heard it from the OB. The NICU nurses may have gotten [a] report from the OB nurses. So, they would not have had direct contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201cQ. But we can agree, at the University of Maryland hospital, that the health care providers, who would be taking and passing along, and/or passing along history information, have an obligation to initially take it correctly and pass it along accurately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Answering the appellee\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine, the appellant argued that the entries were business records and, thus, fell within the exception to the hearsay rule for business records. In support of her argument, she submitted an affidavit from Dr. Marcus Hermansen, the director of the NICU at Southern New Hampshire Medical Center and an associate professor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School. With respect to the two disputed entries, Dr. Hermansen opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cIt [is] remarkable that anyone would claim that such information is not pathologically germane to the diagnosis and treatment of a newborn in Teonna\u2019s condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cIn assessing a diagnosis and determining the proper course of treatment of a newborn in Teonna\u2019s condition it is helpful to know approximately when the mother\u2019s abdominal pain began, what medical treatment, if any, was sought at that time, and from whom, whether and when an evaluation of the condition had occurred, and by whom, whether the mother (and thus the unborn baby) were treated, whether they were kept for monitoring at the hospital or released, what happened upon return to a health care provider and the baby\u2019s condition at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cNone of the information contained in [the quoted entries] is extraneous to the medical inquiry in diagnosing and treating a newborn in Teonna\u2019s condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The appellant\u2019s mother also testified on deposition. At that deposition, she testified that, beginning in month seven of her pregnancy, she had occasionally had pain in her lower abdomen and legs. She also testified that she visited Dr. Robinson at the Maryland Family Practice on November 11, 1992, the day before Teonna was born. She had no pain during the visit, she asserted. When she got home from the Family Practice Clinic, the pain returned, then eased, and then got progressively worse as the night continued. She stated that she was able to fall asleep for a period of time, but around 10:30 p.m., she got up to use the bathroom, at which time, she experienced pain that reminded her of the labor pains she experienced when her other, older children were born. The appellant\u2019s mother testified that she woke up her family and they walked to her mother\u2019s house, arriving around 11:30 p. m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>A friend, whom the appellant\u2019s mother called, picked up her and her husband and drove them to the hospital. She stated that, upon her arrival at the hospital, at around 12:80 a.m., a nurse who was leaving the hospital, asked her whether she needed a wheelchair, and, upon being told that she did, went back inside and brought one out. According to the appellant\u2019s mother, the nurse took her into an examination room and performed a vaginal exam to determine the extent of Joyce\u2019s dilation. The nurse informed her, she said, that she was not dilated and went to get a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">From this point on, the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony, while in conflict with the statement of facts in the appellant\u2019s original complaint, is consistent with the appellant\u2019s amended complaint. At her deposition, the appellant\u2019s mother testified that no one else on the hospital staff examined her and that she did not see a member of the staff for another five to six hours until she was rushed to the delivery room for the emergency c-section (her deposition testimony was consistent with the amended complaint on this point). The original complaint stated that, after arriving at the hospital around 2:00 a.m., \u201cMs. Boyce was reassured by Defendant and sent home\u2014 Ms. Boyce returned to University Hospital a few hours later.... \u201d UMMS asked Joyce about this discrepancy at her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201cQ. Miss Boyce, when you originally filed suit, you alleged that you had come to the hospital at about 2 a.m. but were sent home and then came back. But, today, it sounds like you came to the hospital about 12:30, weren\u2019t sent home but just didn\u2019t get any care. Which version is correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cA. I was, I never left the hospital once I went there. I never left the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. So you were not sent home after presenting to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201cQ. You just stayed there and nobody came to treat you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>On the day of the liability phase of trial and prior to its start, the trial judge heard arguments on several motions, including the motion <em>in limine </em>filed by UMMS. She granted the motion in limine, ruling in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cI have reviewed the deposition testimony of [Doctors] Seymour and Fox in which they testify that the statements] related to the mother\u2019s treatment, in essence, is not pathologically germane because it is related to the mother\u2019s treatment and they were treating the minor child. I have also reviewed plaintiffs expert witness affidavit.... Dr. Hermanson [ ] points out that at the time of the alleged note, mother and child were one, and he concluded that the information is pathologically germane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cIn this case, Joyce Boyce\u2019s testimony is in conflict with the notes contained in Dr. Fox and Dr. Seymour\u2019s records. Joyce Boyce does not confirm that she arrived at 2 a.m. She does not confirm that she was seen at family practice. She specifically says that she never left the E.R. and that she waited either with her husband or alone for medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cIt is my view[,] that the fact that the patient disagrees with the accuracy of the note precludes a finding that the note is pathologically germane under the definition of what a pathologically germane statement must be. To reiterate, the definition of a pathologically germane statement^] that is[,] [ ] that statement must be a statement that falls within the broad range of facts in which a hospitales] practice^] are considered relevant. I do not believe that hospital practice would consider relevant statements which a patient specifically disavows and says are not accurate pertaining to her treatment. Moreover, I give little weight to Dr. Herman-son\u2019s report [asserting that the statements are pathologically germane] because he does not discuss or seem to be aware in his affidavit that the patient disavows the accuracy of the note....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cSo, for the reasons that I have assessed, I do not believe that the information in the note fits the definition of a pathologically germane statement because it\u2019s contradicted by the patient, because the plaintiffs expert witness was unaware of that fact, I give little weight to his testimony and greater weight to the testimony of [Dr.] Fox and Dr. Seymour who knew that they didn\u2019t know the source of the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201cSo, I believe it\u2019s unlikely under those facts that they would have given it great weight because, at the time they were treating the baby, they knew that they didn\u2019t know who told them about this 2 a.m. report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201cI also find that the information is generally unreliable.\u201d Thus, the two contested entries in the appellant\u2019s medical record were excised from the record and the jury was not allowed to consider them. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Generally, the standard of review with respect to a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is that such matters are left to the sound discretion of the trial court and unless there is a showing that the trial court abused its discretion, \u201cits ruling[] will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Bern-Shaw Ltd.

In <em>Globe, supra, </em>the Court explained why hospital records, in most circumstances, are not subject to the problems associated with hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cThe question here presented is whether evidence represented by the hospital chart contains a sufficient guarantee of its truthfulness. We are of the opinion that it does. It is a record required by the hospital authorities to be made by one whose duty it is to correctly make the entries therein contained. So far as the hospital is concerned, there could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>be no more important record than the chart which indicates the diagnosis, the condition, and treatment of the patients. This record is one of the important advantages incident to hospital treatment, for it not only records for the use of the physician or surgeon what he himself observes during the time he is with the patient, but also records at short intervals the symptoms, condition, and treatment of the patient during the whole time of the physician\u2019s absence. Upon this record the physician depends in large measure to indicate and guide him in the treatment of any given case. Long experience has shown that the physician is fully warranted in depending upon the reliability and trustworthiness of such a record. It is difficult to conceive why this record should not be reliable. There is no motive for the person whose duty it is to make the entries, to do other than record them correctly and accurately. On the other hand, there is the strongest reason why he should: First, because of the great responsibility, he knowing that the treatment of the patient depends largely upon this record, and if it be incorrect it may result, and probably will result, in the patient\u2019s failure to receive proper surgical or medical treatment, which failure might be followed by serious consequences or even death. Second, the entrant must realize and appreciate that his position is dependent upon the accuracy with which the record is made. Third, as was stated by Tindall, C. J., in <em>Poole v. Dicas, </em>1 Bing. (N.C.) 649: Tt is easier to state what is true than what is false; the process of invention implies trouble in such a case unnecessarily incurred.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Globe, </em>152 Md. at 446-47, 137 A. at 46. In <em>Garlick, </em>we referred to the above passage stating, \u201c[t]hat basic attitude towards hospital records and business records[,] in general[,] has never really changed.\u201d 313 Md. at 218, 545 A.2d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Applying the above stated law\u2014Rule 5\u2014803(b)(6), \u00a7 10-101, and our case law\u2014to the case <em>sub judice </em>leads us to the conclusion that the two entries should have been admitted. The entries were made contemporaneous with the actual occurrence of the event. Entries made by a doctor or doctors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>prior to the end of their shifts or at the conclusion of their shifts are -within the meaning contemplated by the words in Rule 5-803(b)(6)(A) \u201cat or near the time.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The appellee spends a great deal of time and effort arguing that the entries should be excluded under 5\u2014803(b)(6)(B), because Doctors Fox and Seymour did not have personal knowledge of the events contained in the entries, which, according to the appellee, created doubt as to the trustworthiness of the entries. This argument runs counter to the purpose of Rule 5-803(b)(6) as well as the history of the Rule, as our summation of that history makes clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Were we to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, we would be eviscerating the business records exception as it is applicable in the area of health care. The very purpose of Rule 5-803(b)(6) (and \u00a7 10-101) is to carve out an exception to the personal knowledge requirement in order to allow greater admissibility of business records. The commentators support this conclusion. Chief Judge Murphy of the Court of Special Appeals, in his <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>referring to \u00a7 10-101, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201c[This] law[ ] represents] legislative \u25a0 recognition that if records are reliable enough for the running of a business[,] ... they are trustworthy enough to be admissible at trial, particularly when one considers the practical difficulty of proving the specific facts contained in many of these records. Where the record is made within a reasonable time after the event it records, it is sufficiently reliable. <em>It does not matter that the person who actually does the recording may not have personal knowledge of the fact recorded. What matters is that both the \u2018reporter\u2019 and the \u2018recorder\u2019 are required by the business to report and record accurately.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 804, 318 (3d.l999) (emphasis added). Chief Judge Murphy correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ly points out that the entire purpose of the business records exception is based on the premise that because the records are reliable enough for the running of a business, in part because of the business duty imposed on the reporter and the recorder, that they are reliable enough to be admissible at trial. This is true <em>regardless of whether the person who actually did the recording has personal knowledge of the information recorded. </em>Professor McLain states that the \u201clacks trustworthiness\u201d portion of the Rule was designed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201c[C]odify the rules of <em>Aetna Casualty [&amp; Sur. Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 453-55, 463 A.2d 822, 826-27 (1983)] and <em>Weishaar [v. Canestrale, </em>241 Md. 676, 686, 217 A.2d 525, 531 (1966) ]. These rules are more widely known as the rules of <em>Johnson v. Lutz, </em>253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (Ct.App.1930), that the business records exception <em>does not embrace statements by persons outside the business, because those persons are under no business duty to record or transmit information truthfully, </em>so that their statements lack a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness, and <em>Palmer v. Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), that the business records exception <em>does not embrace self-serving records, made in anticipation of litigation, which lack circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUf\">Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence, </em>Rule 5\u2014803(b)(6), \u00a7 <em>4(q </em>)(i), 237 (2nd ed.2002) (emphasis added). Thus, according to Professor McLain, the \u201clacks trustworthiness\u201d portion of the Rule was only intended to exclude self-serving records and statements made by individuals not bound by a business duty to transmit information truthfully. The entries in the present case fall squarely within the circumstances described by Chief Judge Murphy and, on this record, do not run afoul of those described by Professor McLain. Therefore, we conclude that the two entries contained in the appellant\u2019s medical records fall within the ambit of Rule 5-803(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Moreover, according to both Doctors Fox and Seymour, the information regarding the admission of the appellant\u2019s mother, to the best of their recollection, came from someone with personal knowledge of Teonna\u2019s history. This testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>consistent with the requirements of Rule 5-803(b)(6)(B). In Dr. Fox\u2019s case, she believed the information contained in her note came from Dr. Seymour. In Dr. Seymour\u2019s case, he believed that the information came from multiple people within the hospital family or from written reports from Obstetrics. If there was any doubt in the trial court\u2019s mind as to the reliability of the entries stemming from the doctors\u2019 lack of personal knowledge, the proper course was to admit the records and allow the parties to put on evidence attacking and supporting the credibility of the process by which the information for the two entries was gathered. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-101(d) (\u201clack of personal knowledge of the maker of the written notice may be shown to affect the weight of the evidence but not its admissibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Both doctors stated that the methods by which they gathered the information for their entries were consistent with how that type of information was collected for that type of entry in the NICU at UMMS in 1992. <em>See </em>Rule 5-803(b)(6)(C). Moreover, and perhaps most important, Dr. Seymour pointed out that any history taken of a NICU patient will always amount to hearsay because it can never come from the infant and will often come from the Obstetrics doctors or nurses, or even from the mother or her records. Dr. Seymour also testified at his deposition that it was the duty of health care providers at UMMS to accurately keep these records. There is every indication that these entries were made in the normal course of business and that it was UMMS\u2019s standard practice to make and keep these type of records. There certainly is no implication, or indication, that the records were falsified, tampered with or in any other way altered. Therefore, the two statements fall within Rule 5-803(b)(6)(A)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Our analysis, however, does not end here. We still must address the trial court\u2019s ruling that the two entries in the medical record were unreliable. It appears that the trial court based its finding on the fact that the doctors lacked personal knowledge of the information contained in the entries. We have already addressed that issue, along with the effect of the appellant\u2019s testimony conflicting with the entries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>concluding that neither prevented an entry from being a business record.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The appellee asserts that the trial judge was correct in finding that the entries should be excluded because they are \u201c100% wrong according to\u201d the deposition testimony of the appellant\u2019s mother. It argues that this conflict indicates a lack of trustworthiness which requires the entries to be excluded under Rule 5-803(b)(6). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The two entries and the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony tend to show that she was at the hospital sometime before, or at, 2:00 a.m. on November 12, 1992. This fact, if believed by the finder of fact, is significant to the appellant\u2019s case. What is open to debate is what occurred, if anything, with respect to her treatment between approximately 2:00 a.m. and shortly before 6:45 a.m. on that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We agree that there are discrepancies between the entries and the testimony of the appellant\u2019s mother, but we do not agree that the records are in direct conflict with the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony or that the inconsistencies are an indication that the entries lack trustworthiness within the meaning of the Rule. There are a number of potential reasons why her testimony might conflict with the entries in Teonna\u2019s record. Not the least of those conceivable reasons is the fact that the deposition was taken approximately ten years after the event. Even if we did agree that the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was in direct conflict with the entries, that would not preclude, even if it would not be irrelevant to, their admissibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-101(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We are convinced that our adversarial system of justice is better served by leaving the explanation of any discrepancies between the entries and the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony to skilled attorneys and the resolution of those potentially conflicting facts to a jury. We are equally convinced that by removing the task of explaining conflicting evidence from the hands of the parties and their attorneys and by preventing evidence vital to the appellant\u2019s case from reaching the jury, the trial court erred when it granted the motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Despite our general tendency to permit the admission of hospital records, \u201cthere have [ ] been some hospital records (or more precisely some entries within those records) that have been objectionable or found to have been inadmissible.\u201d <em>Garlick, </em>313 Md. at 220, 545 A.2d at 32; <em>Dietz v.

When addressing the issue of whether an entire medical record is admissible, generally, we have adhered to the rule that \u201cstatements in a hospital record must be \u2018pathologically germane\u2019 to the physical condition which caused the patient to go to the hospital in the first place.\u201d <em>Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>224 Md. at 570, 168 A.2d at 504, <em>citing Lee v.

Therefore, entries in hospital records which are pathologically germane, or relevant to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s condition, typically fall within the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In the instant ease, the trial court ruled that, \u201cthe fact that the patient [Joyce] disagrees with the accuracy of the note precludes a finding that the note is pathologically germane .... \u201d The trial court placed little weight on Dr. Herman-son\u2019s affidavit stating that Joyce\u2019s medical history was pathologically germane to unborn and newly born Teonna because \u201che d[id] not discuss or seem to be aware in his affidavit that the patient disavowed] the accuracy of the note.\u201d The trial judge then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cI know that, with respect to the pathologically germane exception, the source of the information need not be identified. However, in this unusual case, the patient [Joyce] does not provide information that is consistent with the information in the Doctor\u2019s notes. It leads me to conclude, generally, that the information in the note is unreliable.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfV\">Initially, we note that, generally, the pathologically germane test has nothing to do with reliability of the hospital record. The reliability test is designed to prevent unreliable information, <em>i. e. </em>information recorded in a hospital record for the purposes of litigation, from being put in front of the fact-finder. <em>See </em>Rule 5-803(b)(6). The pathologically germane test is designed to prevent creative attorneys from putting information in front of the fact-finder that may not otherwise be admissible solely because it is in a hospital record. <em>See Yellow Cab Co., </em>224 Md. at 570, 168 A.2d at 504 (\u201cA \u2018pathologically germane\u2019 statement \u2018must fall within the broad range of facts which under hospital practice are relevant to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s condition\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As a general proposition, we fail to comprehend how the medical treatment of the mother of an unborn baby within hours before delivery is not pathologically germane to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>treatment of an unborn (or newborn) baby. Our general proposition is specifically illustrated, in this case, by Dr. Herman son\u2019s affidavit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He stated that, \u201c[i]t [is] remarkable that anyone would claim that such information is not pathologically germane to the diagnosis and treatment of a newborn in Teonna\u2019s condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Furthermore, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the importance of the two entries to Teonna\u2019s treatment, under UMMS\u2019s practice, is supported by the testimony of Doctors Fox and Seymour. Both testified to the effect that UMMS\u2019s standard practice was for oral and written information to be passed between Obstetrics, where the mother was cared for and where the baby was actually born, and the NICU, where the baby was treated. Dr. Fox testified that, if necessary, she would go to a different ward and look at the mother\u2019s chart to make sure the information in the NICU patient\u2019s history was accurate. Dr. Seymour stated in his testimony that, as part of his history taking duties, he had, on occasion, spoken with mothers and regularly gathered information from Obstetrics doctors and nurses to obtain a history on a NICU patient. It seems self-evident that, by its practice, UMMS considered the history of the mother relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of NICU patients. If that is not the case, why would information ever be passed from Obstetrics to the NICU? Why else would Doctors Fox and Seymour ever concern themselves with the history of a mother of a NICU patient? We conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the two entries in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>question were not pathologically germane to Teonna\u2019s treatment under UMM S\u2019s practices.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, by excluding two entries made by UMMS in Teonna Boyce\u2019s medical records on the grounds that they were hearsay. The entries met the requirements of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, <em>see </em>Rule 5-803(b)(6); \u00a7 10-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and they were pathologically germane to the diagnosis or treatment of Teonna Boyce.
