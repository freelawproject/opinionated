On December 12, 2002, Corey Pendleton, the appellant, by and through his next friend and father, Randy Pendleton, filed in that court a complaint against the State of Maryland and the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS), an agency of the State, (eollec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tively the appellees, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe State\u201d or \u201cthe State Defendants\u201d), and Barnett and Cecelia Carroll, d/b/a Finding Direction, Inc., alleging their negligence. The complaint also alleged battery with respect to James Wratchford, the appellant\u2019s roommate. The appellant subsequently amended his compliant to add Finding Direction, Inc., as a defendant. The gravamen of the complaint was that the appellant was sexually and physically abused and battered by his roommate while he was residing in a group home licensed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On May 23, 2003, the State filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That motion was granted as to the State Defendants, the State of Maryland and DSS, but not as to the other defendants. When they failed to answer the complaint, the Circuit Court entered a default judgment against them and subsequently, after an inquisition hearing on damages, assessed damages at $597,000.00. Judgment in that amount was entered in favor of the appellant against the defendants Barnett and Cecelia Carroll, d/b/a Finding Direction, Inc., and Finding Direction, Inc. The appellant appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the State Defendants from the case. This Court, on its own initiative and before proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Pendleton v. State, </em>387 Md. 465, 875 A.2d 769 (2005), to address the single issue posed by the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201cWhether the trial court erred in granting the State Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, finding that the State had only a public duty of care, rather than a special or statutory duty to protect a child removed from the custody of his parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>and placed in the custody of a foster group home from the intentional acts of a third party[ ]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We shall hold that the trial court did not err in dismissing the appellant\u2019s amended complaint, which insufficiently alleged a duty on the part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In October 1999, the appellant and his mother, Cynthia Mason, being homeless, were placed in a temporary shelter by DSS. Subsequently, in early January 2000, when he was ten years old, the appellant was removed from his mother\u2019s custody and placed in foster care. His placement was with Finding Direction, Inc., a licensed residential childcare provider in Baltimore City, operated by Barnett and Cecelia Carroll. The appellant was assigned to share a room in the residential group home with James Wratchford, then sixteen years old, another resident in the group home. The appellant alleges that he was sexually and physically abused and battered by Wratchford while they shared that room.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The appellant did not report the alleged abuse immediately, as he testified at the inquisition hearing on damages. According to the appellant\u2019s testimony at that hearing, he first reported the alleged abuse to a friend, who also lived in the group home. He then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">\u201cQ When you told your friend and your friend told the foster care folks\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">Q -what did they do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">A They took me down stairs and talked to me alone about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">Q Did you tell them the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">A Yes, I told them the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">Q And then what did they do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-16\">A Then the police came. They wrote up a report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Q How much time went by-how much time went by between the start of the sexual assault and the time you told?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">A I have to think on that one. I\u2019m not going to truly say I really know, but I\u2019m going to say around like a month or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">Q Did it seem to you like it was a long time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">Q Did it seem like it was short?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">A It seemed like a little long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">Q But you think maybe about a month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">Q And then after you told and the police came, it didn\u2019t happen anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Once the operators of the group home were notified of the situation, they acted to assure that there was no further contact between the appellant and Wratchford. The appellant was removed from the group home in February 2000 and reunited with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">The appellant\u2019s mother, pursuant to the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-107 of the State Government Article, timely filed notice of the appellant\u2019s claim with the State. It was denied. By this time, the appellant\u2019s mother had passed away and Randy Pendleton, the appellant\u2019s father, had custody of the appellant. He filed, as next friend and father, a complaint on behalf of the appellant, which he later amended to add Finding Directions, Inc., as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">The complaint sounded in negligence. As relevant to the State Defendants, it alleged that the State \u201cowed a duty to [the appellant] to keep him safe from harm while he was housed at Finding Direction and to make certain the policies designed to protect him were followed,\u201d but that the State Defendants \u201cbreached their duties of care\u201d by: (1) placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Wratchford, a sixteen year old, in the same room with the appellant, a ten year old, (2) failing properly to supervise Wratchford, (3) failing to protect the appellant from being sexually and physically assaulted by Wratchford, (4) failing to provide adequate staffing for proper supervision of the appellant, (5) failing properly to train staff persons, and (6) failing to protect the appellant from the foreseeable risk of harm associated with being placed in the group home run by Finding Directions, Inc. As a result of the State Defendants\u2019 alleged breach of duty, the appellant claimed that he suffered \u201chumiliation, shame, embarrassment, anger, physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of emotional enjoyment of life, severe and extreme emotional distress, and incurred medical expense.\u201d The State Defendants\u2019 breach of duty, he maintained, was the proximate cause of his injuries and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The only allegation of fact the appellant made with regard to the knowledge the State Defendants had of the situation or with which it was charged was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cUpon information and belief, the State and its Foster Care Program officials as well as Defendants Barnett Carroll and Cecelia Carroll were aware of (or should have been aware of) the sexual tendencies, deviousness and history of sexual assaults of Wratchford, and taken care not to place [appellant] in danger of being sexually assaulted by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABu\">He did not allege that Wratchford had committed assaults prior to those alleged by the appellant or that the State had knowledge of any sexual tendencies Wratchford may have had or that he had a history of sexual assaults. There was, in short, no factual allegation as to the basis for the knowledge attributed to the State or that related why the State should have been aware of any deviant tendencies that Wratchford may have had, or even that he, in fact, had such tendencies prior to the alleged incidents that occurred with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On May 23, 2003, the State filed a motion to dismiss the appellant\u2019s amended complaint, arguing that it failed to state a claim. The Circuit Court granted the motion and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>dismissed the negligence claims against the State. His motion for reconsideration of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment having been denied and judgment having been entered against the remaining defendants, the appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The appellant\u2019s claim against the State is, as we have seen, a simple negligence claim. Specifically, the appellant argues that the State had a non-delegable duty, imposed both by statute and the special relationship established by the State\u2019s placement of him in foster care and the group home, to protect the appellant from sexual and physical abuse and battery by Mr. Wratchford. The State breached that duty, and that the breach was the proximate cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries, he concludes. Conversely, the State argues that the appellant\u2019s amended complaint does not allege the facts necessary to show that the State had any duty to the appellant. More specifically, the State rejoins that the amended complaint is \u201cdevoid of any factual allegation that the State was negligent in licensing or monitoring Finding Direction and contains no facts to support the allegations regarding Wratchford\u2019s alleged history,\u201d or that the State failed to follow statutory procedures in placing the appellant with Finding Directions. Furthermore, it submits, \u201cthe amended complaint contains no allegation that the State received and failed to act upon, any report of abuse allegedly inflicted by Wratchford or anyone else against Appellant or any other resident of Finding Direction prior to the injuries alleged in the Complaint, and there is no allegation that the State failed to respond appropriately once the alleged actions of Wratchford were made known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Maryland\u2019s child welfare services\u2014as relevant to this case, what is termed both foster care and out-of-home placement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014 are governed by Title 5, Subtitle 5, Part III of the Family Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 5-524 through 5-534. Section 5-501(m) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Family Law Article defines \u201cout-of-home placement\u201d as \u201cplacement of a child into foster care, kinship care, group care, or residential treatment care.\u201d Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-501(m) of the Family Law Article. Section 5-526 provides that group homes may be \u201coperated by for-profit or nonprofit charitable corporations,\u201d subsection (a)(1), and must comply with State licensing laws as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 5-507 through 5-509 of the Family Law Article. Subsection (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Regulations for the State\u2019s out-of-home placement program, promulgated by the Secretary of Human Resources, are codified in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 07.02.11.01 through 07.02.11.34. Group home placement is one option for providing care for displaced children. COMAR states that the purpose of the State\u2019s out-of-home placement program is to provide care for children that have \u201cbeen abused, abandoned, neglected, or [are] dependent, or ... [are] at imminent risk of serious harm.\u201d COMAR 07.02.11.01A. After a court has determined that \u201ccontinued residence in the child\u2019s home is contrary to the child\u2019s welfare\u201d and has \u201cCommitted the child to the custody or guardianship of the local department\u201d (DSS), the department \u201cshall initiate out-of-home placement for [the] child.\u201d COMAR 07.02.11.04. \u201cIn order of preference, a child shall be placed with a relative caregiver, in a foster home, or in a group care setting.\u201d COMAR 07.02.11.11A. COMAR also requires that \u201c[a]ny residential treatment facility used by the local department shall meet the requirements for licensure for the facilities established in COMAR 01.04.04 ...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> COMAR 07.02.11.11F. The regulations state that local DSS caseworkers are to have regular contact with children in the out-of-home placement program. CO-MAR 07.02.11.17A. For children placed in group homes, a \u201ccaseworker shall have a face-to-face interview with the child within 1 week of placement, and subsequently at least once a month ....\u201d COMAR 07.02.11.17BG).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In <em>Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 690 A.2d 1000 (1997), Judge Karwacki, -writing for the Court, addressed the requisites of a sufficient pleading in a negligence action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cIn the context of a negligence action, we have previously-held that a sufficient pleading must \u2018allege, with certainty and definiteness, facts and circumstances sufficient to set forth (a) a <em>duty </em>owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (b) a <em>breach </em>of that duty and (c) injury <em>proximately </em>resulting from that breach.\u2019 <em>Read Drug and Chemical Co. v.

Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>206 (3d ed. 2003) (\u201c[t]he object of the motion is to argue that as a matter of law relief cannot be granted on the facts alleged\u201d).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">Thus, when reviewing the grant of such a motion, a court \u2018must assume the truth of all well-pled facts in the complaint as well as the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those relevant and material facts.\u2019 <em>Porterfield v. Mascari II, Inc., </em>374 Md. 402, 414, 823 A.2d 590, 597 (2003) (indicating that [] we accept all well-pled facts in the complaint, and reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party). <em>See Benson v.

Dismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff. <em>Allied Invest. Corp. v.

A trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint will be affirmed if that complaint nevertheless fails to state a claim. As this Court opined in <em>Patton v. USA Rugby, </em>381 Md. 627,</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>635, 851 A.2d 566, 570 (2004) <em>(quoting Valentine v.

In <em>West Virginia Cent. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v.

It is consequently relative and can have no existence apart from some duty expressly or impliedly imposed. In every instance before negligence can be predicated of a given act, back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining, the observance of which duty would have averted or avoided the injury.... As the duty owed varies with circumstances and with the relation to each other of the individuals concerned, so the alleged negligence varies, and the act complained of never amounts to negligence in law or in fact; if there has been no breach of duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">96 Md. at 666, 54 A. at 671-72. <em>See Doe, </em>388 Md. at 414-15, 879 A.2d at 1092; <em>Patton, </em>381 Md. at 636, 851 A.2d at 570-71; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 714, 697 A.2d at 1375; <em>Ashburn v.

The foreseeability test \u2018is simply intended to reflect current societal standards with respect to an acceptable nexus between the negligent act and the ensuing harm.\u2019 <em>Dobbins v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>338 Md. 341, 348, 658 A.2d 675, 678 (1995) (quoting <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>305 Md. 320, 333, 503 A.2d 1333, 1340 (1986)). In determining whether a duty exists, \u2018it is important to consider the policy reasons supporting a cause of action in negligence. The purpose is to discourage or encourage specific types of behavior by one party to the benefit of another party.\u2019 <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 550, 727 A.2d at 950.

With regard to the statutory duty argument, it contends that \u201c[i]n placing Appellant at Finding Direction, the State was merely executing its statutory responsibility to provide an out-of-home placement for Appellant in a home that was operating in compliance with applicable licensing laws, and that was otherwise capable of providing appropriate care to Appellant.\u201d Moreover, the State denies that a special relationship arose, under the specific circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, </em>out of the interaction between the appellant and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">This Court discussing the \u201cpublic duty doctrine,\u201d has stated: \u201cwhen a statute or common law \u2018imposes upon a public entity a duty to the public at large, and not a duty to a particular class of individuals, the duty is not one enforceable in tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muthukumarana v.

It is clear, however, that there are limitations to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>public duty doctrine, \u201c[specifically, it \u2018has no application when the court concludes that a statute or court order has created a <em>special duty </em>or specific obligation to a particular class of persons rather than to the public at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 805 A.2d at 396 <em>(quoting </em>Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 271 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">A \u201cspecial relationship\u201d may arise between two parties, constituting an exception to the public duty doctrine. <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083. Thus, in the context of a police officer, if it can \u201cbe shown that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection,\u201d then a special relationship exists which satisfies the duty element of a negligence claim. <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085 (citations omitted); <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 488, 805 A.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">At the hearing on the appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the trial judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cIn this court\u2019s view, licensing is a governmental function and creates no legal duty.

Prince George\u2019s County, </em>85 Md.App. 508, 584 A.2d 157 (1991). In <em>Willow Tree, </em>a child was fatally injured while using playground equipment at a day-care center. The child\u2019s parents brought an action against the day-care center, which, in turn, sought contribution or indemnification from Prince George\u2019s County and its inspector. The question on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>appeal was whether there was a statutory duty on the part of the County to discover, and report, the allegedly unsafe playground equipment from which the child\u2019s injury resulted. The pertinent COMAR regulations and County ordinances provided that the playground was to be maintained \u201cfree from hazards\u201d and \u201cfree from conditions likely to endanger the life or health of children.\u201d <em>Willow Tree, </em>85 Md.App. at 514, 584 A.2d at 160. The intermediate appellate court held \u201cthat the State or the County does not owe any individual duty of care merely by the enactment of a general ordinance requiring safety inspections, nor by the fact that it undertook inspections for safety violations. The duty created by the statute and ordinance was one owed to the public generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 584 A.2d at 160-61. The court concluded that \u201c[tjhere is a complete lack of any intention on the part of the Legislature which would indicate that it was creating a duty to individual members of the public, and we will not create one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 584 A.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The appellants in <em>Willow Tree </em>argued, in addition, that a special relationship existed between them and the County, an argument that the intermediate appellate court also rejected. It reasoned: (1) the County did not affirmatively and specifically act to protect individual children, but rather, children and others generally, (2) the ordinance there at issue did not contain requirements for mandatory acts for the specific protection of a particular class of persons, and (3) by adopting an inspection program, the County was mandatorily complying with relevant statutory law, not voluntarily assuming a special relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 518-19, 584 A.2d at 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The appellant distinguishes <em>Willow Tree </em>from the case at bar on the basis that, unlike this case, where the State removed the child from parental custody and placed him in the custody of a foster home, in <em>Willow Tree, </em>\u201cneither the State of Maryland nor a State agency was the actor who placed the child at the scene of the injury.\u201d It is this affirmative act on the part of the State in this case which renders the \u201cpublic duty doctrine\u201d argument inapplicable, the appellant concludes. We do not agree. The State\u2019s removal of the appellant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>parental care was done pursuant to a statutory mandate. As we shall explain <em>infra, </em>that act is not the kind of \u201caffirmative act\u201d that gives rise to a special relationship that would impose a duty on the State for the benefit of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">A. Statutory Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The appellant asserts that the State has a statutory duty, imposed by Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-526(c) of the Family Law Article, not to place children in an abusive group home. Section 5-526(c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201c(c) <em>Compliance with licensing </em>laws.\u2014The Department, or the Department\u2019s designee, may not place a child in a residential group home or other facility that is not operating in compliance with applicable State licensing laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Relying on this statute, the appellant contends that \u201c[t]he Legislature, therefore, has created a duty flowing to children specifically identified by virtue of prior, affirmative action taken to protect them by removing them from their former, unsuitable custodial circumstance.\u201d Furthermore, he submits, \u201cplacement of a child in a facility that is not operating in accordance with the requirements of the law, therefore, is in and of itself a breach of statutory duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We stated in <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 831 A.2d 18 (2003), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\u201cEvidence of negligence may be established by the breach of a statutory duty Svhen the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect and the injury was of the type the statute was designed to prevent.\u2019 <em>Erie Ins. Co. v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 84, 585 A.2d 232, 234 (1991) (citing <em>Pahanish v. Western Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 362, 517 A.2d 1122[, 1132] (1986)); <em>see also Geo.

East Europe Import Export, Inc., </em>463 F.Supp. 135, 138 (D.Md.1979) (\u2018To use a statutory duty as a foundation for a negligence claim, the plaintiff must show that it was within the class of persons the legislation was intended to protect and that the alleged injury was the type of harm which the statute was intended to prevent\u2019). Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the statute must \u2018set forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a <em>particular class </em>of persons rather than the public as a whole.\u2019 <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 635, 510 A.2d at 1087 (quoting <em>Morgan v.

Vol.), \u00a7 5-502 of the Family Law Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar5\">\u201c(a) Declarations.\u2014The General Assembly declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV-\">\u201c(1) minor children are not capable of protecting themselves; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c(2) when a parent has relinquished the care of the parent\u2019s minor child to others, there is a possibility of certain risks to the child that require compensating measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Policy.\u2014It is the policy of this State:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c(1) <em>to protect minor children whose care has been relinquished to others by the children\u2019s parent;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u201c(2) to resolve doubts in favor of the child when there is a conflict between the interests of a minor child and the interests of an adult; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c(3) to encourage the development of day care services for minor children in a safe, healthy, and homelike environment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">One of those policies is to protect minor children in its care. The record in this case does not show, or even suggest, that the State has done anything in violation of this policy. To be sure, the State placed the appellant at Finding Direction, Inc., a duly licensed group home. \u00a7\u00a7 5-507 through 5-509 of the Family Law Article; COMAR 01.04.04. But the appellant does not allege in his amended complaint that the State was negligent in licensing or monitoring Finding Direction, Inc. And there were no allegations that, when the appellant was placed, Finding Direction, Inc., was not then operating in compliance with applicable State licensing laws. Thus, there is no allegation, never mind evidence, showing that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>violated \u00a7 5-526(c) by placing the appellant with Finding Direction, Inc. In the absence of such an allegation, the appellant\u2019s amended complaint is insufficient to plead negligence based upon an alleged statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Before proceeding to a discussion of the special relationship prong of the appellant\u2019s argument, it is important to distinguish <em>Horridge v. Department of Social Services, </em>382 Md. 170, 854 A.2d 1232 (2004). <em>Horridge </em>was a negligence action that had been dismissed for failure to state a claim. The case arose out of the abuse, and eventual murder, of a young child. The father of the child, who resided in Texas, alleged that \u201che made eight reports to the St. Mary\u2019s County DSS of physical abuse being inflicted on his nineteen-month-old son Collin by Collin\u2019s mother or her boyfriend ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 854 A.2d at 1234. DSS was largely unresponsive to both the father\u2019s reports and to a neighbor\u2019s independent report. DSS employees made visits to the home but decided against taking any action, relying instead on the mother\u2019s positive statements concerning the well-being of the child. Social workers from DSS treated the father\u2019s complaints as those of an estranged, custody-deprived father, and told him not to make any further reports. They made no further inspections based upon the father\u2019s last report. Tragically, two to three months after the father began making reports to DSS, the child was beaten to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The appellant contends that the <em>Horridge </em>Court determined that there was a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the State and the aggrieved party in that case, which created a duty applicable here. He substantially relies on that case to argue that \u201cseveral criteria have been identified to determine whether or not a \u2018special relationship\u2019 exists.\u201d This argument, however, is somewhat misplaced. Horridge pled two counts of negligence against DSS, one based upon a statutory duty and the other based upon a duty arising out of a special relationship. The Court addressed only the issue of statutory duty. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 854 A.2d at 1239 (\u201c[W]e need deal only with the statutory context pled in Count I.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>In relation to that statutory duty, the relevant statutes in <em>Horridge </em>were \u00a7\u00a7 5-701 through 5-714 of the Family Law Article, rather than \u00a7 5-526(c), as in this case. Those sections of the Family Law Article require anyone who may have reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect to notify the DSS or a law enforcement agency, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-704(c) and 5-705(d), as a result of and in response to which DSS must respond within 24 hours. Section 5-706(b). This latter section and the corresponding COMAR sections, the Court in <em>Horridge </em>concluded, imposed a duty on DSS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-U\">\u201cThe duties imposed on DSS by FL \u00a7 5-706 and the implementing regulations of the Department of Human Resources are far more specific and focused. They require a prompt investigation of <em>each </em>reported incident of child abuse. The duty to act is mandatory; the steps to be taken are clearly delineated; and, most important, the statute makes clear in several places that the sole and specific objective of the requirement is the protection of a specific class of children\u2014those identified in or identifiable from specific reports made to DSS and those also found in the home or in the care or custody of the alleged abuser. This is not an obligation that runs to everyone in general and no one in particular. <em>It runs to an identified or identifiable child or discrete group of children.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 189-90, 854 A.2d at 1243 (some emphasis added). The statutes with which the <em>Horridge </em>Court was concerned were intended to protect a specific class of children, by requiring a mandatory response by DSS to each reported incident of child abuse. That obligation was owed, therefore, to \u201ca specific class of children, identified or identifiable before the fact from statutorily mandated reports, from a specific kind of harm likely to occur if the statutory duty is ignored. DSS is given not just a specific duty to act in response to such a report but ample and detailed authority to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 854 A.2d at 1244. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201cThe legislative policy of preventing future harm to children already reported to have been abused is so abundantly clear as to be beyond cavil, and, given the statutory man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>date to act and the general waiver of tort immunity when State employees fail to act in a reasonable way and harm ensues, we can see no great burden or consequence to regarding this existing statutory duty as a civil one from which tort liability may arise. We cannot conceive that the Legislature intended, when a child is killed or injured, at least in part because DSS fails to perform the duties clearly cast upon it to make a site visit within 24 hours and a thorough investigation, for the only sanction to be the placement of a reprimand in some social worker\u2019s personnel file. The Legislature meant for DSS and its social workers to act immediately and aggressively when specific reports of abuse or neglect are made, and the best way to assure that is done is to find that they <em>do </em>have a special relationship with specific children identified in or, upon reasonable effort, identifiable from, facially reliable reports of abuse or neglect and, subject to the State Tort Claims Act, to make them liable if harm occurs because they fail in their mandated duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 193, 854 A.2d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In <em>Horridge, </em>there was no issue raised as to the sufficiency of the pleadings, the State simply having failed satisfactorily to comply with the specific mandates, with the discharge of which one of its agencies was charged. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>on the contrary, there are no well-pled factual allegations that the State failed to comply with a specific statutory requirement. The State placed the appellant in the care of Finding Direction, Inc., a duly licensed group home, to be sure. While that was properly alleged, it was not alleged that the State had not properly licensed or supervised Finding Direction, Inc., or that Finding Direction, Inc., was, in any way, in violation of the requirements of its operating license. Furthermore, once Finding Direction, Inc., was apprized that the appellant had reported that he had been sexually abused and battered, it notified the State, as it was required to do, and the State acted immediately to address the situation. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Horridge, </em>where the pleadings alleged a failure on the part of the State to respond as statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>required, the complaint here contained no such sufficient allegation of the State\u2019s dereliction in failing to respond, once it was notified of the alleged incident of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">B. Special Relationships</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Regardless of the distinction between Horridge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and this case, it is evident that the relationship of one party to another may give rise to a duty under certain circumstances. In rationalizing these \u201cspecial relationships,\u201d the Court has adopted the reasoning of several sections, reflective of our common law, of the <em>Restatement (Second) of </em>Torts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or reasoned from the affirmative action of one party, on the basis of which the other party relies to his or her detriment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These relationships are often separate and distinct, yet they both involve the same duty and responsibility, however the resulting relationship is forged or develops. As the appellant sees it, the State did an affirmative act when it removed him from his mother\u2019s care and his parents\u2019 custody, thus establishing a special relationship with, and a concomitant duty to, him, as one of the children in the State\u2019s care. This use of \u201caffirmative act,\u201d however, blurs the distinction between the application of the common law duty and the reliance duty. We shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>analyze the duty that arises out of special relationships in both contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Common Law</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>discusses special relationships, and the duties that arise therefrom, in several pertinent sections. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 314A, 315, 319-20 (1965).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, in <em>Remsburg v.

Regarding the Restatement, we observed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[s]ection 315 is a special application of the general rule set forth in \u00a7 314. Section 314 states that \u2018[t]he fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.\u2019 In turn, \u00a7 315 articulates the general rule that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">[tjhere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">(b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">303 Md. at 242, 492 A.2d at 1300.

The comment to \u00a7 319, however, indicates that the rule stated in that section applies to two situations. First, \u00a7 319 applies to those situations where the actor has charge of one or more of a class of persons to whom the tendency to act injuriously is normal. Second, \u00a7 319 applies to those situations where the actor has charge of a third person who does not belong to such a class but who has a peculiar tendency so to act of which the actor from personal experience or otherwise knows or should know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">Illustrations appended to \u00a7 319, which concern the negligent release of an infectious patient from a private hospital for contagious diseases and the escape of a homicidal maniac patient through the negligence of guards employed by a private sanitarium for the insane, provide farther guidance regarding the scope of \u00a7 319.

In <em>DeShaney, </em>a civil rights action (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), was brought by the mother of a child who had been beaten by his father, against social workers who had received complaints that the child was being abused by his father, but failed to remove him from his father\u2019s custody, and their employer, the DSS. The Supreme Court held that, after receiving the complaint, the State had no constitutional duty to protect the child from his father. 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006, 103 L.Ed.2d at 263.

Although the Court mentioned the State\u2019s duty in that case in the context of negligence claims, stating, \u201c[i]t may well be that, by voluntarily undertaking to protect [the child] against a danger it concededly played no part in creating, the State acquired a duty under state tort law to provide him with adequate protection against that danger[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 201-02, 109 S.Ct. at 1006, it did so only in dicta. The Court also observed, expressly declining to opine on its validity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cHad the State by the affirmative exercise of its power removed [the child] from free society and placed him in a foster home operated by its agents, we might have a situation sufficiently analogous to incarceration or institutionalization to give rise to an affirmative duty to protect. Indeed, several Courts of Appeals have held, by analogy to <em>Estelle </em>and <em>Youngberg, </em>that the State may be held liable under the Due Process Clause for failing to protect children in foster homes from mistreatment at the hands of their foster parents. <em>See Doe v.

Therefore, the Court\u2019s holding is only tangentially relevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As stated <em>supra, </em>the appellant failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the State violated an affirmative duty of care, statutorily created by the Legislature, the benefits of which redounded to the appellant. Additionally, we reiterate that, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the appellant has not satisfactorily alleged any facts to show that the State took an affirmative act on its own part that would create a common law special relationship from which a duty would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Generally unless there is a special relationship, \u201c[t]here is no duty to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him [or her] from causing physical harm to another.... \u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 315 (1965). There are two circumstances in which a special relationship giving rise to a duty on the part of the State could have been alleged to exist in the case <em>sub judice: </em>(1) the State had control of Wratehford and knowledge of some propensity of his to do harm to others (\u00a7 319) and (2) the State, having custody of the appellant and having placed him in foster care, owed the appellant a duty to exercise reasonable care in protecting him from other persons under the State\u2019s control, as to whom it knew, or had reason to know, could, and likely would, harm him. \u00a7 319 (a party must \u201cknow or have reason to know\u201d that a third person is likely to cause harm to another); \u00a7 320 (it is necessary for a party to exercise control over a third person to prevent that person from harming another intentionally and that the State had knowledge of the necessity to control such third persons). Any duty, if in fact one exists, is then a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances. <em>Albeit </em>in the context of a statutory duty, the prerequisite knowledge did exist in <em>Horridge </em>and was pled in the complaint in that case. There was, however, no sufficient factual allegation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>knowledge in the amended complaint in the instant case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In his reply brief, the appellant argues that he could not provide any additional factual specificity. He offered two reasons: \u201cFirst, what the State knew about Wratchford is a fact solely within the State\u2019s control.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] Second, the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ments, if any, that would disclose what the State knew about Wratehford are confidential and, therefore, [the appellant] was unable to ascertain that information prior to discovery.\u201d[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The appellant argues that the State had, or should have had, knowledge of Wratchford\u2019s alleged history of committing abuse, if there was any such history, by virtue of the documents it was required to provide the group home prior to Wratchford\u2019s admission to the group home, i.e., his social history or predisposition report and any psychological or psychiatric reports, COMAR 01.04.04.23. In addition, it should have had the reports of the social workers who met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>with him as COMAE 07.02.11.17 required them to do. He also cites <em>Whiteley v. Schoenlein, </em>183 Md. 590, 596, 39 A.2d 692, 695 (1944), for the contention that \u201c[t]he rule requiring positiveness of pleading is relaxed so as to permit an allegation on information and belief where the fact is not presumably within the knowledge of plaintiff but is within that of the defendants.\u201d 183 Md. at 596, 39 A.2d at 695 <em>(citing Hendrickson v. Standard Oil Co., </em>126 Md. 577, 588, 95 A. 153, 158 (1915)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u2022 <em>Whiteley </em>was not a negligence case, rather it was a contract case in which the dispute concerned a provision of that contract relating to the division of the profits due the parties to the business venture. 183 Md. at 596, 39 A.2d at 695. Specifically, as relevant here, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cAs to the contention that the complainant nowhere states the basis of his belief that there was a substantial profit and that this is a mere conclusion of the pleader, the bill does allege that the defendants have custody of all the records and have failed to make an accounting. The rule requiring positiveness of pleading is relaxed so as to permit an allegation on information and belief where the fact is not presumably within the knowledge of the plaintiff but is within that of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\"><em>Id. </em>It was in this respect, and only in this respect, that the Court relaxed the requirement for positiveness of pleading\u2014 where there is an allegation of exclusive custody of records and the relief sought depends on what those records show. The Court relied on <em>Hendrickson v. Standard Oil Co., </em>126 Md. 577, 95 A. 153, <em>supra. </em>That case also did not concern a negligence claim; the issue, nuisance, involved allegations related \u201cto the prospective installation of a large tank, for the storage of inflammable and explosive oils, in immediate proximity to the plaintiffs houses.\u201d <em>Hendrickson, </em>126 Md. at 588, 95 A. at 158. We stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cThis would undoubtedly be a nuisance against which the plaintiff would have a clear right to preventive relief. The allegation as to this branch of the case is not in the form of a specific charge, but states only the plaintiffs information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>and belief in regard to the purpose of the defendant to locate the storage tank in the position indicated. It is objected that this form of averment is not sufficiently definite; but it is to be observed that the bill was referring in this instance to the defendant\u2019s <em>intention, </em>and, as said in 16 Cyc. 230, the rule requiring positiveness of pleading \u2018is relaxed so as to permit an allegation on information and belief where the fact is not presumably within the knowledge of plaintiff, but is within that of defendant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3r\"><em>Hendrickson, </em>126 Md. at <em>588, 95 A. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">These cases, and the allegations they addressed, are distinguishable from the allegations in the case <em>sub judice. </em>There is a real difference between the allegations required to plead an accounting and those necessary to plead negligence. The facts in the former situation are often exclusively within the defendant\u2019s knowledge and possession, including, most particularly, the thought process critical to the resolution of the issue. Similarly, generally, <em>intention </em>is different from a concrete fact that is discoverable by, and during, investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Different situations and causes of action may require different, varying levels of factual specificity for pleading purposes. We stated in <em>Read Drug and Chemical Co. v. Colwill Construction Co., </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cIt is obvious that the necessary allegations of fact sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence in a simple factual situation vary from those in more complex factual situations and a form of declaration useful in the former situation may not be sufficient as a guide in preparing a declaration for the more complex case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">250 Md. 406, 413, 243 A.2d 548, 553 (1968). Discussing the pleading standard in negligence actions, the Court quoted, with approval, from Joseph O. Kaiser, <em>Pleading Negligence in Maryland-Res Ipsa Loquitur as a Rule of Pleading, </em>11 Md. L.Rev. 102,103-04 (1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\u201cThus, a rather flexible standard is presented to the Maryland practitioner for his use in stating a cause of action for negligence. A survey of the Maryland statutory forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and the Maryland cases will demonstrate that where the plaintiffs right and the defendant\u2019s corresponding duty are simple and easily perceived, a simple factual statement of the defendant\u2019s act or omission in breach thereof, coupled with the general characterization of the defendant\u2019s act or omission as negligent, will suffice. On the other hand, <em>the less apparent the plaintiff\u2019s right and the defendant\u2019s duty, the more likely the pleader will be required to specify the acts or omissions relied upon to constitute the negligent conduct. </em>Otherwise stated, in simple situations involving an easily recognized breach of duty, a general averment of negligence following a simple statement of the defendant\u2019s act or omission will be regarded as an ultimate fact; while <em>in more complex situations where the breach of duty is not readily apparent, such an averment will be regarded as a mere legal conclusion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><em>See Read Drug, </em>250 Md. at 413-14, 243 A.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">As to the latter category of case\u2014the \u201cmore complex situation\u201d\u2014the Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\u201cExcept in cases involving such simple and specialized situations as the motor vehicle and carrier-passenger cases [respectively <em>American Express Company v.

Cole, </em>38 Md. 110, 113 (1873) (quoting in part from an opinion by Mr. Justice Butler in <em>Rex v.

In the landmark case of <em>State, use of Jeter v. Schwind Quarry Co., </em>97 Md. 696, 55 A. 366 (1903), a declaration was held to be insufficient on demurrer which alleged that the defendant operator of a stone quarry negligently directed the decedent of the plaintiff to extract a charge of blasting powder which had been placed in a hole drilled in a rock; that the plaintiffs decedent was not sufficiently skilled for this type of work, was ignorant of the danger involved and was not warned of the danger by the defendant; that in the execution of the work assigned to him, the plaintiffs decedent was killed due to the negligence of the defendant. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the declaration and the judgment for the defendant for costs was affirmed. This Court held that the declaration was insufficient because it failed to allege specifically enough in what way the defendant violated any duty to the plaintiffs decedent, that is, in what respect the place supplied by the defendant for the plaintiffs decedent to work was not safe; what was the particular danger which was created by the negligence of the defendant; and how the allegedly unsafe condition was connected with and caused the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cIn <em>Livingston v. Stewart &amp; Co., Inc., </em>194 Md. 155, 69 A.2d 900 (1949), the declaration alleged that while the plaintiff was a business invitee in the defendant\u2019s department store, a two-wheel bicycle fell on the plaintiff as a result of which the plaintiff was injured through the negligence of the defendant and without any fault of the plaintiff. In the bill of particulars filed by the plaintiff, it was stated that the exact facts of the negligence of the defendant were particularly within the knowledge of the defendant which had sole control of the bicycle. This Court held that the lower court properly sustained the demurrer to the declaration because it \u2018contains only the argumentative conclusion that plaintiffs injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, but states no acts done or left undone by defendant which constitute negligence or a negligent manner of doing anything.\u2019 (194 Md. at 159, 69 A.2d at 901.) Judge Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>kell, for the Court, in <em>Livingston </em>quoted with approval from <em>Phelps v.

It does not allege \u201cin what way the [State] violated any duty to the [appellant],\u201d <em>Read Drug, </em>250 Md. at 415, 243 A.2d at 554, <em>citing Jeter, </em>97 Md. at 699, 55 A. at 367, or the \u201cacts done or left undone by the [State] which constitute negligence or a negligent manner of doing anything.\u201d <em>Livingston, </em>194 Md. at 159, 69 A.2d at 901. Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s averments, without more factual specificity as to the relationship between the State and Wratchford, and thus its knowledge of his potential danger to a roommate, constitute simply legal conclusions. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">As we have seen, the appellant argues that the State\u2019s removal of the appellant from his mother\u2019s care constituted an \u201caffirmative act,\u201d which thereby established a special relationship between the State and the appellant. We do not agree. \u201cAffirmative act,\u201d as used by the appellant and as applied in this context, is not characteristic of the kind of conduct this Court has found necessary to establish a special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We considered the nature of the conduct necessary to \u201cforge\u201d a special relationship in <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986). There, in the context of a police officer\u2019s interaction with the public, characterizing the key element as an \u201caffirmative act,\u201d the Court stated, generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201cA proper plaintiff, however, is not without recourse. If he alleges sufficient facts to show that the defendant policeman created a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with him upon which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>relied, he may maintain his action in negligence. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 31503). This \u2018special duty rule,\u2019 as it has been termed by the courts, is nothing more than a modified application of the principle that although generally there is no duty in negligence terms to act for the benefit of any particular person, when one does indeed act for the benefit of another, he must act in a reasonable manner. <em>See Scott v. Watson, supra, </em>278 Md. at 170-71, 359 A.2d at 555; <em>Penna R.R. Co. v. Yingling, </em>148 Md. 169, 129 A. 36 (1925). In order for a special relationship between police officer and victim to be found, it must be shown that the local government or the police officer <em>affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, </em>thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 630-31, 510 A.2d at 1085 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted); <em>Williams v.

Rather than arrest the man, as he obviously could have done, the officer told him to pull his vehicle to the side of the store and not to drive any more that night. Disregarding the officer\u2019s admonition, the man drove off after the officer left and, while doing so, hit a pedestrian, who, as a result of the collision, lost his leg. This Court held that a special relationship had not been established in that case. It reasoned that the victim had \u201calleged no facts which show that [the police officer] affirmatively acted specifically for [the victim\u2019s] benefit.\u201d 306 Md. at 631-32, 510 A.2d at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Court applied the <em>Ashbum </em>standard in <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 805 A.2d 372.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>issue in that case was: \u201cwhether local government emergency telephone system employees (specifically operators, dispatchers, and managers) owe an individual, tort duty to persons in need of their services, and, if so, under what circumstances the employees may be held liable for the negligent performance of that duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 805 A.2d at 377. Stated differently, the question was whether a special relationship existed between 9-1-1 employees and victim callers. The Court concluded that \u201ca 911 employee generally owes no duty in tort for the negligent performance of his or her duties to an individual in need of emergency telephone. services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 805 A.2d at .398-99. It reasoned, \u201cabsent a special relationship between a 911 employee and an individual in need of emergency services, an employee does not owe such an individual a private duty in tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 805 A.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">After reviewing the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d jurisprudence of jurisdictions throughout the country, the Court reaffirmed its <em>Ashbum </em>holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201cAlthough we acknowledge that a more formulaic special relationship test may facilitate greater predictability, our review of the many different special relationship requirements adopted by other jurisdictions reinforces our choice not to incorporate a more regimented approach into Maryland\u2019s special relationship test. We continue to believe that \u2018the intent of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d doctrine is better addressed by our general standard outlined in Ashbum\u2019 because it preserves our ability to determine \u2018whether a special relationship exists\u2019 on a \u2018case-by-case basis.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 495, 805 A.2d at 401 <em>(citing Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 150, 753 A.2d 41, 67-68 (2000)). Applying <em>Ashbum </em>to 9-1-1 employees, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u201c[I]n order for a special relationship between a 911 employee and a person in need of assistance to exist, it must be shown that the 911 employee <em>affirmatively acted </em>to protect or assist the specific individual, or a specific group of individuals like the individual, in need of assistance, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>often inducing the specific reliance of the individual on the employee[,]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 496, 805 A.2d at 401 (emphasis added), and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cIn our view, acting to protect or assist a \u2018specific group of individuals,\u2019 sufficient to create a special relationship, involves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large in need of emergency telephone services. To find otherwise, by equating a duty to act with the provision of a general public service, might jeopardize the availability of those services in the first instance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Z\"><em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 499-500, 805 A.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">This reasoning is applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>As in <em>Muthukumarana, </em>in this case, an \u201caffirmative act\u201d sufficient to create a special relationship \u201cinvolves more than general actions taken to serve members of the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 805 A.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Removing the appellant from the care of his mother and placing him in the foster care program was a statutorily mandated and required act of the State. It was affirmative in the respect that the State took action to place him in the custody of the child welfare program, but it was not an \u201caffirmative act\u201d sufficient to create a special relationship giving rise to a duty out of which a claim based on negligence can result. Without specifically applying the public duty doctrine to the State\u2019s actions in this instance, we hold that an affirmative act sufficient to create a special relationship must consist of something more (as in <em>Horridge, </em>albeit statutorily mandated) than simply placing a child in foster care. <em>See Williams, </em>359 Md. at 140, 151, 753 A.2d at 62, 68 (Where a police officer told individuals to go into a house and that he would remain, the officer may have had a duty to tell them he was leaving. \u201c[Ajffirmative actions and specific promises of protection ..., if in fact they occurred, are sufficient to have created a special relationship \u2014 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Child welfare services pursuant to statute are services to the general public. The State, by creating a program of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>services, available to the general public, does not create a special relationship to any particular individual. Generally, without factual allegations of some other affirmative act beyond that required under the general program, no common law special relationship to any specific individual normally will result. As we said in <em>Muthukumarana, </em>\u201c[t]o find otherwise, by equating a duty to act with the provision of a general public service, might jeopardize the availability of those services in the first instance.\u201d 370 Md. at 499-500, 805 A.2d at 403. This decision \u201cis consistent with our view of narrowly construing the \u2018special relationship\u2019 exception.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>381 Md. at 642, 851 A.2d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The appellant did not allege in his amended complaint that the State took any action other than what was mandated statutorily. Therefore, we conclude that there was no affirmative act on the part of the State that created a common law special relationship. Furthermore, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the appellant did not allege with sufficient specificity facts necessary to establish that the State had a duty to the appellant in this instance. The trial court correctly granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The purpose of child welfare services is to place children in a protective setting. It is for this reason that there are significant statutory guidelines that dictate how the State is to operate and monitor group home care programs. The appellant did not allege that the State failed adequately to license or monitor Finding Direction, Inc., the group home in question, nor did he allege that the group home was, or was being, operated improperly. Moreover, the appellant did not allege knowledge by the State of the abuser\u2019s history of abuse or propensity for that kind of conduct. Absent a sufficient factual allegation that the State had knowledge, or reason to know, that Wratchford had some propensity for abuse as well as knowledge that he would be placed in close proximity to the appellant, a likely target of those propensities, there is no duty giving rise to a cause of action for negligence. The allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>in the amended complaint were factually insufficient to plead a duty on the part of the State. The motion to dismiss was properly granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. Maryland Rule 2-322 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\"(b) Permissive.

These cases are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>None of them addressed the situation where the State placed a child with an independently licensed group home, as to which there were no allegations of licensing impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The <em>P.G. </em>court found a special relationship between the State and prospective foster parents. 4 P.3d at 331-332. The court concluded that the State had a duty to inform the prospective foster parents of a foster child\u2019s history so that they could make an informed decision as to whether to adopt the child. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ronald S. </em>court held that a special relationship existed between the County and a foster child with respect to the child\u2019s foster care placement. 16 Cal.App.4th at 895, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 418. That relationship, arising from the child's dependency, <em>i.e., </em>he was entirely in the County's control, <em>id., </em>imposed a duty on the County to investigate the qualifications of the proposed foster parents. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the <em>Mark G. </em>court only assumed, for argument's sake, that <em>DeShaney, supra, </em>signaled that a special relationship is created between the State and a child when the child is removed from his home and placed into foster care. <em>Mark G., </em>677 N.Y.S.2d at 300, 247 A.D.2d at 21.
