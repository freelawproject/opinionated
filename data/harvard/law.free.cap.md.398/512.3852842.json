We shall hold that petitioner is not eligible for medical benefits, <em>i.e. </em>hearing aids, under \u00a7 9-660 unless he is eligible for compensation under \u00a7 9-505 and \u00a7 9-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Petitioner, Frederick Green, was employed by the Carr Lowery Glass Company for over thirty years as a mold shop worker. On August 3, 2004, he filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (hereinafter \u201cCommission\u201d), alleging that \u201cyears of exposure to loud glass machine[s] caused loss of hearing.\u201d Dr. Brian Kaplan, a physician affiliated with Ear, Nose <em>&amp; </em>Throat Associates in Baltimore, evaluated petitioner\u2019s hearing on October 19, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Kaplan\u2019s evaluation stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cMr. Green does have a mild to severe high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. His Maryland Compensation Formula for hearing loss is zero percent. However, this pattern of hearing loss is consistent with that caused by significant environmental noise exposure. This noise exposure and hearing loss is likely also the cause of the factors for his bilateral tinnitus. He is a good hearing aid candidate given the degree of loss and discrimination scores. The cost of hearing aids is $5,125.00. I have recommended good hearing protection in the future when in loud environments and will plan on seeing him back on an as needed basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">According to Dr. Kaplan\u2019s audiogram, petitioner suffered some hearing loss in the range of frequencies between 2000 and 3000 hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The Commission held a hearing on January 28, 2005 to determine whether petitioner sustained an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment, and whether petitioner was entitled to hearing aids, as recommended by Dr. Kaplan. By written order, on February 10, 2005, the Commission denied petitioner\u2019s claim, finding that petitioner \u201cdid not sustain an occupational disease of binaural hearing loss arising out and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred on February 25, 2003, and ... that the [hearing aids] issue is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Green filed a petition for judicial review, and both parties moved for summary judgment. On May 27, 2005, after hearing arguments by the parties, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an oral opinion. The court concluded, \u201cit is required that the claimant meet the standard of \u00a7 9-650 before being entitled to medical benefits.\u201d By written order on May 31, 2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer/insurer, denied petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and affirmed the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Green filed a timely appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the contest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ed statutory provisions, \u00a7 9-505 and \u00a7 9-650, and concluded that an inquiry of the legislative history was unnecessary because the statutory language is sufficiently clear. <em>Green v. Carr, </em>170 Md.App. 502, 514, 907 A.2d 845, 851 (2006). The intermediate appellate court noted also that the language of \u00a7 9-505 is \u201cmuch too broad to function independently and serve as the sole basis for compensation, medical expenses, or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 907 A.2d at 853. Instead, the court held that \u00a7 9-505 establishes that occupational deafness due to industrial noise in certain frequencies is a compensable condition, and that one who suffers occupational deafness is entitled to compensation and benefits if he or she also meets the requirements in \u00a7 9-650. <em>Id. </em>at 518-19, 907 A.2d at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">This Court granted Green\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cIs a Claimant whose hearing has been damaged as a result of his occupation and who meets the criteria for benefits under Labor &amp; Employment Article \u00a7 9-505 entitled to have hearing aids provided by the Employer/Insurer, despite the fact that he does not meet the criteria for monetary compensation under Labor &amp; Employment Article \u00a7 9-650?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\"><em>Green v. Lowery, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 919 A.2d 700 (2007). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md. Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a genuine dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2\u2014501(f); <em>see Hill v. Knapp, </em>396 Md. 700, 711, 914 A.2d 1193, 1199 (2007). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">. We first recount briefly the history and statutory framework of Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as related to hearing loss in particular. Workers\u2019 compensation encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>passes two main categories of compensable events: accidental personal injury and occupational diseases. \u00a7\u00a7 9-501, 9-502; <em>Means v. Baltimore County, </em>344 Md. 661, 664, 689 A.2d 1238, 1239 (1997); <em>see also Yox v. Tru-Rol, </em>380 Md. 326, 330-36, 844 A.2d 1151, 1153-57 (2004) (providing a detailed history of Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act). Today, an employee\u2019s hearing loss may fall into either category, depending on whether the employee experienced a sudden traumatic event or was exposed repeatedly to loud noises. <em>See Yox, </em>380 Md. at 332, 844 A.2d at 1154. This was not always the case, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">As first enacted in 1914, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided compensation only for accidental injuries that arose out of and in the course of employment, and an employee was not required to show that his or her disability resulted in a loss of wages or earning capacity. <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 330-31, 844 A.2d at 1153-54. Thus, an employee who suffered the total loss of hearing in both ears due to a one-time accident that created a loud blast, for example, would have received compensation. <em>See Belschner v. Anchor Post, </em>227 Md. 89, 92, 175 A.2d 419, 420-21 (1961). Compensation for hearing loss as an occupational disease, however, was not provided until 1951. <em>See Yox, </em>380 Md. at 332, 844 A.2d at 1154. At that time, claims for occupational disease related to hearing loss were not compensable unless the employee showed that he or she was no longer able to work in the occupation that produced the disability. <em>See Belschner, </em>227 Md. at 92-93, 175 A.2d at 422; <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 333-33, 844 A.2d at 1154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In 1967, the Legislature amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to create a separate provision dealing specifically with occupational disease hearing loss. <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 333-34, 844 A.2d at 1155. The new provision, \u00a7 25A of Article 101, provided that \u201coccupational deafness shall be compensated according to the terms and conditions of this section\u201d and set forth a testing methodology for determining eligibility for compensation. 1967 Md. Laws, Chap. 155; <em>Crawley v. General Motors Corp., </em>70 Md.App. 100, 104, 519 A.2d 1348, 1350, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 147, 528 A.2d 473 (1987). The new provision stated that only hearing losses in the range of 500, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>1000, and 2000 cycles per second were compensable, and provided that, \u201c[i]f the losses of hearing average 15 decibels or less in the three frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not then constitute any compensable hearing disability.\u201d 1967 Md. Laws, Chap. 155; <em>Crawley, </em>70 Md.App. at 104, 519 A.2d at 1350; <em>see also Yox, </em>380 Md. at 334, 844 A.2d at 1155-56 (summarizing compensability criteria).- We have recognized that the intent of the Legislature in enacting the new provision was \u201cnot only to provide technical criteria for measuring occupational loss of hearing but also to make,such loss compensable without regard to inability to work or loss of wages.\u201d <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 335, 844 A.2d at 1156 (quoting <em>Crawley v. General Motors Corp., </em>70 Md.App. 100, 107, 519 A.2d 1348, 1352 (1987)). Thus, we held that the statute provided that an employee may be eligible for occupational disease compensation due to work-related hearing loss without a showing of disablement, <em>ie., </em>loss of wages or inability to perform regular work. <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 335, 844 A.2d at 1156; <em>Crawley, </em>70 Md.App. at 101, 519 A.2d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As part of the Legislature\u2019s general code revision process in 1991, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Art. 101, was repealed and recodified as Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 335, 844 A.2d at 1156. The new statute split the former provisions regarding occupational hearing loss between subtitle 5, dealing with the entitlement to and liability for compensation, and subtitle 6, dealing with benefits. \u00a7\u00a7 9-501 <em>et seq.; Yox, </em>380 Md. at 335, 844 A.2d at 1156. It is the 1991 codification of the statute that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Our focus is primarily on three sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, located in two of the subtitles of Title 9: \u00a7 9-505, which defines occupational deafness; \u00a7 .9-650, which sets forth the criteria for calculating the percentage of hearing loss; and \u00a7 9-660, which provides for medical benefits. For clarity, we set forth the full text of these sections below. As additional context, we include also all of the text in Part VII of Subtitle 6, entitled \u201cOccupational Deafness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Subtitle 5, \u201cEntitlement to and Liability for Compensation,\u201d contains Section 9-505, entitled \u201cOccupational deafness.\u201d Section 9-505 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201c(a) In general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided, an employer shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to a covered employee for loss of hearing by the covered employee due to industrial noise in the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 hertz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c(b) Short-term employer.\u2014An employer is not liable for compensation for occupational deafness under subsection (a) of this section unless the covered employee claiming benefits worked for the employer in employment that exposed the covered employee to harmful noise for at least 90 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Subtitle 6 of Title 9 is entitled \u201cBenefits\u201d and consists of several Parts. Part I addresses general provisions, for example, while Part VII concerns occupational deafness and Part IX provides for medical benefits. Part VII starts with \u00a7 9-649, entitled \u201cScope of part.\u201d Section 9-649 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7p\">\u201cA covered employee who suffers from occupational deafness shall be paid compensation in accordance with this Part VII of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Section 9-650, entitled \u201cCalculation of percentage of hearing loss,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201c(a) Measurement instruments.\u2014(1) Hearing loss shall be measured by audiometric instrumentation that meets the following criteria: (i) ANSI 3.6-1996; (ii) ANSI S3.43-1992; and (iii) ANSI 3.39-1987 or any ANSI standard that supersedes the previous calibration or measurement criteria. (2) Measurements shall be conducted in a sound room that meets the ANSI 3.1-1991 criteria for maximum permissible ambient noise for audiometric test rooms. (3) Behavioral psychoacoustic measurements shall be obtained with instrumentation that utilizes insert earphones, as referenced in ANSI 3.6-1996.(4) Electrodiagnostic measurements such as auditory evoked potentials, acoustic emittance measurements, or distortion product otoacoustic emissions may be obtained to determine the nature and extent of workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>hearing loss. (5) Audiologic results shall be used in conjunction with other information to evaluate a claimant\u2019s compensable hearing loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c(b) Calculation\u2014Average thresholds of hearing.\u2014(1) The percentage of hearing loss for purposes of compensation for occupational deafness shall be determined by calculating the average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 hertz in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2) The average of the thresholds in hearing shall be calculated by: (i) adding together the lowest measured losses in each of the 4 frequencies; and (ii) dividing the total by 4.(3) To allow for the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes found in the population at any given age, there shall be deducted from the total average decibel loss determined under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection one-half of a decibel for each year of the covered employee\u2019s age over 50 at the time of the last exposure to industrial noise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201c(c)(1) If the average hearing loss in the 4 frequencies determined under subsection (b) of this section is 25 decibels or less, the covered employee does not have a compensable hearing loss. (2) If the average hearing loss in the 4 frequencies determined under subsection (b) of this section is 91.7 decibels or more, the covered employee has a 100% compensable hearing loss. (3) For every decibel that the average hearing loss exceeds 25 decibels, the covered employee shall be allowed 1.5% of the compensable hearing loss, up to a maximum of 100% compensable hearing loss at 91.7 decibels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c(d) Binaural percentage of hearing loss.\u2014The binaural percentage of hearing loss shall be determined by: (1) multiplying the percentage of hearing loss in the better ear by 5; (2) adding that product to the percentage of hearing loss in the poorer ear; and (3) dividing that sum by 6. \u201c(e) Amplification device; bone conduction thresholds.\u2014(1) In determining the percentage of hearing loss under this section, consideration may not be given to whether the use of an amplification device improves the ability of a covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>employee to understand speech or enhance behavioral hearing thresholds. (2)(i) In determining a workers\u2019 compensation claim for noise-related hearing loss, audiologic data shall use both bone conduction and air conduction results, (ii) If a conductive loss is present, the bone conduction thresholds for each ear, rather than the air conduction levels, shall be used to calculate a claimant\u2019s average hearing loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Section 9-651, entitled \u201cExtent of Liability,\u201d states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHJM\">\u201c(a) In general.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, an employer is liable for the full extent of the occupational deafness of a covered employee if: (1) the employment of the covered employee by the employer has contributed to any extent to the occupational deafness of the covered employee; and (2) the employer otherwise is liable under this section and \u00a7 9-505 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201c(b) Limitation on liability.\u2014An employer is liable only for the part of the deafness attributable to the employment by the employer if the employer establishes by competent evidence, including the results of a professionally controlled hearing test, the extent of the deafness of the covered employee that existed before exposure to harmful noise in the employment of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Finally, \u00a7 9-660, located in Part IX \u201cMedical Benefits\u201d of Subtitle 6 and entitled \u201cProvision of medical services and treatment,\u201d states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201c(a) In general.\u2014In addition to the compensation provided under this subtitle, if a covered employee has suffered an accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or occupational disease the employer or its insurer promptly shall provide to the covered employee, as the Commission may require: (1) medical, surgical, or other attendance or treatment; (2) hospital and nursing services; (3) medicine; (4) crutches and other apparatus; and (5) artificial arms, feet, hands, and legs and other prosthetic appliances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201c(b) Duration.\u2014The employer or its insurer shall provide the medical services and treatment required under subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tion (a) of this section for the period required by the nature of the accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201c(c) Award or order\u2014Not to reopen case or change, previous award.\u2014Except as provided in \u00a7 9-736(b) and (c) of this title, any award or order of the Commission under this section may not be construed to: (1) reopen any case; or (2) allow any previous award to be changed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">As we have often stated, the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Department of Human Resources v. Howard, </em>397 Md. 353, 918 A.2d 441 (2007). In ascertaining legislative intent, we first examine the plain language of the statute, and if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written.. <em>Id. </em>The ordinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation. <em>See Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">If a statute has more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous. <em>See Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005). Ambiguous or equivocal statutory language requires us to consider not only the ordinary meaning of words, but also to interpret how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of an act. <em>See Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006). We resolve any ambiguity in light of the legislative history, prior case law, and statutory purpose. <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 918 A.2d 470, 481 (2007). We avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. <em>See Gwin v. MVA, </em>385 Md. 440, 462, 869 A.2d 822, 835 (2005); <em>Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1115. We presume also that the Legislature has acted with full knowledge of prior legislation, and we construe the statute as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase .is rendered surplusage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory. <em>Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316, 896 A.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Before this Court, petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred by holding that a claimant with work-related hearing loss is not entitled to a hearing aid under \u00a7 9-505 solely because he is not also eligible for monetary benefits under \u00a7 9-650. Petitioner concedes that he is not eligible for monetary benefits under \u00a7 9-650, but he argues that provision of medical benefits is a separate analysis to that of monetary compensation because \u00a7 9-660 says, \u201cin addition to the compensation provided under this subtitle\u201d and compensation is defined as only monetary compensation. Petitioner farther asserts that \u00a7 9-505 establishes liability for \u201coccupational deafness\u201d even where the level of injury does not rise to the threshold for monetary benefits under \u00a7 9-650. Thus, petitioner asserts that he is entitled to reasonable medical expenses under \u00a7 9-660 because he suffered a hearing loss within the ranges set forth in \u00a7 9-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Respondent replies that petitioner does not become eligible for <em>any </em>type of workers\u2019 compensation benefits unless the claim is deemed compensable under both \u00a7 9-505 and \u00a7 9-650. Respondent argues further that \u00a7 9-505 and \u00a7 9-650 are complementary parts of the same test for determining benefits in occupational deafness cases, and that \u00a7 9-505, standing alone, does not create an entitlement to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Our analysis begins with \u00a7 9-505. Section 9-505(a) starts with the words \u201cin general\u201d and is located in a subtitle that establishes the main categories of injuries that are compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 9-505(a) states that, <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided, </em>an employer shall provide <em>compensation in accordance with this title </em>to a covered employee for loss of hearing ... due to industrial noise in the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 hertz.\u201d \u00a7 9-505(a) (emphasis added). Section 9~505(b) requires that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>employee claiming benefits have worked for the employer and been exposed to loud noises for at least 90 days. \u00a7 9-505(b). This general language in \u00a7 9-505 establishes minimal requirements for an occupational deafness claim. The section establishes certain frequencies where a loss of hearing may, in accordance with Title 9, constitute occupational deafness. Section 9-505 also acknowledges that occupational deafness is an occupational disease, regardless of a person\u2019s inability to work or loss of wages. <em>See Yox, </em>380 Md. at 335-36, 844 A.2d at 1156-57 (reiterating that the 1967 amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were intended to make occupational hearing loss, as distinguished from other occupational diseases, compensable without regard to disablement).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Section 9-505 sets forth only general requirements for making an occupational deafness claim. The language of \u00a7 9-505 does not provide any specific criteria for determining the extent of an employee\u2019s hearing loss. Nor does \u00a7 9-505 detail how to calculate a worker\u2019s entitlement to occupational deafness related compensation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, nothing in the language of \u00a7 9-505 explicitly states that an employer shall provide medical benefits to covered employees with hearing loss in the named frequencies. Instead, the language of \u00a7 9-505 relies on qualifying language, <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise </em>pro: <em>vided, </em>an employer shall provide <em>compensation in accordance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>with this title,\u201d </em>to direct the reader to additional details. \u00a7 9-505(a). The word \u201ctitle\u201d refers to the entire Act, which includes subtitle 6, where sections on calculation of percent hearing loss, \u00a7 9-650, and medical benefits, \u00a7 9-660 are set forth. Because of the qualifying language and the general language used in \u00a7 9-505, we do not read \u00a7 9-505 to <em>independently </em>establish employer liability for compensation or medical benefits if a covered employee suffers hearing loss in the identified frequencies. An employee must also qualify for compensation and benefits under \u00a7 9-650 and \u00a7 9-660.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Section 9-650, entitled \u201cCalculation of percentage of hearing loss,\u201d provides precise testing procedures for determining the extent of a worker\u2019s hearing loss. The threshold of hearing loss that must be met in \u00a7 9-650 is calibrated such that any hearing loss experienced due to aging is deducted from the overall calculation of loss. \u00a7 9-650(b)(3). Moreover, \u00a7 9-650 states that a covered employee does not have a compensable hearing loss if the average hearing loss in the four frequency ranges is 25 decibels or less. \u00a7 9-650(c)(l). In requiring an average hearing loss of more than 25 decibels, the Legislature determined that a certain threshold of loss be met in order to warrant compensation. <em>See Yox, </em>380 Md. at 328, 844 A.2d at 1152. As we stated in <em>Yox:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cWe shall hold that <em>an occupational deafness disablement occurs when the hearing loss is sufficient to become compensable under \u00a7 9-650. </em>A claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on occupational deafness must therefore be filed within two years from the time the hearing loss <em>reaches that level of compensability </em>and the employee has actual knowledge that the loss was caused by his/her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The criteria in \u00a7 9-650 presumably establish a threshold that is lower than whatever level of hearing loss constitutes \u201cdisablement,\u201d because occupational hearing loss was meant to be compensable without regard to \u201cdisablement.\u201d <em>See Yox, 380 </em>Md. at 335-36, 844 A.2d at 1156-57. We note, however, that the Legislature did not set a threshold such that <em>any </em>hearing loss attributed to work is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>compensated\u2014an individual must have an average loss of more than 25 decibels in the named frequencies. \u00a7 9-650(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The Court of Special Appeals correctly noted that \u00a7 9-505 does not establish criteria to calculate hearing loss. Judge J. Frederick Sharer, writing for the panel, recognized that \u00a7 9-505 lacks any accounting for age-related hearing loss. Judge Sharer stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cWere [\u00a7 9-505] to be the whole of the test, nearly every employee of a certain age, at every task, will have suffered a compensable disablement. It is a fact that the human aging process is accompanied by some degree of hearing loss in a substantial percentage of the population. To accept [petitioner\u2019s] reasoning, our holding would entitle nearly every worker in an industrial setting to compensation in the nature of medical expenses, including hearing aids, even in the absence of a \u00a7 9-650 calculation of occupational hearing loss. Under that scenario, the \u00a7 9\u2014650(b)(3) provision, providing for deduction for \u2018the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes to be found in the population at any given age\u2019 would be rendered meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Green, </em>170 Md.App. at 517, 907 A.2d at 858. We agree. Section 9-650 provides the technical criteria for measuring occupation hearing loss, and \u00a7 9-505 lacks such criteria because it references what is already established in \u00a7 9-650. The two sections are complementary, and a covered employee must comply with both to be eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Petitioner concedes that he is not eligible for compensation under \u00a7 9-650, but argues that he is entitled to a hearing aid under \u00a7 9-660, \u201cProvision of medical services and treatment.\u201d We do not find support for petitioner\u2019s assertion. Section 9-660 governs the provision of medical benefits for all forms of workers\u2019 compensation claims. Section \u00a7 9-660 begins with the words \u201cin general\u201d and then states \u201c[i]n addition to the compensation provided under this subtitle, <em>if </em>a covered employee has suffered an accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or <em>occupational disease </em>the employer or its insurer promptly shall provide\u201d medical treatment and services. \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>660(a) (emphasis added). Subsection (b) also requires the employer or its insurer to provide the medical treatment and services \u201cfor the period required by the nature of the accidental personal injury, compensable hernia, or occupational disease.\u201d \u00a7 9-660(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The language of \u00a7 9-660 makes provision of medical benefits contingent, through the use of the word \u201cif,\u201d on the employee actually suffering an occupational disease, compensable hernia, or accidental injury. As noted above, we have held that an occupational deafness claim, as an occupational disease, occurs when the hearing loss is sufficient to become compensable under \u00a7 9-650. <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 328, 844 A.2d at 1152. Because petitioner concedes that he is not eligible for compensation under \u00a7 9-650 and therefore concedes also that he is not suffering an occupational deafness disease, we hold that he is not eligible for medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Petitioner\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 9-505 establishes liability to provide medical benefits for occupational deafness even where the level of injury does not rise to the threshold for monetary benefits under \u00a7 9-650 fails. There is no evidence in the language of the statute that two separate thresholds\u2014one for compensation and one for medical benefits\u2014exist. The provision of medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660 is a separate consideration to that of monetary compensation, but the analysis of hearing loss related medical benefits <em>relies on </em>the calculation of percent hearing loss in \u00a7 9-650. Medical services and treatment are to be provided <em>in addition to compensation if </em>a covered employee has suffered an occupational disease, and the only way to determine if the employee may make an occupational deafness claim is to follow the methodology set forth in \u00a7 9-650. <em>See Yox, </em>380 Md. at 328, 844 A.2d at 1152. The language in \u00a7 9-505 stating that \u201closs of hearing by the covered employee due to industrial noise in the [specified] frequencies\u201d does not establish liability for medical benefits because it is general and lacks specific criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Petitioner asserts that \u00a7 9-651 provides further evidence that \u00a7 9-505 was intended to have a meaning independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>from \u00a7 9-650. We disagree. Petitioner relies on language in \u00a7 9-651 stating that an employer is liable if, amongst other things, \u201cthe employer otherwise is hable under this section and \u00a7 9-505 of this title.\u201d \u00a7 9-651(a)(2). Petitioner suggests that, because \u00a7 9-651 does not specifically refer to \u00a7 9-650, satisfaction of \u00a7 9-650 is not required to establish a claim for medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660 if the employee meets the criteria set forth in \u00a7 9-505. Petitioner makes no new argument by relying on the language of \u00a7 9-651. Even though \u00a7 9-651 does not explicitly refer to \u00a7 9-650, \u00a7 9-505 references \u00a7 9-650 by requiring that compensation be provided \u201cin accordance with this title.\u201d \u00a7 9-505(a). The language of \u00a7 9-651 does not support petitioner\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 9-505 establishes an independent ground for medical benefits, nor does \u00a7 9-505 establish an independent ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Considering the statute as a whole, it is inconsistent that the calculation of compensation in accordance with \u00a7 9-650 would include specific audiometric instrumentation methodology while provision of medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660 would not rely on similarly detailed requirements. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, calculation of hearing loss, especially considering the need to account for age-related hearing loss, is complicated and \u201cthe statute is, by necessity, complex.\u201d <em>Green, </em>170 Md.App. at 517, 907 A.2d at 853. The Legislature intended to \u201cset forth a technical set of criteria for when occupational deafness would be compensable.\u201d <em>Yox, </em>380 Md. at 334, 844 A.2d at 1155. Section 9-505 is important in the statutory scheme because it sets forth the general criteria for entitlement and liability as a result of work-related hearing loss, and because it references other sections in Title 9. Based on the language and structure of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we hold that a covered employee is entitled to medical benefits under \u00a7 9-660 for occupational deafness only if the hearing loss is compensable under both \u00a7 9-505 and \u00a7 9-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
