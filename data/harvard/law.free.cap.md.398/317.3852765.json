Specifically, this case arises out of an attempt by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cthe City\u201d), appellee, to condemn several private properties via quick-take.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The properties in question, owned by Robert A. Sape<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ro,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant, are located at 1701-1709 North Charles Street (commonly referred to as the \u201cChesapeake Restaurant\u201d) and 22-24 East Lanvale Street, both located in Baltimore City, Maryland (collectively referred to as \u201cthe Properties\u201d). On December 8, 2005, the City filed with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City an action for regular condemnation and, within it, a petition for immediate possession of and title to the Properties. Thirteen days later, on December 21, 2005, the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s petitions, divesting Mr. Sapero of his property by ordering that the City \u201cbe vested with possession of the fee simple interests in those properties known as 1701-1709 N. Charles Street and 22-24[E.] Lanvale Street ... as of the 21st day of DECEMBER, 2005....\u201d Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, title to the Properties ultimately would vest in the City ten days after personal service of the petitions and relevant order, upon all defendants who had an interest in the Properties, unless such interested parties filed an answer to the City\u2019s petitions within the ten day period \u201calleging that the City does not have the right or power to condemn title to the property....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Mr. Sapero timely filed an answer. On January 20, 2006, the City filed an amended, petition to correct typographical errors in the street directional designations. On that same date, Mr. Sapero filed a motion to vacate. On March 10, 2006, the City filed a second amended petition to include a contract purchas\u00e9r of the property located at 1701-1709 N. Charles Street, Victor Cheswick, Jr. After several postponements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Circuit Court finally held a hearing on March 20, 2006, where it heard arguments concerning the City\u2019s petitions and Mr. Sapero\u2019s motion to vacate. The Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s petitions and denied Mr. Sapero\u2019s motion to vacate. On March 30, 2006, Mr. Sapero filed a motion to alter or amend judgment. The Circuit Court denied that motion. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Mr. Sapero presents several questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201c1. Whether the Circuit Court could condemn Appellant\u2019s real property where the known contract purchase[r] was not timely made a party to the proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">2. Whether the quick-take statute denies due process where the Appellant was not permitted to conduct and complete discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">3. Whether Appellee proved an immediate need for possession by merely testifying that it was necessary for \u2018business expansion?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">4. Whether Appellee acted in good faith in the condemnation proceeding by valuing Appellant\u2019s property at $770,000 when it had actual knowledge of an existing arm\u2019s length purchase contract priced at $2,000,000 for only a portion of the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>5. Whether Appellee can constitutionally condemn Appellant\u2019s property for economic development without proving a carefully considered or significantly controlled development plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">6. Whether the Circuit Court could issue an order under the quick-take statute thirteen days after the filing of the petition when the statute requires the order to be entered within seven days?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As noted, the Circuit Court entered its judgment in this case prior to our decision in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324 (2007). Therefore, the trial court did not have the benefit of our recent decision discussing the requirement of a showing of <em>immediate necessity </em>by the City for condemnations via quick-take under the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, \u00a7 21-16. We reiterate that the City \u201cmust demonstrate the reason or reasons why it is necessary for it to have <em>immediate </em>possession and immediate title to a particular property via the exercise of a quick-take condemnation.\u201d <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 228, 916 A.2d at 327. As we discuss below, the factual circumstances of the case <em>sub judice </em>do not demonstrate that there was a sufficient showing by the City that immediate possession of the Properties was necessary. Therefore, quick-take condemnation was not the proper method for the City\u2019s acquisition of the Properties. We shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with respect to the petition for immediate possession. Additionally, we shall address Mr. Sapero\u2019s due process concerns in regard to the limited discovery allowable under quick-take condemnation pursuant to \u00a7 21-16. With our disposition of the case in addressing questions two and three, we need not resolve Mr. Sapero\u2019s other concerns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">This case arises from circumstances very similar to those in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324 (2007), <em>supra, </em>our recent decision concerning quick-take condemnation in Baltimore City. As in <em>Valsamaki, </em>we are presented with the City\u2019s attempt to obtain possession of private property in furtherance of its urban renewal efforts, specifically in the Charles North Revitalization Area. We described that plan in <em>Valsamaki:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cOn October 25, 1982, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore adopted Ordinance No. 82-799, which established the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan for the Charles North Revitalization Area.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Ordinance No. 82-799 sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>forth the goals and objectives of the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u2018The basic goal of this Urban Renewal Plan is the revitalization of the Charles/North area in order to create a unique mixed-use neighborhood with enhanced viability, stability, attractiveness, and convenience for residents of the surrounding area and of the City as a whole. The objectives of this Plan include:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">a. protecting existing residential neighborhoods;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>b. establishing a positive and identifiable image for the Charles/North Area compatible with the surrounding residential areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">c. accommodating the expansion of existing retail small business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">d. promoting new retail business activity in the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">e. establishing and enforcing uniform comprehensive design and rehabilitation standards that will enhance the physical environment of the business area through private investment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">f. bringing about a general physical improvement of the area through coordinated public improvements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">g. providing a pleasant environment for the staging of year-round promotional activities and events; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">h. removing blighting influences and creating development lots for commercial uses.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">The Property [in the case <em>sub judice, </em>1701-1709 North Charles Street and 22-24 East Lanvale Street] is located within the boundaries of the Charles North Revitalization Area. In June 2004, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore amended the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan by Baltimore City Ordinance No. 04-695, which specifically authorized the acquisition of the subject Property \u2018by purchase or by condemnation, for urban renewal purposes\u2014 \u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\"><em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 230, 916 A.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The Charles North Urban Renewal Plan has been in existence since October 1982 and, from June 2004 onward, the City has been specifically authorized by Ordinance No. 04-695 to acquire the subject Properties. Nonetheless, as in <em>Valsamaki, </em>the City did not act on its authority for well over a year. Apparently the City attempted to negotiate the purchase of the Properties and when it could not reach an agreeable purchase price with Mr. Sapero, it moved forward with quick-take condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Had the City filed an action for regular condemnation when first authorized to do so, there would have been more than 19 months prior to the decision of the trial court during which Mr. Sapero would have had a more complete opportunity to litigate (utilizing discovery) and thus properly present defenses\u2014which a property owner is entitled to do. Throughout a period of time that general condemnation litigation is going forward, governmental entities may continue to negotiate with property owners. The primary result of the practice in the instant case (as in Valsamaki)\u2014whereby the City waits almost a year and a half, then attempts to acquire property via the quick-take procedure\u2014is that the City effectively forecloses the ability of private property owners to fully litigate. In the absence of a true exigency, or an emergency such as an immediate need to alleviate dangerous or unhealthy conditions, the use of quick-take should always be subject to close scrutiny as to the purpose for its use. It should not be used solely as a litigation tactic. It must not be forgotten that private property rights are fundamental constitutional rights under both the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On December 8, 2005, the City filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a petition for condemnation and then a petition for immediate possession of and title to the Properties. The City\u2019s petition for condemnation stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u201cIt is necessary for the [City] to acquire the fee simple interest in and to the property known as 1701-1709[N.] Charles Street and 22-24[EJ Lanvale Street, in Baltimore City, State of Maryland ... together with improvements thereupon, and all the rights, ways, waters, easements, privileges, advantages and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The petition for condemnation further provided that \u201c[t]his property will be used for redevelopment purposes; namely in the North Ch\u00e1rles Project area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The City\u2019s subsequent petition for immediate possession and title stated: \u201cThat it is necessary for Petitioner to acquire immediate possession and title to the said property interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>as appears from the affidavit of William N. Burgee, Director of Property Acquisition and Relocation, Department of Housing and Community Development, attached hereto and prayed to be taken as a part hereof.\u201d The attached affidavit of William N. Burgee stated, in relevant part, only that \u201c[t]hese properties ... must be in possession of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore at the earliest possible time in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d Again, as in <em>Valsamaki, </em>there was no attempt in the affidavit to specify the immediacy of the necessity other than the general statement that the Properties were needed <em>\u201cat the earliest possible time in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. The City, in the affidavit, provided no reason \u201cwhy\u201d any such business expansion necessitated the <em>immediate </em>acquisition of the Properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">After the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s petitions on December 21, 2005, Mr. Sapero timely filed an answer in which he, among asserting other defenses, (1) denied that the City had the right or power to condemn the title to, and take possession of, the Properties and (2) attacked the constitutionality of the City\u2019s petition for condemnation. On February 24, 2006, Mr. Sapero served discovery on the City consisting of interrogatories, a request for production of documents, and a request for admissions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, on March 10, 2006, the City filed an amended petition, adding Victor Cheswick, Jr., contract purchaser for 1701-1709 North Charles Street, as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After several postponements, at least one of which was requested by the City, and more than three months after the City filed its quick-take petition, and almost two years after it had authority to condemn the Properties, a quick-take hearing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was held on March 20, 2006, in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Baltimore City. This was 20-21 months after the City could have initiated condemnation but only three months and several days after it actually did. The trial court first addressed Mr. Sapero\u2019s request for a continuance based upon the fact that the contract purchaser (Mr. Cheswick)\u2014a named party from the second amended complaint\u2014was not present at the hearing. After hearing arguments from the parties\u2019 respective counsel, the trial court, that had granted a continuance to the City on the basis that one of its witnesses was not available, found that a continuance was not necessary in respect to the property owner\u2019s request and also denied Mr. Sapero\u2019s oral motion to vacate. Specifically, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cThe court does not believe it\u2019s appropriate to continue this proceeding, or to vacate that order simply because of the addition of Victor Cheswick to these proceedings that occurred sometime last week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cThat is this issue of the timing of these proceedings is a delicate one. Now, clearly Mr. Sapero as the legal owner of the property, there is no dispute as to that. He has filed this motion, he asked this court for a hearing. That has been addressed, and quite frankly, there has been more than ample time to address the procedural and substantive issues that are subject to this court\u2019s review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cSo for those reasons, the court is going to deny the motion for continuance at this time, deny the oral motion to vacate the court\u2019s order of December 21, 2005, and go forward with a hearing on both the procedural and substantive issues raised in the motion to vacate, as well as any other proceedings that counsel wish this court to entertain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0t\">After further argument by the parties as to how the hearing should proceed, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201cBefore the court is a preliminary matter that defendant\u2019s counsel raises with regard to the scope of this proceeding today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cIt is argued by the defendant that the court should not go forward with a hearing on the fundamental issue of the due process and constitutional challenges to the city\u2019s authority to take by quick take the property of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>\u201cIt is argued that the defendant should have the opportunity to conduct reasonable discovery on the critical issues that are raised in this proceeding.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cThe city maintains that the defendants have had more than ample time, more time than typically afforded under the critical statute, Section 21-16C of the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City. The city further argues that the whole purpose in a quick take proceeding is to provide title [to] the condemning authority so that it can go forward with a project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cThe court must start and end the analysis with Section 21-16C, which according to the defendant\u2019s argument, the court should not apply the time frame, because they are discretionary and not mandatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\"><em>\u201cWhile I am empathetic to the reasonable concerns voiced by the defendant in terms of the time frame, that time frame is mandatory as established by the Code of Public Local Laws under Section 21-16. </em>It provides [that] the court shall, not should, [ ] schedule a hearing within 15 days of the filing of an answer, which hearing shall be only for the purpose of contesting the right and power of the city to condemn the title to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cThat in this court\u2019s view is controlling, and therefore in light of the fact that in this case an answer and motion to vacate was filed on January 5 and an appropriate response in opposition was filed on February 15, we sit here today on March 20th really more than two months after the motion to vacate and the answer was filed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cThat is significantly more time than even allowed by 21-16. <em>So because of the plain meaning of 21-16, which I do understand and will say it\u2019s very constricting in terms of time, </em>the court must apply the time frame under that section of the Code of Public Local Laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cSo at this point, the court will go forward with the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate, and as well on the issue of the constitutional issue as to the propriety of the taking itself.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The trial court then denied Mr. Sapero\u2019s motion to vacate, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cIn short, [although] it does seem in part unfair that the time frame is so stringent and so rigorous. I do not find on the arguments presented that that time frame established by the Code of Public Law is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cNevertheless, there is this substantive issue included in the motion to vacate. The court will address by way of a hearing in the context of whether or not the city can demonstrate that the public interest requires that the city have immediate possession of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cSo for those reasons, the court will deny the motion to vacate, and I\u2019ll pass the written order this evening reflecting denial of the motion on,procedural grounds only, not on the substantive issue created in the third argument.\u201d [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The City called two witnesses in support of its arguments: Mr. Paul Dombrowski (the Director of Planning and Design for the Baltimore Development Corporation and also the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Project Manager for the Charles North area) and M.J. \u201cJay\u201d Brodie (President of the Baltimore Development Corporation). The City first questioned Mr. Dombrowski in regard to the amount tendered by the City for the property known as the Chesapeake Restaurant. Mr. Dombrowski only testified on the subject of valuation\u2014he provided no testimony as to the existence of any exigency or emergency, or any other reason why the acquisition of the Properties was immediately necessary. The City next called Mr. Brodie. Mr. Sapero initially objected, asking that a continuing objection be placed in the record due to the lack of discovery in the proceedings and his resulting inability to depose Mr. Brodie prior to the hearing. The trial court overruled his objection, but acquiesced in his request that it be continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">On direct examination, the City asked Mr. Brodie whether it was necessary to enact Ordinance No. 82-799 and Ordinance No. 04-695 in the Charles North area. Specifically, the question was phrased, \u201c... was it necessary to enact an urban renewal ordinance in this geographic area?\u201d After an objection was made by Mr. Sapero, and overruled, Mr. Brodie responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cWell, the basic reasons are the area has had some structures that were vacant for many years. The Chesapeake is a case in point. That is they were not contributing to business activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cIn some cases, but not all, the buildings were not maintained well. There have been empty buildings for a long time, some are deteriorated, the buildings \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cThe northwest corner of North and Charles might be indicative of some of the deteriorating conditions. So it is a mixed bag of buildings, some maintained better on the outside than others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cWe do in this area, in the Charles North area as we always do, have considered in consultation with residence groups and community associations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201c... So in our view as the Baltimore Development Corporation, we proposed to the City Council amendment five [Ordinance No. 04-695] in the last several years, which would call for the city\u2019s acquisition of certain properties so that they could be assembled, and go back to the area I quoted, number H <em>[see </em>Ordinance No. 82-799A.2.h, supra,] creating development lots for commercial uses. That was part of our intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The City then asked Mr. Brodie: \u201c[W]hy is the subject property at 1701-9 North Charles Street necessary for the urban renewal of the subject area?\u201d After the trial court overruled another objection by Mr. Sapero, Mr. Brodie responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cWell, I quoted from the ordinance so as not to be spontaneous about it. The assemblage of properties for new commercial uses, particularly the Chesapeake Restaurant, the parking lot behind it, which is not owned by Mr. Sapero, but by others, and that we as part of the plan approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cIt was one of several properties, you see them here, a series of properties behind the Chesapeake and its groupings on the southwest corner of the intersection of North and Charles, and the northeast corner. The proposal in the plan was for the city to acquire those properties, to run a competitive process to select a developer to either renovate or a combination of renovate and new construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">After describing the process which the City goes through when soliciting developers for projects such as the Charles North area, the City asked Mr. Brodie whether any developers had been selected for this particular project. Again, Mr. Sapero\u2019s objection was overruled, and Mr. Brodie responded: \u201cThe city received three proposals.\u201d Further response was stricken from the record upon the sustaining of Mr. Sapero\u2019s additional objection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The City then concluded its question<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing of Mr. Brodie. Mr. Sapero declined to cross-examine Mr. Brodie due to Ms inaMlity to conduct discovery. At no point in the questioning did Mr. Brodie testify to the existence of any exigency or emergency or otherwise state why it was necessary for the City to obtain <em>immediate </em>possession of the Properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On March 30, 2006, Mr. Sapero filed a motion to alter or amend judgment. On May 2, 2006, the Circuit Court demed that motion. Thereafter, Mr. Sapero noted a direct appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">This case was tried in the Circuit Court without a jury; therefore, we review it on both the law and the evidence. Md. Rule 8-131(c); <em>Banks v. Pusey, </em>393 Md. 688, 697, 904 A.2d 448, 453 (2006). We will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and in our review \u201cwill give due regard to the opportunity of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c); <em>Banks, </em>393 Md. at 697, 904 A.2d at 453. The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, are not entitled to such deference. \u201cWhen the trial court\u2019s order \u2018involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004) (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We shall address the issues in reverse order, first turning to Mr. Sapero\u2019s contention that the City did not provide sufficient evidence of immediate necessity for quick-take condemnation. Then, we shall address Mr. Sapero\u2019s due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>A. Immediate Necessity\u2014Quickr-Take</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">The Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, \u00a7 21-16, is titled \u201c \u2018Quick-take\u2019 condemnation\u2014in general,\u201d and states in subsection (a), titled \u201cPetition for Immediate Taking,\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_o\">\u201cWhenever any proceedings are instituted under Title 12 of the Real Property Article of Public General Laws of the State of Maryland or by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore for the acquisition of any property for any public purpose whatsoever, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, simultaneously with the filing of said proceedings or at any time thereafter, may file a Petition under oath <em>stating that it is necessary </em>for the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of, or <em>immediate </em>title to and possession of, said property, <em>and the reasons therefore.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00a7 21-16(a) (emphasis added). Section 21-16(c) requires that the City, in a petition for immediate possession of and title to property, state under oath the reasons why it is necessary for the City to have immediate possession of the property. A property owner is entitled to challenge the validity and sufficiency of those reasons or the requirement would be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>requirement at all. Moreover, the statute places the issue before the courts. If the trial court is satisfied that there is an immediate need, it may then grant immediate possession if it feels it is required in the public\u2019s interest: <em>\u201cIf it appears from a Petition for Immediate Possession, </em>with or without supporting affidavits or sworn testimony, that the public interest requires the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of said property.... \u201d \u00a7 21-16(d) (emphasis added). In <em>Valsamaki, </em>we distinguished such quick-take condemnation actions from regular condemnation actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cIn the case of regular condemnation, once the City establishes at least a minimal level of public use or purpose, judicial review may be thereafter limited to determining that the agency\u2019s decision is not so oppressive, arbitrary or unreasonable as to suggest bad faith; that, however, is not the case in assessing immediacy in a quick-take condemnation action in Baltimore City under \u00a7 21-16. Rather, the court must also determine whether there is a necessity to justify an <em>immediate </em>taking and, in that determination, must be able to assess the reasons for the immediacy. Section 21-16 expressly <em>requires the City </em>to state reasons relating to immediacy, thus the City has the burden not only to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of public use, but, additionally, in a quick-take action, the burden to establish the necessity for an immediate taking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 254, 916 A.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Concerning the immediate necessity for quick-take condemnation, Mr. Sapero asserts that \u00a7 21-16 \u201cspecifically require[s] that some justifiable, readily apparent and irrefutable evidence [must] exist that a taking is necessary, not just a bald assertion that a necessary reason exists.\u201d And furthermore, that \u201c[t]he quick-take law\u2019s plain language initially places the burden of proof upon the Petitioner requesting immediate possession, that is, [the City], to provide <em>reasons </em>for the necessity for immediate possession, not just some general assertions that a reason exists.\u201d We agree with the gist of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Mr. Sapero\u2019s contentions. They are in accord with our decision in <em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. 222, 916 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The City, however, while acknowledging that it has the burden to prove immediate necessity in order to proceed with quick-take condemnation, argues that the case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from <em>Valsamaki. </em>Specifically, the City states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">\u201cIn the <em>Valsamaki </em>case the court found that the City had not demonstrated the reason or reason(s) why it was necessary for it to have immediate possession and immediate title to a particular property via the exercise of quick take condemnation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cIn this case not only did the City provide an affidavit stating the need for the property as \u2018business expansion\u2019, but both Mr. Paul Dombrowski, Planner and Mr. M. Jay Brodie, President of Baltimore Development Corporation (\u2018BDC\u2019) testified at the hearing before Judge Berger on March 20,2006.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We do not find the City\u2019s arguments to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The affidavit in the case <em>sub judice </em>stated only that the Properties \u201cmust be in possession of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore at the earliest possible time <em>in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. That language is <em>identical </em>to the affidavit language in <em>Valsamaki, </em>which we found to be inadequate in demonstrating necessity for an immediate taking. 397 Md. at 231, 916 A.2d at 329. Discussing the relevant petitions in <em>Valsamaki, </em>which, we reiterate\u2014with the exception of the property addresses\u2014 utilized language virtually identical to the petitions in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cSection 21-16(a) specifically provides that the City must show the necessity for an <em>immediate </em>taking. The City\u2019s petitions evince a dearth of any specific evidence showing a necessity for the immediate possession of the Property via quick-take condemnation as opposed to a regular condemnation. In the petition for condemnation, the City simply stated that: \u2018This property will be used for redevelopment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>purposes; namely in the Charles North Project area.\u2019[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] The petition for immediate possession and title referenced an attached affidavit which provided only a conclusory and general statement that: \u2018The property ... must be in possession of the [City] at the earliest time possible <em>in order to assist in a business expansion in the </em>area.\u2019 [Emphasis added] \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThe record does not demonstrate sufficient evidence to support a finding that the City is entitled to <em>immediate </em>possession of the Property. As stated <em>supra, </em>the affidavit attached to the petition for immediate possession and title only provides that immediate possession is necessary \u2018in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u2019 This statement, in and of itself, while perhaps sufficient to justify regular condemnation, does not justify a quick-take condemnation. <em>Cf. Free </em>State,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] <em>supra </em>(where affidavit showed necessity for public safety).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. at 256, 916 A.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The City stresses that the testimony of Mr. Dombrowski and Mr. Brodie, <em>supra, </em>provides further indication of the necessity for the immediate acquisition of the Properties. In particular, the City points out that, unlike the situation in <em>Valsamaki, </em>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mr. Brodie testified that three proposals for the redevelopment of the Properties had already been received by the City. As indicated <em>supra, </em>however, Mr. Dombrowski did not testify at all as to the necessity for the City\u2019s immediate possession of the Properties. And Mr. Brodie did not testify to anything other than what Ordinance No. 82-799 and Ordinance No. 04-695 outlined, \u201c[w]ell, I quoted from the ordinance so as not to be spontaneous about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>it[,]\u201d and to the fact that three proposals had been received, \u201c[t]he city received three proposals.\u201d As stated <em>swpra, </em>further response was stricken from the record upon the sustaining of Mr. Sapero\u2019s additional objection. The admitted testimony is insufficient to show the reason or reasons why it is necessary for the City to have immediate possession of the Properties in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The City argues that Mr. Sapero\u2019s objections kept \u201cspecific information about the RFP [Requests for Proposals] and the plan the City contemplated out of the record\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that Mr. Sapero, by declining to cross-examine Mr. Brodie, curtailed evidence that Mr. Brodie would have given in support of the necessity for the immediate taking. The City states that \u201c[i]t is specious of [Mr. Sapero] to assert now that there was no immediate necessity for the City\u2019s taking.\u201d We do not believe that his argument is specious. The City has the burden under \u00a7 21-16 to show the necessity for the immediate possession of property via quick-take condemnation. There is a reason for this. Quick-take condemnation results in a deprivation of the constitutionally protected right to property without the more complete due process protections available in a regular condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In the case of such limited proceedings, it is the City\u2019s responsibility to provide evidence of the actual exigency or emergency for such an immediate taking. The City is arguing that its inability to effectively elicit testimony from its own witnesses\u2014testimony necessary to support its case\u2014-justifies a finding of immediate necessity. This argument is unavailing. It is the responsibility of a particular party to establish evidence in support of its own argument. The City failed to do that here. The fact that Mr. Sapero objected to questions posed by the City and to the testimony of the City\u2019s \"witnesses and that such objections were sustained, is part and parcel of litigation. Moreover, because of the time constraints of quick-take actions, discovery was effectively curtailed for Mr. Sapero. His objections were based on the fact that the type of process chosen by the City deprived him of an opportunity to fully litigate the issues upon which the City\u2019s witnesses were about to testify. The City\u2019s choice of procedures created the problem, not Mr. Sapero\u2019s objections. Furthermore, there is no requirement that a party must cross-examine a witness. It was Mr. Sapero\u2019s right to decline to question the \"witnesses, especially in light of the effective denial of discovery caused by the City\u2019s choice of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The City, citing to <em>Johnson v. Consolidated Gas, Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>187 Md. 454, 462-63, 50 A.2d 918, 922-23 (1947), also argues that \u201c[t]he necessity for the taking does not have to be absolute; all that is required is that it be reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d Specifically, the City states that <em>Johnson </em>holds that \u201c[ujnless the discretion of the condemning agency as to reasonable necessity is wrongfully, arbitrarily, or oppressively exercised, that discretion cannot be controlled or reviewed by the Court.\u201d 187 Md. at 463, 50 A.2d at 923 (citing <em>Beall v. Redmiles, </em>176 Md. 677, 681, 6 A.2d 551, 553 (1939)). These arguments in relation to <em>Johnson, </em>however, are inapposite to the case at hand. The Court in <em>Johnson </em>addressed an instance of regular condemnation for the right-of-way for electric light and power lines, as well as transmission towers, across a piece of private property in Baltimore County. 187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Md. at 457, 50 A.2d at 919. The case did not involve quick-take condemnation in Baltimore City under \u00a7 21-16, which requires a prima facie showing of immediate necessity significantly different than that referred to in <em>Johnson. </em>Under a regular condemnation action, reasonable necessity for the condemnation itself may (or may not) be sufficient, but \u00a7 21-16 specifically requires for quick-take condemnation that the City demonstrate the reason or reasons why it is necessary for the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of and immediate title to property. The necessity for immediacy relates to the actual existence of an exigency or emergency and such necessity for <em>immediate </em>possession in quick-take actions is different and more demanding than the necessity for condemnation in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Two instances in which we have found such necessity for immediate possession occurred in <em>Free State Realty Co., Inc. v. City of Baltimore, </em>279 Md. 550, 369 A.2d 1030 (1977) and <em>Segall v. City of Baltimore, </em>273 Md. 647, 331 A.2d 298 (1975) (per curiam).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In both cases, the affidavits presented evidence showing the alleged necessity for the City\u2019s immediate possession of the properties in question. In <em>Free State, </em>the Court addressed whether a severely deteriorated building could be condemned via quick-take. The affidavit attached to the petition for immediate possession stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c[T]he dwelling ... \u2018ha[d] deteriorated to such extent <em>as to constitute a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and welfare,\u2019 </em>which was \u2018likely to continue to deteriorate unless corrected, and [that] such continued deterioration m[ight] contribute to the blighting or deterioration of the immediately surrounding area thereto.\u2019 It further recited that the owner had \u2018failed to correct the deterioration thereof as evidenced by the violation notice[s] attached ....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">279 Md. at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031 (emphasis added). The Court found that, based upon the evidence in the affidavit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>property constituted an immediate serious and growing menace to public health, safety, and welfare. <em>Id. </em>There is no finding in the case <em>sub judice, </em>nor facts presented, of a serious and growing menace to public health, safety, and welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In <em>Segall, </em>the Court found that the affidavit showed that all of the other properties in the development area had been acquired and that the sale of the entire site could not be completed until that last property had been acquired, i.e., a \u201chold-out\u201d situation may have existed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 273 Md. at 648, 331 A.2d at 298-99. Specifically, the one paragraph opinion of the <em>Segall </em>Court stated, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cThe basis of the[ ] claim is the requirement of Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City (1969) \u00a7 21-16(a) as amended by Chapter 420, Acts of 1972, that a petition for immediate possession state \u2018the reasons therefor.\u2019 [The appellants] say the City failed to comply. The short answer to this contention is that the City\u2019s petition referred to an attached affidavit. That affidavit said \u2018[t]hat all other property interests in the ten disposition lot areas aforesaid ha[d] been acquired, and demolition and sale of the entire site areas [could] not be completed until possession and title of the subject property interest [were] granted to the City.\u2019 This complied with the statute. For this reason we have not addressed ourselves to the City\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\"><em>Segall, </em>273 Md. at 648, 331 A.2d at 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Unlike <em>Free State </em>and <em>Segall, </em>the instant case does not present the Court with sufficient evidence to justify quick-take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>condemnation under \u00a7 21-16. The affidavit only stated that the Properties were needed \u201cat the earliest possible time in order to assist in a business expansion in the area,\u201d which, we deem to be an insufficient indication of necessity for immediate possession. <em>See Valsamaki, supra. </em>Furthermore, although Mr. Brodie testified that three proposals had been received for the redevelopment of the Properties (or at least the Chesapeake Restaurant property), there was no specific evidence, or <em>any evidence, </em>admitted by affidavit or otherwise, of a need for the use of quick-take or even a specific plan for the Properties introduced beyond that basic statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There certainly was no evidence presented that quick-take was necessary for the public\u2019s health, safety, or immediate welfare, and it was not asserted by admitted evidence that Mr. Sapero was a \u201chold-out\u201d of any sort. In fact, the City had the power to initiate condemnation for approximately a year and a half and chose to wait, apparently until the last minute, and then decided to make use of a type of action that curtailed the property owner\u2019s ability to present a defense. Based upon this lack of evidence for the necessity of the City\u2019s immediate, i.e., quick-take possession of the Properties, especially in light of our recent holding in <em>Valsamaki, </em>we hold that the Circuit Court erred in granting the City\u2019s petition for the immediate taking.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We now turn to address the due process concerns which arise from quick-take condemnation under \u00a7 21-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>IV.

That right to private property is a fundamental right provided by both the Federal Bill of Rights and the Maryland Declaration of Rights and cannot be taken without due process of law. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that, \u201cNo person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or <em>property, without due process of law; </em>nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

Titled <em>\u201cVesting of title and possession,\u201d </em>it states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cIn cases where the City files a Petition for Immediate Taking of title and possession to the said property in fee simple absolute or such lesser estate or interest as is specified in the Petition, title thereto shall irrevocably vest in the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore ten days after personal service of the Petition upon each and every Defendant or, if the Defendants or any of them shall file an answer to the Petition within the said ten day period alleging that the City does not have the right or power to condemn title to the property, then on the date of the trial court\u2019s decision or on the date of decision in any appeal from the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cIn the event the Defendants or any of them should file an answer, the court shall schedule a hearing within fifteen days of the date of the filing of an answer, which hearing shall be only for the purpose of contesting the right or power of the City to condemn title to the property. The trial court shall render its decision within fifteen days from the final day of said hearing. The City or the Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>or any of them shall have an immediate right of appeal to the Court of Appeals of Maryland from the decision of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201cPossession shall vest in the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore simultaneously with the vesting of title, except when the City has taken possession previously under subsection (d) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00a7 21\u201416(c). As we stated in <em>Valsamaki, </em>the procedural timing of the quick-take process under \u00a7 21\u201416(c) severely limits a party\u2019s ability to obtain any discovery prior to a taking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cSection 21-16(c) of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City provides that an individual has ten days after being served with a petition for immediate taking of possession and title to property to file an answer challenging the City\u2019s right or power to condemn. In that event, the court must schedule a hearing within fifteen days of the date of the filing of the answer. Therefore, a hearing would take place within 25 days of an individual being served with a petition. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-421 (\u2018Interrogatories to parties\u2019) and Rule 2-422 (\u2018Discovery of documents and property\u2019), a party has 30 days to respond upon being served with a discovery request for interrogatories or documents. Additionally, Rule 2-417 (\u2018Deposition\u2014Written questions\u2019) provides that a party has 30 days from receipt of service of the notice to serve their own cross questions. So, not only is the time to prepare for trial drastically shortened in a quick-take action, but discovery in the ordinary course of litigation is virtually impossible. Important procedural due process protections are conspicuously absent from this stage of the proceeding in quick-take actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\"><em>Valsamaki </em>397 Md. at 232 n. 8, 916 A.2d at 329 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mr. Sapero attempted to accomplish discovery by serving interrogatories, a request for production of documents, and a request for admissions on the City.

Herein lies the problem. The timing under which quick-take condemnation takes place pursuant to \u00a7 21\u201416(c) severely and prohibitively restricts a party\u2019s ability to prepare for the hearing to challenge the quick-take condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Procedural due process protections dictate that, at a minimum, the deprivation of property by adjudication requires that a party receive notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard consistent with the circumstances of the .taking. <em>Hamdi v.

In the case <em>sub judice </em>there is no issue presented as to whether notice was made; notice, such as required under the statute, was given to Mr. Sapero. He received notice of the City\u2019s petitions, filed an answer, and a hearing was held. The issue that raises the Court\u2019s primary concerns, and what we shall now address, relates to Mr. Sapero\u2019s opportunity to be heard, i.e., whether such hearings in \u00a7 21-16 quick-take actions are meaningful, reasonable, and appropriate to the nature of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Hearings in the context of \u00a7 21-16 quick-take condemnation actions, as they are conducted in Baltimore City, are apparently truncated proceedings, in which the property owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>whose property rights are at issue, does not have sufficient access to general discovery in aid of litigation. The inability of the property owner to obtain discovery is apparently known to the City. As far as we can determine from the records, this is the second case in recent months before this Court where the City has acquired property, or attempted to acquire it, without ever responding in either case to any discovery requests.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This process differs from regular condemnation proceedings, wherein the party subject to the condemnation proceedings has full access to general discovery as provided by the Maryland Rules. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 12-206(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this Rule, discovery in actions for condemnation shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 400 of Title 2 of these Rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">These quick-take condemnations deal with the fundamental right to property, and any resulting deprivation of process\u2014 that which is normally provided under regular condemnation proceedings\u2014should not occur unless warranted by extreme circumstances. Such extreme circumstances can arise when there is an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, <em>Free State, </em>279 Md. at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031, or possibly in extreme cases of \u201chold-outs,\u201d <em>Segall, </em>273 Md. at 648, 331 A.2d at 298-99. Whenever immediate possession is sought, given the minimal time frame envisioned for proceeding under \u00a7 21-16, discovery appropriate to the case should occur, even if the normal discovery time frames are shortened by order of the court based on a party\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The situation extant from the case <em>sub judice </em>exemplifies the problems with the City\u2019s utilization of \u00a7 21-16 quick-take condemnation when the acquisition of property via regular condemnation proceedings would seem as appropriate. As we stated in <em>Valsamaki:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, the <em>factually unjustified exercise </em>of quick-take condemnation rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>regular condemnation is an improper procedural abridgment of these [personal private property] rights. Quick-take condemnation should only be conducted when the need for the possession of the property is immediate (i.e., at the time of filing the petition, immediately necessary) and in the public interest. Otherwise, the City should utilize the regular condemnation power which permits a property owner the full exercise of his or her procedural due process rights. Under circumstances where there is no immediacy, the use of quick-take condemnation deprives a property owner of a significant part of the process to which he or she is due, without any corresponding necessity on the part of the City to justify that deprivation. When the stockpiling of property is the goal, except perhaps under some circumstances relating to a final acquisition, the regular condemnation power is more appropriate, in that it affords greater procedural due process protections to the property owner. Nor is the use of quick-take proper purely in order to gain a litigation advantage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">397 Md. at 259-60, 916 A.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">It is evident that the City could have utilized regular condemnation proceedings and avoided this morass of procedural due process concerns. The City first initiated the urban renewal plan with regard to the Charles North Project area in 1982, upon its enacting of Ordinance No. 82-799. Then, in June 2004, when it enacted Ordinance No. 04-695, it specifically authorized the acquisition of the subject Properties. The City did not file for condemnation, regular or quick-take, until December 2005, almost a year and a half later. This gives rise to the appearance that quick-take condemnation is being used by the City to obtain a litigation advantage over property owners. Quick-take condemnation may not be used solely as a litigation tactic in the urban renewal redevelopment process. At oral argument the City contended that was not the case, that good-faith negotiations for the Properties took place prior to the quick-take proceeding. Regular condemnation proceedings, however, as we have indicated, , could have been initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>while negotiations continued, thereby providing the property owner with full procedural due process protections. If a price was reached via negotiation, the condemnation proceedings could then have been abandoned. Md. Rule 12-211; Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-109 of the Real Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In conclusion, we hold that \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City requires that, in order to utilize quick-take condemnation, the City demonstrate why, because of some exigency or emergency, it is in the public interest for the City to take immediate possession of a particular property. Without such a showing, the City may not maintain a quick-take condemnation action. Therefore, we vacate the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City as to the granting of the City\u2019s petition for immediate possession and remand this case to that court for proceedings consistent with <em>Valsamaki </em>and our decision in this case. Again, we reiterate, that at the time of the hearing in this case, the Circuit Court did not have our decision in <em>Valsamaki </em>as guidance in making its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\">. We thoroughly discussed quick-take condemnation in our recent decision in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Valsamaki, </em>397 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>222, 916 A.2d 324 (2007). <em>Valsamaki </em>was not available to the trial court at the time it rendered its decision in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. The exact ownership of the properties, or at least of 1701-1709 North Charles Street, is somewhat in dispute. We shall discuss this more in depth, <em>infra. </em>It is, however, undisputed that appellant held record title to both properties during the time of the quick-take proceedings and continues to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. One of the postponements was requested by the City, in spite of its \"immediate\u201d need for the Properties,, because a witness was unavailable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">. Pursuant to the language of the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, \u00a7 21-16(c), the parties involved in a quick-take condemnation action in Baltimore City have the right to a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals. Section 21-16(c) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\"><em>\u201cThe City or the Defendants or any of them shall have an immediate right of appeal to the Court of Appeals of Maryland from the decision of the trial court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\"><em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 8-301(a) (\"Appellate review by the Court of Appeals may be obtained only: (1) by direct appeal or application for leave to appeal, where allowed by law....\u201d). At oral argument before this Court, we raised an interesting tangential issue: Whether \u00a7 21-16(c) of the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City was enacted before the Court of Special Appeals was granted jurisdiction over condemnation cases, and therefore, whether the right to direct appeal actually means direct appeal to this Court or to the Court of Special Appeals? Any possible jurisdictional problem was cured when this Court issued its writ of certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. Though we shall not specifically resolve questions one, four, five, and six, we shall briefly comment on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Question one presents the issue of whether a known contract purchaser must be included as a party to a condemnation proceeding in order for condemnation to take place. We note that the evidence in the record is sparse in indicating that the City had actual knowledge of a contract purchaser prior to, and at the time of, the initiation of the condemnation proceedings. The City apparently conducted title searches, the results of which, generally, would only reveal the title holder (Mr. Sapero), not any contract purchaser. Later, the City did apparently bring a contract purchaser into the action via an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Question four posits whether the City acted in good faith by valuing Mr. Sapero's property at $770,000 when it allegedly had actual knowledge of an existing arm\u2019s length purchase contract for $2,000,000. While there may be a legitimate question as to the good faith of the City\u2019s valuation, because of our disposition of the case, valuation is not an issue at this time. Likewise, we need not reach question five, because the City did not satisfy the basic requirement of showing immediate necessity for quick-take. For a quick-take under \u00a7 21-16, the City must first establish that prima facie showing, as well as having a carefully considered development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">As to question six, whether the Circuit Court\u2019s failure to comply with specific statutorily mandated time lines as to the issuance of an order, may or may not be fatal to a quick-take condemnation action. Though we shall not further discuss this question, we do note that the trial court must comply with the statutes that govern its actions, especially when a governmental entity is attempting to condemn constitutionally protected property rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. \u201cThe Baltimore City Code provides that renewal projects in Baltimore City must be conducted pursuant to a renewal plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">' \u00a7 2-5.

It felt, however, in the <em>pve-Valsamaki </em>era, that it had no choice but to rule as it did.

In a response to Mr. Sapero\u2019s Motion to Establish Hearing Date and Procedures, filed by the City on March 10, 2006, (just 10 days before the hearing) the City stated in that response, unsupported by an affidavit, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\"The nature of a quick-take proceeding is that the condemning authority is in need of the property at the earliest possible time in order to assemble the required development \u2018footprint\u2019.

Moreover, this statement, especially given the extended period during which regular condemnation could have occurred, would not in any event, in and of itself, sufficiently support the immediate necessity required by \u00a7 21-16(d) to be shown in the \"Petition for Immediate Possession.\u201d Additionally, because this was a quick-take, Mr. Sapero did not have the opportunity to take the deposition of any potential witnesses, including the unidentified developer and Mr. Brodie, or conduct any other discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">.
