The petitioner, Prince George\u2019s County, argues that a judicial determination of the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance is premature because the respondent used car dealers failed to invoke and exhaust their administrative remedies. The respondents claim that pursuit and exhaustion of administrative remedies were not required in this case and that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional on the ground that it violates due process and equal protection principles. We shall hold that the respondent used car dealers were required to invoke and exhaust administrative remedies prior to obtaining judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Maryland General Assembly, by the Regional District Act, Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 28, \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq., </em>delegated zoning power for most of Prince George\u2019s County to the Prince George\u2019s County District Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 8-101(2) of the Act, the District Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201cmay by ordinance adopt and amend the text of the zoning ordinance and may by resolution or ordinance adopt and amend the map or maps accompanying the zoning ordinance text to regulate, in the portion of the regional district lying within its county ... (ii) the size of lots, yards, courts and other open spaces____\u201d The Regional District Act also creates the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Zoning Appeals (\u00a7 8-107), provides for the Board of Zoning Appeals to extend or continue \u201cnonconforming uses\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 8-108 and 8-109), and authorizes the Board of Zoning Appeals to grant \u201cspecial exceptions and variances to the provisions of the zoning regulations.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 8-110 and 8-111). Section 27-229 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, enacted by the District Council, also authorizes the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Zoning Appeals to grant variances. Under the Regional District Act, decisions of the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Zoning Appeals are final administrative decisions, are subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court, and the Circuit Court\u2019s decision is subject to an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals (\u00a7 8-111.1 of the Regional District Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">On November 14, 2000, the District Council amended the Prince George\u2019s County Zoning Ordinance and approved Council Bill 87-2000 (\u201cCB 87\u201d). The new zoning bill imposed a minimum lot size requirement of 25,000 square feet on used vehicle, mobile home, and camping trailer dealerships. CB 87 also contained a three-year amortization period, requiring all such dealerships to comply by August 31,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">On August 29, 2003, Ray\u2019s Used Cars, along with seventeen other used car dealers throughout Prince George\u2019s County, brought this action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, challenging the constitutionality of CB 87 and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. All of the plaintiff used car dealers operated used car lots that did not meet the new minimum lot size requirement of 25,000 square feet. The plaintiffs contended that CB 87 violated due process and equal protection principles. They did not, however, assert that CB 87 effected an unconstitutional taking of property in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>24 of the Declaration of Rights, or in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">\u201c22. That the Plaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to the continued operation of their businesses because CB 87 2000 arbitrarily and unreasonably denies equal protection of the law to Plaintiffs, in that new vehicle, mobile home,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] camping trailer sales and service lots, are allowed in commercial zones on lots less than Twenty Five Thousand square feet (25,000 sf) and used vehicles are not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201c23. That Plaintiffs also contend the prohibition of used care [sic] lots smaller than Twenty Five Thousand square feet (25,000 sf) in commercial zones is an abuse of the [governmental] power because it has no relation to the public health, safety, general welfare and morals in the effected area [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201c24. The Plaintiffs assert that the \u2018amortization period\u2019 is also invalid because the overall reasonableness bears not [sic] rationale [sic] relationship to the factual circumstances and public gain is far outweighed by the private loss of the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201c25. That there exists an actual controversy of justiciable issue between the parties within the jurisdiction of this Court involving the constitutionality and/or validity of CB-87-2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201c26. That the Plaintiffs\u2019 rights are affected by CB-87-2000 in that they are owners and/or operators of used car lots which might be closed if said statute is not declared unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">\u201c27. That Defendant\u2019s action[s] in approving CB-87-2000 were arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional. There exist the strong likelihood that the Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201c28. That unless the Defendant is restrained by this Court from enforcing CB-87-2000 which is arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional, Plaintiffs will suffer immediate, substantial and irreparable injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The plaintiffs did not institute any administrative proceedings seeking variances or other administrative remedies. The Circuit Court held a three-day nonjury trial at which the plaintiffs\u2019 case focused on the negative impact CB 87 would have on their particular businesses. In his opening statement, the attorney for the plaintiffs explained: \u201cSome [of the plaintiffs] have been in business at their locations for more than thirty years. Some own their businesses. All of the businesses obviously are on lots that are less than 25,000 square feet, and some lease their businesses. This ordinance affects them all in different ways, all of them bad.\u201d Five of the plaintiffs testified at trial. Typical testimony offered by the plaintiff used car dealers concerned the size of their car sales lots (all under 25,000 square feet), the profitability of their businesses, the hardship of relocating, and the statements that they were compliant with county regulations other than the minimum lot size requirement in CB 87. In his closing argument, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney delineated the issues that he was raising (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201cAnd the first issue is whether or not CB-87-2000 is constitutional, does it violate the provisions of Article 24 of the Maryland Constitution. Following the case law does it bear, number one, a substantial relationship to its intended purpose, and is it constitutional when you weigh the good it was intended to accomplish against the damage it causes the public <em>and these plaintiffs in particular.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cThe second issue of the case, Your Honor, is whether or not CB 87 is constitutional as to these particular plaintiffs, and the third issue in this case is whether or not CB 87 is constitutional with reference to the amortization schedule which is\u2014was essentially three years ending on August 31st, 2003.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The Circuit Court filed a declaratory judgment concluding that CB 87 violated \u201csubstantive due process\u201d and equal protection principles. The court also enjoined its enforcement. Relying upon language in <em>Levinson v. Montgomery County, </em>95 Md.App. 307, 319-321, 620 A.2d 961, 967-968, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 197, 627 A.2d 539 (1993), and older cases from an era when courts frequently struck down economic and land use regulatory legislation on so-called \u201csubstantive due process\u201d grounds <em>(see, e.g., Goldman v. Crowther, </em>147 Md. 282, 307-308, 128 A. 50 (1925)), the Circuit Court took the position that \u201cstate courts have shown a greater willingness than their federal counterparts to find that, as a matter of due process, a zoning restriction is arbitrary and unreasonable\u201d and that \u201c \u2018Maryland courts [under Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights] employ a heightened level of scrutiny\u2014something over and above the \u201cminimum rationality\u201d test under the federal constitution.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later in the declaratory judgment, the Circuit Court reiterated \u201cthat Maryland has adopted a heightened level of scrutiny for the review of a zoning ordinance.\u201d Applying this \u201cheightened scrutiny analysis,\u201d the Circuit Court declared that CB 87 denied the plaintiffs due process and equal protection of the laws because it did not bear a \u201csubstantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, comfort, or welfare.\u201d In addition, the court declared that, \u201cas it applies, CB-87 is arbitrary, unduly oppressive, fundamentally unfair, and unreasonable, and its enforcement will work greater hardship upon the public than that which it endures under existing conditions.\u201d Addressing the three-year amortization period set forth in CB 87, the court declared that it was not reasonable because the plaintiffs\u2019 loss would far outweigh the public gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Prince George\u2019s County appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, contending that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to invoke and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>exhaust their administrative remedies precluded this action for a declaratory judgment and injunction. Prince George\u2019s County alternatively argued that the Circuit Court erred in holding CB 87 unconstitutional. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. Regarding the exhaustion argument, the Court of Special Appeals held that the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to CB 87 fell under the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the rule requiring the pursuit and exhaustion of administrative remedies \u201cbecause they asserted a facial challenge to the validity of CB 87. Accordingly, this \u2018constitutional exception\u2019 allowed them to file a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court, without first applying for variances and litigating their cases before the Board of Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Turning to the constitutionality of CB 87, the Court of Special Appeals held that the ordinance violated so-called \u201csubstantive due process\u201d principles. Like the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals relied heavily upon language in <em>Levinson v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>95 Md.App. at 319-321, 620 A.2d at 967-968.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>court held the ordinance unconstitutional under \u201csubstantive due process principles,\u201d it decided that it was \u201cnot necessary to address the constitutionality of CB 87 under equal protection principles.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals similarly did not reach the issue regarding the validity of the amortization period. Although the appellate court did not expressly hold the amortization period unconstitutional, the court noted \u201cthat the appellees are correct in their contention that the record does not show any rational basis for the three-year amortization period. Further, Prince George\u2019s County Code\u2019s seven-year amortization period for an investment of $20,000 indicates that an amortization period of three years for an investment in excess of $100,000 is not rational.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Following the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, Prince George\u2019s County filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Ray\u2019s Used Cars, 391 </em>Md. 577, 894 A.2d 545 <em>(2006). </em>The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>used car dealers did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Prince George\u2019s County argues that the judgments below violated the rule requiring the invocation and exhaustion of administrative remedies whenever such administrative remedies are exclusive or primary. Prince George\u2019s County maintains that variance and other administrative procedures are available to the plaintiff used car dealers, that the Legislature intended that these remedies be pursued and exhausted prior to filing an action in court, but that none of the plaintiffs sought such administrative relief. The County contends that this Court has repeatedly enforced the exhaustion rule in zoning cases like the present one, and that the Regional District Act sets out a comprehensive and detailed scheme of administrative procedures for such land use issues. In oral argument before us, Prince George\u2019s County represents that the plaintiffs may now institute administrative proceedings for variances or other relief. The County alternatively asserts that the courts below reached the wrong conclusion on the merits because the 25,000 square foot minimum lot size requirement is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The respondent used car dealers contend that they were not required to invoke and exhaust administrative remedies. First, they argue that the available administrative \u201cremedies are neither exclusive [n]or primary.\u201d In so arguing, they rely on the fact that the applicable statutes do not expressly state that the administrative remedies are exclusive or primary, and they rely on the principle that, where there exists an alternative judicial remedy, \u201cthere is no presumption that the administrative remedy was intended to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Zappone v. Liberty Life, </em>349 Md. 45, 63, 706 A.2d 1060 (1998). Second, the used car dealers claim that they challenged the constitutionality of CB 87 \u201cas a whole, and not its application to their particular facts,\u201d and that, therefore, the case fell within the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the rule requiring invocation and exhaustion of administrative remedies. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>dealers, relying heavily upon <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 102 A.2d 821 (1954), one of the few cases falling within the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the exhaustion rule, argue that there was \u201ca clear necessity for a prior judicial decision\u201d and that the pertinent \u201cfactual determinations\u201d were \u201cnot within the expertise of the Board of Appeals or the Planning Board.\u201d On the merits, the used car dealers argue that the court below correctly held that CB 87 was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We shall reject the used car dealers\u2019 alternative contentions (1) that the available administrative remedies are neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>exclusive nor primary and (2) that the case falls within the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the exhaustion rule. The Circuit Court will be directed to dismiss the complaint for failure to pursue and exhaust administrative remedies. We shall not, therefore, reach the constitutional issues presented. If the plaintiffs decide to institute appropriate administrative proceedings, those issues, as well as any other issues which the plaintiffs desire to present, may be raised in the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">This Court has often dealt with the relationship between legislatively created administrative remedies and alternative statutory, common law or equitable judicial remedies. Thus, in <em>Zappone v. Liberty Life, supra, </em>349 Md. at 60-61, 706 A.2d at 1067-1068, we summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cWhenever the Legislature provides an administrative and judicial review remedy for a particular matter or matters, the relationship between that administrative remedy and a possible alternative judicial remedy will ordinarily fall into one of three categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\"><em>\u201cFirst, </em>the administrative remedy may be exclusive, thus precluding any resort to an alternative remedy. Under this scenario, there simply is no alternative cause of action for matters covered by the statutory administrative remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\"><em>\u201cSecond, </em>the administrative remedy may be primary but not exclusive. In this situation, a claimant must invoke and exhaust the administrative remedy, and seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision, before a court can properly adjudicate the merits of the alternative judicial remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u201cThird, the administrative remedy and the alternative judicial remedy may be fully concurrent, with neither remedy being primary, and the plaintiff at his or her option may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>pursue the judicial remedy without the necessity of invoking and exhausting the administrative remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaD\">In arguing that the administrative remedies under the Regional District Act and the Prince George\u2019s County Code are neither exclusive nor primary, but are merely concurrent with the judicial remedies sought in this case, the respondent used car dealers rely on the absence of language in the Regional District Act and the Prince George\u2019s County Code expressly stating that the administrative remedies are exclusive or primary. They also invoke the principle that administrative remedies are not ordinarily presumed to be exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">As we have pointed out, however, \u201c[wjhile sometimes the Legislature will set forth its intent as to whether an administrative remedy is to be exclusive, or primary, or simply a fully concurrent option, <em>most often statutes fail to specify </em>the category in which an administrative remedy falls.\u201d <em>Zappone, </em>349 Md. at 62, 706 A.2d at 1068 (emphasis added). The absence of express statutory language is a consideration in determining whether an administrative remedy is intended to be exclusive, although it is clearly not the only consideration. It is entitled to little weight in determining whether the administrative remedy is primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Moreover, while there is no presumption that an administrative remedy is intended to be exclusive when a recognized alternative judicial remedy exists, there is a strong \u201cpresumption that the administrative remedy is intended to be primary, and ... a claimant cannot maintain the alternative judicial action without first invoking and exhausting the administrative remedy.\u201d <em>Zappone, </em>349 Md. at 63, 706 A.2d at 1069. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Reclamation v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 362, 855 A.2d 351, 359 (2004) (\u201c[Wjhen adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>trative remedies, exist in zoning cases, they must be exhausted before other actions, including requests for declaratory judgments, mandamus, and injunctive relief, may be brought,\u201d citing <em>Josephson v. City of Annapolis, </em>353 Md. 667, 674-678, 728 A.2d 690, 693-695 (1998)); <em>Fosler v. Panoramic Design, Ltd., </em>376 Md. 118, 128, 829 A.2d 271, 277 (2003) (\u201c[T]he presumption that a statutory administrative remedy is primary is reflected in the Declaratory Judgment Act\u201d); <em>Brown v. Fire &amp; Police Employees Retirement System, </em>375 Md. 661, 669, 826 A.2d 525, 530 (2003) (\u201cThis Court adheres firmly to the rule that statutorily prescribed administrative remedies ordinarily must be pursued and- exhausted. * * *. This principle that statutory administrative remedies normally must be exhausted is a policy embedded in various enactments by the General Assembly and is supported by sound reasoning\u201d); <em>Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E. Church, </em>375 Md. 59, 76, 825 A.2d 388, 397 (2003) (A \u201cprinciple of administrative law ... is the requirement that administrative remedies must be exhausted before bringing an action in court\u201d); <em>Furnitureland v. Comptroller, </em>364 Md. 126, 133, 771 A.2d 1061, 1065 (2001) (\u201c[W]here the Legislature has provided an administrative remedy for a particular matter or matters, there is a presumption that the Legislature intended such remedy to be primary and intended that the administrative remedy must be invoked and exhausted before resort to the courts\u201d), and cases there cited. <em>See also PSC v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 88-94, 882 A.2d 849, 885-889 (2005) <em>Converge v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 482-486, 860 A.2d 871, 882-885 (2004); <em>Moose v.

Intercom, </em>366 Md. 1, 12, 782 A.2d 791, 797 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We have stated that the \u201cRegional District Act is the exclusive source of zoning authority\u201d in the Regional District. <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>329 Md. 494, 502, 620 A.2d 886, 890 (1993). <em>See, e.g., County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Brandywine </em>Enterprises, 350 Md. 339, 342, 711 A.2d 1346, 1347 (1998) (\u201cThe Regional District Act ... is the exclusive source of zoning authority in those areas of Prince George\u2019s County which it covers\u201d); <em>Montgomery County v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Revere, </em>341 Md. 366, 383, 671 A.2d 1, 9-10 (1996); <em>Council of Chevy Chase View v.

In addition, the adjudicatory administrative and judicial review procedures under the Regional District Act and the Prince George\u2019s County Code are available to furnish relief to each of the plaintiff used car dealers whose particular sales lots are adversely affected by CB 87, to the extent that such dealers may be entitled to relief on constitutional or non-constitutional grounds. <em>See, e.g., District Council v. Brandywine, supra, </em>350 Md. 339, 711 A.2d 1346; <em>Hartman v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>264 Md. 320, 286 A.2d 88 (1972); <em>Gingell v.

Whether or not such remedies are exclusive, at the very least they are presumed to be primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Although the Regional District Act is the exclusive source of zoning in the geographical area encompassed by the Regional District, we have not expressly held whether the adjudicatory <em>remedies </em>under that Act are exclusive or whether they are simply primary. Furthermore, there is no need to resolve that issue in this case. Whether exclusive or primary, this Court\u2019s opinions have made it clear that the adjudicatory remedies provided by the Regional District Act, for the resolution of zoning issues like those presented here, must be pursued and exhausted before resort to the courts. Our cases have applied this principle even when zoning ordinances enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ed by the District Council have been challenged on the ground that they were invalid or unconstitutional. We have also held that no action maybe maintained under the Declaratory Judgments Act, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-401, <em>et seq., </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, for the resolution of such issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In <em>Hartman v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>264 Md. 320, 286 A.2d 88, landowners in Prince George\u2019s County sought from the District Council the grant of a special exception and a variance in order to use their land for a filling station and an automobile repair business. A special exception and a variance were granted, but thereafter several opponents filed with the District Council a petition for reconsideration. The petition was not filed within the time period previously specified in the zoning ordinance, but a new enactment arguably extended the time, and the petition was filed within the extended period under the new enactment. The District Council granted the reconsideration petition and scheduled the case for an administrative hearing. The landowners, instead of further contesting the matter at the administrative hearing, filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for declaratory and injunctive relief. They argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the new enactment extending the reconsideration time was invalid. The Circuit Court, instead of dismissing the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, decided the case on the merits. This Court, however, directed the Circuit Court to enter \u201can order dismissing the bill and remitting the [landowners] to their special statutory remedies.\u201d <em>Hartman v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>264 Md. at 326, 286 A.2d at 90. The Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Hammond, initially held that the case fell within the exclusion in the Declaratory Judgments Act where \u201ca statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>went on to point out, <em>Hartman, </em>264 Md. at 324, 286 A.2d at 89-90, that the rule requiring exhaustion of statutory administrative remedies</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">\u201chas been applied to zoning cases. See <em>Mayor and City Council v. Seabolt, </em>210 Md. 199, 123 A.2d 207 (no declaration that a zoning ordinance does not validly control a particular property where property owner could have appealed an adverse ruling of the zoning board under Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7 7). In <em>Poe v. Baltimore City, </em>241 Md. 303, 307, 216 A.2d 707, the owner\u2019s claim was that the ordinance was unconstitutional in its application to his property. He argued that he was entitled to a declaration to this effect since only a court and not a zoning board could rule on constitutional questions. His argument was rejected by this Court, which remitted him to his zoning administrative remedies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAc\">After reviewing numerous other zoning cases applying the requirement that statutorily prescribed administrative remedies must be pursued and exhausted, the Court in <em>Hartman </em>concluded (264 Md. at 324, 286 A.2d at 90):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cIn the case before us, the [landowners] can appear at the rehearing and make and preserve for judicial review all the contentions they now make----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">A similar case under the Regional District Act is <em>Gingell v. County Commissioners For Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>249 Md. 374, 239 A.2d 903, involving a constitutional challenge to a District Council comprehensive zoning ordinance which changed the classification of a portion of the plaintiffs property. Instead of petitioning the zoning authorities for a reclassification of her property or other relief under the Regional District Act, the plaintiff filed an action in the Circuit Court for declaratory and injunctive relief. She claimed that the zoning ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property and that it \u201cwas unreasonable, discriminatory and arbitrary legislative action bearing no substantial relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>to the exercise of the police power.\u201d <em>Gingell, </em>249 Md. at 377, 239 A.2d at 905. This Court, affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, stated (249 Md. at 376-377, 239 A.2d at 905):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfI\">\u201cThe reasons for requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies before resorting to the courts are that it is within the expertise of the administrative agency involved to hear and consider the evidence brought before it and make findings as to the propriety of the action requested; courts would be performing the function that the legislature specified be done by the administrative agency; courts might, be called on to decide issues that would never arise if the prescribed administrative remedies were followed; and where a statute provides a specific form of remedy in a specific case then this remedy must be followed____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>See also Bogley v.

As stated in the <em>Gingell </em>case, 249 Md. at 377, 239 A.2d at 905, \u201cthis [administrative] remedy must be followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Under Maryland .administrative law, the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the requirement that primary administrative remedies must be pursued and exhausted is an extremely narrow one. For several reasons, the present case does not fall within this limited exception. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">As a preliminary matter, it should be emphasized that \u201cMaryland ... administrative agencies are fully competent to resolve issues of constitutionality and the .validity of statutes or ordinances in adjudicatory administrative proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>which are subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v.

Equitable, </em>339 Md. 596, 622, 664 A.2d 862, 875 (1995).

Broadcast Equities, Inc., supra, </em>360 Md. at 452-461, 758 A.2d at 1003-1008, a case involving alleged employment discrimination, this Court extensively reviewed the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the exhaustion rule. Initially, we pointed out that (360 Md. at 455, 758 A.2d at 1004)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cthis Court has emphasized that the so-called \u2018constitutional exception\u2019 to the normal rule that primary administrative and judicial review remedies must be followed is very \u2018narrow.\u2019 Our ... opinions have significantly limited the scope of that exception.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The <em>Broadcast Equities </em>opinion then discussed in detail <em>Goldstein v. Time-Out Family Amusement, supra, </em>301 Md. at 590, 483 A.2d at 1280, which had held that, to come -within the exception, \u201cthe attack must be made to the constitutionality of the statute as a whole,\u201d including all of its parts and ah of its applications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <em>Broadcast Equities </em>opinion went on to enumerate several other limitations upon the \u201cconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>exception,\u201d even when the challenge is to the statute as a whole. The Court explained (360 Md. at 456-457, 758 A.2d at 1005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">\u201cThis Court has also held that the ... constitutional exception has no application where there exists no recognized statutory, common law, or equitable alternative to the statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies. In other words, where the only recognized avenue for relief is the administrative and judicial review proceedings, the claimant may not circumvent those proceedings by a declaratory judgment or equitable action even where the validity of an enactment on its face is the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201cSimilarly, where the legislature has expressly provided or intended that the administrative and judicial review remedy be the \u2018exclusive\u2019 remedy, the exception ... is inapplicable, and a declaratory judgment or equitable action challenging the validity of an enactment \u2018as a whole\u2019 will not lie. <em>Josephson v. Annapolis, supra, </em>353 Md. at 674-678, 728 A.2d at 693-696; <em>Holiday v. Anne Arundel, </em>349 Md. 190, 201-204, 707 A.2d 829, 834-836 (1998); <em>Zappone v. Liberty Life, supra, </em>349 Md. at 60-62, 706 A.2d at 1067-1069.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cIn addition, the constitutional exception to the exhaustion requirement does not apply when the constitutional challenge to the statute \u2018as a whole\u2019 involves the need for some factual exploration, which may be necessary when statutory classifications are challenged on equal protection grounds or under Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable, supra, </em>339 Md. at 623-624, 664 A.2d at 876, and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Another limitation upon the exception, pointed out by the <em>Broadcast Equities </em>opinion, is where the administrative agency might afford the plaintiff relief on nonconstitutional grounds, thus making unnecessary a ruling on the constitutional issue. This Court stated (360 Md. at 461, 758 A.2d at 1007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cFurthermore, if this action had been dismissed by the Circuit Court, and if the administrative hearing had taken place, the Montgomery County Commission on Human Relations might have found, on the facts, that no unlawful employment discrimination had taken place. If such decision were supported by substantial evidence, there would be no need to reach any of the constitutional issues raised by <em>Broadcast Equities. </em>Applying the so-called \u2018constitutional exception\u2019 under circumstances like these is inconsistent with the firmly established principle of Maryland law \u2018that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground,\u2019 <em>Ashford v. State, </em>358 Md. 552, 561, 750 A.2d 35, 40 (2000), quoting <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 404 n. 13, 631 A.2d 453, 463 n. 13 (1993). <em>See, e.g., Harryman v. State, </em>359 Md. 492, 503 n. 6, 754 A.2d 1018, 1024 n. 6 (2000); <em>Thrower v. State ex rel.

State, </em>356 Md. 324, 342, 739 A.2d 41, 51 (1999) and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOH\">Finally, the <em>Broadcast Equities </em>opinion, 360 Md. at 461-462, 758 A.2d at 1008, held that the exception should not be applied when the judicial decision on the facial validity of an enactment is not likely to terminate the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On three alternative grounds, the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the zoning ordinance does not fall within the \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d to the rule requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>First, </em>the attack upon CB 87 has not been to the ordinance \u201cas a whole,\u201d including all of its parts and applications. Instead, the thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge has been to the ordinance\u2019s effect upon existing used car dealers presently operating on lots under 25,000 square feet. Throughout the proceedings in the Circuit Court, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and arguments centered upon the adverse effect of CB 87 upon existing used automobile dealers operating on lots under 25,000 square feet, and upon the ordinance\u2019s distinction between such used automobile dealers and new automobile dealers. The evidence and arguments at no time were aimed at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>25,000 square foot minimum lot size for potential or future used car dealers. Furthermore, there was no evidence or argument with regard to mobile home or camping trailer dealerships on lots smaller than 25,000 square feet. The five testifying plaintiffs specifically focused only on the negative impact of the ordinance on their under-25,000 square foot lots. In his closing argument, the attorney for the used car dealer emphasized that the court should consider the damage to \u201cthese plaintiffs in particular.\u201d Under the teaching of <em>Goldstein v. Time-Out Family Amusement, supra, </em>301 Md. 583, 483 A.2d 1276, and numerous other decisions by this Court, the constitutional challenge to CB 87 was not to the enactment \u201cas a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Second, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csubstantive due process\u201d and equal protection attacks upon the ordinance were factually based, and the Circuit Court\u2019s declaratory judgment rested upon the court\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court in <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable, </em>339 Md. at 623, 664 A.2d at 876, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cFinally, where a constitutional challenge to a statute, regardless of its nature, is intertwined with the need to consider evidence and render findings of fact, and where the legislature has created an administrative proceeding for such purpose, this Court has regularly taken the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that the matter should be initially resolved in the administrative proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The administrative agencies under the Regional District Act were created by the General Assembly to hear the evidence and render the appropriate findings of fact. Instead of initially performing this function itself, the Circuit Court should have deferred to those agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Third, </em>the pursuit and exhaustion of the appropriate administrative proceedings might well result in the plaintiffs obtaining relief without the necessity of reaching the constitutional issues at the administrative level or upon judicial review. There are nonconstitutional grounds under the Regional District Act and the Prince George\u2019s County Code, which, if deemed applicable at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings, could afford relief to the plaintiffs. The constitutional issues might \u201cnever arise if the prescribed administrative remedies were followed,\u201d <em>Gingell v. Board of County Com\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>249 Md. at 377, 239 A.2d at 905.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">For all of the above reasons, the plaintiffs were required to pursue and exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE ACTION.

Although the courts below and the respondents occasionally referred to the \"United States Constitution\u201d or the \"Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d it appears that the Circuit Court\u2019s declaratory judgment rested entirely on Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. As previously discussed, the theory and basis of the declaratory judgment was the Circuit Court\u2019s view that Maryland, in Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, has adopted a greater level of \"substantive due process\u201d scrutiny for judicial review of zoning ordinances than the level of scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, neither the courts below nor the plaintiffs ever relied upon or even cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which is a normal (although not the exclusive) jurisdictional route for civil actions challenging local enactments on the ground that the enactments violate the plaintiffs' federal constitutional rights. Actions under \u00a7 1983 may be brought without exhausting administrative remedies, <em>Felder v. Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 146-147, 108 S.Ct. 2302, 2311, 101 L.Ed.2d 123, 143-144 (1988), although the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must still be ripe for judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Nevertheless, to the extent, if any, that the courts below and the plaintiffs-respondents may have grounded their position on the Federal Constitution and on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, it seems clear that any federal constitutional issues are not ripe for resolution under the principles discussed in <em>Maryland Reclamation Associates, Inc. v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 351-352 n. 2, 366-367, 855 A.2d 351, 352-353 n. 2, 361 (2004); <em>Maryland Reclamation v. Harford County, </em>342 Md. 476, 501-506, 677 A.2d 567, 580-582 (1996), and cases there cited. <em>See, </em>in particular, <em>Williamson County Planning Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 U.S. 172, 192-194, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 3119-3120, 87 L.Ed.2d 126, 142-143 (1985) (A landowner\u2019s constitutional challenge to a new zoning ordinance was held not ripe for judicial decision because the landowner had failed to seek variances from the appropriate administrative officials).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">. There are additional categories, although they are rare. In <em>Foster v. Panoramic Design, Ltd., </em>376 Md. 118, 127-128 n. 3, 829 A.2d 271, 277 n. 3 (2003), we discussed a statute creating a statutory administrative remedy and an alternative judicial remedy, in which the Legislature specified that, if both are invoked, the alternative judicial remedy shall be primary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\">. Section 3-409(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>\u201cSpecial form of remedy provided by </em>statute.\u2014If a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">. In <em>Goldstein v. Time-Out Family Amusement, </em>the plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality, on their face, of certain exemptions in a tax statute. This Court held (301 Md. at 590, 483 A.2d at 1280):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">\"In our view the constitutional attack here was not to the statute as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\"Although Time-Out originally claimed to attack the exemption statute in its entirety, it is clear to us that its real protest focused upon the statutory exemptions granted to recreational businesses, and not upon the exemptions for non-profit and charity institutions which are also contained in \u00a7 406. At trial, Time-Out conceded it was not attacking the non-profit and charity exemptions. Thus, we believe Time-Out was not attacking the General Assembly's legislative power to enact exemptions to a general taxation scheme. It merely attacked certain exemptions granted to businesses similar to its own.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">. The plaintiff used car dealers emphasized this in their brief (respondents\u2019 brief at 23):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\"In the instant matter, the trial court based it [sic] decision that CB 87 was unconstitutional on its factual determinations made after having an opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses during a three days trial [sic]. In pertinent parts, the trial court made the following findings of fact: 1) that the testimony and evidence produced at trial provides no persuasive justification for the used classification in the Council Bill, 2) that it is clear CB 87\u2019s sponsor wanted to rid his Councilmatic District of small used car lots without the proper justification, 3) that there is no basis for why a 25,000 square foot lot size classification is required for used car sales and not other automobile related services and 4) that the 25,000 square foot lot size was an arbitrary number selected by the Petitioner without any nexus to legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. As mentioned earlier in this opinion, the plaintiffs heavily rely upon <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 102 A.2d 821 (1954), for their argument that they need not exhaust administrative remedies. The Court's discussion of <em>Pressman </em>in <em>Montgomery County v. Broadcast Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. 438, 459-460, 758 A.2d 995, 1006-1007 (2000), demonstrates that the <em>Pressman </em>case furnishes utterly no support for the plaintiffs\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
