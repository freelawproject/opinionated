Defendant Derrick Mobley was convicted of one count of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-24\">Two of the three points on appeal can be quickly dispatched. First, the expert\u2019s testimony that the substance involved in Vaughn\u2019s conviction under Count Six was methaqualone was sufficient to sustain that conviction. The argument as to the tests used by the expert goes to the weight of the evidence, a matter for the properly instructed jury. Second, the \u201con or about\u201d jury instruction could not have confused the jury as to the separate events charged in the five cocaine counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">The third issue concerns the destruction of the notes of the chemist who testified as an expert about the nature of the substance involved. The government\u2019s expert witness, Patrick Long, a forensic chemist at the Georgia State Crime Laboratory, testified that the nine packages of powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>sold to a government informant and an agent contained cocaine hydrochloride and that tablets seized from the car at Vaughn\u2019s residence were methaqualone. It was then established that Long had destroyed his laboratory notes, as well as the spectra, a graph, produced by infrared analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Defendants argue that Long\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted because the destruction of his notes deprived them of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and cross-examination, denied them due process by denial of access to the means to prepare for and conduct cross-examination, denied them their Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, and either violated the Jencks Act or the principle of the <em>Jencks </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Defendants\u2019 confrontation claim is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Herndon, </em>536 F.2d 1027 (5th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Love, </em>482 F.2d 213 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1026, 94 S.Ct. 453, 38 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973), and <em>United States v. Williams, </em>447 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.1971) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 954, 92 S.Ct. 1168, 31 L.Ed.2d 231 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Defendants\u2019 due process claims fail under the test established in <em>Herndon. </em>Determination of a due process deprivation depends on \u201cthe materiality of the evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by government witnesses or the jury, and the reasons for its unavailability.\u201d 536 F.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">As to all other arguments and the cases cited to support them, the Government is entitled to prevail because of one fact: the cocaine samples themselves were available. Defendants could have obtained their own analysis of the samples. A defendant bears the burden of showing that missing evidence would have been material and favorable to his defense. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 872-74, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3449-50, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982); <em>United States v. Nabors, </em>707 F.2d 1294, 1296-97 (11th Cir.1983). Aside from the fact that there is no indication the notes would have demonstrated a likelihood of mistaken interpretation and that the government was not responsible for the destruction of the notes, the fact that the evidence itself was available for testing negates any harmful error, if error at all, in connection with the legal arguments made on the basis that the notes of the witness were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
