MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">This appeal is from that part of the decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) Board of Appeals (\u201cboard\u201d) which affirms the examiner\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 claims<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42-53 and 55-64 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. We reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\">THE INVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">Appellants\u2019 claims are drawn to heat shrinkable (or recoverable) articles and methods of utilizing these articles. Heat shrinkable articles, which are well known in the art, are often shaped as a hollow tube, having two open ends, or a hollow cap, having an open end and a closed end. They are used as protective coatings for pipes, electrical cables, and telephone cables by positioning the heat shrinkable article over the pipe or cable and then applying heat to shrink the article into contact with the pipe or cable. The following polymeric materials are useful in manufacturing heat shrinkable articles: polyolefins, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, copolymers of ethylene and ethyl acrylate, chlorinated or fluorinated polymers; also, ethylene-propylene, or chlorinated, or silicone rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">Heat shrinkable articles are typically made by the following process: (1) melt-shaping a polymeric material into an article having an original shape, (2) cross-linking the shaped article, (3) heating the cross-linked article above the melting temperature of the polymeric material, (4) expanding the heated article into a new shape, and (5) cooling the article while maintaining its expanded new shape. When an article made by this method is heated above the melting point of the polymeric material, it shrinks back to its original shape. The extent of expansion during step (4) of the above process is indicated by the expansion ratio of a dimension (often diameter) after expansion to the same dimension before expansion (i.e. when the article had its original shape).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-20\">One problem encountered in prior heat shrinkable articles is their tendency to split during expansion or shrinkage if the article has a high expansion ratio. Splitting usually occurs at the open end(s) of such articles and is especially acute if the article has a nick or notch which tends to propagate during shrinkage. Appellants state that, although the expansion ratio at which split<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ting occurs depends on the type of polymer utilized, there is rarely a problem with expansion ratios below 2.5 and usually ratios up to 3.0 can be safely used. However, they indicate that splitting becomes a problem with expansion ratios of 3.5 or higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Appellants have discovered that splitting is avoided, even when high expansion ratios are utilized, if the article is provided with open end sections having relatively low expansion ratios. Figure 1 shows an example of a tube-shaped heat shrinkable article in accordance with appellants\u2019 invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The solid lines show the article\u2019s shape before heat shrinkage, while the dotted lines depict the article\u2019s configuration after heat shrinkage. The article assumes an hour glass shape after heat shrinkage because intermediate section 10 has a higher expansion ratio than end sections 12. Likewise, when appellants\u2019 articles are in the form of an end cap, as shown in Fig. 2 below, the hour glass shape depicted by the dotted lines results after heat shrinkage, because intermediate section 16 has a higher expansion ratio than open end section 18 and closed end section 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Element 24 in Fig. 2 is a gripping protuberance by which end section 20 of the end cap can be grasped when it is in the interior of conduit 22, as shown below in Fig. 3, to permit this section to be pulled out of the conduit\u2019s interior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">The following claims are illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-14\">42. A hollow heat-shrinkable article composed of a polymeric material and having a closed cross-section and at least one open end, each open end being defined by an open end section having adjacent thereto an intermediate section, the open end section having a first expansion ratio which is from 1 to 3.0 and the intermediate section having a second expansion ratio which is at least 3.0 and at least 0.5 greater than said first expansion ratio, whereby the amount of available recovery in the open end section is substantially less than the amount of available recovery in the intermediate section, the circumference of the open end section after unrestrained recovery of the article being substantially greater than the circumference of the intermediate section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\">55. [Rewritten in independent form for purposes of this appeal] A method of covering a part of an elongate substrate which comprises the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-16\">(a) placing around said part of the substrate at least part of a hollow heat-shrinkable article composed of a polymeric material and having at least one open end, each open end being defined by an open end section having adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>thereto an intermediate section, the open end section having a first expansion ratio which is from 1.0 to 3.0 and the intermediate section comprising a region having a second expansion ratio which is at least 3.0 and at least 0.5 greater than said first expansion ratio, whereby the amount of available recovery in the open end section is substantially less than the amount of available recovery in the intermediate section adjacent thereto, at least an open end section and an adjacent intermediate section of the article being placed around the substrate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">(b) heating said open end section and said intermediate section of said article to cause shrinkage of said intermediate section into contact with the substrate and to cause shrinkage of said open end section to form a collar which flares out of contact with the substrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">59. A method of providing an end cap on a hollow conduit which comprises the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">(a) placing around the end of the hollow conduit the open end section only of a heat-shrinkable tubular cap comprising an open end section defining the open end of the cap and having a first expansion ratio, an intermediate section adjacent said open end section and having a second expansion ratio and a closed end section having a third expansion ratio, the second expansion ratio being greater than the first and third expansion ratios; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">(b) heating said open end section to cause shrinkage thereof into contact with the conduit without causing substantial shrinkage of the remainder of the cap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Claims 52 and 61, which indirectly depend from claims 42 and 59, respectively, require that the article have \u201ca gripping protuberance on the outside of the closed end section.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claim 60, which depends from claim 59, calls for the further step of pushing the end cap along its axis so that the closed end and intermediate sections are telescoped through the open end section into the interior of the hollow conduit where they remain during heating (see Fig. 3 supra). The other claims before us are also dependent claims, which further limit the values of the expansion ratios, specify the article\u2019s dimensions, describe the material from which the article is made, specify the number of open and closed ends in the article, or set forth further steps for utilizing the end cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">THE PRIOR ART</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">United States patent No. 3,526,683 to Heslop et al. (\u201cHeslop\u201d) discloses a method of forming a heat recoverable article having different degrees of heat recovery at different parts of the article by a process similar to that taught by appellants. Hes-lop\u2019s articles are particularly useful as sleeves for parts with irregular dimensions such as an insulator for a splice between different size wires, where the article undergoes heat recovery to conform to the shape of the part. In one embodiment of Heslop, a tubular article is cross-linked at an intermediate section thereof, heated, expanded in diameter to the shape shown in Fig. 4 below, and then heat recovered to the shape depicted in Fig. 5 below.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">Heslop\u2019s example I indicates that tubular articles, like that of Fig. 4, can have open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>end sections with expansion ratios of 3.33, and an intermediate section with an expansion ratio of 1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">United States patent No. 3,847,183 to Meyer discloses heat recoverable closures for protecting cables from moisture penetration. The ends of the cables are protected by end caps having an open end and a closed end, while cables spliced together are encased in a cylindrical sleeve having two open ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">United States patent No. 3,992,570 to Beinhaur discloses a rubber end cap which is placed over the end of a cable by axially aligning the closed end of the cap and the end of the cable and forcing the remainder of the cap over the closed end and over the exterior of the cable so that the cap is turned inside out.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">BOARD OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 35-40 and 42-67<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">[I]t is evident from Heslop that hollow heat-shrinkable articles having variant sections of independent and different heat-shrinkability are known so that they may be used as a sleeve to encapsulate various irregularly shaped forms. The fact that in the specific embodiments of Heslop the expansion ratios of the open and intermediate sections are in reverse order than [sic, from] those claimed is not seen to distract from its value as a reference to suggest the instantly claimed invention. It clearly would be apparent to the average routineer in this field that either the end or intermediate sections could be made to have a greater or smaller expansion ratio, respectively, depending on a particular application to which the article is to be put.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">As to appellants\u2019 argument that their articles do not split, the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7rg\">Only the obvious result is achieved by appellant [sic, appellants] by selecting an expansion ratio of the open end to be smaller than the expansion ratio of the intermediate section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">... Although the reason for appellants\u2019 modification finds no response in the art, nevertheless, the art is suggestive of the claimed variations and, accordingly, no patentable distinctiveness can lie on this basis____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">The board also concluded that the teachings of Meyer and Beinhaur would have been properly combinable with those of Heslop to provide Heslop\u2019s article with a closed end section and to telescopically insert a cable sealing device, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">At the outset, we caution the Solicitor that obviousness is a question of law to be determined from the facts. <em>Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., </em>713 F.2d 1530, 1535, 218 USPQ 871, 876 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Stevenson v. International Trade Commission, </em>612 F.2d 546, 549, 204 USPQ 276, 279 (CCPA 1979); <em>In re May, </em>574 F.2d 1082, 1089, 197 USPQ 601, 606-07 (CCPA 1978). A conclusion of obviousness is not reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, which is applicable to fact findings. <em>See Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp., </em>724 F.2d 951, 220 USPQ 592 (Fed.Cir.1983). Rather, such a conclusion is reviewed for correctness or error as a matter of law. <em>In re Carleton, </em>599 F.2d 1021, 1024 n. 14, 202 USPQ 165, 169 n. 14 (CCPA 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">1. <em>Prima Facie Obviousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">With respect to claims 42-48, we agree with the board that it would have been prima facie obvious to reverse the order of the expansion ratios in Heslop\u2019s article so that it would have an hour glass shape after heat recovery. Although the heat shrinkable articles in Figs. 4 and 5 of Heslop has an arrangement of expansion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ratios opposite to that of appellants\u2019 article, Heslop teaches the broad concept of producing heat shrinkable articles with portions having different expansion ratios so that the articles conform to parts with irregular dimensions after heat recovery. When a portion of the part to be covered has a smaller diameter than that of its surrounding portions, which are also to be covered, we are satisfied that it would have been prima facie obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, from the teachings of Hes-lop, to utilize a heat shrinkable article with expansion ratios permitting its recovery to an hour glass shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">We also agree with the board that it would have been prima facie obvious to close one end of Heslop\u2019s heat shrinkable articles to form an end cap, as specified by claims 49-51 and 53. It is well known to make heat shrinkable articles in the shape of end caps rather than tubes when sealing the end of a single wire rather than two spliced wires, as taught by Meyer. However, as admitted by the Solicitor at oral argument, the combination of Heslop and Meyer fails to suggest providing a gripping protuberance on the outside of the closed end, and, therefore, the board\u2019s decision with respect to claim 52 is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We agree with appellants that the references would have failed to suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art the steps of: heating to form a collar at the open end section which flares out of contact with the part being covered (claim 55) and heating the open end section of an end cap to cause shrinkage of the open end section without shrinking the remainder of the cap (claim 59). Accordingly, the board\u2019s approval of the rejection of these independent claims, along with their dependent claims 56-58 and 60-64, respectively, is erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">2. <em>Unexpected, Results</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">Appellants argue that, even if the PTO established a prima facie case of obviousness, it has been rebutted, because the claimed invention unexpectedly overcomes the splitting problem discussed supra. Also, they point out that the prior art of record does not suggest avoiding the splitting problem by utilizing appellants\u2019 technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">In response to appellants\u2019 assertions of unexpected results, the Solicitor states in his brief: \u201cThere is no <em>objective evidence </em>in the record that \u2018no splitting\u2019 is, in fact, a result of their claimed invention, much less that it is unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">In their reply brief, appellants argue that their assertions of unexpected results <em>are </em>supported by objective evidence. Specifically, appellants rely on the following passages in their specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-12\">On the other hand, in order fully to utilise the advantages of the present invention, the second region generally exhibits a high degree of available recovery. The expansion ratios which will, in the absence of end sections as required by the present invention^] lead to splitting on shrinkage are dependent <em>inter alia </em>on the polymer employed and the thickness. There is seldom a problem with expansion ratios below 2.5, and usually expansion ratios of up to 3.0 can safely be used. However, at expansion ratios of 3.5 or higher splitting is usually a problem and this applies more so at ratios of 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0. Thus the present invention is especially applicable at ratios of from 4 to 6 and above, for example up to 10, i.e. where the amount of available recovery is from 400% to 1000%, usually from 400% to 600%, especially when the percentage of unresolved recovery after shrinkage is high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-13\">... Typical dimensions, in inches, of three such end caps are as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Cap No.</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">Intermediate Section Diameter After Shrinkage (a)</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\">Cap Diameter Before Shrinkage (b)</p>\n<p id=\"AEFA\">End Section Diameter After Shrinkage (d)</p>\n<p id=\"Avu\">End Section Expansion Ratio \u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"A3a\">Intermediate Section Expansion Ratio \u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"AdX\">1 0.8 4.0 2.8 1.4 5</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">2 1.5 6.0 3.5 1.7 4</p>\n<p id=\"A5S\">3 2.5 8.0 4.5 1.8 3.2</p>\n<p id=\"b777-42\">(1) b -f- d; claim 42 range is 1 to 3</p>\n<p id=\"b777-43\">(2) a -=- d; claim 42 range is greater than 3 [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b777-44\">It is appellants\u2019 position that the combination of these passages constitutes objective evidence that the splitting problem exists and that the claimed invention overcomes this problem. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-45\">It is well settled that unexpected results must be established by factual evidence. Mere argument or conclusory statements in the specification does not suffice. <em>In re Lindner, </em>457 F.2d 506, 508, 173 USPQ 356, 358 (CCPA 1972). Here, appellants\u2019 table of \u201c[tjypieal dimensions\u201d is devoid of any data from which we can determine whether or not the end caps described therein actually split. In essence, appellants ask us to <em>assume </em>that the end caps in this table are nonsplitting, because a preceding passage in the specification concludes that no splitting occurs in such articles. Examples requiring such assumptions can hardly be considered factual evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-46\">Even if the specification contained objective evidence showing that appellants\u2019 heat shrinkable articles do not split, such evidence would not be a satisfactory showing of unexpected results. When an article is said to achieve unexpected (i.e. superior) results, those results must logically be shown as superior <em>compared </em>to the results achieved with other articles. <em>In re Swentzel, </em>219 F.2d 216, 220, 104 USPQ 343, 346 (CCPA 1955). <em>See also In re Palmer, </em>451 F.2d 1100, 1102, 172 USPQ 126, 128 (CCPA 1971). Moreover, an applicant relying on comparative tests to rebut a prima facie case of obviousness must compare his claimed invention to the closest prior art. <em>In re Merchant, </em>575 F.2d 865, 869, 197 USPQ 785, 788 (CCPA 1978). Here, appellants have not presented any experimental data showing that prior heat shrinkable articles split. Due to the absence of tests comparing appellants\u2019 heat shrinkable articles with those of the closest prior art, we conclude that appellants\u2019 assertions of unexpected results constitute mere argument and conclusory statements in the specification which cannot establish patentability. <em>Lindner, supra; In re Wood, </em>582 F.2d 638, 642, 199 USPQ 137, 140 (CCPA 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-51\">Appellants complain, however, that the PTO challenges their assertions of unexpected results for the first time in the Solicitor\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They contend that, if we are persuaded by the PTO\u2019s position, prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>cution should be reopened so that affidavits showing unexpected results can be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">It is elementary that the claimed invention must be considered as a <em>whole </em>in deciding the question of obviousness. <em>In re Kaslow, </em>707 F.2d 1366, 217 USPQ 1089 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Stratoflex, </em>713 F.2d at 1537, 218 USPQ at 877. Although the board and the examiner correctly concluded that the invention of claims 42-51 and 53 would have been prima facie obvious, this conclusion did not properly end consideration of the obviousness question; evidence arising out of secondary considerations must always be considered. <em>Stratoflex, supra; In re Sernaker, </em>702 F.2d 989, 996, 217 USPQ 1, 7 (Fed.Cir.1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Despite appellants\u2019 arguments throughout prosecution that heat shrinkable articles with the claimed expansion ratios overcome the longstanding splitting problem, the board and the examiner merely concluded that these ratios would have been obvious without properly responding to appellants\u2019 allegations of unexpected results. Although appellants failed to make an adequate showing of unexpected results, if the board or the examiner had considered this point when the case was pending before them and had pointed out that there was no objective evidence of unexpected results, appellants would, at least, have had notice and would have had an opportunity to file objective evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither the board nor the examiner, however, gave such notice, and, therefore, appellants were led to believe, albeit erroneously, that they had satisfied their burden of going forward with objective evidence to rebut the prima facie case of obviousness. <em>In re Rinehart, </em>531 F.2d 1048, 189 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1976). In view of the PTO\u2019s failure to challenge the sufficiency of appellants\u2019 rebuttal evidence until this appeal, when appellants could no longer offer evidence, we conclude that it is necessary to vacate the board\u2019s decision on claims 42-51 and 53 and to remand the case to afford appellants the opportunity to submit objective evidence of unexpected results. <em>See In re Wiechert, </em>370 F.2d 927, 933, 152 USPQ 247, 251-52 (CCPA 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">The decision of the board is <em>reversed </em>with respect to claims 52 and 55-64 and <em>vacated </em>with respect to claims 42-51 and 53. The case is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">REVERSED-IN-PART; VACATED-IN-PART; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-15\">.
