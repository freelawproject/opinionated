Both Jack and Shirley had filed individual actions, on their own behalf, and derivative actions, putatively on behalf of the corporation, against appellees. Their derivative actions were dismissed, and the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to appellees, finding that appellants had brought and pursued the derivative actions in bad faith. The district court entered judgment separately against Jack in the amount of $3,541.79 and against Shirley in the amount of $77,-919.28. In this appeal, appellants contend that both the basis for, and calculation of, the attorneys\u2019 fees award constitute error warranting reversal and/or remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-22\">A. <em>Basis for the Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1543-23\">Under the traditional \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d attorney\u2019s fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute or enforceable contract providing therefor. <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 717, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 1407, 18 L.Ed.2d 475, 478 (1967). Courts, however, have developed a \u201cbad faith\u201d exception to this general rule. Fees will be awarded if a party or attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> acted in \u201cbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Indus. Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 129, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d 703, 714 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-24\">In the instant case, appellees sought attorneys\u2019 fees on two grounds. First, they urged the district court to award fees based upon a statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-123(f), which provides that \u201cupon final judgment and a finding that the [derivative] action was brought [by the plaintiff] without reasonable cause, [the court] may require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to pay to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>the parties named as defendant the reasonable expenses, including fees of attorneys, incurred by [the defendant] in the defense of such action.\u201d Alternatively, appellees suggested that the \u201cbad faith exception\" warranted an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the circumstances of this case. Finding that appellants had acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees on the latter ground. Appellants now contend that the factual findings of the district court are inadequate to support a fee award on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-4\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) provides that \u201c[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury ..., the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon____\u201d These findings may \u201cappear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such findings are designed to aid appellate courts in reviewing the decision below, but they are not a jurisdictional requirement of appeal. <em>Armstrong v. Collier, </em>536 F.2d 72, 77 (5th Cir.1976). Thus, while a district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 52(a) complicates review, reversal is unnecessary if a full understanding of the question presented may be had without the aid of such findings. <em>See Gupta v. East Tex. St. Univ., </em>654 F.2d 411 (5th Cir.1981). On the other hand, an appellate court will normally vacate the judgment and remand the action for appropriate findings where \u201cthe finding of fact and conclusions of law are mere conclusory statements and do not fully address all the issues raised in the litigation.\u201d 5A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 52.06[2].</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-6\">In the instant case, a remand is appropriate. The district court\u2019s findings can be broken down into two sets. In the first set, the court recited those facts which supported dismissal of both Jack\u2019s and Shirley\u2019s derivative actions: Jack did not own stock in the corporation at the time the derivative suit was filed and Shirley had not read the complaint, had no personal knowledge of the facts surrounding the allegations made in the complaint, and \u201cdisplayed an obvious unwillingness to learn about the suit by not acquiring more than a rudimentary understanding of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second set of findings relates to appellants\u2019 motive for bringing the suit: the Rothenbergs brought the derivative actions as \u201cleverage\u201d to enhance their personal claims. (Supplemental Record at 62-63). Based upon its finding that the derivative actions were brought as leverage, the district court found that appellants had acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-11\">In determining the propriety of a bad faith fee award, \u201cthe inquiry will focus primarily on the conduct and motive of a party, rather than on the validity of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the instant case, only the second \u201cset\u201d of findings focuses on the proper inquiry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This second set, however, contains \u201cmere conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Moore\u2019s, supra. </em>The district court found that \u201c[w]ithout question\u201d Mr. Rothenberg brought the derivative action \u201cto enhance his personal claims ...\u201d and that \u201c[t]he entire record of this case points to [the] conclusion ... [that] Mrs. Rothenberg filed this action as an attempt to enhance her personal claims____\u201d\u25a0 In a case, such as this one, which has dragged on for more than six years and produced a voluminous record of thousands of pages, such bald assertions provide no meaningful basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>this court to review the ultimate finding of \u201cbad faith.\u201d Therefore, the case is remanded for the district court to indicate the factual basis for its ultimate conclusion. <em>Cf. Fortner v. Balkcom, </em>380 F.2d 816, 821 (5th Cir.1967) (conclusory findings of district court that defense counsel\u2019s decisions not to present critical witnesses were in the nature of \u201ctrial tactics\u201d without any findings concerning the lawyer\u2019s actual activities did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 52(a)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">B. <em>Calculation of the Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1bx\">The district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to three different counsel teams. Each team submitted affidavits in support of the dollar amounts claimed as reasonable fees. Counsel for defendants Rose and Stern provided detailed affidavits itemizing each aspect of their services to their clients, and the district court correctly observed that these affidavits provided the court \u201csufficient information to determine whether the fees and costs requested are reasonable.\u201d Supp.R. at 64. However, the district court was also correct in observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1545-6\">The affidavits and documents filed by counsel for [Invesco International, Inc.] and counsel for Burke and the Davises are no more than self-serving, conclusory statements that the amounts requested are reasonable. Counsel for these defendants did not adequately itemize what services were rendered, the amount of time involved for each segment of the case, what documents were prepared, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1545-9\"><em>Id. </em>Appellants are correct in asserting that in view of such admittedly insufficient documentation, the district court erred in nonetheless calculating an award. <em>See King v. McCord, </em>621 F.2d 205, 206 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-10\">Accordingly, the fee award should be vacated with instructions to the district court to (1) make factual findings which support the conclusion that appellants brought their derivative action as \u201cleverage\u201d for their personal claims,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) base its calculation of the award upon adequate documentation of the services rendered by counsel for Invesco and Burke and the Davises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1543-18\">. <em>See Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 766-67, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2464, 65 L.Ed.2d 488, 501-02 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1544-7\">. This court made all of these observations in affirming the dismissal of Shirley's suit. <em>See Rothenberg v. Security Management, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 958 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ANpE\">. Green, <em>From Here to Attorney's Fees: Certainty, Efficiency, and Fairness in the Journey to the Appellate Courts, </em>69 Cornell L.Rev. 207, 279-80 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"An8\">. While the district court\u2019s reliance on this court's finding that Shirley had not read the complaint, was not familiar with the facts surrounding the allegations made in the complaint, and that she had not learned about the case arguably focuses on her \"conduct,\" under the circumstances of this case, those findings relate to the validity of the case rather than the bad faith of appellant. This court made those observations in concluding that Shirley was incapable of adequately representing other shareholders in a derivative action. Her \"conduct,\" therefore, was a basis for finding the claim invalid, not for finding bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1545-7\">. <em>Rule </em>52(a) does <em>not, </em>contrary to appellants\u2019 suggestion, require the district court to cite to the record. In this case, however, it is necessary for the district court to lay the factual predicate for its conclusion that the derivative action was used as leverage for appellants\u2019 personal claims. Given the volume of the record in this case, one helpful suggestion may be for the district court to request proposed findings of fact from the parties. <em>See, e.g., Ramey Constr. Co. v. Apache Tribe, 616 </em>F.2d <em>464, 468 </em>(10th Cir.1980). Furthermore, should the district court, upon remand, reconsider its position and determine that a finding of \"bad faith\u201d may not be appropriate even if appellants had used the derivative action as leverage for their personal claims, <em>see, e.g., Owen v. Modern Diversified Indus., </em>643 F.2d 441 (6th Cir.1981) (stockholder who brought derivative action principally to protect his investment in corporate debentures could not maintain derivative action, but did not act in bad faith), the district court could consider the propriety of an award under O.C. G.A. \u00a7 14 \u2014 2\u2014123(f). An award pursuant to this statute, however, would require a specific finding, and adequate underlying factual findings, that appellants' derivative action was brought \"without reasonable cause.\u201d <em>Cf. Oil &amp; Gas Income, Inc. v. O.B. Trotter, </em>395 F.2d 753 (5th Cir.1968) (affirming an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e) only after the district court specifically found that the suit had been brought \"without merit\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1545-14\">. Alternatively, the district court should make sufficient findings to support a conclusion that the actions were brought \"without reasonable cause\u201d within the meaning of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-123(f). <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
