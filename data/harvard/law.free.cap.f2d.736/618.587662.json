NTD, one of five divisions of the International, operates in forty-one states and consists of approximately 8,000 craftsmen who travel throughout the United States erecting steel tanks and related structures. Unlike the other four divisions of the International, NTD has no separate local organizations. Rather, NTD was established by the International Constitution \u201cfor the purpose of giving status to and servicing those members who by the transient nature of their employment and their coverage under the NTD Agreement have no fixed permanent place of employment and who thus are unable to carry membership in a Local Lodge or participate in its activities.\u201d Pl.Ex. 4. A national director and eight district representatives administer NTD. These officials are appointed by the International president and serve at his pleasure. NTD has never conducted an election of officers, has never adopted and filed with the Secretary a constitution and bylaws, and has never filed any financial reports with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">After several NTD members filed a complaint with the Secretary protesting the failure of NTD to conduct an election of officers, the Secretary brought this action. He contends that NTD is a \u201clocal labor organization\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(i), 402\u00ae, and 481(b) and thus has violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(b) by failing to hold an election of officers every three years by secret ballot and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431(a), 431(b), and 437(b) by failing to adopt and file a constitution and bylaws and by failing to file reports with the Secretary. The Secretary alleges that the International violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e) by failing to ensure that NTD members had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the opportunity to nominate and vote for candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">After trial, the district court, 542 F.Supp. 957, held that NTD is a labor organization within the- meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(i) and 402(j) and therefore must comply with the reporting and disclosure requirements of the LMRDA. The court concluded, however, that NTD is a \u201cnational\u201d rather than a \u201clocal\u201d labor organization. Hence, according to the trial court\u2019s ruling, NTD must conduct elections of officers at the five-year intervals prescribed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(a) rather than at the three-year intervals prescribed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(b). Defendants appeal, contending that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(b) and that NTD is not a labor organization for the purposes of the LMRDA. The Secretary cross-appeals, contending that NTD is a local rather than national labor organization for the purposes of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We first address defendants\u2019 contention that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(b). Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481, international, national, and local labor organizations must hold periodic elections of officers by secret ballot. Section 482(a) permits a member of a labor organization to file a complaint with the Secretary alleging a violation of \u00a7 481. Section 482(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cThe Secretary shall investigate such complaint and, if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation of this sub-chapter has occurred and has not been remedied, he shall, within sixty days after the filing of such complaint, bring a civil action against the labor organization as an entity in the district court of the United States in which such labor organization maintains its principal office to set aside the invalid election, if any, and to direct the conduct of an election or hearing and vote upon the removal of officers under the supervision of the Secretary and in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and such rules and regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. The court shall have power to take such action as it deems proper to preserve the assets of the labor organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Defendants contend that \u00a7 482 authorizes the Secretary to bring suit only to set aside an invalid election. They emphasize that \u00a7 482(a) states, <em>\u201cThe challenged election </em>shall be presumed valid pending a final decision thereon (as hereinafter provided) and in the interim the affairs of the organization shall be conducted by the officers elected or in such other manner as its constitution and bylaws may provide.\u201d (emphasis added). Defendants also note that \u00a7 482(b) empowers the Secretary to bring an action to \u201cset aside the invalid election.\u201d Thus, defendants assert, the text of the statute indicates that the Secretary may not bring an action against NTD under \u00a7 482 because NTD has never conducted an election of officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Defendants\u2019 argument is unpersuasive. Section 482(a) permits a labor organization member to file a complaint \u201calleging the violation of <em>any </em>provision of section 481.\u201d (emphasis added). After investigating the complaint, the Secretary may bring a civil action \u201cto set aside the invalid election, <em>if any.\u201d </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(b) (emphasis added). Section 482(c) states that when <em>\u201can election has not been held within the time prescribed by section 481 ... </em>the court shall declare the election, <em>if any, </em>to be void and direct the conduct of a new election.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the text of the statute clearly indicates that Congress contemplated an action pursuant to \u00a7 482 when a labor organization fails to conduct an election. Moreover, this construction fully comports with the basic objective of the statute: to guarantee democratic union elections \u201cmodeled on \u2018political elections in this country.\u2019 \u201d <em>Local 3489, United Steelworkers v. Usery, </em>429 U.S. 305, 309, 97 S.Ct. 611, 614, 50 L.Ed.2d 502 (1977) (quoting <em>Wirtz v. Hotel, Motel &amp; Club Employees Union, Local 6, </em>391 U.S. 492, 504, 88 S.Ct. 1743, 1750, 20 L.Ed.2d 763 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Defendants also rely on a number of cases in contending that the Secretary may not proceed under \u00a7 482 unless the labor organization has conducted an election. <em>Driscoll v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 139, </em>484 F.2d 682 (7th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 960, 94 S.Ct. 1490, 39 L.Ed.2d 575 (1974), is illustrative. In <em>Driscoll, </em>a union member brought suit before an election challenging the union\u2019s practice of requiring every candidate for union office to execute an affidavit stating that he was not a Communist. The court upheld the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, in part because \u00a7 402 remedies are unavailable until after the union holds the scheduled election. <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>Driscoll </em>and similar cases are readily distinguishable from the case at bar. Congress limited relief under \u00a7 402 to post-election relief when an election is scheduled in order to prevent individuals or the government from blocking or delaying the election. <em>See Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 568-70, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1858-59, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); <em>Calhoon v. Harvey, </em>379 U.S. 134, 140, 85 S.Ct. 292, 296, 13 L.Ed.2d 190 (1964). That policy is not implicated when, as here, the union does not intend to conduct elections. Although courts have not squarely addressed the issue before us, they have upheld actions under \u00a7 482 when a union failed to hold an election within the time limits that \u00a7 481 prescribes. <em>See Marshall v. Local Union 1374, International Association of Machinists, </em>558 F.2d 1354, 1358 (9th Cir.1977); <em>Hodgson v. Union de Empleados de los Supermercados Pueblo, </em>388 F.Supp. 1026 (D.P.R.1974). We therefore hold that \u00a7 482 authorizes the Secretary to bring suit against a labor organization that fails to hold periodic elections prescribed by \u00a7 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">We next address defendants\u2019 assertion that NTD is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(i). We note at the outset that Congress gave exclusive enforcement authority under Title IV of the Act to the Secretary of Labor in order \u201cto utilize the special knowledge and discretion of the Secretary.\u201d <em>Calhoon v. Harvey, </em>379 U.S. at 140, 85 S.Ct. at 296. Thus, we must defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u201cunless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.\u201d <em>E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, </em>432 U.S. 46, 55, 97 S.Ct. 2229, 2234, 53 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977); <em>see Cross v. United Mine Workers, </em>353 F.Supp. 504, 508 (S.D.Ill.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Section 402(i) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArV\">\u201c \u2018Labor organization\u2019 means a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting commerce and includes any organization of any kind, any agency, or employee representation committee, group, association, or plan so engaged in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Defendants argue that many NTD members cannot attend NTD meetings regularly or have substantial direct contact with the organization because of the transient nature of their work. Thus, defendants contend, NTD is not a labor organization subject to the LMRDA because its members do not \u201cparticipate\u201d in the organization; rather, NTD is merely a \u201cdivision\u201d of the International.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">In order to effectuate the purposes of the Act, Congress defined labor organization broadly \u201cto provide comprehensive coverage of labor organizations engaged <em>in any degree </em>in the representation of employees or administration of collective bargaining agreements.\u201d S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2318, 2370 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.2. Thus, if the organization represents its members regarding grievances, labor disputes, or terms or conditions of employment, the organization is subject to the Act regardless of its formal attributes, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Brennan v. United Mine Workers, </em>475 F.2d 1293, 1295-96 (D.C.Cir.1973); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 451.3, or the extent of its representative activities. <em>See National Educational Association v. Marshall, </em>100 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2565 (D.D.C.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The evidence indicates that NTD officials and members negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers for the benefit of NTD members. Although these agreements are not complete collective bargaining agreements in themselves, they establish standards regarding labor disputes, grievances, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. Furthermore, NTD district representatives provide a number of services for NTD members, including handling grievances under the agreement and distributing publications. NTD holds meetings in which its members participate and collects dues from its membership. This evidence clearly shows that NTD is an organization in which employees participate and which represents its members concerning grievances, labor disputes, and other terms and conditions of employment. NTD admits that it is involved in an industry affecting commerce. Accordingly, we hold that NTD is a labor organization within the meaning of \u00a7 402(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The Secretary contends that the trial court erred in concluding that NTD is a \u201cnational\u201d rather than a \u201clocal\u201d labor organization for the purposes of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481. Noting that the LMRDA does not define \u201cnational\u201d or \u201clocal,\u201d the district court reasoned that those terms refer to the geographical boundaries of the labor organization. Thus, since NTD operates in forty-one states, the district court held that NTD is a national labor organization. Defendants add that NTD is unable to hold monthly meetings that most NTD members can attend or to operate a hiring hall, two functions that many locals perform. The Secretary, on the other hand, relies on 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.11. That regulation states that an organizational unit\u2019s characterization as a local or national body is \u201cdetermined by its functions and purposes rather than the formal title by which it is known or how it classifies itself.\u201d The Secretary contends that NTD is functionally and structurally a local labor organization notwithstanding the geographical breadth of its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Since the LMRDA defines neither \u201clocal\u201d nor \u201cnational,\u201d we must construe those terms in light of their ordinary meaning, congressional purpose, and the deference accorded to the Secretary\u2019s construction of the Act. The typical union structure is a three-tier hierarchy. T. Kheel, <em>Labor Law </em>\u00a7 3.01 (18 <em>Business Organizations </em>1980). Below the AFL-CIO is the national or international union, which performs such functions as supervising locals, maintaining legal departments, and providing public relations staffs and liaison offices with government departments. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 3.02[2]. The national or international organization is made up of subordinate locals. Generally, local labor organizations provide day-to-day services to the membership, such as policing collective bargaining agreements, disposing of grievances, collecting membership dues and disciplining dissident members. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 3.03[1]; <em>Shultz v. Employees\u2019 Federation, </em>74 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2140, 2143 (S.D.Tex.1970). Although a local usually represents workers located within close geographic proximity, it may simply represent workers in a single bargaining unit. <em>See </em>A. Goldman, <em>Labor Law and Industrial Relations in the United States of America </em>182-83 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Congress\u2019 purpose in requiring that labor organizations conduct elections under the LMRDA was to ensure that union officers would be responsive to the needs and desires of union members. <em>See </em>S.'Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 19-20, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2318, 2336. When it required elections every three years for locals but only every five years for national or international organizations, Congress evidently considered it especially important to ensure the accountability of those officials with whom union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>members have the most direct contact. Thus, it makes little sense to focus exclusively on the geographical proximity of the organization\u2019s membership in determining whether a labor organization is a local within the meaning of \u00a7 481. Rather, congressional intent indicates that the focus should be on the relationship between the organization and its members. Accordingly, we agree with the Secretary that we must focus on NTD\u2019s functions and structure in order to determine whether it is a local or a national labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Given its structure and functions, we find no reason to reject the Secretary\u2019s characterization of NTD as a local labor organization. NTD is subordinate to the International and has no subordinate organizational units. Thus, it has the relatively simple organizational structure characteristic of local labor organizations. <em>See Shultz v. Employees\u2019 Federation, </em>74 L.R.R.M. (BNA) at 2143. It pays a \u201cper capita\u201d tax to the International, which is a tax locals typically pay to their parent national or international organizations. <em>See King v. Randazzo, </em>234 F.Supp. 388, 394 (E.D.N.Y.1964), aff<em>'d </em>346 F.2d 307 (2d Cir.1965). Most important, NTD performs the functions of a local. NTD officials negotiate the basic terms of collective bargaining agreements, ensure that those agreements are enforced, handle grievances, collect dues from members, maintain out-of-work lists, hold meetings at which members express their views, and provide a number of other services directly to NTD members. We therefore find that NTD is functionally and structurally a local labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Finally, defendants contend that NTD should be exempt from the election requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481 because it is unable to comply with those provisions. Specifically, defendants contend that the transience of NTD members renders NTD unable to comply with \u00a7 481(e), which requires the labor organization to mail notice of an election to each member within fifteen days before the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Defendants\u2019 argument is unconvincing. Section 481(b) requires each local to conduct officer elections at least once every three years. If it fails to do so, \u00a7 482(c) requires the court to direct an election supervised by the Secretary. The LMRDA contains no exception for instances in which compliance with these requirements is difficult, and we are unwilling to imply one given the clear congressional mandate. <em>Cf. Wirtz v. Local Union No. 1622, </em>285 F.Supp. 455, 465 (N.D.Cal.1968) (Congress did not give courts the power to determine whether election would serve the public interest). Moreover, defendants have not shown that NTD is unable to comply with the Act\u2019s election provisions. Section 481(e) merely requires that the labor organization mail notice of the election to its members at their last known home address; it does not require that the notice actually reach them. NTD presently manages to elect delegates to the International convention and to collect dues from its members. Thus, NTD\u2019s inability to hold elections complying with the LMRDA is speculative at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">We affirm the opinion of the district court insofar as it held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over this action and that NTD is a labor organization within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(i). We reverse that portion of the district court\u2019s opinion holding that NTD is a national labor organization subject to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(a) because we conclude that NTD is a local labor organization for the purposes of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
