KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1193-18\">Petitioner Raymond Bertolini Trucking Company (RBTC) appeals the Tax Court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s dis-allowance of RBTC\u2019s deduction of certain lawfully made kickback payments as ordinary and necessary business expenses, under I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the Tax Court\u2019s decision and find that petitioner was entitled to take these deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-19\">RBTC is an Ohio corporation based in Akron. RBTC became a subcontractor at a large shopping mall construction site in Akron under the primary contractor, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. (Forest City) when the previous subcontractor defaulted. Mr. Nicholas Festa, Forest City\u2019s supervisor at the site, awarded RBTC the subcontract, which was up to that time the largest job that RBTC had undertaken. RBTC was to bill Forest City on an hourly basis for use of equipment and personnel. In the course of carrying out the subcontract, RBTC\u2019s weekly payroll soared from $5000 to $30,000, and the company had to make monthly payments on $200,000 worth of equipment purchased during this time to perform the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-20\">Sometime after RBTC began invoicing its bills to Forest City, Mr. Festa approached Mr. Bertolini, RBTC\u2019s president, to solicit him to make \u201ckickback\u201d payments to Mr. Festa out of the payments received from Forest City. Mr. Bertolini understood Mr. Festa to mean that RBTC would not be allowed to continue the subcontract work and would not be timely paid if the kickbacks were not forthcoming. Mr. Bertolini agreed to make the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-21\">RBTC did additional subcontract work on a site adjacent to the mall on a bid subcontract basis. All of these subcontracts were signed by Mr. Festa and were conditioned on RBTC making kickback payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-22\">During RBTC\u2019s taxable year ending September 30, 1976, it paid Festa (or others for Festa\u2019s benefit) $44,500 in seven payments. In fiscal 1977, such payments totalled $90,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>071.91. The individual payment amounts bear no particular relation to the amounts paid by Forest City to RBTC. RBTC later made out a note payable to Festa for $30,-000, which petitioner paid in installments. In making these payments, RBTC did not violate either Ohio State law or federal law, and was not by virtue of the payments subject to loss of any license or privilege to engage in its trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">RBTC deducted its payment of $44,500 to Festa from its income in its taxable year ending September 30, 1976, as \u201cSubcontract-Construction.\u201d In its taxable year ending September 30, 1977, RBTC reported $82,571.91 paid to Festa as \u201cCommissions and Fees to Nonemployees\u201d on its 1099 form. Petitioner later filed another 1099 for the payments made to Festa on the $30,000 note. The Commissioner disallowed these deductions on the ground that they were not \u201cordinary\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 162(a). Section 162(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxGx\">In general. \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">Illegal bribes or kickbacks may not be deducted, under I.R.C. \u00a7 162(c)(1). Congress amended the statute in 1969,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adding \u00a7 162(c)(2), which was revised in 1971.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection (c)(2) now provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2zt\">Other illegal payments. \u2014 No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any payment ... made, directly or indirectly, to any person, if the payment constitutes an illegal bribe, illegal kickback, or other illegal payment under any law of the United States or under any law of a State (but only if such State law is generally enforced), which subjects the payor to a criminal penalty or the loss of license or privilege to engage in a trade or business.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">The Treasury promulgated Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-1, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-12\">A deduction for an expense paid or incurred after December 30, 1969, which would otherwise be allowable under section 162 <em>shall not be denied on the grounds that allowance of such deduction would frustrate a sharply defined public policy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-13\">(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-14\">The statute and regulations thus set out a scheme under which a taxpayer may deduct as a business expense any expenditure which is ordinary and necessary, and legally made, and the Commissioner may not disallow a deduction on public policy grounds. There is no dispute here that petitioner\u2019s kickback payments were made legally, and the Commissioner concedes that the payments were necessary. Thus the only question before us is whether the payments were ordinary, within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-15\">Petitioner and the Commissioner advocate two distinct views of the meaning of \u201cordinary\u201d in the statute. The Commissioner promotes the view that \u201cordinary\u201d means \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chabitual.\u201d Petitioner advances the view that the word \u201cordinary\u201d is in the statute simply to distinguish between expenditures which are ordinary, i.e., currently deductible, and those which must be capitalized and deducted over the life of the asset or benefit acquired. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>is apparently no meaningful legislative history on this point,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> though the phrase \u201cordinary and.necessary\u201d has been with us to delimit allowable business expense deductions since 1909.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">The Commissioner cites <em>Deputy v. du Pont, </em>308 U.S. 488, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940), for his view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-9\">Ordinary has the connotation of normal, usual, or customary. To be sure, an expense may be ordinary though it happen but once in the taxpayer\u2019s lifetime. Yet the transaction which gives rise to it must be of common or frequent occurrence in the type of business involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 495, 60 S.Ct. at 367 (citations omitted). <em>See also Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 113, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933) (ordinary has \u201cstrain of constancy\u201d but is \u201caffected by time and place and circumstance\u201d); <em>United Draperies, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>340 F.2d 936 (7th Cir.1964) (kickbacks not ordinary means of securing business in trailer manufacturing business).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">This is the interpretation of \u201cordinary\u201d which the Tax Court followed in deciding RBTC\u2019s case here. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-12\">[I]n the absence of any proof whatsoever that the payments made by Mr. Bertolini to Mr. Festa were in any way customary or normal in the dumping or excavating industry, we must hold that such payments were not \u201cordinary\u201d within the meaning of section 162(a) and therefore are not deductible thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-13\">The leading case for the view that petitioner propounds is <em>Commissioner v. Tellier, </em>383 U.S. 687, 86 S.Ct. 1118, 16 L.Ed.2d 185 (1966), in which Justice Stewart wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">The principal function of the term \u201cordinary\u201d in \u00a7 162(a) is to clarify the distinction, often difficult, between those expenses that are currently deductible and those that are in the nature of capital expenditures, which, if deductible at all, must be amortized over the useful life of the asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 689-690, 86 S.Ct. at 1119-1120. <em>See also Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings and Loan Assoc., </em>403 U.S. 345, 354, 91 S.Ct. 1893, 1899, 29 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971); <em>Mason Dixon Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>708 F.2d 1043, 1046 (6th Cir.1983); <em>NCNB Corp. v. United States, </em>651 F.2d 942, 948 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Colorado Springs National Bank v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 1185, 1192 (10th Cir.1974); <em>Bayou Verret Land Co. v. Commissioner, </em>450 F.2d 850, 858 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-18\">An expenditure is ordinary if it is a current expense. The Supreme Court so held in <em>Tellier, </em>and we followed that decision in <em>Mason Dixon Lines, </em>in which we examined the deductibility of \u201cliquidated damage\u201d penalties for operating a vehicle with weight in excess of statutory limits:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-19\">The Supreme Court has set out the proper approach when claimed deductions are denied by the IRS because the deducted expenses have some relation to violations of law by the taxpayer. A court should determine first whether the expenditures come within the literal requirements of \u00a7 162(a). This test is satisfied if the expenses are incurred in connection with a business and if they are ordinary and necessary. <em>The significance of ordinary is to distinguish between capital expenditures which must be amortized if deductible at all and expenditures for current operations of the business. </em>* * * <em>Commissioner v. Tellier, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 689, 86 S.Ct. at 1120, <em>quoting Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>U.S. 111, 113, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">708 F.2d at 1046.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Similarly, the court in <em>NCNB Corp., </em>having found the taxpayer\u2019s expenditures to have been necessary, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-6\">The question, therefore, is to what extent, if at all, the expenditures were also \u201cordinary,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>were current, were part of the cost of producing the income which is reported on the disputed income tax returns. It is a matter of timing, the selection of the proper tax year or years against whose revenues the expenditures should be set off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">651 F.2d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">We believe that the confusion regarding the meaning of \u201cordinary\u201d stems from the fact that the two views advanced here are both to a certain extent correct, and are not mutually exclusive. <em>See Tulia Feedlot, Inc. v. United States, </em>513 F.2d 800 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 947, 96 S.Ct. 362, 46 L.Ed.2d 281 (1975). Whether an expenditure is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chabitual\u201d is a criterion to be used in determining whether it is currently deductible, or whether it must be capitalized. An expenditure may be extraordinary and unusual because it is a purchase of an asset requiring an unusually large cash outlay, or because the expenditure was occasioned by an extraordinary disaster. These will generally be capital, or non-ordinary expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">The interrelation between the question of what is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chabitual\u201d and what is currently deductible is illustrated in <em>Welch, </em>cited by both parties here. In that opinion Justice Cardozo wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-10\">Now, what is ordinary, though there must always be a strain of constancy within it, is none the less a variable affected by time and place and circumstance. Ordinary in this context does not mean that the payments must be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will have to make them often. A lawsuit affecting the safety of a business may happen once in a lifetime. The counsel fees may be so heavy that repetition is unlikely. Nonetheless, the expense is an ordinary one because we know from experience that payments for such a purpose, whether the amount is-large or small, are the common and accepted means of defense against attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqaL\">290 U.S. at 113-14, 54 S.Ct. at 8-9. The opinion then goes on to discuss whether the expenditures in question in that case, the taxpayer\u2019s payment of the debts of his corporation after discharge in bankruptcy, were ordinary expenses, or, as the Commissioner found, \u201crather in the nature of capital expenditures, an outlay for the development of reputation and good will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 54 S.Ct. at 8. Justice Cardozo wrote these lines which are eminently quotable, but which give judges and tax lawyers little guidance on the question of what is ordinary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-13\">One struggles in vain for any verbal formula that will supply a ready touchstone. The standard set up by the statute is not a rule of law; it is rather a way of life. Life in all its fullness must apply the answer to the riddle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 115, 54 S.Ct. at 9. In his next sentence, however, Justice Cardozo concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-15\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue resorted to that standard [\u201clife in all its fullness\u201d] in assessing the petitioner\u2019s income, and found that the payments in controversy <em>came closer to capital outlays than to ordinary and necessary expenses in the operation of a business. ... [T]he tax must be confirmed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-17\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-18\">The central issue in <em>Welch </em>was thus whether the expenditure should have been deducted currently or capitalized; the question of whether the expenditure was \u201cnor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>mal\u201d is a tool for getting at this prime question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">This is not to say that the question of whether an expenditure is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chabitual\u201d is of no moment. We recognize that there are cases in which an expenditure may be so abnormal as not to be logically connected to the taxpayer\u2019s particular business at all and so not be a deductible business expense. <em>Deputy v. du Pont, supra, </em>cited by the Commissioner for his interpretation of \u201cordinary,\u201d is such a case. In <em>du Pont </em>the Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial of a deduction of carrying charges on the taxpayer\u2019s short sale of securities, because the taxpayer was not in the business of trading securities, but rather in the business of \u201cconserving and enhancing his estate.\u201d 308 U.S. at 493, 60 S.Ct. at 366. <em>du Pont </em>thus stands for the proposition that there must be some normal, logical connection between a taxpayer\u2019s particular business and the expenditure for it to be deductible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is obviously such a relationship between RBTC\u2019s construction business and the kickback payments which it made in order to retain its construction contracts, and so under <em>du Pont </em>the payments are ordinary and deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">This Court does not condone kickback arrangements any more than do the Commissioner and the Tax Court. This case is somewhat aberrant, because in most of our country payments such as those' made by petitioner are illegal and consequently not deductible. But a legal kickback is a cost of doing business like any other \u2014 an indispensable one here \u2014 and Congress has written the tax laws so as to allow deductions for such costs so long as the payments made are within the bounds of federal and state law. As the Court said in <em>Tellier:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aef\">We start with the proposition that the federal income tax is a tax on net income, not a sanction against wrongdoing. That principal has been firmly imbedded in the tax statute from the beginning. * <em>* * </em>With respect to deductions, the basic rule, with only a few limited and well-defined exceptions, is the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">383 U.S. at 691, 86 S.Ct. at 1120. <em>See also United Draperies, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>340 F.2d 936, 938 (7th Cir.1964) (Knoch, J., dissenting); Griswold, <em>supra </em>note 11. Parenthetically, we note that allowing the payments as deductions here may be wise tax policy, since the deduction by the payor may on audit reveal income tax evasion on the part of the recipient if he fails to report the payment, as apparently occurred here in the ease of Mr. Festa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">The Commissioner does not argue here that petitioner\u2019s payments are capital in nature rather than current expenses, nor does he argue that the expenses were not connected with petitioner\u2019s business. He concedes that the expenditures were necessary. Accordingly, petitioner has fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7' 162(a). The Commissioner may not disallow the deduction here on policy grounds, for Congress and the Treasury, by enacting I.R.C. \u00a7 162(c)(2) and promulgating Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.162-1, ended any ambiguity regarding the deductibility of current business expenses such as legal kickbacks. We find that the Tax Court applied an erroneous legal standard to the facts of this case, and find that under the correct standard petitioner\u2019s payments were ordinary and necessary business expenses and were properly deducted under \u00a7 162(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>The judgment of the Tax Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1193-23\">.
