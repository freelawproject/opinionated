For the reasons set forth below, we affirm and enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">Sellersburg Stone Company (\u201cSellers-burg\u201d) operates an open-pit limestone quarry and a crushed limestone operation in Clark County, Indiana. The mining technique used by Sellersburg involves a two-step procedure. In the first step, \u201cprimary blasting,\u201d boulders are blasted from the side of the quarry. Those boulders that are too large to pass through the stone-crusher then are moved by a front-end loader to the floor of the quarry, where they are closely clustered, in preparation for \u201csecondary blasting.\u201d In this second step, workers drill a hole into each boulder and place a stick of dynamite in each hole. The workers add a primer cord to each stick of dynamite and pack each hole with fine stones. The dynamite in approximately twenty boulders is then detonated at one time. If, after the detonation, a dynamite charge does not explode, the standard safe practice in the industry is to inspect all remaining boulders for undetonated dynamite by turning the boulders over.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sellersburg, however, did not follow this practice. It relied instead upon the workers\u2019 visual inspection of only the top sides of the boulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">On December 13, 1979, two Sellersburg workers were engaged in secondary blasting. David Hooper drilled the boulders that had been collected in a cluster, while Carl Sparrow loaded the drill holes with sticks of dynamite and added the primer cord to the dynamite. After Hooper and Sparrow detonated the dynamite of about twenty boulders, Hooper began inspecting and drilling the remaining boulders. He inspected the top of one boulder, but he did not have the equipment to turn it over in order to inspect its bottom. Hooper then began drilling the boulder, but when the drill was about halfway through the boul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>der, the boulder exploded, causing him permanent disabling injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">After Hooper was taken to the hospital, Sellersburg did not preserve the accident site. Instead, it removed or disturbed all evidence of the accident and then resumed normal mining activity. In addition, Sellersburg did not inform the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor (\u201cMSHA\u201d) about the accident until January 2, 1980, when it mailed a written report of the accident to the MSHA\u2019s subdistrict office located in Vincennes, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">On January 3, 1980, MSHA inspectors examined the petitioner\u2019s quarry and issued three citations to Sellersburg for violating three MSHA regulations: 30 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 50.10, 50.12, 56.6-106.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An assessment officer of the MSHA proposed, on July 2, 1980, that the petitioner be assessed penalties of $78 for the violation of section 50.10, $78 for the violation of section 50.12, and $1000 for the violation of section 56.6-106. On July 25, 1980, Sellersburg notified the Secretary of Labor that it would contest the citations and the proposed penalties. Several weeks later, on August 8, 1980, the Secretary petitioned the Commission for an assessment of the proposed civil penalties, in accordance with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2700.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">A hearing on the petition for assessment took place before an ALJ on December 10, 1981. The ALJ issued his decision on July 26, 1982, affirming the violations and imposing penalties of $1000 for the violation of section 50.10, $1000 for the violation of section 50.12, and $7500 for the violation of section 56.6-106. Sellersburg then petitioned the Commission for discretionary review of the AU\u2019s decision, and review was granted on September 1, 1982. In a decision dated March 11, 1983, the Commission affirmed the AU\u2019s findings of violations and his assessment of penalties. On April 6, 1983, Sellersburg filed a petition for review with this court, arguing both that the AU made insufficient factual findings to support his determination that Sellers-burg violated section 56.6-106, and that the amount of penalties assessed is contrary to law and constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac3l\">Factual Findings Relating to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 56.6-106</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">Section 56.6-106 of the MSHA regulations requires that, at mining operations, \u201cfaces and muck piles\u201d must be examined for undetonated explosives.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sellersburg argues that, since the AU did not find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>specifically that the boulder that exploded and injured Hooper was part of a muck pile, the AU\u2019s finding of a violation of section 56.6-106 must be vacated or modified. The Commission considered this argument in its review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, and it concluded that the AU implicitly had found the boulder to be part of a muck pile. Furthermore, the Commission concluded that the AU\u2019s findings sufficiently supported his determination that Sellersburg violated section 56.6-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Under the Commission\u2019s regulations, decisions of AUs must \u201cinclude findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the reasons or bases for them, on all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented by the record.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2700.65 (1983). Such findings and conclusions are also mandated by section 557(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A)(1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In interpreting section 557(c), the. Supreme Court has held that, where an agency makes no specific findings upon a contention, the agency complies with the Administrative Procedure Act if it considers the contention and discusses it. <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway Co. v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 173, 193, 80 S.Ct. 229, 241, 4 L.Ed.2d 223 (1959). Federal courts also have held that they are not disposed to overturn an agency\u2019s decision on the basis of section 577(c) \u201cif the agency\u2019s path, although not ideally clear, may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Benmar Transport &amp; Leasing Corp. v. ICC, </em>623 F.2d 740, 746 (2d Cir.1980). <em>See also Wasson v. SEC, </em>558 F.2d 879, 884 (8th Cir.1977); <em>Chieppo Bus Co. v. United States, </em>383 F.Supp. 1192, 1198 (D.Conn.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">In the present case, the AU found that Sellersburg \u201cdid not properly examine the muck pile after secondary blasting, because after such blasting it drilled boulders without turning them over to examine each boulder for a dynamite drill hole on the bottom of the boulder.\u201d AU Decision dated July 26, 1982, at 3. It is apparent from the AU\u2019s brief discussion that he considered and decided that the boulder that injured Hooper was part of a muck pile. We thus are able to discern the path taken by the AU, and we hold that this path sufficiently supports his determination of a violation of section 56.6-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">According to Sellersburg, the penalties in this case were assessed erroneously because the AU and the Commission failed to make the findings required for \u201cdetermination of penalty amount\u201d as outlined in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3(a). Sellersburg cites <em>Allied Products Co v. FMSHRC, </em>666 F.2d 890 (5th Cir.1982), for the proposition that both the AU and the Commission must follow the procedure set forth in section 100.3(a), and it argues that in the absence of appropriate findings, the penalties must be deemed excessive, arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">In its decision affirming the penalties assessed by the AU, the Commission expressed its position that the <em>Allied </em>decision \u201cmisperceived the penalty assessment authority of the Commission and its judges under the Act.\u201d Commission Decision dated March 11, 1983, at 4. The Commission stated that, in contested cases, the amount of the penalties to be assessed by the Commission and its judges is a <em>de novo </em>determination based on the six statutory criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>specified in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(i). Applying section 820(i), the Commission concluded that the AU erred in failing to make specific findings regarding four of the six criteria. However, the Commission determined from the record that information relating to these four criteria had been uncontested. Choosing not to remand the case for specific findings, the Commission entered the uncontested information as the required findings. It then ruled that in light of all the findings, the assessed penalties were not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">We begin with a review of the process of penalty assessment under the Federal Mine Health and Safety Act (\u201cAct\u201d). The Act empowers the Secretary of Labor, acting through the MSHA, to issue citations against mine operators that have violated the standards of the Act and also to propose civil penalties for these violations. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 814(a), 815(a) (1982). In proposing penalties, the Secretary must consider the six criteria listed in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 815(b)(1)(B) (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying these criteria, the Secretary assigns penalty points and then converts the points into proposed penalty amounts, pursuant to MSHA regulations. <em>See </em>30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">If a mine operator timely notifies the Secretary of its intent to contest the Secretary\u2019s citations or proposed penalties, the Secretary must advise the Commission of such notification, and the Commission must afford an opportunity for a hearing before an AU. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 815(d), 823(d) (1982). The AU, after determining that a violation has occurred, may affirm, modify, or vacate the Secretary\u2019s proposed penalties. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 815(d). A mine operator that is adversely affected or aggrieved by the AU\u2019s decision may petition the Commission for review. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 823(d)(2)(A)(i). The Commission may accept review and, after examining the record, it may affirm, set aside, or modify the decision of the AU. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 823(d)(2)(c). In assessing penalties, both the AU and the Commission must consider the same six criteria that are considered by the Secretary. <em>Compare id. </em>at \u00a7 820(i)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>with id. </em>at \u00a7 815(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, neither the AU nor, the Commission is bound by the Secretary\u2019s proposed penalties. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2700.29(b) (1983). If a mine operator is adversely affected by the decision of the Commission, it may obtain review in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(a)(1) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">, Having set forth the statutory and regulatory framework for penalty assessment under the Act, we now consider Sellers-burg\u2019s argument that the assessed penalties in the present case are excessive and an abuse of discretion. Sellersburg relies heavily upon <em>Allied Products Co. v. FMSHRC, </em>666 F.2d 890 (5th Cir.1982), where a mine operator presented a similar claim of excessive penalties. The Fifth Circuit correctly identified the statutory crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>r\u00eda to be considered by the AU and the Commission in assessing penalties, pursuant to 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(i). The court then applied the penalty point formula set forth in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 and determined that the penalties assessed by the Commission were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">It is clear that the penalty point formula outlined in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 applies to the proposed penalty assessments of the MSHA, which is under the direction of the Secretary. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.2 (1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, we find no basis upon which to conclude that these MSHA regulations also govern the Commission. It cannot be disputed that the Commission and its AUs constitute an adjudicative body that is independent of the MSHA. Sen. Rep. No. 461, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 38 (1977). This body is governed by its own regulations, which explicitly state that, in assessing penalties, it need not adopt the proposed penalties of the Secretary. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2700.29(b) (1983). Furthermore, neither the Act nor the Commission\u2019s regulations require the Commission to apply the formula for determining penalty proposals that is set forth in section 100.3 of the MSHA regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since we cannot conclude that the AUs and the Commission must follow the procedure outlined in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 in order to assess penalties, we refuse to utilize this procedure in order to determine the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s assessment, as the Fifth Circuit did in <em>Allied. </em>We instead base our review upon the Commission\u2019s consideration of the six criteria listed in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(i).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The Commission accepted the AU\u2019s findings that Sellersburg\u2019s violations were the result of negligence and that all three violations were serious. Although the Commission concluded that the AU erred in making no findings with respect to the remaining four criteria, the Commission found, from a review of the record, that \u201cthere was no controversy between the parties concerning the record evidence bearing on each of these criteria.\u201d Commission\u2019s Decision dated March 11, 1983, at 8. The Commission then entered the record evidence as the required findings. Specifically, the Commission found: (1) that the parties stipulated to Sellersburg\u2019s good faith in abating the violations; (2) that, on the issue of size, Sellersburg\u2019s annual production was approximately 450,-000 tons of limestone, and Sellersburg employed between fourteen and twenty persons; (3) that, on the issue of history of violations, the Secretary entered into evidence, and Sellersburg did not challenge, an exhibit indicating that Sellersburg was charged with thirty-five violations between January 1978 and January 1980; and (4) that Sellersburg refused to stipulate that payment of civil penalties would not affect its ability to continue in business, but it did not offer any argument or evidence to the contrary. In light of all the findings, the Commission concluded that it could not say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>\u201cthat the penalties assessed [were] inconsistent with the statutory criteria and the deterrent purpose behind the Act\u2019s provisions for penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. It then found that the ALJ\u2019s penalty assessments did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">We note, first, that the Commission\u2019s entering of undisputed record information as findings was proper under the Act. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(d)(2)(C) (1982) (\u201c[t]he Commission ... may ... modify the decision or order of the administrative law judge in conformity with the record\u201d). The Commission must remand a case to the AU only if it \u201cdetermines that further evidence is necessary on an issue of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the Commission\u2019s conclusion that uncontroverted evidence did not warrant further factual findings, such a remand was not required in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Turning to the Commission\u2019s application of the statutory criteria to the facts of this case, we find that the Commission accurately considered the evidence pertaining to each criterion. Sellersburg had a history of previous violations. Although its operation was small to medium-sized, Sellersburg presented no evidence that payment of civil penalties would adversely affect its ability to continue in business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, notwithstanding Sellers-burg\u2019s good faith in abating the violations, the AU specifically found gross negligence in Sellersburg\u2019s violation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 56.6-106 and negligence in Sellersburg\u2019s violations of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 56.10, 56.12. Finally, the AU found that the violation of section 56.6-106 was \u201cmost serious\u201d and posed a \u201cgrave risk \u2019 to employees, and he found that the violations of sections 56.10 and 56.12 were serious and hindered the MSHA\u2019s ability to conduct appropriate investigations. On the basis of these reasonable considerations, we cannot conclude that the penalties assessed by the AU and affirmed by the Commission were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decision dated March 11, 1983, is affirmed and enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">. Since boulders often are moved during a dynamite blast, the drill hole of an undetonated stick of dynamite may be visible only by turning the boulder over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">. This account of the events preceding the accident was given by Hooper at the hearing before the ALJ in this case. At this hearing, Sparrow testified that he and Hooper discovered the undetonated charge in the boulder and that, after he told Hooper to drill holes in the other boulders, he returned to his truck. The ALJ clearly rejected Sparrow\u2019s testimony in favor of Hooper\u2019s account of the events. <em>See </em>ALJ Decision dated July 26, 1982, at 3. We hold that these factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and we refuse to disturb them. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(a)(1) (1982) (\u201d[t]he findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A1Z\">. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvI\">If an accident occurs, an operator shall immediately contact the MSHA District or Subdistrict Office having jurisdiction over its mine.

Commission exercises independent review, and applies the six statutory criteria without consideration of these regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU9v\">47 Fed.Reg. 22,287 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">. <em>See supra </em>note 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">. We do not read <em>Donovan ex rel. Chacon v. Phelps Dodge Corp., </em>709 F.2d 86 (D.C.Cir.1983), as holding to the contrary. In <em>Donovan, </em>the Commission reversed an ALJ\u2019s finding that a mine operator discriminated against an employee active in promoting mine safety. The District of Columbia Circuit stated that the Commission is bound statutorily to uphold an ALJ\u2019s factual determinations that are supported by substantial evidence. It then held that, because the ALJ\u2019s finding of discrimination was supported by substantial evidence, the Commission exceeded its statutory standard of review in reversing this finding. In the present case, the Commission did not reverse a factual finding of the ALJ. Instead, it modified the ALJ\u2019s decision by entering as factual findings the uncontroverted information that was contained in the record and that the ALJ took into account in assessing civil penalties. <em>See </em>ALJ Decision dated July 26, 1982, at 5 (\u201d[b]ased upon the statutory criteria for assessing a civil penalty, respondent is assessed [penalties totalling $9500]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1225-21\">. In the absence of proof that the payment of civil penalties would adversely affect a company\u2019s ability to stay in business, it is presumed that there would be no such effect. <em>See Buffalo Mining Co., </em>2 IBMA 226, 247-48, 251, 252 (1973) (decided under the predecessor Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
