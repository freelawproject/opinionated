(Southwest) guilty of violating National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) \u00a7 8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board found that Southwest failed to honor the fringe benefit, hiring hall,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and grievance arbitration provisions of its collective bargaining agreement with Local 75 of the Bridge Workers Union (the union).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-25\">In a pro forma opinion, 262 N.L.R.B. 665 (1982), the Board adopted the finding of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that Southwest violated its duty to bargain in good faith when it unilaterally abrogated the hiring hall provision of an expired collective bargaining contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-26\">On petition for enforcement, the Board argues that Southwest may not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>attack the merits of the Board\u2019s hiring hall decision because the company failed to comply with NLRA \u00a7 10(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1982), and Board rules requiring a dissatisfied party to file timely and specific exceptions to an unfavorable ALJ report. In the alternative, the Board contends that the hiring hall provision, as a term or condition of employment within the meaning of NLRA \u00a7 8(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) (1982), survives the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement until employer and union bargain to impasse over the fate of the provision in the next contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Although we think that Southwest filed timely exceptions, we agree with the Board\u2019s finding that the hiring hall provision survived the contract\u2019s expiration. Therefore, we enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">Southwest sells, services, and installs bank security equipment. In 1979, the Board certified the Bridge Workers Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for employees working out of the company\u2019s Phoenix, Arizona premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">After several fits and starts, Southwest President Rick Iglesias signed the union\u2019s master agreement with the Arizona Steel Field Erectors Association, a multi-employer group.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contract, effective from August 1, 1977, through July 31, 1980, covered employees who fabricated, erected, and maintained steel used in safes, vaults, vault doors, safe deposit boxes, and other bank security devices. The contract required employers to hire workers through the union\u2019s hiring hall, and to make payments on their behalf to various union benefit funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">Between April 22, 1980, and May 16, 1980, Southwest requested, and the union referred, eight employees. Sometime in May, Southwest stopped requesting referrals. Then on May 14, Iglesias informed the union that Southwest would subcontract out for all bargaining unit work. The next day, the union sent a letter to both Iglesias and the multi-employer association stating that the Bridge Workers intended to file a grievance pursuant to the master agreement. Iglesias failed to respond to either the letter or the multi-employer group\u2019s attempts to schedule a grievance hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">On June 20, the multi-employer group notified Iglesias that it had scheduled a grievance hearing for July 1. Southwest failed to appear at the hearing, and on July 2, the arbitration committee issued a decision finding the employer guilty of violating, among other things, the master agreement\u2019s hiring hall clause. The union followed up by filing unfair labor practice charges on July 22. Meanwhile, the master agreement expired on July 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">A year later, on July 29, 1981, the ALJ issued a report concluding that Southwest had violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) in failing to honor the fringe benefit, hiring hall, and grievance arbitration provisions. On August 20, acting within the Board\u2019s 20-day procedural framework for filing objections, Southwest submitted general exceptions to the AU\u2019s findings. Exception 5 objected to the AU\u2019s conclusion of law that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">[b]y failing and refusing to abide by the fringe benefit, <em>referral, </em>and grievance and arbitration provisions of the 1977-1980 Arizona Master Labor Agreement ... thereby unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment of its employees, Respondent has engaged in unfair labor practices violating section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-13\">Brief for Respondent Southwest Security Equipment Corp. at 8 (quoting from AU report) (emphasis in brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">Similarly, exception 6 identified a particular AU finding regarding \u201creferral,\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>did not provide specific reasons why the employer objected to the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">But on August 26, 1981, the union filed its own limited exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. On September 4, Southwest filed a brief responding to the union\u2019s exceptions and clarifying Southwest\u2019s reasons for objecting to the ALJ\u2019s findings on \u201creferral.\u201d The September 4 brief reasoned that Southwest had not committed an unfair labor practice because the hiring hall provision did not survive the master agreement\u2019s expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Finally, nearly 10 months later, the Board adopted pro forma the ALJ\u2019s report. 262 N.L.R.B. 665 (June 30, 1982). Later, on November 12, 1982, the Board rejected Southwest\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The Board now petitions for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-8\">Two standards of review govern our inquiry. As to the timeliness of the employer\u2019s exceptions, we must uphold the Board\u2019s decision unless the Board acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>NLRB v. United Association of Journeymen &amp; Apprentices of the Plumbing &amp; Pipefitting Industry, </em>704 F.2d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir.1983); <em>see also </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 30.10 (1958) (reviewing court may overturn agency\u2019s application of properly-adopted regulation only if application is arbitrary or capricious). But in doubtful situations, we merely give \u201cweight\u201d to the Board\u2019s application of the Act. <em>Joint Council of Teamsters No. 42 v. NLRB, </em>702 F.2d 168,170 (9th Cir.1981) (citing <em>NLRB v. Denver Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, </em>341 U.S. 675, 692, 71 S.Ct. 943, 953, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 100, 78 L.Ed.2d 105 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-14\">As to the merits of the hiring hall decision, we must defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the bargaining obligation under \u00a7 8(d) if that interpretation is \u201creasonably defensible.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, </em>441 U.S. 488, 497, 99 5. Ct. 1842, 1849, 60 L.Ed.2d 420 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-16\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-17\">A. <em>The Procedures: Specificity of Exceptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-18\">1. <em>The NLRA and the Board\u2019s rules. </em>The NLRA forbids us from considering a matter not presented to the Board or to the AU. Section 10(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-19\">No objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court [of appeals], unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJr\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-20\">To implement \u00a7 10(e), the Board has promulgated several regulations. Rule 102.-46(b), for instance, sets out four requirements that every exception to an ALJ\u2019s findings must meet.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One requirement commands the party to \u201cstate the grounds for the exception[ ].\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.-46(b)(4) (1983). The rule adds that the Board may disregard or consider waived any exceptions failing to conform to these requirements. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Rule 102.-48(a) provides for pro forma Board adoption of the ALJ\u2019s findings when the party fails to meet the requirements of Rule 102.-46(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, Rule 102.46(a) requires the excepting party to file its objections with the Board within 20 days of the date the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>AU transfers the case to the Board. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102.46(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">2. <em>Applying the requirements. </em>Relying principally on <em>Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>318 U.S. 253, 255, 63 S.Ct. 585, 586, 87 L.Ed. 744 (1943), the Board argues that Southwest\u2019s exceptions were so unspecific that they could not effectively apprise the Board of an alleged error in the AU\u2019s findings. The Board reasons that its rules plainly call for more than Southwest\u2019s short demurrer in exceptions 5 and 6, filed August 20, 1981. In fact, the Board says, Southwest did not really identify its quarrel with the AU\u2019s proposed disposition of the hiring hall clause until September 4, 1981, when it filed a brief opposing the union\u2019s limited exceptions to other parts of the ALJ\u2019s report. But the Board contends that this clarification came too late to preserve the hiring hall question for the Board or this court. By then, the 20-day filing deadline had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">For three reasons, we think the Board arbitrarily applied \u00a7 10(e) and its rules to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">First, Southwest meets this Circuit\u2019s test for determining sufficiency of notice. In <em>NLRB v. Giustina Bros. Lumber Co., </em>253 F.2d 371 (9th Cir.1958), we held that Rule 102.46(b) prohibited the respondent from raising an issue before the Ninth Circuit where respondent\u2019s objection had been \u201cso ambiguous as to be <em>totally ineffective </em>\u201d in \u201cadequately apprising]\u201d the Board of the excepting party\u2019s intentions. <em>Id. </em>at 374 (emphasis added). This is a stringent test. But Southwest\u2019s exception to the ALT\u2019s referral, whether considered alone or together with its brief of September 4, constituted a much better effort than \u201ctotally ineffective\u201d notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">Second, although the NLRA vests the Board with great discretion to resolve unfair labor practice disputes, the statute does not permit the Board to use its authority \u201cin a manner [that] deprives a party of a fair and adequate hearing.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Zeno Table Co., </em>610 F.2d 567, 569 (9th Cir.1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">Southwest should not be penalized for making adequate, if somewhat inartful, efforts to raise the hiring hall question below. Even if its August 20 effort was insufficient, its September 4 brief \u2014 which was submitted only 15 days after the deadline for filing exceptions had passed \u2014 certainly cured the problem and put both the ALT and the Board on notice about Southwest\u2019s hiring hall contention. Indeed, the Board would be hard-pressed to argue that Southwest\u2019s poor notice somehow prejudiced, <em>see Zeno Table, </em>610 F.2d at 569, the proceedings. After all, nearly 10 months passed between the date Southwest submitted its September 4 brief clarifying its position, and the date that the Board issued its pro forma decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">Third, the Board\u2019s own rules and precedents command it to read its procedural rules liberally. <em>E.g., </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.121 (1983) (\u201cThe rules and regulations in this part shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes and provisions of the act.\u201d); <em>Daisy\u2019s Originals, Inc., </em>187 N.L.R.B. 251, 251 n. 1 (1970) (\u201c[T]he Board makes every effort to apply its rules with such lenience as will effectuate the purposes of the act.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-10\">The Board cites a string of cases holding against parties who failed to meet the Board\u2019s procedural standards. But all these cases are distinguishable as extreme examples whose facts, taken as a whole, showed that the excepting parties filed tardily, ambiguously, or not at all. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 350, 73 S.Ct. 287, 290, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953) (general exception alleging only that decision was contrary to and unsupported by law held insufficient); <em>Stephenson v. NLRB, </em>614 F.2d 1210, 1214-15 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (exception relying simply on Board Chairman\u2019s dissent below held too ambiguous); <em>NLRB v. STR, Inc., </em>549 F.2d 641, 642 (9th Cir.1977) (complete failure to file exceptions held insufficient); <em>NLRB v. Selvin, </em>527 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1975) (exceptions filed 7 months after filing deadline had passed held insufficient); <em>NLRB v. International Association of Bridge Workers, </em>473 F.2d 816, 817 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>(9th Cir.1973) (per curiam) (general exceptions held insufficient for failure to make \u201cany other reference\u201d below to contention urged before court of appeals); <em>NLRB v. Pinkerton\u2019s National Detective Agency, </em>202 F.2d 230, 233 (9th Cir.1953) (complete failure to raise issue below held insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">We conclude, then, that Southwest filed timely exceptions to the AU\u2019s report. Therefore, the merits of the hiring hall decision are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">B. <em>The Merits: Hiring Hall Clause Survivability</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">Hiring hall provisions are common in the construction industry, \u201cwhere jobs tend to be unpredictable, of short duration, and not with any single employer.\u201d R. Gorman, <em>Basic Text on Labor Law </em>643 (1976). The hiring hall serves as a \u201cunion-operated clearinghouse which matches employers seeking a transitory workforce [with] employees seeking work.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">The well-established presumption is that an employer violates his \u00a7 8(a)(5) duty to bargain in good faith if he unilaterally changes the terms of a collective agreement, even after that agreement has expired. As we recently put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-8\">[T]he collective bargaining agreement survives its expiration date for purposes of marking the status quo as to wages and working conditions. The employer is required to maintain that status quo following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement until the parties negotiate a new agreement or bargain in good faith to impasse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\"><em>NLRB v. Carilli, </em>648 F.2d 1206, 1214 (9th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Peerless Roofing Co. v. NLRB, </em>641 F.2d 734, 735 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Clear Pine Mouldings, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>632 F.2d 721, 729 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 984,101 S.Ct. 2317, 68 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981)); <em>see also American Distributing Co. v. NLRB, </em>715 F.2d 446, 449 (9th Cir.1983) (applying same principle); <em>Stone Boat Yard v. NLRB, </em>715 F.2d 441, 444 (9th Cir.1983) (same) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1910, 80 L.Ed.2d 459 (1984); <em>NLRB v. Sky Wolf Sales, </em>470 F.2d 827, 830 (9th Cir.1972) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-15\">The Board contends that under the law established in these cases, Southwest had the duty to honor the hiring hall provision of the master agreement, even after July 31, 1980. The Board reasons that the hiring hall provision, a subject of mandatory bargaining within the meaning of \u00a7 8(d), <em>see NLRB v. Tom Joyce Floors, Inc., </em>353 F.2d 768, 771 (9th Cir.1965), is no different from employee welfare fund and benefits clauses, which routinely survive contract expiration, <em>see, e.g., Carilli, </em>648 F.2d at 1214 (preserving employer\u2019s payments into union trust fund); <em>Clear Pine Mouldings, </em>632 F.2d at 729 (preserving existing arrangement for implementing health and welfare plan).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-16\">But relying on the Board\u2019s analysis in <em>Gordon L. Rayner (Bay Area Sealers), </em>251 N.L.R.B. 89 (1980), <em>enf'd as modified, </em>665 F.2d 970 (9th Cir.1982), Southwest contends the fact that the hiring hall provision is a mandatory bargaining subject does not automatically preserve the provision upon the contract\u2019s expiration. Quoting <em>Rayner, </em>Southwest argues that only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj0\">those terms and conditions established by the contract and governing the employer-employee, as opposed to the employer-union, relationship survive the contract and present the employer with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>continuing obligation to apply those terms and conditions____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\"><em>Rayner, </em>251 N.L.R.B. at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">According to Southwest, the reasoning behind the Board\u2019s own precedents contemplates that only certain types of contract provisions \u2014 such as fringe benefits and other \u201ceconomic benefits or remunerations that the employees receive[ ] from [the employer] in exchange for their labors,\u201d <em>Sir James, Inc., </em>183 N.L.R.B. 256, 259 (1970) (Webster, Tr. Ex.) \u2014 are terms or conditions that fit within the \u201cemployee/employer\u201d rubric. Hiring hall provisions, Southwest says, are designed to protect the power of unions as institutions, rather than that of individual workers. At the very least, Southwest argues, the Board should conduct its <em>Rayner </em>analysis on the record be.fore deciding that hiring hall provisions are a part of the employer/employee relationship for purposes of \u00a7 8(a)(5); the Board should not have adopted pro forma the AU\u2019s findings on this important matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">Southwest\u2019s argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">First, the Board has long held, after careful consideration, that a hiring hall provision is an essential part of the employee/employer, relationship. In <em>Houston Chapter, Associated General Contractors, </em>143 N.L.R.B. 409 (1963), <em>enf'd, </em>349 F.2d 449 (5th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 1026, 86 S.Ct. 648, 15 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966), the Board considered whether the union\u2019s demand for a hiring hall provision was a mandatory subject of collective bargaining negotiations within the meaning of \u00a7 8(a)(5) and \u00a7 8(d). The Board ruled that it was. Borrowing language from <em>NLRB v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp., </em>356 U.S. 342, 350, 78 S.Ct. 718, 723, 2 L.Ed.2d 823 (1958), the Board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-9\">The second test is whether the subject sought to be bargained about has regulated the relations between the employer and his employees. Certainly, the matter of what standards are to be applied in determining priorities for employment <em>must of necessity regulate relations between the employer and the employees.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\"><em>Houston Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors, </em>143 N.L.R.B. at 412 (emphasis added). Even the dissent agreed with this assessment. <em>See id. </em>at 415-16 (Rodgers &amp; Leedom, Members, dissenting) (\u201c[T]he hiring hall is not peripheral to industrial relations. It goes right to the core of the employer-employee relationship____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">Second, Southwest\u2019s argument misapprehends the importance of the hiring hall in industries that use it. Without the hiring hall, the construction employee would find it very difficult to find work or to establish seniority and entitlement to union benefits. Work is sporadic. An employer may need help for a day, a month, or a year. Unless he is lucky, the potential employee may spend more time looking for work than he does actually working. But the hiring hall brings employer and prospective employee together. When an employer needs help, he turns to the union. The union maintains a list of people who need work, and promises to fill employer needs as they arise. <em>See </em>R. Gorman, <em>supra, </em>at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\">In short, the construction industry hiring hall is an essential component of the employer/ employee relationship. In a sense, the hiring hall is not only part of that relationship, but also the catalyst that makes the relationship possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-14\">We hold that the hiring hall provision, which is properly presented on petition for enforcement, survived the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, we ENFORCE the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1405-14\">. The Board also found Southwest guilty of violating NLRA \u00a7 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1982). Section 8(a)(1), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with an employee\u2019s right to engage in or refrain from concerted activities, is often appended as boilerplate to Board complaints charging violations of other \u00a7 8(a) provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AcMM\">. A hiring hall is \"a union-operated clearinghouse which matches employers seeking a transitory workforce [with] employees seeking work.\u201d R. Gorman, <em>Basic Text on Labor Law </em>643 (1976). Hiring hall provisions are common in the construction industry. <em>See generally infra </em>pp. 1337, 1338.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1405-28\">. In opposing the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement, Southwest contests only the survivability of the hiring hall clause, and not the survivability of the fringe benefit and grievance arbitration clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">. When the union\u2019s representative first contacted Southwest, Iglesias refused to sign the master agreement and said he wanted a special contract because Southwest installed electrical wiring as well as security devices. The master agreement's jurisdiction did not include electrical work. Nonetheless, Iglesias called the union several months later to say he would sign the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">.

R.B. 408 (1979). <em>See </em>262 N.L.R.B. at 669 (Robbins, A.L.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"AelU\">In the present case, however, two members of the Board, in holding that the hiring hall provision survives, expressly disclaim reliance on <em>American Sink Top. See </em>262 N.L.R.B. at 665 n. 1 (Van de Water, Chairman &amp; Hunter, Member). <em>But see O\u2019Connor Co. v. Carpenters Local 1408, </em>702 F.2d 824, 825 (9th Cir.1983) (\"Termination of a collective bargaining agreement does not necessarily extinguish a party's duty to arbitrate grievances arising under the contract.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-18\">In any event, we can resolve the case before us without deciding whether an analogy to arbitration clause survivability is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1410-15\">NORRIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Au5Z\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-16\">I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the issue presented by Southwest Security\u2019s failure to comply with Board regulations governing the degree of specificity with which parties must make exceptions to an AU\u2019s findings. As the majority recognizes, we should overturn the Board\u2019s decision that these regulations bar Southwest Securities from attacking the merits of the ALJ\u2019s decision only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Board acted arbitrarily. <em>See supra </em>slip op. at p. 2872, at 1336. Because the Board applied the plain language of the regulations to the facts of this case, I cannot conclude that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary. The exceptions that Southwest Security filed on August 20th \u2014 the only exceptions filed before the deadline passed\u2014 plainly did not meet the requirements of regulation 102.46(b)(4). Although Southwest Security\u2019s exceptions refer obliquely to the hiring hall issue, they do not \u201cinclude citation of authorities\u201d or set forth \u201cthe grounds for the exceptions,\u201d as required by the regulation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">I am not persuaded by the reasons offered by the majority to support its conclusion that the Board\u2019s conduct was arbitrary. The majority takes the position that any defects in the exceptions of August 20th were cured by a brief filed on September 4th. But the brief filed on September 4th was late; it was filed after the twenty-day deadline prescribed by regulation 120.-46(a). If I were a member of the Board, I might well allow a late brief to be included in the record so long as no party was prejudiced by the addition. As a judge reviewing the Board\u2019s decision, however, I cannot say that the Board was being arbitrary when it refused to consider a brief filed after a deadline explicitly set forth in the governing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">Accordingly, we should consider the August 20th filing only. Southwest Security\u2019s exceptions in that filing are no less sketchy than those in other cases where the Board\u2019s decision to disregard exceptions was upheld on appeal. <em>See e.g., NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 350, 73 S.Ct. 287, 290, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953) (exception alleging only that decision was contrary to law); <em>NLRB v. International </em>Association <em>of Bridge Workers, </em>473 F.2d 816, 817 (9th Cir.1973) (per curiam) (exception of insufficient particularity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">The majority further maintains that Southwest Security\u2019s exceptions meet our Circuit\u2019s test for determining sufficiency of notice. But the majority inaccurately formulates that test by citing a case, <em>Giustina Brothers v. NLRB, </em>253 F.2d 371 (9th Cir.1958), which is inapposite. <em>Giustina Brothers </em>held that the Board <em>did not </em>act arbitrarily in disregarding exceptions that were \u201cso ambiguous as to be totally ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. The case thus cannot be used as authority for the majority\u2019s decision that the Board <em>did </em>act arbitrarily in disregarding these exceptions. The holding in <em>Giustina Brothers </em>is, rather, the converse of the holding the majority is fashioning in this case. Moreover, even though Southwest Security exceptions may not be \u201ctotally ineffective,\u201d as were the exceptions in <em>Giustina Brothers, </em>the exceptions here are admittedly deficient nonetheless. And nothing in <em>Giustina Brothers </em>stands for the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">Finally, the majority reasons that the Board\u2019s enforcement of regulation 102.46 violates regulation 102.121, which states that all regulations should be \u201cliberally construed to effectuate the purposes and provisions of the Act.\u201d I fail to see how this general provision supports a decision that the Board\u2019s application of regulation 102.46 to the specific facts of this case was arbitrary. After all, Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that courts shall construe those rules \u201cto secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d If a district court refused to consider an item filed after a deadline set forth in the local rules of court, however, I doubt we would employ Rule 1 to find that the district court abused its discretion \u2014 absent unusual circumstances not present in this case \u2014 if the party who filed the item, like Southwest Security, failed to show good cause for missing the deadline. The majority\u2019s reliance on the general language of regulation 102.121 is thus simply makeweight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">In sum, I see no basis for reaching the merits of the hiring hall issue without intruding upon the Board\u2019s discretion to regulate its internal process of administrative appeals. In this case, the Board did neither more nor less than enforce the text of regulation 102.46. Nevertheless,'the majority concludes that the Board acted arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>trarily in treating the regulation as if it meant what it said. The majority is thus fashioning a precedent that will frustrate the Board in its legitimate efforts to induce parties to fairly state at least the substance of their legal arguments in a timely manner. I believe the Board has a tough enough job in managing its considerable caseload without being faced with the new obstacle created by today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
