We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">Gist was \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the federal S.S.I. program on January 1, 1974,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(E). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-20\">[A]n individual shall also be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if he is permanently and totally disabled as defined under a State plan approved under subchapter XIV or XVI of this chapter as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of disability) for December 1973 (and for at least one month prior to July 1973), so long as he is continuously disabled as so defined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">Gist had apparently been determined to be disabled under the state plan prior to July 1973, although the record before us is absolutely devoid of any evidence concerning the initial determination of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">On April 16, 1980, Gist received notice that the Secretary had determined that her condition was not disabling as of March 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gist appealed this decision to an Administrative Law Judge (AU). The ALJ found that Gist did not meet either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>state or federal definition of disability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the AU found that Gist \u201cis not precluded from engaging in useful occupations she is otherwise qualified to perform and is able to care for her daily needs without assistance.\u201d This finding removed Gist from the state plan\u2019s definition of disability. As to the federal definition of disability, the AU found that Gist had no \u201csevere impairment,\u201d a requirement for disability under the federal definition. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">As noted above, there is no medical evidence in the record from Gist\u2019s initial determination of disability. The most important medical evidence in the record is the reports of two doctors, Dr. Spitz, Gist's treating physician, and Dr. Shapiro, who examined Gist as the request of the Secretary. There are also several hospital reports in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Dr. Spitz\u2019s reports indicate that Gist has suffered from pernicious anemia, high blood pressure, thyroidism, and lower back pain. Dr. Spitz, Gist\u2019s treating physician, indicated that her pernicious anemia, high blood pressure, and thyroid condition were all controlled through medication. Dr. Spitz, however, diagnosed her back pain as \u201cadvanced degenerative joint disease of the spine\u201d although he did not indicate what physical limitations this condition might cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Dr. Shapiro performed a physical examination and radiological examination on Gist. Following these examinations, Dr. Shapiro made the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeJ\">The clinical findings are not impressive as to indicate a definitive clear-cut affliction to the lower back. The patient exhibits a full range of motion in the lumbar spine. She shows no motor or sensory deficit in the lower extremities. Mrs. Gist shows a considerable amount of obesity, and such is superimposed upon moderately advanced degenerative arthritis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">The patient does have symptoms which, in the opinion of this examiner, would periodically persist until she loses a considerable amount of weight. The degenerative arthritis is not a particular factor in this instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">Mrs. Gist does not exhibit any signs of a disc herniation, with or without nerve root compression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">I rate her ability to stand, sit, walk, squat, kneel, bend, walk up or down stairs, not particularly limited if performed intermittently. The patient\u2019s ability to grasp, lift and carry is rated at 10-15 pounds with no adverse effect upon the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">Various elements pertaining to a person who is found to be disabled, are missing. This is not only in regards to clinical findings, but also in regards to the fact that at no time did she require, seek, or obtain medical attention[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Gist entered the North Detroit General Hospital for lower back pain in April of 1979. The hospital reports indicate, however, that the back pain was brought on by Gist\u2019s helping her daughter move furniture. Radiology reports indicated \u201cmoderate degenerative arthritic changes\u201d in the lumbar spine. The general diagnosis was a \u201clow back strain.\u201d Upon discharge, Gist was said to be doing \u201cextremely well.\u201d Gist also entered the Henry Ford Hospital several times in late 1979 and early 1980. The record indicates that her first visit to the hospital was caused by her running out of her thyroid medication. A subsequent report indicated that Gist related a history of not taking her thyroid medication regularly. Gist also entered St. Michael Hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tal in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in April of 1980 for \u201cnonspecific chest discomfort and palpitations.\u201d Gist was diagnosed as having cholelithiasis (gallstones), pernicious anemia and iron deficiency anemia. Gist was given medication for the anemic condition. The hospital reports indicates that her condition on discharge was \u201cimproved\u201d and that her prognosis was \u201cgood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Gist\u2019s prior work is limited. She had worked as a kitchen helper and had also performed domestic work. Gist has an eighth grade education.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Gist\u2019s main argument on appeal is that her termination should have been evaluated under the \u201cmedical improvement\u201d standard and not under the \u201ccurrent disability\u201d standard. She argues that even though the AU stated that he found \u201csufficient medical improvement\u201d to terminate benefits, he did not actually apply this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The appropriate method of evaluating the evidence in termination cases is a matter which has sparked a great deal of litigation. <em>See, e.g., Dotson v. Schweiker, </em>719 F.2d 80 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Kuzmin v. Schweiker, </em>714 F.2d 1233 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Patti v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 582 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Cassiday v. Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 745 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Crosby v. Schweiker, </em>650 F.2d 777 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam); <em>Weber v. Harris, </em>640 F.2d 176 (8th Cir.1981); <em>Miranda v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>514 F.2d 996 (1st Cir.1975). A panel of this circuit has recently considered this question in a case involving the termination of Social Security Disability Benefits. That panel held that the Secretary is required to \u201cproduce evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition has improved, and in the absence of such evidence the claimant will be deemed to be still disabled.\u201d <em>See Haynes v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>734 F.2d 284 at 288 (6th Cir.1984). <em>Haynes, </em>however, did not involve S.S.I. benefits or a claimant who was grandfathered into the program. Only two cases have addressed the appropriate standard for termination as it applies to grandfatherees. <em>See Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>719 F.2d 595 (2d Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>724 F.2d 262 (1983); <em>Finnegan v. Matthews, </em>641 F.2d 1340 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The Ninth Circuit in <em>Finnegan </em>was faced with a problem slightly different from the one now before this court. In <em>Finnegan, </em>the Secretary argued that the prior state determination' of disability was entitled to no weight whatsoever. It argued that it could make an \u201cinitial determination\u201d on a grandfatheree\u2019s disability. <em>See </em>641 F.2d at 1343. The Ninth Circuit rejected this approach, holding that \u201cbenefits to a grandfatheree must not be terminated absent proof of a material improvement in his medical condition or of the commission of a clear and specific error during the prior state determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">In contrast to the situation in <em>Finnegan, </em>the Secretary does not now argue that the prior determination is entitled to no weight. The regulation which governs the termination of benefits of grandfatherees provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\"><em>Persons who were found disabled under a State plan. </em>If you became entitled to benefits because you were found to be disabled under a State plan, we will find that your disability ended in...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">(1) The month in which your disability, as shown by current medical or other evidence, does not meet the criteria of the appropriate state plan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-13\"><em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.994(e) (1983). Although this regulation does not clearly establish a standard for termination, the notice which accompanied its promulgation does:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">At one time we would not find that disability or blindness had stopped unless the medical evidence showed that the person\u2019s condition had <em>improved </em>since we last determined that he or she was disabled. About three years ago we changed this policy and began to find, <em>on the basis of new evidence, that the person was not disabled or blind as defined in the law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 55,566, 55,568 (Aug. 20, 1980). According to the regulations, the Secretary will not terminate a grandfatheree\u2019s benefits merely upon a reevaluation of the same evidence used in the prior determination. Rather, the Secretary relies on \u201cnew evidence\u201d to terminate a grandfatheree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Finnegan </em>is thus distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In <em>Wheeler, </em>the district court had ruled that because of the difficulty of ascertaining the state definition of disability, a grandfatheree\u2019s benefits could not be terminated absent evidence of medical improvement or clear error in the initial determination. <em>See Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>547 F.Supp. 599, 609-10 (D.Vt.1982). The Second Circuit rejected this approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">[Sjuch a standard, requiring extensive retrospective consideration of facts, is not the one Congress enacted. Instead, Congress preferred an assessment of only the grandfatheree\u2019s current condition, requiring a retrospective look only to ascertain the prior state standard in those situations where it was more beneficial to the claimant than the new federal standard. It is only the prior state standard, and not the claimant\u2019s disability status under that standard, that has been grandfathered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Wheeler, </em>719 F.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Despite the Second Circuit\u2019s apparent rejection of the district court\u2019s adoption of the <em>Finnegan </em>standard, the court later limited its holding on a petition for rehearing. The Second Circuit, in responding to the contention that the earlier ruling \u201cforecloses consideration of any role for the concept of \u2018medical improvement\u2019 in disability termination cases,\u201d stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">What sort of record will meet the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test in termination cases, whether the Secretary bears some burden of producing evidence of medical improvement after a beneficiary has presented evidence that the medical condition underlying the prior determination has continued ... and whether a burden of persuasion remains with the beneficiary are issues that were not presented and not decided on this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\"><em>Wheeler, </em>724 F.2d at 263 (citation omitted). Given this statement by the Second Circuit in denying the petition for rehearing, it is difficult to determine what <em>Wheeler </em>stands for.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">That <em>Haynes </em>did not involve grandfatherees, that <em>Finnegan </em>is also distinguishable and that <em>Wheeler </em>is a precedent of uncertain scope does not mean that we are left without guidance. On the contrary, we find <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983) dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">In <em>Campbell, </em>the Supreme Court considered an attack on the medical-vocational guidelines, more commonly known as the \u201cgrid.\u201d In upholding the Secretary\u2019s use of the grid, the Court articulated a standard of review which applies to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALd\">Where, as here, the statute expressly entrusts the Secretary with the responsibility for implementing a provision by regulation, our review is limited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">461 U.S. at \u2014, <em>Id. </em>at 1957 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">In the present case, Congress has expressly delegated the responsibility for promulgating regulations on this matter to the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(e)(1)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">The Secretary shall ... prescribe such requirements with respect to the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>applications, <em>the suspension or termination of assistance, </em>the furnishing of other data and material, <em>and the reporting of events and changes in-circumstances, </em>as may be necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this sub-chapter.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Since Congress has delegated this authority to the Secretary, our review is \u201climited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.\u201d We conclude that the regulations do not exceed the Secretary\u2019s authority and are neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The crucial statutory provision relating to grandfatherees is \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(E). It provides that a grandfatheree is entitled to benefits only \u201cso long as he is continuously disabled____\u201d The Secretary\u2019s regulations are entirely consistent with the plain language of this statutory provision. If new evidence indicates that a claimant is not currently disabled, he is necessarily not \u201ccontinuously disabled.\u201d Moreover, the Secretary\u2019s practice is particularly appropriate in light of problems specific to grandfatheree cases. In the present case, there is no record of the initial determination. The Secretary asserts that this situation is not uncommon. Were the Secretary required to show strict \u201cmedical improvement,\u201d such as the remission of a malady or its correction or amelioration through surgery or medication, Gist could never be removed from the S.S.I. program because there is no record of what her earlier condition was. That is, it would be impossible for the Secretary to demonstrate an advancement in her condition from one point to another point because it is not known what her condition was at the initial point. Allowing a claimant to receive lifetime benefits would clearly be contrary to Congress\u2019 command that a grandfatheree receive benefits only \u201cso long as he is continuously disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">Turning to the evidence presented in this case, we find that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Gist\u2019s own treating physician, Dr. Spitz, reported that her anemia, high blood pressure and thyroid condition were under control. Dr. Shapiro\u2019s report supports the conclusion that her back problem is not a severe impairment and Dr. Spitz\u2019s report says nothing to the contrary. When Gist did need hospital treatment for her back, it was brought on not simply by the severity of her affliction, but rather by her having helped her daughter move furniture. Similarly, the hospital treatment she received for her other conditions were occasioned by a need to adjust her medication. These elements of the record provide substantial evidence that Gist did not have a \u201csevere impairment\u201d under the federal standard, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c) (1983), and that, under the state standard, she was not \u201csubstantially precluded from engaging in useful occupations\u201d or \u201cunable ... to carry on the minimum activities essential to daily living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">We find no merit in Gist\u2019s contention that the sequential procedure for evaluating disability, under which no further inquiry is necessary if a claimant is determined not to have a severe impairment, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a) (1983), is improper. The requirement that an impairment be severe flows directly from the statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B). Since the severe impairment requirement is an absolute one, in that if a claimant lacks a severe impairment he can receive benefits under no conceivable set of facts, there is no need for the Secretary to consider other factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>such as age, education and vocational skills, if this crucial element is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We also conclude that the AU properly evaluated Gist\u2019s complaints of pain. Although pain may be so severe that it is disabling, <em>see Glass v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>517 F.2d 224, 225 (6th Cir.1975), the opportunity of the AU to observe the claimant and determine the credibility of her testimony as to pain should not be lightly discarded. <em>Kirk v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>667 F.2d 524, 538 (6th Cir.1981). In the present case, the AU relied on the fact that during the period that Gist claimed she was in severe pain, she was regularly traveling on a bus between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Detroit, Michigan. The AU also relied upon the fact that Gist\u2019s testimony about pain was not well supported by the medical evidence. These were permissible factors for the AU to rely upon and we find no basis for overturning his credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In conclusion, we find that the Secretary evaluated Gist\u2019s termination under the proper standards and that substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate Gist\u2019s benefits. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\">. The S.S.I. program was formerly administered by the states under financial grants from the federal government under title XIV. As of January 1, 1974, title XIV was repealed and replaced by a new title XVI, under which the federal government undertook complete responsibility for S.S.I. benefits to the disabled. <em>See </em>Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub.L.

Grandfathered claimants may, of course, maintain their entitlement to benefits by showing that they meet either the federal definition of disability contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A), (B), (C), (D), or continue to be disabled under the state plan\u2019s definition. <em>See Wheeler </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>719 F.2d 595, 597 (2d Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>724 F.2d 262 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-16\">.

It should be noted that one of the principal concerns of several of the cases which require the Secretary to show \"medical improvement\u201d in nongrandfatheree cases is that the Secretary should not be allowed to merely reevaluate the evidence used at the prior determination. <em>See, e.g., Dotson, </em>719 F.2d at 81 (the Secretary argued that it should be allowed to \"have another physician review the medical evidence that was previously held to be sufficient to support an award of benefits, and interpret that same evidence to support a later determination that the claimant's disability had ceased\u201d).
