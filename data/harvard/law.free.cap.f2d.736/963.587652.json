At the conclusion of the testimony, the Magistrate, to whom the action had been committed by agreement, submitted the cause to the jury on, so far as the appellant was concerned, three interrogatories. These interrogatories, as statements of the issues to be resolved by the jury, were apparently agreed to by the parties and were explained to the jury in the Magistrate\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The liability of the defendant West, as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, was based on an alleged violation of the constitutional prohibition against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d treatment arising out of his macing by West while confined in his prison cell. Without objection, the cause was submitted to the jury. In his jury instructions on the standard of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d to be applied by them in resolving the issue of liability in this case, the Magistrate charged the jury that the use of mace \u201cby and of itself does not establish excessive and unjustified force\u201d violative of a prisoner\u2019s constitutional right to be free of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d that \u201cthe reasonableness of its use (in the prison context) depends on the surrounding circumstances,\u201d that it \u201cmay be reasonably used to quell disorders and to compel obedience but not to punish a prisoner,\u201d and that, in determining whether the use was reasonable under the circumstances of the case, the jury should consider \u201cone, the need for the application of the force; two, the relationship between the need for force and the amount of force used; three, the extent of injury inflicted; and four, whether the force was applied in good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or was used maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d He, also, instructed the jury that, even if the defendant West had \u201cunjustifiably used ... excessive force against Plaintiff,\u201d he would not be liable if he \u201cacted in good faith and with a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of his ... actions\u201d under all the circumstances but the burden of establishing such \u201creasonable belief\u201d was an affirmative defense of which the defendant had the burden of proof. This, the Magistrate told the jury, was known as a \u201cgood faith defense,\u201d the elements of which were \u201cfirst, that the particular Defendant reasonably believed that he was acting within his lawful authority, that is, that he reasonably believed that using, authorizing, or acquiescing in the use of mace was justified under the circumstances; and second, that the particular Defendant acted in good faith on the basis of his reasonable belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">After these statements of the substantive issues of liability, the Magistrate then advised the jury on the form in which they should express their verdict. For this purpose, he submitted two interrogatories relating to the possible substantive liability of the defendant West. The first interrogatory on liability of the defendant West (interrogatory number 2) called for an answer to the question whether West had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>\u201cviolate[d] the plaintiffs constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by the use of excessive and unreasonable force against him,\u201d in the use of mace on the occasion in question. The jury was instructed that if their answer to this interrogatory was \u201cYes,\u201d then they were to go on to interrogatory number 4, which, as it related to the defendant West, involved what the Magistrate denominated as the defendant\u2019s \u201cgood-faith\u201d defense. This interrogatory inquired of the jury whether, if the defendant West had \u201cunjustifiably used, ... excessive force against ... plaintiff,\u201d had he (the defendant West) \u201cact[ed] in good faith and with a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of his actions.\u201d The jury was directed that if they found from the evidence that the defendant West had so acted, then they \u201cshould answer issue numb r four [which was the issue just quoted], \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d He added that, \u201cYou [referring to the jury] should not go on to consider issue number five [which was the damages part of the interrogatories] unless you have answered \u2018no\u2019 as to\u201d the defendant West in response to interrogatory four. The jury followed these instructions. They answered both the second and fourth interrogatories addressed to them in connection with the defendant West\u2019s possible liability \u201cYes.\u201d It necessarily followed, therefore, that under the Magistrate\u2019s instructions, the jury was not to award the plaintiff damages and such was the jury\u2019s response. Judgment was accordingly entered in favor of the defendant West and this appeal by the plaintiff followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The plaintiff on appeal argues that the Magistrate erred in submitting to the jury the issue of good-faith in the use of mace under the circumstances of this ease, and in admitting evidence in support of such defense. He, also, argues that if the good faith of the defendant West were in issue, the Magistrate should have charged the jury that the good faith defense requires the establishment not of a subjective belief in the lawfulness or reasonableness of an officer\u2019s conduct, but of an objective standard of such reasonable belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The difficulty with this argument of the plaintiff is that it was not properly raised at trial. The interrogatories submitted to the jury were, it seems clear from the colloquy between the Magistrate and counsel during discussion of the jury instructions, agreed upon by the parties. Certainly, when the interrogatories were stated and explained by the Magistrate in his instructions to the jury, there was no objection to the submission of the cause in the form of such interrogatories or to the propriety of the interrogatories as proper statements of the issues to be resolved in the case by the jury by their verdict. Under those unobjected to instructions, the jury was, as we have seen, directed to proceed no further (in effect, to make no award of damages in favor of plaintiff) if the answer to the so-called \u201cgood faith\u201d interrogatory was \u201cYes.\u201d Under these circumstances, the plaintiff is in no position to assert error in the instructions or in the ruling of the Magistrate on the interrogatories submitted by him to the jury, the answers to which were to be dispositive of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Though we consider the affirmance of the judgment below proper for the reasons already stated, the dissent would reverse. It would appear that, since the dissent raises issues not addressed by us in our exposition of our reasons for affirming the judgment below, we should comment on the reasoning of the dissent for its contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">The reasoning on which the dissent would reverse the judgment below is in the form of a syllogism consisting of three interdependent legal premises or conclusions. The first and major premise in this syllogistic exposition is that macing a prison inmate in his cell is \u201cclearly prohibited\u201d by the federal law in this circuit and is accordingly <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. Because it finds that this constitutional principle was \u201cclearly\u201d established in the federal law of this circuit at the time this action arose, the dissent postulates that the defendant \u201cshould have known that the use of tear gas under those conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment\u201d and, since he did or should have known such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>fact, the dissent concludes that \u201cas a matter of law a good faith defense was not available to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having reached this point, the dissent would find that the giving of a good faith immunity instruction, though not objected to at trial, the \u201cfailure to object [did] not preclude appellate review [and reversal because] the instruction \u2018plainly misstate[d] fundamentally controlling substantive\u2019 principles.\u201d It is thus evident that the dissent\u2019s reasoning rests entirely on the correctness of its initial major premise, that macing by the defendant of the plaintiff while the latter was locked in his cell was a constitutional violation under the clearly established law of this circuit. We accordingly address this fundamental and central thesis of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">In support of its central thesis, the dissent cites two cases, only one of which is a decision of this court, <em>Landman v. Peyton, </em>370 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 881, 87 S.Ct. 168, 17 L.Ed.2d 108, 392 U.S. 939, 88 S.Ct. 2315, 20 L.Ed.2d 1399 (1968), <em>rehearing denied, </em>393 U.S. 900, 89 S.Ct. 77, 21 L.Ed.2d 194. <em>Peyton, </em>however, is not cited, as we read the dissent, for the proposition that macing by a prison official of a prison inmate while locked in his cell is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional; the dissent summarizes the decision as merely \u201cadmonishing state prison officials] that unnecessary use of tear gas can violate the Constitution.\u201d Actually, though, <em>Peyton </em>is cited in other decisions in this circuit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and generally in other circuits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as authority for the use of tear gas or mace by prison officials for disciplinary purposes, and this construction of the decision seems the one warranted by both the facts and the result in <em>Peyton, </em>which affirmed the use of tear gas in that case. The defendant prison officials in that case were alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint to have \u201cused tear gas indiscriminately as punishment against the prison inmates.\u201d The district court had found at trial \u201cthat tear gas was used approximately 12 to 15 times in the course of a year ...\u201d against inmates. The prison regulations, as testified to by the defendant Peyton provided the prison guards with \u201cblanket authorization to use tear gas against a \u2018recalcitrant\u2019 inmate, in addition to employing it in its customary role to prevent riots and escapes.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the basis of this regulation and the record, the district court \u201cconcluded that this [i.e., the use of tear gas] was done in a legitimate exercise of disciplinary authority.\u201d This court, on appeal of the district court\u2019s decision, noted the prison regulation authorizing use of tear gas on \u201crecalcitrant\u201d inmates and contrasted it with the less permissible federal prison regulations. However, after this comparison, we affirmed the decision of the district court sustaining the use of tear gas in the prison environment against \u201crecalcitrant\u201d inmates, saying (370 F.2d at 138, n. 2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbcN\">\u201cSuperintendent Peyton testified that the guards have blanket authorization to use tear gas against a \u2018recalcitrant\u2019 inmate, in addition to employing it in its customary role to prevent riots and escapes. A written report is required only after a tear gas shell is fired. The superintendent also stated that no record is kept of the number of shells issued and no crosscheck is made to determine if reports are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>filed covering each instance that the gas is employed. By way of contrast, the use of tear gas against a single inmate in a federal prison is permitted only \u2018in most extraordinary circumstances and after approval in writing of the warden or superintendent.\u2019 U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons, Use of Tear Gas and Smoke 3 (1949). While it is our belief that the federal practice is the more enlightened, we will not disturb the finding that the use of tear gas revealed in this record did not amount to \u2018cruel and unusual punishment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">This language which is the dispositive part of the court\u2019s opinion, does not sustain in any way the dissent\u2019s basic premise; in fact, it is clearly authority for a contrary view and, as we have already observed, it has been so generally considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The other authority cited by the dissent for its <em>per se </em>rule is <em>Landman v. Royster, </em>333 F.Supp. 621, 649 (E.D.Va.1971). The dissent, quoting from this case, declares that the \u201cfederal law in this circuit clearly prohibited \u2018the use of [tear] gas to disable a man physically who poses no present physical threat.\u2019 \u201d But the quotation included in the dissent is only a few words taken out of a long sentence which itself in turn was a part of a larger and more extensive paragraph in this decision. The full paragraph of the opinion, with the words extracted therefrom in the dissent italicized, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-6\">\u201cTear gas has also been used to silence noisy, misbehaving men while confined to their cells. Thomas Jefferson was gassed three times, and others have been gassed in their cells at the penitentiary. The problem of dealing with convicts who persist in disturbing entire cell blocks and inciting others to join in the disorder is a real one. The Court has not found any instances of gassing men in cells who were not currently disruptive. Yet <em>the use of gas to disable a man physically who poses no present physical threat </em>constitutes a form of corporal punishment, the use of which in such a situation is generally disapproved. Undoubtedly it is effective, but it is painful, and its abuse is difficult to forestall. The problem appears to arise because there appears to be no way to isolate a misbehaving inmate to an area where his rantings will not disturb anyone. This difficulty is, however, one of the system\u2019s own creation. If chaining a man to his bars, punishing him with a strap, and other corporal punishment should be enjoined, <em>Jackson v. Bishop, supra </em>[404 F.2d 571] this Court cannot make a principled distinction which would permit the use of tear gas to punish or control the nonthreatening inmate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">As is seen, the full sentence from which the dissent extracted its quotation, did not \u201cclearly prohibit\u201d tear gas \u201cto disable a man physically who poses no present physical threat\u201d but declared that the use of tear gas \u201cin such a situation is <em>generally disapproved.\u201d </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added) Moreover, it recognized that control of noisy and disturbing inmates with mace was not unusual or necessarily improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">That the decision in <em>Royster </em>has not been understood as prohibiting the use of tear gas against \u201crecalcitrant\u201d prisoners while locked in their cells in this circuit is illustrated by the decisions in <em>McCargo v. Mister, </em>462 F.Supp. 813, 818 (D.Md.1978) and in <em>Greear v. Loving, </em>391 F.Supp. 1269 (W.D.Va.1975). Thus, in <em>McCargo </em>the court said at p. 818:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-11\">\u201cThe use of tear gas against inmates in their cells is not per se a cruel and unusual punishment. In the landmark case of <em>Landman v. Royster, </em>333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971), Judge Merhige noted that \u2018[t]ear gas has also been used to silence noisy, misbehaving men while confined to their cells;\u2019 however, in a situation where tear gas was used to punish or control a non-threatening inmate, the court concluded that such use was \u2018generally disapproved.\u2019 333 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>F.Supp. at 649. Similarly, in <em>Greear v. Loving, </em>391 F.Supp. 1269 (W.D.Va.1975), <em>vacated, </em>538 F.2d 578 (4th Cir.1976), the court remarked that \u2018the use of tear gas is not forbidden in all instances but only when there appears to be no. necessity for its use,\u2019 and went on to \u2018emphasize the close scrutiny with which it considers the use of tear gas in correctional facilities.\u2019 391 F.Supp. at 1271.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Perhaps more illuminative on this circuit\u2019s rule with respect to the use of tear gas than <em>McCargo </em>or <em>Royster </em>is the decision on appeal in <em>Greear v. Loving, </em>538 F.2d 578 (4th Cir.1976). The prisoner in that case had been gassed while locked in his cell. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison official. In so doing, it cited <em>Landman v. Royster. </em>On appeal, we reversed, finding the case not appropriate for summary judgment because of disputed facts but emphasizing that we were \u201cdecid[ing] nothing concerning the merits of Greear\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580. In the opinion, we outlined the differences in the testimony which caused the court to reverse the summary judgment. For the purposes of this case, though, the important feature of the ease is that the court did not hold that it was unconstitutional <em>per se </em>to use tear gas on a prisoner locked in his cell in order to quiet and control him, which it should have done if the \u201cclear\u201d rule of this circuit were as the dissent suggests; the court rather remanded the case for a jury to determine whether the use was illegal under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\"><em>Greear </em>illustrates the correct rule in this context. That rule is not one of a <em>per se </em>rule of unconstitutionality but a rule that looks to the totality of the circumstances, the provocation, the amount of gas used, and the purposes for which the gas was used, in determining the validity of the use of tear gas in the prison environment. As Judge Merhige in <em>Royster </em>observed, \u201c[t]he problem of dealing with convicts who persist in disturbing entire cell blocks and inciting others to join in the disorder is a real one.\u201d Most of the cases have held that, provided the quantity of gas used is graduated by the gravity of the occasion, gassing is not violative of constitutional rights. This was the ruling of the Court of Appeals in <em>Spain v. Procunier, </em>600 F.2d 189 (9th Cir.1979), modifying the opinion in 408 F.Supp. 534 on which <em>McCargo </em>relied. There the court laid down this rule on the use of tear gas by prison officials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-9\">\u201cIf then the tear gas is used in dangerous quantities, we agree with the district court that its use is justified only in those grave circumstances which would justify the use of severe and potentially lethal force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-10\">\u201cWe think the record further indicates, however, that use of the substance in small amounts may be a necessary prison technique if a prisoner refuses after adequate warning to move from a cell or upon other provocation presenting a reasonable possibility that slight force will be required. In these circumstances the substance may be a legitimate means for preventing small disturbances from becoming dangerous to other inmates or prison personnel____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-11\">\u201c... We agree with the trial court that use of potentially dangerous quantities of the substance is justified only under narrowly defined circumstances, but we further conclude that use of nondangerous quantities of the substance in order to prevent a perceived future danger does not violate \u2018evolving standards of decency\u2019 or constitute an \u2018unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>and wanton infliction of pain.\u2019 \u201d 600 F.2d at 195-96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The lower court in this case followed the rule stated in <em>Spain </em>in its instructions to the jury. Thus, it said in these instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-6\">\u201cThe use of a chemical restraint such as mace by and of itself does not establish excessive and unjustified force. As in every instance where force is employed, the reasonableness of its use depends on the surrounding circumstances. Chemical agents should not be indiscriminately employed so you should consider the amount, frequency, purpose of use in determining whether the macing constitutes excessive force. Mace may b\u00e9 reasonably used to quell disorders and to compel obedience but not to punish a prisoner. In deciding whether the force employed by a particular defendant was unjustified, excessive and unreasonable, you should keep in mind that the Defendants\u2019 actions took place in an environment different from the quiet of the courtroom, that they occurred within the confines of a prison where it was the Defendants\u2019 duty to maintain order and discipline, and [in] such an environment \u2014 not every use of force is a constitutional violation but only that use of force which shocks a reasonable person\u2019s conscience because it is unjustified, excessive and unreasonable. Factors which you should consider in deciding whether such force was used against Plaintiff include, but are not limited to, one, the need for the application of the force; two, the relationship between the need for force and the amount of force used; three, the extent of injury inflicted; and four, whether the force was applied in good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or was used maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">In so directing the jury the lower court was not only following what appeared to be the rule of this circuit as we read <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Greear </em>in particular,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that of most of the other circuits. <em>See for instance: Lock v. Jenkins, </em>641 F.2d 488, 496 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Stringer v. Rowe, </em>616 F.2d 993, 998 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Poindexter v. Woodson, </em>510 F.2d 464, 466 (10th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 846, 96 S.Ct. 85, 46 L.Ed.2d 68; <em>Clemmons v. Greggs, </em>509 F.2d at 1340 (\u201c[t]he use of tear gas when reasonably necessary to prevent riots or escapes or to subdue recalcitrant prisoners does not constitute cruel and inhuman punishment,\u201d citing <em>Landman v. Peyton, </em>370 F.2d 135; <em>Bethea v. Crouse, </em>417 F.2d 504, 509 (10th Cir.1969); <em>Breece v. Swenson, </em>332 F.Supp. 837, 840 (W.D.Mo.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">We think the above review both of the authorities of this circuit as well as of other circuits makes it abundantly clear that the use of mace on an unruly or \u201crecalcitrant\u201d prison inmate, though confined in his cell, is not plainly <em>per se </em>unconstitutional and thus the rule for denying to the defendant in this case the defense of good faith immunity is not present [i.e., the unconstitutionality of the defendant\u2019s conduct was so clearly established that the defendant should have known his conduct was illegal].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Whether it was constitutional or not depended on whether the jury believed the defendant or the plaintiff. \u2019 The defendant testified he alone used mace and then only in a single burst for a second or two. The plaintiff, on the other hand, testified he was gassed continuously by three or four guards, of whom the defendant was one, for several minutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the <em>Spain </em>rule and that included in the lower court\u2019s jury instruction in this case the jury, if it believed the defendant that the intrusion was as minor as the defendant said, it should have found for the defendant; if on the other hand, it believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the jury should have found for the plaintiff. The jury resolved this point in favor of the defendant and it is not our function to reverse that finding. Even if this were not true, though, we are not convinced that the clear error exception to the mandate of Rule 51, Fed.R.Civ.P. is properly invoked under the circumstances of this ease. <em>Morris v. Travisono, </em>528 F.2d at 858, we think, supports conclusively a conclusion contrary to that reached in the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">The plaintiffs-prisoners in <em>Morris </em>sued the prison officials, contending that \u201cthe use of tear gas to punish nonthreatening prisoners constituted cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d redressable under \u00a7 1983. In submitting the cause to the jury, the district judge had given this instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\">\u201c \u2018[I]f you find that the plaintiffs were gassed while locked in their cells and at the time of the gassing posed no substantial and immediate physical threat to themselves, other prisoners or to the security of the institution or to the correctional officers but rather the plaintiffs were gassed <em>for the mere purpose of punishing them, </em>then you must find for the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in text)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">The verdict of the jury was in favor of the plaintiffs-prisoners. On appeal, the defendants argued that the instruction as given in its definition of cruel and unusual punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>ment had used \u201ca harsher legal standard than that established by precedent\u201d where the charge of cruel and unusual punishment consisted of the use of tear gas on a prisoner locked in his cell. The court recognized that the challenged instruction was \u201copen to attack as lowering the threshold of cruel and unusual punishment to a level that cannot be said to represent a well-settled principle of constitutional law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. The court, however, said it was unnecessary to reach that \u201cserious question of substantive law\u201d because of \u201cthe failure of defendants to object clearly and specifically to the district court\u2019s instructions before the jury retired to consider its verdict, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859. The court proceeded to emphasize that \u201cRule 51 is of considerable importance for the orderly and just functioning of the judicial system\u201d and that [quoting 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2558, at 675 (1971) ], \u201c \u2018If there is to be a plain error exception to Rule 51 at all, it should be confined to the exceptional case where the error has seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d It concluded that this was not such a case and affirmed the judgment entered on the verdict. We agree with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">For the reasons stated, we feel that the rationale of the dissent cannot be sustained. To repeat: First, its primary premise that the clearly settled law of this circuit is that a gassing of a prison inmate in his cell is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional is an untenable assumption, not supported by the decisions of this circuit. Since this is so, it cannot be said that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that his action in gassing the plaintiff was unconstitutional and, therefore, under <em>Harlow, </em>the defendant was entitled, as the magistrate without objection instructed the jury, to a good-faith defense. It follows, therefore, that the instructions of the magistrate were proper but, even if not proper, the plaintiff, who was represented by able and experienced counsel, waived any objections to such instructions by failure to object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">. This action was originally instituted on behalf of ten or twelve state prisoners against a number of defendants, who were officials and employees of the Department of Correction. It was later converted into a class action on behalf of the original plaintiffs by an amended complaint. Prior to trial, however, the actions on behalf of all plaintiffs, other than Bailey and Linder, were dismissed for failure to prosecute. At trial of the actions on behalf of Bailey and Linder, the jury verdict was in favor of the defendants. Both Bailey and Linder gave notice of appeal but Linder failed to perfect his appeal. The only plaintiff before the Court on this appeal is Bailey. Moreover, while the plaintiffs listed as defendants Lieutenant West, who had used the mace in this case, and other officials and employees of the Department of Correction, the jury exonerated each of the defendants of any liability and the plaintiff has not appealed the judgment in favor of these defendants. Accordingly, this appeal involves only Bailey, as plaintiff/appellant, and West as defendant/appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">. <em>See Harlow v.

The dissent seems to shift somewhat from the argument that macing of a prison inmate while locked in his cell is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional to one that, in this instance, it was unreasonable and unnecessary for the defendant to have used mace. To support this, the dissent quotes a short excerpt at the end of the cross-examination of the defendant. Such excerpt from the defendant's testimony, however, cannot be understood except in the context under which the testimony was given. The defendant was being cross-examined by plaintiff's counsel on what steps he was permitted under the North Carolina statute \u201cto stop a prison inmate from talking loudly and using swear words.\u201d Specifically, the defendant was asked whether he was \"saying, ... that the statute only allows macing\u201d in such a situation. After the defendant answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>this question in the negative, the defendant was asked, \"[w]hat other things besides the use of mace [could be used under the statute.]\u201d The defendant responded that, \u201d[i]t depends on who is using the force.\u201d The cross-examiner came back immediately with the same question he had previously addressed to the defendant: \"... aren't you saying that the only thing that the statute allows you to do is to use mace.\u201d When this question was again answered in the negative, the cross-examiner demanded to know from the defendant, \u201cwhat ... other than the use of mace then- that the statute allows you to do when confronted with the situation of an inmate talking loudly and using curse words directed at the prison guards.\u201d The defendant responded by identifying certain other steps the statute would permit. But \u2014 and this is the important fact \u2014 the defendant was never asked whether it was more reasonable and less likely to result in injury to the plaintiff to use any of the other methods than to use a small amount of mace. This was a question that the defendant had already been asked and answered earlier in his testimony. He had only mace with him at the time the plaintiff was gassed to maintain order and discipline in the prison to which those prisoners who had been unruly and proved difficult to control were assigned. He did have a riot baton but he did not have it with him. He testified that there was a real danger that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct would incite other prisoners to join in and that the prisoners would begin to destroy property and create chaos in the prison. The defendant and another guard testified to the likelihood of such a condition developing. He also, testified why, in his opinion, the use of a limited amount of mace as a deterrent was better than going into the plaintiff's cell with force such as a \"billy\u201d or a riot baton. It is plain, then, that the witness gave a reason why he had preferred the use of mace to any form of force. Whether his reason was sound or tenable was a question for the jury and the jury resolved that question in favor of the defendant and, again, it is not our province to second-guess the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">. The plaintiff's testimony was that the gas was sprayed through what he described as a \"little bitty crackhole\" in the window to his cell. Because of the smallness of this \"crack\u201d he was unable to see the three or four guards spraying mace into his cell, according to the plaintiff. However, it is difficult to understand how three of four people could have been <em>contemporaneously </em>spraying mace into his cell through this \"little bitty crackhole\". On the other hand, the defendant testified he was the only one to spray mace into the cell and that he did it in a single short \"burst\u201d of no more than one or two seconds. He also said that, had he wanted, he could not have continued because the plaintiff, who controlled the window through which the mace was sprayed, closed the window. Under these facts, it is not difficult to understand the manner in which the jury resolved the conflict between the two versions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1044-8\">ERVIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5j\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">I cannot agree that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to object to the lower court\u2019s jury charge precludes him from asserting error on appeal. In my view, an objection was not necessary because the lower court committed plain error when it submitted an instruction on good faith to the jury. For this reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">In <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), the Supreme Court firmly established that a good faith defense is not applicable if a state or federal official \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate ... constitutional rights____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 95 S.Ct. at 1001. Since <em>Wood </em>was decided, the Supreme Court has twice reaffirmed this aspect of the good faith standard, emphasizing both the subjective and objective elements of the test. <em>See Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">From my reading of the record I remain unconvinced that defendant West survives either prong of the test. In 1974, when the macing occurred, the eighth amendment unquestionably protected prison inmates from the unjustified and excessive use of force by prison officials. <em>Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878); <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1909); <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis v.

Royster, </em>333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971). The same protection was provided under North Carolina law. See N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 148-20 (prohibiting corporal punishment); see also <em>Threatt v. North Carolina, </em>221 F.Supp. 858 (W.D.N.C.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">In 1974 it was also clear that this prohibition against excessive force applied to the use of tear gas. The leading cases in this circuit stated then, and still state now, that where the actions of a prisoner pose no danger to the safety of guards, or other prisoners, or to the general security of the prison, and where there is no need to move physically a recalcitrant prisoner, the use of tear gas on inmates constitutes a form of corporal punishment that violates the eighth amendment. <em>Landman v. Royster, </em>333 F.Supp. 621, 649 (E.D.Va.1971) (\u201cIf chaining a man to his bars, punishing him with a strap, and other corporal punishment should be enjoined, <em>Jackson v. Bishop, supra, </em>404 F.2d 571, this court cannot make a principled distinction which would permit the use of tear gas to punish or control the non-threatening inmate.\u201d) <em>See also Landman v. Payton, </em>370 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.1966); <em>McCargo v. Mister, </em>462 F.Supp. 813, (D.Md.1978); <em>Greear v. Loving, </em>391 F.Supp. 1269 (W.D.Va.1975). Since 1974 we have reaffirmed our opposition to the use of excessive force on several occasions. <em>Slakan v. Porter, </em>737 F.2d 368, (4th Cir.1984); (prohibiting excessive use of billy clubs, tear gas, or high pressure hoses); <em>Pritchard v. Perry, </em>508 F.2d 423, 425-26 (4th Cir.1975); <em>see also Bruce v. Wade, </em>537 F.2d 850 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028 (2d Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 913, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">This is not to say that the use of tear gas is unconstitutional <em>per se. </em>We have held that under the proper circumstances, the use of tear gas in moderation can be an effective and acceptable means of inmate control.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record in this case, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>reveals that West\u2019s use of mace was unnecessary and abusive. Bailey was incarcerated in a one-person cell in a building with only four cells. His sole offense consisted of making profane remarks to a prison guard. I do not believe that Bailey could have posed a danger to the personal safety of West, other inmates, or the general security of the prison. Notwithstanding West\u2019s self-serving testimony about the need to guard against a riot, this was not a situation where the density of the prison population made it either possible or likely that an abusive remark would spark a general disturbance or an uprising. <em>Cf. Clemmons v. Greggs, </em>509 F.2d 1338 (1975) (use of gas sanctioned where near-riot conditions prevailed in heavily populated cell block). West himself could not have been in physical danger because he had no reason to enter Bailey\u2019s cell and the incident involved only an exchange of words. There was no evidence in the record to indicate that Bailey had damaged the cell or was inflicting injury on himself, and there was no danger to other prisoners because Bailey was in a single-person cell. Immediate incapacitation of the prisoner was simply not required. <em>Cf. Greear v. Loving, </em>538 F.2d 578 (1976) (gas needed to stop prisoner from setting fire to his mattress and destroying the plumbing in the cell).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Regardless of whose testimony one believes, the record paints a vivid picture of gross over-reaction to a relatively minor offense. Prisoners are often unruly and insubordinate. In some instances punishments are required. In this case, however, what little disruption Bailey\u2019s comments might have posed to the peace of the prison could have been handled by removing Bailey to another cell, ignoring the comments entirely, or threatening the prisoner with a milder form of non-corporal punishment. In short, the macing amounted to a gratuitous infliction of bodily injury. The majority appears to forget that the price Bailey paid for his cursing went beyond temporary discomfort; Bailey has permanently lost part of his sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">In sanctioning the use of tear gas under certain aggravated circumstances, this court never intended for gas to be used routinely to discipline prisoners who stray from the letter of the prison code. Were gas to be used in this manner, it would cease to be a means of inmate control and would become a form of corporal punishment to be dispensed at the discretion of prison guards. As this court recognized in <em>Landman v. Peyton, </em>370 F.2d 135 (1966), absolute power is corrupting, whether it lies in the hands of prison guards, or other men. <em>Id. </em>at 140. It is the responsibility of the courts to ensure that unnecessarily violent prison practices do not pass unchecked. Although prison officials must have some discretion over the application of punitive measures to protect themselves and other inmates, carte blanche use of tear gas has never been, and should never be, included in those protective or disciplinary measures. Were we to permit such a practice the door would be opened to routine infliction of excessive and unnecessary corporal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">However difficult it may be in some instances to draw the line between punishment and legitimate use, there is little question in my mind but that the line was crossed here. This case involves none of the exigent circumstances that we have relied on in the past to justify the use of tear gas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view, therefore, West\u2019s actions violated clearly established case law prohibiting the use of excessive force. The constitutionality of West\u2019s response was not a matter for the jury to decide. West reasonably should have known that under these circumstances the use of mace violated Bailey\u2019s constitutional rights, and thus I believe West was not entitled under <em>Harlow </em>to a good faith immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">In addition to my concern over West\u2019s ability to satisfy the objective prong of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number><em>Harlow </em>standard, I do not believe West can meet the subjective element of the test. Although West claimed statutory authority under North Carolina law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to use mace on Bailey, he testified that he knew prison policy required the least degree of force necessary to enforce discipline. West conceded that he knew he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to use mace\u201d on Bailey, and even went so far as to enumerate other, less harsh, measures he could have taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">I conclude, therefore, that as a matter of law a good faith defense was not available to the defendant. The lower court erred in failing to instruct the jury accordingly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The majority correctly points out that plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not object to the court\u2019s instructions on good faith after they were read to the jury. This court has repeatedly held, however, that failure to object need not preclude appellate review if the instruction \u201cplainly misstates fundamentally controlling substantive principles\u201d, <em>Miller v. Premier Corp., </em>608 F.2d 973, 983 (4th Cir.1979), and thereby prejudices the verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">In my view the court\u2019s decision to tender instructions on good faith amounted to a misstatement of fundamental principles. It matters little whether a court charges incorrectly on legal principles that should be tendered, or charges correctly on principles that should not be presented to the jury;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in either event the law applicable to the case at hand has been mistated. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>although the court here did not actually m\u00edstate a <em>required </em>element, <em>Miller </em>still applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">There is little question but that the lower court\u2019s error was prejudicial. Because the jury rendered a special verdict, we know as a matter of record that the jury found defendant West guilty of violating the plaintiff\u2019s eighth amendment rights, yet immune from damages under the good faith defense. The court\u2019s decision to instruct on \u201cgood faith\u201d, therefore, effectively denied the plaintiff damages he should have received. Clearly, then, both parts of the plain error standard \u2014 \u201cplain misstatement\u201d and prejudice \u2014 have been satisfied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8Hr\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"A9y\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the ruling of the lower court and remand for a determination of damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">. The majority\u2019s lengthy discussion about the existence of a <em>per se </em>rule misconstrues the nature of my argument. There is no question but that in certain instances it is constitutional to use tear gas to control prisoners. What the majority fails to perceive, however, is that excessive or unjustified use of gas to punish or control non-threatening and non-recalcitrant prisoners is <em>not </em>constitutional. Under these circumstances, macing becomes a form of corporal punishment that is indistinguishable from the use of straps found to violate the eighth amendment in <em>Jackson v. Bishop, </em>404 F.2d 571 (8th Cir.1968), or from the type of beating with billy clubs and high pressure hoses that this court recently prohibited in <em>Slakan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8eg\">None of the cases cited by the majority refute this basic proposition. Indeed, in all the cases principally relied on by the <em>majority </em>\u2014 Royster, <em>Peyton, Spain, Greear, </em>and <em>McCargo, </em>\u2014 the court specifically concluded that under the circumstances tear gas was necessary to maintain order or prevent physical harm to persons and property. Admittedly, in some of these cases the prisoners gassed were, like Bailey, securely confined in their cells. But unlike Bailey, there was reason to believe that these prisoners would incite others to riot or inflict injury on themselves or property within the cell. As discussed <em>infra, </em>there simply was no reason to believe that a riot would or could develop in the building Bailey was confined in, and there was no evidence in the record to indicate that Bailey was inflicting injury on himself or damaging the cell. Had the <em>Royster </em>or <em>Peyton </em>courts, for example, concluded that the prisoner posed no danger of injury or incitement to riot, the gassing in those instances would have been found violative of the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">The majority also misses the mark in its presentation of <em>Royster. </em>The court relies on one sentence from Judge Merhige\u2019s opinion for the proposition that the use of gas to disable a man \"who poses no present physical threat is generally disapproved,\u201d but not unconstitutional. <em>Royster, supra, </em>at 649. When read in context, however, Judge Merhige\u2019s opinion makes clear that when used to punish or control a nonthreatening inmate, the use of tear gas is indistinguishable from the type of corporal punishment that the eighth circuit found unconstitutional in <em>Jackson, supra. </em>Moreover, at the beginning of the paragraph, Judge Merhige states that the type of activity for which gas can be used is that where convicts \u201cpersist in disturbing entire cell blocks and [incite] others to join in the disorder.\u201d <em>Royster </em>at 645. The court specifically goes on to note that in this case it \"has not found any instances of gassing men in cells who were not currently disruptive. <em>Royster </em>at 649. Read in its entirety, I find little in the opinion to undermine the proposition that the use of tear gas against a non-threatening inmate is cruel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>and unusual punishment. To the contrary, I believe <em>Royster </em>affirmatively supports this position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">.

If you find that a particular Defendant or Defendants unlawfully used or authorized or acquiesced in the use of excessive force against one or both of the Defendants, but that he is or they acted in good faith and with a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of his or their actions, then you should answer issue number four \"yes\" as to that particular Defendant or Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-24\">This instruction does not accurately reflect the <em>Wood v. Strickland </em>standard. Although the court at one point (not excerpted supra) does use the phrase \"knew or should have known,\" the instruction places too much emphasis on the subjective element of the <em>Wood </em>test. As written, the charge dilutes the objective element of the <em>Wood </em>test from \"should have known\u201d to \"reasonable belief in the lawfulness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s action, thereby improperly incorporating subjective elements into the objective prong of the test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1047-25\"><em>.

The majority relies on <em>Morris v.

The First Circuit is certainly entitled to its interpretation of Rule 51, but the standard we are required to follow is that set out in <em>Miller, supra. </em>As discussed <em>supra, </em>I believe that the facts of this case unequivocally satisfy the <em>Miller </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
