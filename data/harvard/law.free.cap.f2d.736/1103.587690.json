On appeal, Smith contends that the district court erred in refusing to allow expert witness testimony about the reliability of eyewitness identification. Upon consideration of this perplexing legal question, we are unable to find that the district court committed reversible error in excluding that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-25\">On July 22, 1982, two armed men entered the Arcanum branch of the Second National Bank of Greenville in Arcanum, Ohio. Two tellers and the branch manager were in the bank. One of the men announced a robbery and instructed the employees to lie face down on the floor. Teller Diane Flory was able to observe one of the men for two to three minutes as he grabbed her. Teller Suzanne Anderson was able to observe the men for almost four minutes. Linda Newbaur, the bank\u2019s manager, was forced by the \u201cshorter robber\u201d to enter the vault and to lie face down. When the man tried to remove her rings, Newbaur observed that he was not wearing gloves. After they were unable to open the time-delay vault, the robbers fled on foot. The three women could not see the fleeing men through the windows of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-26\">After the robbery, Deputy Sheriff Toby Spencer took a palm print from the counter of a middle teller station, where the two men had vaulted. F.B.I. fingerprint exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>iner Benjamin Moore examined the print and concluded that it belonged to appellant Smith. The employees also gave the police descriptions of the men. About three weeks after the robbery, the employees were shown a photo-spread of six photos. One of the photos was of Smith and another was of Marcellus Edwards, who has since been convicted of this robbery. Manager Newbaur identified Edwards. Not one of the employees, however, could identify appellant Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">On November 19, 1982, nearly four months later, the FBI requested that three employees view a line-up. At the line-up, all three women identified Smith. The grand jury indicted Smith on February 15, 1983. After a trial before Judge Walter Rice, the jury returned a guilty verdict and Smith was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">At trial, the government\u2019s case consisted of the employees\u2019 eyewitness testimony and the fingerprint expert\u2019s testimony. In his defense, Smith testified that he had never been to Arcanum, Ohio and that he had no knowledge of the robbery. Smith\u2019s 13-year old niece testified that she ate breakfast with him at the time of the robbery. Venita Faircloth remembered breakfast because Smith gave her a \u201ccrumpled ten-dollar bill\u201d as a birthday present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">The defense also sought to introduce the testimony of psychologist Solomon M. Fulero as an expert in the field of eyewitness identification in order to rebut the eyewitness\u2019 testimony. Out of the presence of the jury, the district judge heard arguments and proffers on the admissibility of Fulero\u2019s testimony. The government conceded that Fulero was an expert, but the district court ruled that the testimony was inadmissable pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 403. The district court\u2019s decision to exclude that testimony is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">In <em>United States v. Green, </em>548 F.2d 1261 (6th Cir.1977), this Court adopted four criteria for review of trial court decisions involving expert testimony: (1) qualified expert, (2) proper subject, (3) conformity to a generally accepted explanatory theory, and (4) probative value compared to prejudicial effect. <em>See also United States v. Brown, </em>557 F.2d 541 (6th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">The government concedes that Dr. Fulero is an expert. We must first decide, then, whether his testimony involved a \u201cproper subject.\u201d The district judge found that Fulero\u2019s testimony was not a \u201cproper subject\u201d because it \u201cwould not assist the jury in determining the facts at issue.\u201d Federal Rule of Evidence 702 allows the admission of such testimony where it \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d A \u201cproper subject\u201d therefore is one that <em>assists </em>the trier of fact. The advisory committee notes to Rule 702 state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANvu\">There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in that dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">In keeping with this test, the district court concluded that \u201cthe preferred testimony would not assist the jury in determining the facts at issue.\u201d Dr. Fulero\u2019s testimony would have provided insight into an eyewitnesses\u2019 general inability to perceive and remember what is seen under a stressful situation. Smith argues that such insight is not within the \u201ccommon sense\u201d of the jury; indeed, it explodes common myths about an individual\u2019s capacity for perception under stress. The district court, however, concluded that the \u201cjury is fully capable of assessing the eyewitnesses\u2019 ability to perceive and remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">That conclusion is consistent with the First Circuit\u2019s treatment of the \u201cproper subject\u201d standard in <em>United States v. Fosher, </em>590 F.2d 381 (1st Cir.1979). In that case, the Court was confronted with the identical situation and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al0\">Admittedly, lay jurors may not have the best possible knowledge of the organic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>and behavioral mechanisms of perception and memory. But to be a proper subject of expert testimony, proof offered to add to their knowledge must present them with a system of analysis that the Court, in its discretion, can find reasonably likely to add to common understanding of the particular issue before the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ani\"><em>Fosher, </em>590 F.2d at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The case before us is, however, distinguishable from <em>Fosher </em>in significant respects. In <em>Fosher, </em>the defendant\u2019s proffer \u201cdid \u25a0 not make clear the relationship between the scientific evidence offered and the specific testimony of the eyewitnesses. Bather, the offer proclaimed that the expert will not comment at all ... on the testimony of any named witness.\u201d Dr. Fulero, by contrast, offered proof, based upon the <em>facts </em>of this case. (Tr. pp. 99-105). In his proffer, Dr. Fulero analyzed the reliability of eyewitness identification in a hypothetical factual situation identical to this case. In the hypothetical, three witnesses were shown a line-up containing the defendant and four months later they were shown a photospread containing the same defendant. The defendant was the only \u201ccommon\u201d element in each showing. Dr. Fulero offered that the later line-up was not \u201cindependent\u201d of the earlier photospread and that the eyewitnesses \u201cincorrectly transferred\u201d the \u201cfamiliar\u201d figure from one procedure to the next. What they identified was the picture of the defendant at the earlier photospread, not the figure of him at the bank. Such testimony might have been relevant to the exact <em>facts </em>before the court and not only might have <em>assisted </em>the jury, but might have refuted their otherwise common assumptions about the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Dr. Fulero also might have provided insight outside the jury\u2019s \u201cken\u201d about the possibility of cross-racial misidentification. The bank robbers in this case were two black males, while the eyewitnesses were three white females. Manager Newbauer testified that few black families live in Arcanum and that \u201cit is unusual for black customers to come to the bank.\u201d In this situation, Dr. Fulero testified, the reliability of eyewitness identification would be minimized. He also stated that the existence at the bank of a weapon and stress would decrease the possibility of proper identification. The proffer in this case, therefore, demonstrated that Dr. Fulero\u2019s testimony may have assisted the factfinder understand the <em>facts of this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The district judge concluded, in addition, that a sufficient proffer had not been made to show that Dr. Fulero\u2019s research \u201cis a Science containing enough of a degree of exactness or exactitude to render his opinion admissible.\u201d Dr. Fulero testified, however, that the American Psychological Association developed a sub-field in the area of eyewitness identification and that his discipline contains the exactness, methodology and reliability of any psychological research. Further, Dr. Fulero and another expert in the field, Dr. Loftus, have appeared as experts in over 60 criminal cases. Indeed, the government never contested Fulero\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">The Government again relies upon <em>Fosher </em>for the exclusion of such testimony. In <em>Fosher, </em>the Court found that the district court could have concluded in 1979 that the level of reliability of the expert testimony had not surpassed the quality of common sense evaluation. 590 F.2d at 383. Four years later, Dr. Fulero\u2019s science has gained reliability. Moreover, his testimony would not only \u201csurpass\u201d common-sense evaluation, it would question common-sense evaluation. This Circuit has been particularly mindful of the dangers of misperception in criminal cases and has itself relied upon psychological studies of the problems of misidentification and suggestion. In <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>714 F.2d 664, 667, this Court relied upon psychological studies for the proposition that the danger of misidentification \u201cis inherent in every identification.\u201d <em>Citing, United States v. Russell, </em>532 F.2d 1063 (6th Cir.1976). We concluded that \u201ccourts should be especially vigilent to make certain that there is no further distortion.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>532 F.2d at 1066. We reached that conclusion in <em>Russell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>based upon the scientific research of Buckhout in \u201cEyewitness Testimony,\u201d 231 <em>Scientific American </em>23 (Dec. 1974). In summarizing and adopting Buckhout\u2019s findings, the <em>Russell </em>Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-5\">Witnesses focus on gross or salient characteristics of any sensory experience, and fill in the details, not according to the observed facts of the experience, but according to some previously internalized pattern they associate with the perceived gross characteristics. In addition, the construction of memory is greatly influenced by post-experience suggestion. Suggestions compatible with the witness\u2019 internalized sterotype are likely to become part of the witness\u2019 memory, not because they are in fact similar to the actual experience, but because they fit the preconceived stereotype.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">532 F.2d at 1066. The day may have arrived, therefore, when Dr. Fulero's testimony can be said to conform to a generally accepted explanatory theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">The final <em>Green </em>test requires the reviewing court to balance the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect. This balancing is identical to the Rule 403 balancing. In this Circuit, evidence may be excluded pursuant to Rule 403 only where its relevance is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Hans, </em>684 F.2d 343 (6th Cir.1982). In <em>United States v. Brady, </em>595 F.2d 359 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 862, 100 S.Ct. 129, 62 L.Ed.2d 84 (1979), this Court stated that in reviewing a 403 balancing, the court \u201cmust look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the proponent, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its prejudicial effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">The \u201crelevance\u201d of Dr. Fulero\u2019s testimony may have been established in his proffer that it would involve a \u201cproper subject.\u201d The prejudice envisioned by Rules 403 and 702 is prejudice to a criminal defendant. Our decision in <em>United States v. Green, </em>which initially established the four-factor test for expert testimony, involved the <em>government\u2019s </em>offer of proof. The rigidity of the factors ensures that the <em>defendant </em>will receive a fair trial. In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>557 F.2d 541 (6th Cir.1977), this Court observed that the clear trend in federal courts is toward admission of expert testimony whenever it will aid the trier of fact, but warned that \u201ca strong countervailing restraint on the admission of expert testimony is the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d That \u201ccountervailing restraint\u201d is not present in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">Moreover, in <em>Mannino v. International Manufacturing Co., </em>650 F.2d 846 (6th Cir.1981), we held that an \u201cappellate court will not hesitate to step in\u201d where it can be shown that the trial court erred in <em>excluding </em>expert testimony. In that case, we also warned that the requirements of Rule 702 are \u201cbroadly phrased, and an expert is viewed not in a narrow sense, but very broadly.\u201d 650 F.2d at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">In the case before us, however, we \u201chesitate to step in\u201d because even if it were error to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony, such error was \u201charmless\u201d to the defendant. <em>See Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 135, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2916, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). The government presented <em>three </em>eyewitnesses who identified <em>Smith </em>as the bank robber. The government also presented uncontroverted evidence that Smith\u2019s palmprint was found at the bank. The expert testimony would have done little to discredit the testimony of three eyewitnesses, each of whom independently identified Smith at a line-up. More significantly, however, the existence of Smith\u2019s palm print at the Arcanum bank by itself wholly discredited his alibi defense. Smith\u2019s trial defense was that he had never in his entire life been in the robbed bank. Evidence of his palm print found at the bank flies directly in the face of his alibi defense. The exclusion of Dr. Fulero\u2019s testimony under the particular facts of this case, therefore, was not \u201cprejudicial\u201d to the defendant. We can not conclude that \u201cit is more probable than not the [exclusion] affected the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Rasheed, </em>663 F.2d 843 (9th Cir.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1157, 102 S.Ct. 1031, 71 L.Ed.2d 315 (1982). Although we find that Dr. Fulero\u2019s expert testimony may have involved a \u201cproper subject,\u201d conformed to a \u201cgenerally accepted explanatory theory\u201d and provided \u201cprobative value,\u201d we conclude that its exclusion in this particular case, therefore, did not \u201cprejudice\u201d the defendant to the extent of affecting the verdict and therefore was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1180-5\">GEORGE CLIFTON EDWARDS, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">I concur in \u25a0 the result reached by The Court in this case. I do not, however, agree that the trial judge was in error in excluding the proffered testimony of an expert witness offered by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">Inspection of the photograph display from which no witness made any identification, and the photograph of the show-up from which three eyewitnesses made identification of the appellant, does not in my view lend support to the proposed assertion that exposure of the witnesses to photographs of six men of generally similar facial characteristics preconditioned the witness toward mistaken identification of appellant at the line-up so as to make them \u201cunreliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">I am aware that eyewitness identification in violent crime situations, and perhaps particularly in cross-racial crimes, presents possibilities of mistaken identification as to which an expert witness with the qualifications of Dr. Fulero could appropriately caution a jury. Three or four separate characterizations of these three eyewitnesses as \u201cunreliable,\u201d however, appears to me (as it must have to the trial judge) to be such overstatement as to be of dubious assistance to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">Recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence have certainly made expert testimony more acceptable in federal trials. For example, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-10\">Rule 702. Testimony by Experts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-11\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">I do not, however, believe that Rule 702 has eliminated trial judge discretion. On that assumption, I would hold that Judge Rice\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Fulero\u2019s proffered evidence was not an abuse of judicial discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
