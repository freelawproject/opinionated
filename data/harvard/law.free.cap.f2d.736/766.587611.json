Plaintiff-appellant Iris N. McKinney, a GS-13 Budget Analyst in the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d), commenced a civil action against defendant-appellee Charles A. Whitfield, her second-line job supervisor; the complaint charged an assault and battery by Whitfield, resulting in serious inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ries to McKinney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whitfield moved to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The District Court granted Whitfield\u2019s motion, reciting the rule that \u201ca federal official is absolutely immune from liability for those tortious acts falling within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of his authority.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s conduct fell within the zone of his discretionary authority, the District Court determined, because it occurred in the context of a supervisor-employee dispute about a proposed personnel action\u2014 the temporary lay-off of McKinney. We hold that the District Court delineated an over-large area for this official\u2019s line of duty; accordingly, we reverse the order dismissing McKinney\u2019s complaint and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The incident prompting McKinney\u2019s complaint occurred on February 25, 1982. An FAA funding shortage necessitated the temporary lay-off without pay of non-essential employees. On the day in question, appellee Whitfield instructed McKinney to come to his office to discuss her proposed \u201cfurlough\u201d and to sign a letter acknowledging that she had been advised of her rights regarding the forthcoming personnel action. The record reveals a history of strained relations between McKinney and Whitfield. The day of the episode in suit proved no exception. After a tense exchange in Whitfield\u2019s office, McKinney signed the acknowledgment letter. She then began to walk away, at which point the letter dropped to the floor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whitfield ordered McKinney to pick up the paper. McKinney did not do so; instead, she fled down the hall towards her office with Whitfield in hot pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Once inside McKinney\u2019s office, Whitfield either fired or threatened to fire her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McKinney then attempted to leave her office to seek assistance from Whitfield\u2019s supervisor. Whitfield, however, informed McKinney that she was \u201cnot going anywhere,\u201d and allegedly pushed an office chair into her leg to prevent her exit. McKinney recounts .that Whitfield persisted in blocking her way out. When she ducked to escape, she alleges, he gripped and twisted her arm, causing her to suffer severe pain and serious physical injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">After unsuccessfully pursuing her administrative remedies, McKinney filed suit in the District Court seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Whitfield moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that his blanket entitlement to absolute immunity was essential to the unimpeded \u201ceffective functioning of the government.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 7. The District Court granted Whitfield\u2019s motion; it relied on \u201cthe long line of cases starting with <em>Barr v. Matteo </em>\u201d indicating that \u201cabsolute immunity applies to all common law torts so long as they are committed within the outer perimeter of the official\u2019s authority.\u201d Memorandum Order, Civil Action No. 82-3016, at 2 (D.D.C. Sept. 23, 1983) (\u201cMemorandum Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">In holding Whitfield\u2019s conduct totally sheltered from liability in a common law tort action, the District Court focused upon \u201cthe specific supervisor-employee context\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>in which McKinney\u2019s alleged injuries occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 4. \u201c[P]revent[ing] [plaintiff] physically from leaving her office with issues left unresolved,\u201d the District Court declared, \u201cf[ell] within the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of defendant\u2019s authority,\u201d albeit perhaps \u201cnear the \u2018extreme edge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(referring to <em>Blatchford v. Guerra, </em>548 F.Supp. 406 (S.D.Fla.1982)). McKinney appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959), relied upon by the District Court, is the fountainhead Supreme Court decision affording federal officials absolute immunity from common law tort liability. In a series of mid 1970\u2019s decisions, the Supreme Court generally rejected <em>state </em>officials\u2019 pleas of absolute immunity from civil liability for torts committed in alleged violation of a plaintiff\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>rights. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975); <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). This series of decisions fueled debate earlier generated in commentary over the soundness, breadth, and continued vitality of <em>Barr. See, e.g., Expeditions Unlimited Aquatic Enterprises, Inc. v. Smithsonian Institution, </em>566 F.2d 289, 303 (D.C.Cir.1977) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 U.S. 915, 98 S.Ct. 3144, 57 L.Ed.2d 1160 (1978) <em>(\u201cExpeditions Unlimited\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 98 5. Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978), however, the Supreme Court appeared to assume <em>Barr\u2019s </em>endurance. The plaintiff in <em>Butz </em>sought damages from high-ranking Agriculture Department officials (including the Secretary) for conduct alleged to violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. Despite the nonfrivolous charge of <em>constitutional </em>violations, the defendants asserted total immunity from civil liability. The High Court held the officials (other than those acting in a judicial or prosecutorial capacity) entitled to assert only qualified, not absolute, immunity; it distinguished <em>Barr </em>as a decision involving only \u201cstate tort claims.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 494-95, 98 S.Ct. at 2904-05; <em>see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807-08, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2732-33, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (signalling that <em>Barr </em>remains good law).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court has specifically held that \u201cthe doctrine of absolute immunity from common law torts survives [Bu<em>tz]</em>.\u201d <em>Sami v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 755, 770 (D.C.Cir.1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McKinney\u2019s complaint, we note, advances only a common law claim; she alleges no conduct in contravention of constitutional restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">In <em>Barr, </em>the Acting Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization resisted a libel action brought by former subordinates based on a press release issued under defendant\u2019s directions. The Court held the Acting Director absolutely immune from civil damages liability for the alleged defamation. Lower federal court decisions have accorded <em>Barr </em>a generous reception in two respects: both the persons sheltered and the torts covered have been expansively interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Emphasizing statements contained in the <em>Barr </em>opinion, <em>see </em>360 U.S. at 572-74, 79 S.Ct. at 1340-41,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> lower federal courts have extended the absolute immunity defense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201cexecutive officials at all levels\u201d of the federal hierarchy. <em>Expeditions Unlimited, </em>566 F.2d at 307 (Wilkey, J., concurring); <em>see, e.g., id. </em>(Chairman of the Anthropology Department at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History); <em>Bishop v. Tice, </em>622 F.2d 349 (8th Cir.1980) (Occupational Safety and Health Administration regional auditor and regional administrator); <em>Berberian v. Gibney, </em>514 F.2d 790 (1st Cir.1975) (Internal Revenue Service officer); <em>Litvak Meat Co. v. Padilla, </em>470 F.Supp. 1040 (D.Colo.1979) (Department of Agriculture meat inspector). In light of this precedent, the District Court correctly assumed as its starting premise that Whitfield\u2019s FAA job supervisor position entitled him to assert <em>Barr </em>in defense of actions not manifestly beyond his line of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Barr </em>itself dealt only with the tort of defamation. <em>See </em>360 U.S. at 574, 79 S.Ct. at 1341; <em>id. </em>at 577, 79 S.Ct. at 1342 (Black, J., concurring) (absolute immunity appropriate because of importance of \u201cinformed public opinion\u201d to \u201ceffective functioning of a free government\u201d). Lower federal courts have brought within Barr\u2019s compass \u201cany common law tort.\u201d <em>Expeditions Unlimited, </em>566 F.2d at 300 (Robinson, J., concurring); <em>accord Miller v. DeLaune, </em>602 F.2d 198, 200 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>Plourde v. Ferguson, </em>519 F.Supp. 14, 17 (D.Md.1980). Federal officials have successfully raised <em>Barr </em>as a defense to a full range of common law delicts: negligence;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> malicious use of process;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> tortious interference with business; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> blackmail, fraud, and intimidation;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and, under some circumstances, assault and battery.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">But the <em>Barr </em>opinion acknowledged limits to an executive officer\u2019s absolute immunity from common law tort liability; federal officials are protected only if their actions are \u201ctaken ... within the outer perimeter of [their] line of duty.\u201d <em>Barr, </em>360 U.S. at 575, 79 S.Ct. at 1341. In <em>Butz, </em>the Court restated that <em>Barr </em>did not \u201cpurport ] to abolish the [common law] liability of federal employees for actions manifestly beyond their line of duty; ... they are accountable when they stray beyond the plain limits of their statutory authority.\u201d <em>Butz, </em>438 U.S. at 495, 98 S.Ct. at 2905. Thus, physical contact batteries may qualify for absolute immunity when administered by federal security or law enforcement officers whose job it is to maintain order and the public peace.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Skolnick v. Campbell, </em>398 F.2d 23 (7th Cir.1968) (deputy court marshal); <em>Plourde v. Ferguson, </em>519 F.Supp. 14 (D.Md.1980) (Air Force Base Exchange detective and military police). We are confident, however, that \u201cthe outer perimeters of [office supervisor Whitfield\u2019s] line of duty\u201d stop short of the physical coercion of subordinate managerial employees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Federal personnel regulations nowhere sanction the use of physical force by desk supervisors; on the contrary, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>provide that \u201cevery management action affecting employees [should be] free from coercion.\u201d Federal Personnel Manual ch. 250, \u00a7 2-2(b)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Federal courts have used a \u201cfunctional\u201d approach to determine the reach of <em>Barr; </em>absolute immunity is not extended \u201cwithout some inquiry into the need of the immunity to forward legitimate purposes of the office.\u201d <em>Ricca v. United States, </em>488 F.Supp. 1317, 1327 (E.D.N.Y.1980); <em>accord Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>456 F.2d 1339, 1346 (2d Cir.1972) (on remand); <em>Carter v. Carlson, </em>447 F.2d 358, 362 (D.C.Cir.1971), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. District of Columbia v. Carter, </em>409 U.S. 418, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973). In <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 73 L.Ed.2d 349 (1982), the Supreme Court, holding the President of the United States absolutely immune from constitutional claims, cautioned that \u201cthe sphere of protected action must be <em>related closely </em>to the immunity\u2019s justifying purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 102 S.Ct. at 2705 (emphasis added). We perceive no close relationship between appellee\u2019s alleged battery and \u201cthe effective functioning of government.\u201d <em>See Barr, </em>360 U.S. at 573, 79 S.Ct. at 1340.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The District Court observed that Whitfield\u2019s actions \u201cmay lie near the \u2018extreme edge\u2019 \u201d of \u201cthe \u2018outer perimeter' of [his] authority,\u201d Memorandum Order at 4; it nonetheless thought absolute immunity appropriate because the alleged battery arose within \u201cthe specific context of the employment situation\u201d and \u201cseparating supervisory goals from the means of aehieving them\u201d would be \u201cdifficult[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. We hold that separation of supervisory goals from supervisory means is required in the setting presented here; we do not believe that drawing the distinction, when superior-subordinate desk employee relations are at stake, involves untoward \u201cdifficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The District Court\u2019s finding that the battery McKinney charged arose in an employment context is uncontested. Under established precedent, Whitfield unquestionably would be entitled to absolute immunity from common law tort liability for certain conduct taken in the course of administering the FAA\u2019s \u201cfurlough\u201d plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, Whitfield\u2019s general engagement in supervision within the scope of his authority does not cloak with immunity the specific conduct at issue \u2014 his resort to manifestly <em>excessive means; </em>a contrary rule would drift away from the moorings of the functional approach. <em>Cf. McSurely v. McClellan, </em>553 F.2d 1277 (D.C.Cir.1976) (en banc) (although information gathering activities of Senate Committee investigator generally qualify for absolute immunity under Speech or Debate Clause, money damages may be available when means selected violate Fourth Amendment), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted sub nom. McAdams v. McSurely, </em>438 U.S. 189, 98 S.Ct. 3116, 57 L.Ed.2d 704 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Our immunity analysis is supported by an Eighth Circuit decision in point, <em>Bishop v. Tice, </em>622 F.2d 349 (8th Cir.1980). In that case, a federal safety engineer claimed that two Occupational Safety and Health Administration regional auditors and a region<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>al administrator induced him to resign by threatening to press against him false criminal charges; their purpose, allegedly, was to create a job vacancy to be filled at the administrator\u2019s direction. The safety engineer sued under a variety of common law theories (defamation, interference with contract, and conspiracy to defraud and deceive),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and defendants raised <em>Barr v. Matteo </em>as one of their defenses. Following a trial court dismissal, the Eighth Circuit ruled that <em>Barr </em>was \u201cof no comfort to defendants\u201d since, taking plaintiff\u2019s allegations as true, defendants had gone \u201cclearly beyond [their authority].\u201d 622 F.2d at 359. Even though federal supervisors are generally entitled to absolute immunity \u201cfrom liability in tort for actions relating to the discharge of their subordinates,\u201d the court stated, \u201cabsolute immunity is lost when a supervisor adopts <em>means </em>beyond the outer perimeter of his authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In summary, we reject the District Court\u2019s view that a means/end distinction is too difficult to draw in the context of relations between superior and subordinate desk employees. Whitfield urges, however, that the rationale of <em>Barr </em>nonetheless reaches his alleged attempt, through physical coercion, to keep McKinney within his reach so that she would stop, look at him, and listen to his instructions. He predicts that requiring federal government supervisors to defend themselves against battery charges will \u201cpave the way for countless abuses by employees of their supervisors.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Whitfield\u2019s forecast strikes us as farfetched. We envision \u201cno serious hamstringing of the activities\u201d of federal government supervisors if they are ordered to answer in damages for battering their subordinates. <em>See Kelley v. Dunne, </em>344 F.2d 129, 133 (1st Cir.1965) (postal inspector not absolutely immune from common law liability for knowingly misrepresenting that he had a warrant needed to search a home). Supervisors in Whitfield\u2019s position have available numerous means, short of physical coercion, for compelling the obedience of recalcitrant subordinates. McKinney was warned after the February 25 incident that future refusal to comply with supervisory instructions would result in disciplinary action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The FAA Supervisor\u2019s Handbook apparently provides for suspension or termination as sanctions for employee insubordination.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Federal personnel regulations additionally authorize disciplinary actions in the form of reprimands and reductions in rank or pay. Federal Personnel Manual ch. 751, \u00a7 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The rationale motivating Barr\u2019s recognition of a federal official\u2019s absolute immunity from common law tort liability is the \u201cfurther[ance] ... of effective administration of government in the public interest.\u201d <em>Expeditions Unlimited, </em>566 F.2d at 292 (footnote omitted). Compelling federal supervisory officials to respond in damages when they visit physical coercion on subordinate desk employees should pose at most a \u201cminimal\u201d threat to government efficiency. <em>See Kelley v. Dunne, </em>344 F.2d 129, 133 (1st Cir.1965). Accordingly, we hold that federal bureaucrats exceed the outer perimeters of their responsibilities, and act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>manifestly beyond their line of duty, when they resort to physical force to compel the obedience of their managerial subordinates.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to reinstate the complaint and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">.

Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>456 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir.1972) (on remand); <em>see also Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 555-57, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218-19, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b841-16\">. Appellee\u2019s job description indicates neither a need for, nor an authorization of, physical force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. We do not follow two slimly-reasoned published district court decisions holding Postal Service supervisors absolutely immune from battery suits. <em>Blatchford v. Guerra, </em>548 F.Supp. 406 (S.D.Fla.1982); <em>Bagwell v. Brannum, </em>533 F.Supp. 362 (N.D.Ga.1982). <em>Wallen v. Domm, </em>700 F.2d 124 (4th Cir.1983) (per curiam), attributed substantial weight by the District Court here, is readily distinguishable. <em>Wallen </em>involved an assault claim, but no allegation of physical contact. We think it evident that compelling federal officials to defend suits alleging heated discussion and threatening gesture would place a noticeably greater damper on the exercise of supervisory discretion than merely holding such officials accountable for physical intrusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b842-11\">. For example, if Whitfield had responded to appellant\u2019s alleged insubordination by filing an adverse performance evaluation, he probably could have asserted successfully absolute immunity from liability in a defamation action. <em>Cf. Lawrence v. Acree, </em>665 F.2d 1319 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">. <em>Bishop v. Tice </em>also presented a claim based on the Constitution. The Eighth Circuit discretely analyzed the immunity issue in each context. As to the alleged constitutional tort, the appellate court also denied absolute immunity. <em>See </em>622 F.2d at 360.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"AHs\">. <em>See </em>Official Letter of Warning from William A. Plissner, Director of Budget, to Iris McKinney, Budget Review and Reports Staff (Apr. 30, 1982), <em>annexed to </em>Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b843-13\">. <em>See </em>Report of Findings and Recommendations in the Grievance of Ms. Iris N. McKinney at 8 (July 23, 1982), <em>annexed to </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\">. We have no occasion to decide when a federal official\u2019s employment responsibilities are such that the use of physical force is within the outer perimeters of authority; Whitfield\u2019s duties assuredly do not necessitate such latitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
