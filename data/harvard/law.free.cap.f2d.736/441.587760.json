The injunction enjoined appellee St. Louis area cemeteries from conditioning sale of interment space on the buyer\u2019s purchase of the cemetery\u2019s memorial foundation preparation service and approved cemetery rules governing memorial foundation preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by third parties. For modification of the injunction appellant argues that (1) the district court acted beyond the scope of its mandate in approving these rules and (2) certain of the approved rules are unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. In a related appeal, appellant argues that the district court erred in awarding appellant only one-half of its requested attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons set forth below, we modify the approved rules and affirm the injunction as modified. We also affirm the attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">This case began as a suit by appellant seeking $3,300,000 in treble damages and injunctive relief for violation by appellees of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 (1976). Appellant, a manufacturer of burial monuments and markers which also provides a monument foundation preparation service, alleged that appellees, eleven St. Louis area cemeteries and their trade association, conspired to unreasonably restrain interstate commerce through an illegal tying arrangement. Appellants challenged the cemeteries\u2019 rule that required purchasers of cemetery lots to also purchase from the cemetery the cemetery's own memorial foundation preparation service. Following a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of the cemeteries, concluding that the challenged transaction involved the sale of a single product as a package deal and that the cemeteries\u2019 exclusive foundation preparation rule was justified by the cemeteries\u2019 ownership interests in the property and their statutory responsibility to provide perpetual care. <em>Rosebrough Monument Co. v. Memorial Park Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>505 F.Supp. 525 (E.D.Mo.1980) <em>{Rosebrough I). </em>The district court also found that appellant was not injured by the cemeteries\u2019 rule and that appellant\u2019s evidence of damages was wholly speculative. <em>Id. </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On appeal this court reversed the district court on the antitrust question. <em>Rosebrough Monument Co. v. Memorial Park Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>666 F.2d 1130 (8th Cir.1981) (Ro<em>sebrough II), cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1111, 102 S.Ct. 2915, 73 L.Ed.2d 1321 (1982). We held that appellees conspired to unreasonably restrain trade or commerce in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act and that the tying arrangement was illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 1140-45. We rejected appellees\u2019 justification for the tying arrangement because appellees failed to meet their burden of showing that multiple entry into the market for foundation preparation \u201cwill become unmanageable and that the foundations prepared or markers installed by their private competitors will detract from the appearance [of the cemeteries] or decrease the general services rendered the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1146. Recognizing that appellees had a legitimate property interest, we nevertheless concluded that this interest could be protected by less restrictive alternatives such as quality specification guidelines for foundation preparation by third parties. <em>Id. </em>at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In considering what remedy was appropriate, we concluded that the district court\u2019s finding that appellant failed to prove the fact of damage was clearly erroneous, but that the finding that appellant failed to satisfy its burden of proof as to the amount of damages was not. We therefore affirmed the denial of damages but directed the district court to award appellant nominal damages in the amount of $1.00 trebled to $3.00. We reversed the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief and remanded this portionof the cause to the district court for \u201cformulation of an appropriate order,\u201d adding that \u201c[appellees, individually or through [their trade association], are free to propose and adopt reasonable rules and guidelines with respect to foundation preparation and installation of monuments by third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148. Finally, we held that appellant was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15 &amp; 26 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980) and remanded this matter as well to the district court for determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">On remand, the injunction issue was submitted on each party\u2019s proposed form of injunction and on the prior record. The district court entered an order enjoining appellees\u2019 tying arrangement and requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>appellees to allow independent monument dealers to perform memorial foundation preparation and installation services</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">in accordance with rules and regulations which may be adopted by the cemeteries and which may contain any or all of the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">(1) the cemetery may establish specifications for the foundation of each type memorial which it permits in the cemetery. These specifications shall be the same as the cemetery itself utilizes in preparing foundations for particular type memorials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">(2) the cemetery may schedule, upon reasonable notice, all installations, taking into account weather and ground conditions, cemetery burial services, availability of personnel, etc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">(3) the cemetery may require that the foundation site be laid out by cemetery personnel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">(4) the cemetery may supervise the foundation and installation process and require the installation meet specifications after inspection and prior to placement of a memorial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">(5) the cemetery may require removal of excavated dirt and cleanup of the installation site;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">(6) the cemetery may require</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">(a) evidence that the installer\u2019s employees are covered by workman\u2019s compensation insurance and that the installer carries adequate public liability insurance in which the cemetery is a named insured, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">(b) a bond to insure compliance with the rules and regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">(7) the cemetery may charge a fee based on its actual labor costs in connection with the third party memorial foundation services; I<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">(8) if the cemetery contributes separately to a fund for the care of memorials, it may require the third party installer to contribute to such fund the same percentage of the charge by said installer as is contributed by the cemetery from its own installation charge;[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-16\">(9) the cemetery may require that the installer expeditiously correct any deviations from the specifications. If, after notice, any deviation is not corrected the cemetery may make such corrections at the installer\u2019s expense. All such rules and regulations which the cemetery may hereinafter adopt are to be reasonable in nature and application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-17\"><em>Rosebrough Monument Co. v. Memorial Park Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 77-883 C (1), slip op. at 2-3 (E.D.Mo. Mar. 18, 1983) (order) <em>(Rosebrough III). </em>The district court explained that the approved rules, which were based on appellees\u2019 proposed injunction order, were designed to preserve accountability and responsibility in the memorial foundation preparation market and to avoid new and fresh disputes over each foundation preparation. <em>Id. </em>at 2 (memorandum).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">On the attorney\u2019s fees issue, the district court determined that under <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), it was required to take into account the significance of appellant\u2019s overall relief in fixing reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The district court noted that appellant had won insignificant damages \u201cafter expending enormous efforts to prove its claim of well over three million dollars,\u201d and awarded appellant $51,293.95, or one-half the requested amount of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Rosebrough III, </em>572 F.Supp. 92 (E.D.Mo.1983). Appellant now appeals from the injunction and the attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-19\">I. <em>The Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-20\">Appellant lodges two attacks against the injunction. First, appellant argues the mandate from this court <em>(i.e., Rosebrough II) </em>did not authorize the district court to approve any cemetery rules and guidelines within the ambit of the injunction, but specifically relegated the proposal and adoption of rules to the cemeteries. Second, appellant argues even if the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>had the authority to approve rules, certain of the rules actually approved represent an abuse of discretion. Specifically, appellant challenges rules (3), (4), (6)(b), (7) and (8) as violative of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Rosebrough II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In <em>Rosebrough II </em>we recognized the need to reconcile the goal of open competition in the foundation preparation market with the cemeteries\u2019 property interests and statutory obligations. On remand it was clearly within the district court\u2019s authority as a court of equity to fashion a remedial decree which would go beyond a mere proscription against the invalid tying arrangement and which would fit the exigencies of this particular case. Furthermore, \u201cit is desirable, in the interests of the court and of both litigants, that the decree [in an antitrust case] be as specific as possible, not only in the core of its relief, but in its outward limits, so that parties may know their duties and unintended contempts may not occur.\u201d <em>International Salt Co. v. United </em>States, 332 U.S. 392, 400, 68 S.Ct. 12, 17, 92 L.Ed. 20 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Nevertheless, it was incumbent upon the district court to fashion an order which would, in accordance with <em>Rosebrough II, </em>effectively open to competition the market that had been closed by the cemeteries\u2019 illegal restraints. We do not believe that the district court\u2019s order accomplishes this. By requiring that foundation sites be laid out by cemetery personnel and that the work of third party installers be supervised at a fee, both of which are permitted by the injunction, the cemeteries could gain an unfair competitive advantage over the third party installers and thus maintain the market control which was achieved through the illegal tying arrangements. As we noted in <em>Rosebrough II, </em>666 F.2d at 1139 n. 5 and 1146, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that third party installers cannot lay out the foundation sites and perform their work without cemetery supervision. We therefore hold that rules (3) and (4) be deleted from the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We believe that rule (6)(b) which allows a cemetery to require a bond from third party installers to insure compliance with the cemetery\u2019s specifications is reasonable. Such a requirement would not appreciably add to the third party installer\u2019s costs and would therefore have little anti-competitive effect. Furthermore, this requirement would not only serve to protect the cemeteries in the event of non-compliance but would also protect consumers who purchase foundation preparation services from third party installers.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">We modify rule (7) to read as follows: \u201cthe cemetery may charge a fee based on its actual labor costs to inspect the finished work product of third-party memorial foundation services.\u201d This would be a fair accommodation to the cemetery\u2019s legitimate concern and need for quality control. Because the cemetery itself would incur labor costs in connection with the inspection of foundations prepared and installed by its own employees, the anti-competitive effect of charging third party installers similar costs should be minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Finally, we hold that rule (8) be deleted from the injunction. In Missouri, an \u201cendowed care cemetery\u201d is required to set aside and deposit in a trust fund a minimum of ten percent of the gross sales price, or five dollars, whichever is greater, for each grave space sold. The income from said fund is to be used only for care and maintenance of the cemetery. Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 214.320-.330 (1976). A cemetery is not statutorily required to set aside any amount from the price of its installation service. Whether a cemetery chooses to do so should not obligate a third party installer to contribute to a fund to cover the costs of what remains the cemetery\u2019s responsibility, <em>i.e., </em>care and maintenance of the cemetery. We believe that the rules permitting the cemetery to require a bond to ensure compliance with the cemetery\u2019s installation specifications, to inspect, at a fee, the finished work product of third party installers, and to require correction of any deviations adequately protect a cemetery against incurring care and maintenance costs resulting from third party installations.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The injunction as modified is in keeping with our holding in <em>Rosebrough II </em>and strikes the proper balance between the competing interests involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">II. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACT\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in reducing its attorney\u2019s fees award to one-half of the amount requested because appellant failed to obtain monetary relief except for $3.00 in nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The statutory bases for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case are 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 26 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), which entitle an antitrust plaintiff to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as a concomitant to a damage award or injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1939-41, the Supreme Court set forth standards to be applied by the district courts in determining what fee is \u201creasonable.\u201d These standards are applicable for all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>at .1939 n. 7. When a plaintiff succeeds only on some of his or her claims for relief, the district court is directed to focus on the work expended on the successful claims and on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1940. The Court explains that there is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations. \u201cThe district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The district court has considerable discretion in determining the amount of a fee award. The standard applied by this court in reviewing an attorney\u2019s fees award is whether the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous as to the factual basis for the award, or whether it committed abuse as to the discretionary margin involved in its allowance. <em>International Travel Arrangers, Inc. v. Western Airlines, Inc., </em>623 F.2d 1255, 1274 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1063, 101 S.Ct. 787, 66 L.Ed.2d 605 (1980). In the present case the district court, which presided over the litigation, was in the best position to evaluate the time and resources expended on appellant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to prove its measure of damages. We find no error or abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s reduction of the attorney\u2019s fee award by one-half to account for appellant\u2019s failure to obtain any significant money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Accordingly, we modify the injunction as set forth in this opinion, and we affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $51,293.95.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-23\">.
