We have jurisdiction pursuant to sections 10(e) and 10(f) of the National- Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e), 160(f) (1976). For the reasons that follow, we will enforce part of the Board\u2019s order, deny enforcement of part of the order, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-19\">. The Company, a New Jersey corporation, is engaged in the business of publishing, selling, and distributing a daily newspaper, The Herald News. The Company maintains its principal office and place of business in Passaic, New Jersey. In addition to its facility in Passaic, the Company maintains other offices in New Jersey, including a Morris County bureau in Morris-town, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-20\">In July 1977, the Company hired Joseph Lasica as a reporter covering municipalities in Bergen County. After an intermediary assignment, the-Company assigned Lasica to the Morris County bureau. On January 15, 1979, Lasica notified The Herald News that he had formed a union organizing committee with some other editorial employees; the group hoped to gain union representation for all editorial employees. From January 1979 until August 1980, Lasica distributed union literature and held organizational meetings with editorial employees in an attempt to convince them to vote for the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union, Local 8 (\u201cLocal 8\u201d or \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>Union\u201d). One editorial employee, Mitchell Stoddard, had been hired by the Company in October 1967. Stoddard served as the Company\u2019s Morris County bureau chief from October 1967 until March 1978. As bureau chief, Stoddard had several responsibilities, including administrative ones.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to his administrative duties, Stoddard reported on Morris County stories and wrote a controversial weekly column that addressed issues affecting northern New Jersey. In March 1978, at the request of Coit Hendley, then the executive director of the Company, Stoddard agreed to and did serve as night editor of The Herald News.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-4\">Fifteen months later, in June 1979, Stoddard returned to the Morris County bureau. At that time Stoddard and Lasica were the only employees in the Morris County bureau; Stoddard was named bureau chief and nominally retained this position at all times relevant to this litigation. Although Stoddard considered himself as running the Morris County bureau after June 1979, the record includes credible testimony that Stoddard no longer performed the responsibilities that he had performed prior to his appointment as night editor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">Two Union representation elections were held, the first in May 1979 and the second in January 1980. After sustaining objections to these two elections, the Board directed that a third election be held in August 1980. During this period, Lasica was the driving force in the Union\u2019s organizational drive. Apart from Lasica\u2019s efforts on. behalf of Local 8 in the first two elections, both Stoddard and Lasica continued to perform their normal duties in the Morris County bureau until June 1980. Moreover, despite the fact that Stoddard and Lasica were the only employees assigned to Morris County, the record is devoid of references to Stoddard\u2019s involvement with the Union until June 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Stoddard testified that he approached Lasica in June 1980, inquiring what he could do to help the Union\u2019s efforts. Shortly thereafter, Lasica attempted to enlist Stoddard as a member of the Union\u2019s organizing committee; Stoddard, however, hesitated. Stoddard further testified that when he departed for vacation a few weeks later he still had reservations about permitting his name to be used as a member of the Union\u2019s organizing committee and communicated his reservations to Lasica. Nevertheless, in the Union\u2019s correspondence of July 28, 1980, while he was still on vacation, Stoddard\u2019s name appeared as one of twelve members of the organizing committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From July 28, 1980, until the election, Local 8 distributed ten campaign pamphlets, all of which listed the members of the organizing committee.. Stoddard\u2019s name was on each pamphlet. Upon his return from vacation on August 4, Stoddard initially disclaimed the Union\u2019s use of his name in its literature. He, however, never asked Lasica to withdraw his name nor did he object to the repeated use of his name in subsequent publications. Instead, Stoddard testified that, because he was committed to the Union, he assisted with the organizing drive (127a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">The Company\u2019s writers, photographers, and editors selected Local 8 as their collective bargaining representative in the third representation election held on August 14-15, 1980.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two days after the election, Stoddard\u2019s regular weekly column did not appear. In an affidavit, Stoddard recites that Jim Hile, the Sunday editor, \u201ctold me that within a half an hour of the election Hendley had come into where he [Hile] was, was madder than hell, had pulled out my column, and said that I was not going to have any more columns\u201d (360a). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>affidavit also recites that when Stoddard questioned Hendley about the weekly column, Hendley replied that it was the Company\u2019s new policy not to have reporters on the street write columns (360a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">In response to the Company\u2019s actions and charges initially filed by Lasica, the General Counsel filed a complaint. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Company\u2019s decision to cancel Stoddard\u2019s column constituted an unfair labor practice within the meaning of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), 158(a)(3), and that the Company changed the conditions of employment of Stoddard in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The AU agreed. He concluded that the Company, \u201cby ceasing the publication of Stoddard\u2019s weekly column, committed an unfair labor practice, in that it discouraged membership in the Union, in violation of Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act\u201d (20a). Moreover, the AU found that Stoddard was demoted due to his union activities (20a). The Board agreed; it affirmed the AU\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions and adopted his order, with a minor modification. The Board\u2019s order required the Company to cease and desist from engaging in the violation found and from engaging in any related manner designed to interfere with the employees\u2019 exercise of their section 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, rights. Affirmatively, the Board ordered the Company to restore Stoddard to his former position as weekly columnist and resume publication of Stoddard\u2019s weekly column, subject to the same lawful standards and requirements that the Company imposes or may impose on its employees; to expunge from its files any reference to the cancellation of Stoddard\u2019s column; to notify Stoddard in writing that the references have been expunged and that evidence of this unlawful action will not be used as a basis for future personnel actions; and to post an appropriate notice<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2a-7a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-12\">The Company petitions for review of the Board's order on five grounds. The Company contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1620-13\">(1) that Stoddard was exempt from coverage under the Act because he was a supervisor within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1620-14\">(2) that Stoddard was exempt from coverage under the Act because he was a managerial employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1620-15\">(3) that substantial evidence did not support the Board's finding that the Company decided not to print Stoddard\u2019s weekly column because of his participation in protected, concerted activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>(4) that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes the Board from challenging the Company\u2019s decision not to print Stoddard\u2019s weekly columns or inquiring into the Company\u2019s motives for deciding not to print Stoddard\u2019s columns; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-5\">(5) that the First Amendment precludes the Board from requiring the Company to resume printing Stoddard\u2019s columns subject to further and continued Board scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-6\">Because we find that Stoddard was covered by the Act and that substantial evidence, based upon the record as a whole, supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Company discontinued Stoddard\u2019s weekly column because of his involvement in protected activities, we will enforce the Board\u2019s order, except that part of such order requiring the Company to resume publication of Stoddard\u2019s weekly column. We hold that the portion of the order requiring the Company to \u201cresume publication of Stoddard\u2019s weekly column, subject to the same lawful standards and requirements\u201d that the Company imposes, or may impose, on its employees, impermissibly attempts to compel the Company to publish what it prefers to withhold in violation of the First Amendment and decline to enforce this part of the order. <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 2839, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974); <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 681, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2656, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">Section 7 of the Act provides that \u201cemployees\u201d of an \u201cemployer\u201d subject to the Act have the right to form, join, or assist labor organizations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. Section 8 provides that it is an unfair labor practice to interfere with, restrain, or coerce the exercise of those rights, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 158(a)(1), or to discriminate \u201cin regard to ... any term or condition of employment to ... discourage membership in any labor organization ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 158(a)(3). Two conditions precedent must be satisfied before sections 7 and 8 are even implicated. First, the- party allegedly violating the Act must be an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by section 2(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2); and second, the. employer must interfere with or otherwise discriminate against an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in section 2(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3). The Company does not dispute the AU\u2019s finding that it is an \u201cemployer\u201d subject to the Act. The Company does dispute, however, the AU\u2019s finding that Stoddard was an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to the Act\u2019s protection. The Company, instead, contends that Stoddard falls within one or both of the exclusions from the Act created for supervisors and managerial employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The.AU and the Board disagreed; they determined that Stoddard was neither a supervisor nor a managerial employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-15\">Section 2(11) of the Act defines the term \u201csupervisor\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AarN\">\u201c... any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>or effectively -to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtPb\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11). \u201cTo be a supervisor the person must \u2018possess real power \u201cin the interest of the employer.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. N.L.R.B., </em>420 F.2d 1296, 1300 (D.C.Cir.1969). In determining whether supervisory status exists, \u201c[w]hat is decisive is what employees do rather than what they are called ____\u201d <em>International Union of E., R. &amp; M.W., AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>426 F.2d 1243, 1247 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 950, 91 S.Ct. 239, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970). Past supervisory status is not determinative. Instead, great weight is given to the individual\u2019s current status. Moreover, the \u201cBoard is far more able than this court to evaluate \u2018the infinite possible variations in responsibilities enumerated in\u2019 \u201d section 2(11). . <em>Food Store Emp. U. Local 347, A.M.C. &amp; B.W. v. N.L.R.B., </em>422 F.2d 685, 690 (D.C.Cir.1969) (citations omitted). Because of its expertise, the Board \u201cnecessarily has a large measure of informed discretion,\u201d and this court will sustain the Board\u2019s determination that an individual is an \u201cemployee\u201d and not a \u201csupervisor\u201d if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Amalgamated Clothing, </em>420 F.2d at 1300. <em>See also Stop &amp; Shop Companies, Inc., Etc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>548 F.2d 17, 18 (1st Cir.1977) (Board finding that certain employees are not supervisors is question of fact for the Board). Because substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that Stoddard was not a supervisor as that term is defined in section 2(11) when he resumed the position of Morris County bureau chief in 1979,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we will affirm the Board\u2019s finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-9\">In addition to its contention that Stoddard was a supervisor, the Company argued, alternatively, that Stoddard was a managerial employee and, therefore, was not entitled to the Act\u2019s protection. In <em>NLRB v. Yeshiva University, </em>444 U.S. 672, 682, 100 S.Ct. 856, 862, 63 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980), the Court defined managerial employees as those who \u201c \u2018formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer\u2019 \u201d (citing cases). \u201cManagerial employees must exercise discretion within, or even independently of, established employer policy and must be aligned with management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 100 S.Ct. at 862; <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 286-87, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1767-68, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1977). \u201c[A]n employee may be excluded as managerial only if he represents management interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy.\u201d <em>Yeshiva University, </em>444 U.S. at 683, 100 S.Ct. at 862 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">In determining the \u201cmanagerial\u201d status of employees, again the Board makes a factual determination. The Board acts within an area \u201cmost wisely entrusted initially to the agency charged with the day-to-day administration of the Act as a whole.\u201d <em>See Marine Engineers v. Interlake Co., </em>370 U.S. 173, 180, 82 S.Ct. 1237, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>1241, 8 L.Ed.2d 418 (1962). Like its determination that an individual is, or is not, a supervisor, the. Board\u2019s factual determination that an individual is, or is not, a managerial employee \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.\u201d <em>See Board v. Hearst Publications, </em>322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 861, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944) (\u201cBoard\u2019s determination that specified persons are \u2018employees\u2019 under this Act is to be accepted if it has \u2018warrant in the record\u2019 and a reasonable basis in law\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that Stoddard was not a \u201cmanagerial employee,\u201d as the Board and the courts have defined that status, when he resumed the position of Morris County bureau chief in June 1979.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will affirm the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-6\">Because we have determined that Stoddard was an employee, the two conditions precedent to the applicability of sections 7 and 8 of the Act \u2014 that the party allegedly violating the Act be an \u201cemployer\u201d under section 2(2) and the allegedly aggrieved party be an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 2(3) \u2014are satisfied. Stoddard, therefore, is entitled to engage in section 7 activities and the Company is prohibited from engaging in the unfair labor practices set forth in section 8. Consequently, we now must determine whether substantial evidence based upon the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Company engaged in unfair labor practices. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">As noted above, <em>see supra </em>part III, an employer commits an unfair labor practice when it interferes with an employee\u2019s section 7 rights or discriminates \u201cin regard to ... any term or condition of employment to ... discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), 158(a)(3). \u201cConduct which violates any of the more specific prohibitions of section 8 [including section 8(a)(3) ] would also coerce or restrain employees in their section 7 rights and would thus violate section 8(a)(1) derivatively.\u201d R. Gorman, <em>Basic Text on Labor Law </em>132 (1976). To establish a violation of section 8(a)(3), and thereby a violation of section 8(a)(1), the General Counsel .must establish that the employer acted \u201cto encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization,\u201d that the employer acted discriminatorily, and that the employer was motivated by an anti-union animus. Establishing these facts presupposes that the General Counsel establishes that the Company was aware of the employee\u2019s activities on behalf of a labor organization. Like other factual findings, the Board\u2019s findings with respect to knowledge, discrimination, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>motive. are conclusive and should not be disturbed unless \u201cirrational or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Oil, Chemical And Atomic Wkrs. Int. U., Local 4-243 v. N.L.R.B., </em>362 F.2d 943, 946 (D.C.Cir.1966); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). When discrimination is alleged, the Board, may infer discrimination from both direct and circumstantial evidence. <em>NLRB v. Link-Belt Co., </em>311 U.S. 584, 602, 61 S.Ct. 358, 367, 85 L.Ed. 368 (1941); <em>Food Store Emp. U., Loc. 347, Amal. Meat Cut., Etc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>418 F.2d 1177, 1181 (D.C.Cir.1969) <em>(quoting NLRB v. Lester Bros., Inc., </em>337 F.2d 706, 708 (4th Cir.1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">The Board and the Supreme Court recently have adressed the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases in which an employer allegedly takes adverse action against an employee for engaging in protected activities and the employer\u2019s motive is questioned. In <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083 (1980), <em>enforced, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 848 (1982), the Board distinguished, for purposes of analysis, between \u201cpretext\u201d cases and \u201cdual motive\u201d cases. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-5\">\u201cIn modern day labor relations, an employer will rarely, if ever, baldly assert that it has disciplined an employee because it detests unions or will not tolerate employees engaging in union or other protected activities. Instead, it will generally advance what it asserts to be a legitimate business reason for its action. Examination of the evidence may reveal, however, that the asserted justification is a sham in that the purported rule or circumstance advanced by the employer did not exist, or was not, in fact, relied upon. When this occurs, the reason advanced by the employer may be termed pretextual. Since no legitimate business justification for the discipline exists, there is, by strict definition, no dual motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALJ\">\u201cThe pure dual motive ease presents a different situation. In such cases, the discipline decision involves two factors. The first is a legitimate business reason. The second reason, however, is not a legitimate business reason but is instead the employer\u2019s reaction to its employees\u2019 engaging in union or other protected activities. This latter motive, of course, runs afoul of Section 8(a)(3) of the Act. This existence of both a \u2018good\u2019 and a \u2018bad\u2019 reason for the employer\u2019s action requires further inquiry into the role played by each motive and has spawned substantial controversy in 8(a)(3) litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-9\"><em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. at 1083-84 (footnote omitted). The Board then focused on the \u201cdual motive\u201d cases. After analyzing the conflicting positions different circuit courts had adopted, the Board formulated a new rule based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the test formulated in <em>Wright Line, </em>the Board first determines whether the \u201cemployee\u2019s employment conditions were adversely affected by his or her engaging in union or other protected activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1083. If the employee\u2019s employment conditions were adversely affected, the Board addresses the motivation issue to determine \u201cwhether the employer\u2019s action was motivated by such employee activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The approach the Board adopted in <em>Wright Line, </em>therefore, requires the General Counsel to \u201cmake a <em>prima facie </em>showing sufficient to support the inference that [the employee\u2019s participation in] the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>tected conduct was a \u2018motivating factor\u2019 in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089. Once the General Counsel establishes a <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct. Although its specific concern in <em>Wright Line </em>was the \u201cdual motive\u201d cases, the Board's rule is applicable to pretext cases as well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">In <em>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983), the Court affirmed the Board\u2019s application of the rule formulated in <em>Wright Line. </em>In addressing the pretext cases, the Court stated: \u201cUnder these provisions [section 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) ] it is undisputed that if the employer fires an employee for having engaged in union activities and has no other basis for the discharge, <em>or if the reasons that he proffers are pretextual, </em>the employer commits an unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2472 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See also NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, </em>388 U.S. 26, 34, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 1798, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967) (\u201conce it has been proved that the employer engaged in discriminatory conduct which could have adversely affected employee rights to some extent, the burden is upon the employer to establish that he was motivated by legitimate objectives since proof of motivation is most accessible to him\u201d). Once the General Counsel establishes discriminatory conduct that adversely affected the employment relationship, <em>Great Dane, Transportation Management, </em>and <em>Wright Line </em>squarely place the burden on the employer to show that legitimate objectives motivated the adverse action; failure to establish legitimate motives <em>requires </em>a finding on behalf of the employee unless a First Amendment exception is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">The General Counsel sought to meet its burden by presenting evidence of the Company\u2019s response to the Union\u2019s election literature. The evidence suggests that Hendley, in anger, ordered Stoddard\u2019s column pulled immediately after the representation election; that Stoddard\u2019s column was pulled two days after the representation election; and that the Company failed to offer any credible explanation for its action. .Instead of offering a credible explanation for its actions, the Company relied on a pretextual justification and contended that the First Amendment served as a shield that prevented the Board from challenging the decision and inquiring into its motives. The Company thus effectively concedes that it failed to establish that it would have taken the adverse action \u201ceven in the absence of protected activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-10\">The AU made several factual findings; the Board adopted the findings without modification (4a). The AU concluded that the Company must have been aware of Stoddard\u2019s activities on behalf of the Union; that Hendley, in anger, ordered Stoddard\u2019s column to be pulled and not printed again immediately after the results of the August election were announced; that the Company\u2019s decision not to publish Stoddard\u2019s column constituted a demotion and, therefore, the terms and conditions of Stoddard\u2019s employment were adversely affected as a reprisal for engaging in union activities; and that the Company\u2019s action was discriminatory. We hold that substantial evidence based on the record as a whole supports the AU\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>First, we find that substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s determination that the Company must have been aware of Stoddard\u2019s efforts on behalf of the Union. The direct evidence shows that during the two weeks prior to the August certification election both the Company and the Union sent out literature urging the employees to adopt their respective positions. The Union\u2019s literature included a list of the names of twelve members of the Union\u2019s organizing committee; Stoddard\u2019s name appeared on each of ten lists. The Company\u2019s literature frequently included direct responses to the substantive arguments raised' by the Union. Consequently, the AU\u2019s conclusion that \u201csome, if not all\u201d of the Union\u2019s campaign pamphlets found their way into [the Company\u2019s] possession\u201d and, therefore, the Company must have been fully aware of those employees aligned with the Union (19a), was warranted. In addition to the direct evidence, circumstantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding. The timing of the Company\u2019s decision, the proffered justification, Hendley\u2019s statement immediately after the election that \u201cthat\u2019s the end of Stoddard\u2019s column,\u201d and the evidence that Hendley was \u201cmadder than hell\u201d when he ordered that Stoddard\u2019s column be pulled support the AU\u2019s finding and bolster his conclusion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-6\">Second, substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding that the terms and conditions of Stoddard\u2019s employment were adversely affected because of his efforts on behalf of the Union.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Prior to the election, Stoddard reported on news stories and wrote a controversial column over which he had almost unlimited discretion. Subsequent to the election, his column was can-celled. Stoddard testified that he was a writer, that writing a column \u201cwas a condition of my original employment\u201d (133a), that he wrote a column from 1967, the year in which he was hired, until 1976, and that he was unhappy with his position as night editor because he would be required to edit rather than write. In light of Stoddard\u2019s testimony, we agree with the AU that the elimination of Stoddard\u2019s column-writing duties may properly be viewed as a demotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-7\">Third, substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding that the Company\u2019s conduct was discriminatory. Discrimination involves \u201ctreating like cases differently.\u201d <em>Marathon LeTourneau Co., Longview Div. v. N.L.R.B., </em>699 F.2d 248, 253 (5th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). Although Hendley told Stoddard that the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>instituted a policy not to have reporters on the street write columns, the General Counsel introduced into evidence columns written by other reporters that postdated the effective date of the new policy. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding that Stoddard was treated in a discriminatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">Fourth, substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding that the Company was motivated, at least in part, by its anti-union animus. The timing of the decision, the purported justification, and Hendley\u2019s state of mind at the time of the decision support the AU\u2019s finding. The General Counsel, therefore, established a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Stoddard\u2019s column was discontinued as a result of the employer\u2019s anti-union animus. Accordingly, we will affirm the Board\u2019s holding that the Company engaged in unfair labor practices unless we find that the Company presented evidence sufficient \u201cto demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of [Stoddard\u2019s participation in] the protected conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">Instead of presenting evidence to persuade the Board that it would have discontinued Stoddard\u2019s column even if he had not engaged in protected activities, the Company argued that the First Amendment of the Constitution precludes the Board from challenging the Company\u2019s decision and from inquiring into the motives for its decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We disagree and hold that <em>Associated Press v. Labor Bd., </em>301 U.S. 103, 131-33, 57 S.Ct. 650, 655-56, 81 L.Ed. 953 (1937), is dispositive of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-11\">In <em>Associated Press, </em>the Associated Press argued that the First Amendment precluded application of the Act to an agency of the press. Associated Press contended that because the case involved the discharge of an editorial employee, ostensibly for failing to perform up to his capabilities, it \u201cmust have absolute and unrestricted freedom to employ and to discharge those who ... edit the news.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 57 S.Ct. at 655. The Court disagreed. According to the Court, \u201c[t]he statute does not preclude a discharge on the ostensible grounds for the petitioner\u2019s action; it forbids discharge for what has been found to be the real motive\u201d of the Associated Press: the employee\u2019s Guild activity and his agitation for collective bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 57 S.Ct. at 655. Continuing, the Court stated: \u201cThe act permits a discharge for any reason other than union activity or agitation for collective bargaining with employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite the attempt of the Associated Press to avoid inquiry into its decision, the Court permitted inquiry into, and required the Associated Press to disclose, the motive for taking adverse action against an employee engaged in union activities. If the asserted motives were merely pretextual and interfered with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>employee\u2019s protected activities, the employer was guilty of committing an unfair labor practice. The attempt' of the Associated Press to prevent inspection of its motives by invoking the First Amendment was totally unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-4\">Similarly, in this case, the Company characterizes its decision as an editorial one and contends that the First Amendment prevents the Board from challenging its decision or inquiring into its motives. We disagree. Instead, we find the principles set forth in <em>Associated Press </em>directly applicable to this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, under the rule announced in <em>Wright Line, </em>the Company is not required to explain its decision unless and until the General Counsel has established a <em>prima facie </em>case that the employer has committed an unfair labor practice. Requiring the employer to respond at that time by demonstrating that it would have taken the adverse action even in the absence of protected conduct strikes a sensible balance that we are unwilling to disturb.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">Because the First Amendment does not prevent the General Counsel from either challenging the Company\u2019s decision or questioning its motives and because the Company failed to offer a credible explanation for discontinuing Stoddard\u2019s column, we find that the Company failed to meet the burden imposed by <em>Wright Line </em>and <em>Transportation Management. </em>We, therefore, will affirm the Board\u2019s decision insofar as it finds that the Company violated sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-12\">Having determined that substantial evidence supports the finding that Stoddard\u2019s column was discontinued in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act and that the First Amendment does not preclude inquiry into the Company\u2019s motives for its decision, we turn to the Board\u2019s remedial order. In analyzing the order, we recognize initially that under section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), the Board has considerable discretion in fashioning remedies for unfair labor practices. <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939 n. 32, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-13\">In its order, the Board attempted to \u201crestore the <em>status quo ante </em>in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>instant dispute\u201d (21a). To effectuate its objective, the Board attempted to regulate prospective publication decisions. The Board ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Company \u201crestore Mitchell Stoddard immediately to his former position as weekly columnist, and resume publication of Stoddard\u2019s weekly column, subject to the same lawful standards and requirements that Respondent [the Company], as an employer, imposes or may impose on its employees\u201d (25a, 6a). In essence, this part of the Board\u2019s order has two unfortunate consequences. First, it seeks to compel the Company to publish what it prefers to withhold; and, second, it injects the Board into the editorial decision-making process on an ongoing basis. The Board contends that its remedy is \u201cnarrowly drawn to remove the consequences of the Company\u2019s unlawful discrimination and to restore the situation as it existed prior to the unfair labor practice\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief at 43). The Board portrays its order as one requiring the Company to \u201ctreat Stoddard\u2019s submissions in a nondiscriminatory fashion\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief at 43), and \u201cto' give normal consideration\u201d to Stoddard\u2019s submissions (Respondent\u2019s Brief at 44). Despite the Board\u2019s attempt to characterize the order as one that merely requires the Company to give Stoddard\u2019s submissions \u201cnormal consideration\u201d and treat them \u201cin a nondiscriminatory fashion,\u201d the order is considerably broader. Indeed, the order unambiguously requires the Company to \u201cresume publication of Stoddard\u2019s column.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-5\">The Supreme Court has implied consistently that newspapers have absolute discretion to determine the contents of their newspapers. In <em>Associated Press, </em>the Court recognized that under certain circumstances the Act might have to yield to First Amendment protections accorded the press. <em>Associated Press, </em>301 U.S. at 132-33, 57 S.Ct. at 655-56. Application of the Act to the Associated Press did not abridge the freedom of the press because \u201cthe full freedom and liberty of Petitioner [the Associated Press] to publish the news as. it desires it to be published\u201d would not be circumscribed. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 57 S.Ct. at 656. The Court implied that should the press\u2019s freedom and liberty \u201cto publish the news as it desires it to be published\u201d be circumscribed, the Act would have to yield to-the First Amendment. Similarly, in <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972), the Court held that the First Amendment does not relieve a newspaper reporter of the obligation to respond to a grand jury subpoena. The Court contrasted the case it was addressing with cases that might qualify for First Amendment protection. Among the latter group was the case involving an \u201cexpress or implied command that the press publish what it prefers to withhold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 92 S.Ct. at 2657. Similarly, in <em>Columbia Broadcasting v. Democratic Comm., </em>412 U.S. 94, 117, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 2094, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973), the plurality opinion contrasted restrictions that could be imposed on a broadcast licensee with those that could be imposed on a private newspaper. Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-7\">\u201cThe power of a privately owned newspaper to advance its own political, social, and economic views is bounded by only two factors: first, the acceptance of a sufficient number of readers \u2014 and hence advertisers to assure financial success; and, second, the journalistic integrity of its editors and publishers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1629-8\">Until its decision in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1971), the Court\u2019s views on whether a newspaper could be compelled to publish that which it chose to withhold could be discovered only by implication. In <em>Tornillo, </em>however, the Court was explicit. The question presented to the Court was whether a Florida statute, which granted political candidates the right to reply to press criticism, violated the First Amendment because it required a newspaper that had criticized a candidate to publish the candidate\u2019s reply. Advocates of an enforceable right to access made strong arguments. After acknowledging the validity of the arguments favoring an enforceable right of access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>press and the worthwhile purposes of the statute, a unanimous Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-4\">\u201cHowever much validity may be found in these arguments, at each point the implementation of a remedy such as an enforceable right to access necessarily calls for some mechanism, either governmental or consensual. If it is governmental coercion, this at once brings about a confrontation with the express provisions of the First Amendment and the judicial gloss on that Amendment developed over the years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 254, 94 S.Ct. at 2838 (footnotes omitted). In resolving the tension between the \u201cright to access\u201d statute and the First Amendment, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-6\">\u201cThe choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public <em>officials </em>\u2014 whether <em>fair or unfair </em>\u2014constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment. It has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press as they have evolved to this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2840 (emphasis supplied). Consequently, \u201cthe First Amendment erects a virtually insurmountable barrier between government and the print media so far as government tampering, in advance of publication, with news and editorial content is concerned.\u201d <em>Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. at 259, 94 S.Ct. at 2840 (White, J., concurring).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1630-8\">Applying these principles to the present case, we find that th\u00e9 Board\u2019s objectives may be valid ones; apparently the Board is attempting to ensure that the Company does not retaliate against Stoddard for his union activities with impunity and attempting to ensure meaningful remedies for victims of unlawful discrimination. Nevertheless, valid objectives are insufficient to permit the Board to require the Company to publish Stoddard\u2019s column. Implementation of a remedy that requires governmental coercion gives rise to a confrontation with the First Amendment. <em>Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. at 254, 94 S.Ct. at 2837. To enforce the Board\u2019s order would require this court to recognize, for the first time, that government regulation of the material to go into a newspaper \u201ccan be exercised consistent with the First Amendment guarantees of a free press as they have evolved to this time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2840. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-11\">A comparison of the degree of government involvement in <em>Tornillo </em>with that in this ease also suggests our result. In <em>Tornillo, </em>the plaintiff sought to enforce a Florida statute that required newspapers to publish a one-time reply to that newspaper\u2019s attack on plaintiff\u2019s candidacy for political office. The Court, however, held that requiring the newspaper to publish a reply, even a one-time reply, could not be reconciled with the First Amendment. In contrast, the Board seeks to compel publication of Stoddard\u2019s column every week for the foreseeable future. Because the Supreme Court was unwilling to sanction even a one-time publication order, we are unwilling to sanction a publication order requiring the Company to publish Stoddard\u2019s column repeatedly. <em>See also Herbert v. Lando, </em>441 U.S. at 166-68, 99 S.Ct. at 1644 (\u201cIn each of these cases <em>[Tornillo </em>and <em>Columbia Broadcasting </em>], we invalidated government efforts to pre-empt editorial decision by requiring the publication of specified material.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-12\">The Board contends that because its order requires resumption of publication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>\u201csubject to the same lawful standards and requirements that Respondent, as an employer, imposes or may impose on its employees,\u201d the remedial order is not constitutionally infirm. According to the Board, this clause renders its order consistent with <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>Associated Press v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 1, 20 n. 18, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 1425 n. 18, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945). We disagree. Had the lead-in language mandating the publication of Stoddard\u2019s column been absent and had this clause been narrowly crafted, we would have been more sympathetic to the argument that the Board\u2019s order merely encompassed a nondiscrimination directive. An order that merely directed the Company to not discriminate against Stoddard on the basis of his union activity would present a much closer case. But this clause is written so broadly that it invites the Board to review the Company\u2019s publication standards and to become directly involved with the Company\u2019s exercise of editorial control and judgment. Moreover, when the clause is read in conjunction with the lead-in language, it is clear that the order involves \u201can express [and] implied command that the press publish what it prefers to withhold.\u201d <em>Branzburg, </em>408 U.S. at 681, 92 S.Ct. at 2657. Thus we find that the clause does not save the otherwise constitutionally defective rembdy. Instead, we find that the remedy mandating resumption of Stoddard\u2019s column must yield to the Company\u2019s First Amendment interest in retaining control over prospective editorial decisions. The Board does not have the power to disregard the First Amendment as interpreted in cases such as <em>Tornillo, Columbia Broadcasting, Branzburg, </em>and <em>Associated Press.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1631-4\">Accordingly, we' remand for further consideration to enable the Board to invoke any specific, alternate remedies consistent with part VI of this opinion to ensure that Stoddard is not retaliated against for his Union activities.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1618-21\">.

The Company primarily relies on <em>Wichita Eagle &amp; Beacon Publishing Co., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>480 F.2d 52 (10th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 982, 94 S.Ct. 2383, 40 L.Ed.2d 758 (1974). In <em>Wichita Eagle, </em>the court determined that two employees who were directly \"involved in the formulation of [the] editorial content of a newspaper\" were aligned with management. <em>Id. </em>at 56. The employees were quite active in formulating and drafting the newspaper\u2019s editorials; they proposed topics and emphasized their own viewpoints in editorials. Because \u201d[w]hat appears in an editorial is the subjective viewpoint of management,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 54, the court distinguished between the reporting of news and \u201cthe creation and expression of subjective opinion on behalf of a newspaper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50. The former was the function of employees protected by the Act and the latter the function of \"managerial employees\u201d who were not protected by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-13\">Stoddard was not a participant in formulating the newspaper\u2019s editorials. Instead, Stoddard is a columnist who sets forth his personal views on controversial topics under his own byline. The record reveals insufficient evidence to support the Company\u2019s contention that Stoddard\u2019s column ever represented or became the viewpoint of the newspaper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">. In <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>Doyle, an untenured teacher, instituted suit against the Mt. Healthy School Board, alleging that the Board had wrongfully \u25a0 refused to renew his contract. The Board gave two reasons for its refusal; one reason involved conduct protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and one involved unprotected conduct. The Court fashioned a two-part test to be applied in dual motivation contexts. First, the employee must establish that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to rehire the employee. Second, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it would have reached the same decision \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1625-7\">. The Board noted that one incidental benefit of its adoption of the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>test \"is that the perceived significance in distinguishing between pretext and dual motive cases will be obviated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089 n. 13. Apparently, the distinction would no longer be necessary because if the General Counsel met his burden, the burden would shift to the employer. If the employer then failed to offer any explanation or offered pretextual reasons, he would not meet his burden and the General Counsel would prevail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1625-11\">. In analyzing <em>Transportation Management, </em>the Supreme Court did not follow the Board\u2019s suggestion that it is unnecessary to distinguish between \u201cpretext\u201d and \"dual motive\u201d cases. <em>See supra </em>note 13. Instead, it immediately distinguished and dismissed the pretext cases as <em>per se </em>violations of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3). The same result occurs, however, under both methods of analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">. We disagree with the Company\u2019s contention that the Board may not rely on this statement. The ALJ found that the Company did not object to Stoddard\u2019s testimony at the time, nor did it object to his affidavit when the General Counsel introduced the affidavit into evidence (16a &amp; nn. 24, 25). The Company does not dispute these findings. It is axiomatic that <em>\u201ca </em>failure to object to an offer of evidence at the time the offer is made, assigning the grounds, is a waiver upon appeal of any ground of complaint against its admission.\" C. McCormick, <em>Handbook of the Law of Evidence </em>113 (2d ed. 1972). If \u201cthe evidence is received without objection it becomes part of the evidence in the case, and is usable as proof to the extent of whatever rational persuasive power it may have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). <em>RJR Communications, Inc., </em>248 N.L.R.B. 920, 921 (1980), is not inconsistent. It is unclear from the facts whether counsel objected to the hearsay evidence relied on by the Board. Moreover, we agree with the ALJ that this was \"relevant and material hearsay.\u201d Consistent with <em>RJR Communications, </em>the hearsay was \"corroborated by something more than the slightest amount of other evidence.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1626-9\">. The Company contends that the General Counsel\u2019s complaint never raised, and the parties never litigated, the issue of whether the change in Stoddard\u2019s role constituted a demotion. Although we agree that the complaint does not allege specifically that Stoddard was demoted, it does allege that the employer changed the terms and conditions of employment. <em>See supra </em>note 9. The \u201cterms and conditions\" language of section 8(a)(3) usually applies to more traditional types of employer actions, including discharge, demotion, and transfer. Stoddard, in fact, retained the salary and benefits of his former position. Nevertheless, we find that the language of section 8(a)(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass other forms of disciplinary action including the adverse action alleged herein. <em>See Wichita Eagle &amp; Beacon Publishing Co., </em>199 N.L.R.B. 360, 367 (1972), <em>enf. denied on other grounds, </em>480 F.2d 52 (10th Cir.1973), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>416 U.S. 982, 94 S.Ct. 2383, 40 L.Ed.2d 758 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">. The Company also contends that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding (24a) that Stoddard\u2019s column had been cancelled because Stoddard \"joined\u201d the Union. Section 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, gives employees, <em>inter alia, </em>the right to \"join\u201d <em>or </em>\"assist\u201d unions. Stoddard testified that he \u201cwas going to join the organizing committee,\u201d but did not testify that he joined the Union. Nevertheless, section 7 lists permissible activities on behalf of labor organizations in the disjunctive. Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s alternative finding that the Company cancelled Stoddard\u2019s column for his role in assisting the Union, the Company\u2019s argument does not require an alternative disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">. The Company goes to great lengths to characterize the issue as one involving editorial discretion. It repeatedly asserts that the \u201cBoard chose to litigate an issue dealing exclusively with the Company\u2019s decision not to print opinion columns written by Stoddard.\u201d Again, we disagree. Paragraphs 10 and 11, which are incorporated by reference in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the complaint (31a-32a), are considerably broader than the Company would have us believe. <em>See supra </em>note 6. We think the complaint, when fairly read, raises the issues of whether cancelling the column altered the terms and conditions of Stoddard\u2019s employment status and whether such action was discriminatory. In fact, only by ignoring paragraphs 15 and 16 of the complaint can one argue that the Board chose to challenge the Company\u2019s editorial discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">. Although <em>Associated Press </em>involved a discharge case, it is applicable to this case nevertheless. The ban on firing employees outright because of their union activities extends to other actions designed to adversely affect their employment conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"ADA\">. The Company primarily relies on two cases to support its contention that the Board may not inquire into the decision to discontinue Stoddard\u2019s column. <em>See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 U.S. 490, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979); <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>461 U.S. 731, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983). Both cases are distinguishable. In <em>Catholic Bishop, </em>the only question the Court . addressed was whether the Act conferred jurisdiction over teachers who taught both religious and secular subjects in church operated schools. 440 U.S. at 506-07, 99 S.Ct. at 1321-22. In concluding that Congress did not intend that the Act confer jurisdiction over these teachers, the Court distinguished <em>Associated Press, </em>301 U.S. 103, 57 S.Ct. 650, 81 L.Ed. 953. The Court never determined the Act was inconsistent with the First Amendment religion clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"AYI\">The Company cites <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s </em>for the proposition that \"where an action is constitutionally protected, the employer\u2019s improper motivation is irrelevant\u201d (Appellant's Reply Brief at 3). In <em>Bill Johnson's, </em>the Court held that the Board could not halt the prosecution of a state court civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate against employees for exercising federally protected labor rights without also finding that the suit lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s, </em>461 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2169. Under the Court\u2019s holding, retaliatory or improper motive is far from irrelevant, it is essential. To prevail, therefore, the Board must be free to inquire into the employer\u2019s motives and must establish that they were retaliatory ones.</p>\n<p id=\"A-MX\">Finally, the Company assertion that \u201d[i]t follows that if government may not dictate what words a newspaper can or cannot print, then it may not question the editorial decision-making process which precedes the printing\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 24),. is directly contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s view. In <em>Herbert v. Lando, </em>441 U.S. 153, 168, 99 S.Ct. 1635, 1644, 60 L.Ed.2d 115 (1979), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1628-18\">\"[Hjoldings that neither a State nor the Federal Government may dictate what must or must not be printed <em>neither expressly nor impliedly </em>suggest that the editorial process is immune from any inquiry whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1630-9\">.
