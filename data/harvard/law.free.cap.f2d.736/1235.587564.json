The sole issue presented is whether the lump-sum rule applies to all AFDC recipients or, as the plaintiffs assert, only to those with earned income. The district court, the Honorable W.C. Stuart presiding, held that the rule applies to all AFDC recipients and granted summary judgment for the defendant, Secretary Heckler. 577 F.Supp. 1180 (S.D.Iowa 1983). Contending that the district court erred as a matter of law, plaintiffs appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-15\">The lump-sum rule determines the effect that receipt of a nonrecurring lump-sum, such as an inheritance, has on an AFDC recipient\u2019s benefits. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (1981) (OBRA), Congress amended the lump-sum rule. In essence, the lump-sum becomes the family\u2019s AFDC payments for a prescribed period. The period of ineligibility is obtained by dividing the total of the family's lump-sum and other income, by the family\u2019s monthly standard of need.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress\u2019s stated intent in amending the rule was to eliminate what it perceived to be the prior rule\u2019s \u201cperverse effect\u201d of encouraging recipients to spend lump-sum payments quickly in order to retain eligibility. <em>See </em>Report of the Committee on the Budget, S.Rep. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>97-139, 97th Cong. 1st Sess. 505, <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 396, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">The plaintiffs contend that the statutory-language of the lump-sum rule establishes that it applies only to families with earned income. The plaintiffs focus primarily on the rule\u2019s reference to section 602(a)(8)(A) to define its scope and to explain how the period of ineligibility is determined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs maintain that section 602(a)(8)(A)(i) and (ii) refers only to persons with earned income, thereby unambiguously limiting the application of the lump-sum rule to persons with earned income. The plaintiffs bolster their contention by arguing that had Congress intended a universal application, section 602(a)(7) would have been the appropriate cross reference. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7) (general guidelines for determining need of all applicants); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 602(a)(31) (stepparent deeming provision of OBRA refers to \u00a7 602(a)(7) to signal universal application). Plaintiffs forcefully argue that Congress\u2019s use of the more specific section necessarily implies a more restrictive reach of the lump-sum rule. The plaintiffs contend that the legislative intent of OBRA was to curtail federal spending, while preserving the \u201csocial safety net\u201d for those truly needy. This was to be achieved by reducing welfare benefits for persons completely without alternative sources of income. <em>See Philadelphia Citizens in Action v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 877, 879 (3d Cir.1982). Thus, applying the lump-sum rule only to families with earned income is consistent with, and furthers, the purpose of OBRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">Against the backdrop of several district court decisions addressing the coverage of the lump-sum rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court below carefully analyzed the statutory language and relevant legislative history. The district court concluded that the statute was ambiguous. The statutory referent to (8)(A)(i) and (ii) to determine coverage was ambiguous because those portions of the paragraph do not specify persons as much as they elaborate treatment to be accorded certain income of <em>all </em>AFDC recipients. However, because Congress explicitly \u201cspecified]\u201d persons to whom the rule would apply, it could follow that Congress intended to restrict the coverage of the lump-sum rule; because Congress chose the section that determines the treatment of earned income as the referent, then the relevant subset to which it applies may be those AFDC recipients with earned income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">Turning to legislative history to resolve the ambiguity, the district court concluded that Congress did not intend a limited application of the lump-sum rule. First, the statutory reference to other income is to guide the application of the rule where there is other income, not to limit its application to instances where there is other income. Second, the court found that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>was appropriate to give deference to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation that the lump-sum rule has a universal application. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) (1982). Finally, the court found that applying the rule to all AFDC families was not inconsistent with the purpose of the particular amendment, OBRA, or AFDC. A universal application of the rule more thoroughly eliminates the \u201cperverse effect\u201d of the prior rule. Because the lump-sum rule forces families to use lump-sum payments to meet their subsistence needs, rather than to rely on aid, a universal application also furthers Congress\u2019s intent to curtail federal spending and achieve a fair allocation of scarce resources among the needy. Moreover, it is also consistent with the stated goal of AFDC to encourage self-support. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The district court\u2019s conclusions were followed by the First Circuit in <em>Sweeney v. Murray, </em>732 F.2d 1022 (1st Cir.1984). Both the district court and the First Circuit in <em>Sweeney </em>have exhaustively and thoroughly considered the arguments raised on appeal. After careful study and deliberation, we find ourselves in agreement with the holdings of the First Circuit and the district court below. On the basis of the conclusions reached therein, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">. Under \u00a7 602(a)(17) a state plan must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">provide that if a <em>person specified in paragraph (8)(A)(i) or (ii) </em>receives in any month an amount of income which, together with all other income for that month not excluded under paragraph (8), exceeds the State's standard of need applicable to the family of which he is a member\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHL\">(A) such amount of income shall be considered income to such individual in the month received, and the family of which such person is a member shall be ineligible for aid under the plan for the whole number of months that equals (i) the sum of such amount and all other income received in such month, not excluded under paragraph (8), divided by (ii) the standard of need applicable to such family, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-17\">(B) any income remaining (which amount is less than the applicable monthly standard) shall be treated as income received in the first month following the period of ineligibility specified in subparagraph (A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(17) (emphasis added). Prior to OBRA, a lump-sum payment was regarded as income only in the month received; thereafter, to the extent that any was left, it was a \"resource,\" against which benefits were offset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">.
