We have decided to enter this order immediately because we do not perceive any reason or justification for further delaying the implementation of this national defense project authorized by Congress and directed by the President. However, an opinion of the panel majority, together with a separate opinion by Judge Cudahy concurring in part and dissenting in part, will follow in due course, addressing the permanent injunction and disposing of all other relevant issues. All members of the panel are presently in agreement that the permanent injunction should be vacated at this time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-19\"> With the ELF communications system, a submarine is able to receive messages while maintaining operational speeds at depths at which it is practically immune from detection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
