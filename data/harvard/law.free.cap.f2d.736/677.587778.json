SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In this pre-award Government contracts case appellant/cross-appellee, the United States Government, appeals from an order of the United States Claims Court enjoining the United States Department of the Navy (Navy) from awarding to any entity other than appellee/cross-appellant ATL, Inc. (ATL), four Navy contracts on which ATL was low bidder, until the Navy affords ATL a new and proper hearing concerning the Navy\u2019s suspension of ATL from all Government procurement action. ATL cross-appeals from the Claims Court order on the grounds that the Claims Court should have ordered award of the four contracts to ATL instead of a new hearing. We affirm in part and reverse in part. In particular, we affirm continuation of the injunction until the Navy affords ATL a proper proceeding, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">We face first the question whether the Claims Court properly exercised jurisdiction over ATL\u2019s suit. Secondly, we treat the issue whether the Claims Court correctly determined that the Navy denied ATL due process in its suspension procedure, particularly as regards its denial of a full hearing. Finally, we address the relief which the Claims Court ordered, including ATL\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">1. <em>Events Leading to ATL\u2019s Filing Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoNA\">A summary of the many facts material to this appeal is as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ATL is a Hawaiian construction contractor and a small business concern whose work is done almost entirely with the Federal Government. In the first part of 1983 ATL submitted what turned out to be low bids in response to four separate Navy invitations for bids for construction work to be performed in the Honolulu area. The Navy office issuing the bid invitations was the Office in Charge of Construction for the Mid-Pacific Region of the United States Navy (OICC MIDPAC or OICC), the chief of which was Navy Capt. Michael Dallam. The bid opening dates for the contracts were in March and April 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Normally, ATL as low bidder would expect acceptance of its bid within 60 days of its opening. However, OICC twice requested ATL to extend the acceptance period for its first two March bids, ultimately until July 31. Similar extension requests followed concerning ATL\u2019s third and fourth bids. ATL also received at least two OICC requests for further information on its technical ability to perform some or all of the bids, which information ATL in each instance promptly provided. Finally, having once already rebuffed ATL\u2019s request for a meeting on the delayed awards, OICC scheduled such a meeting on July 6 to address ATL\u2019s technical ability to perform all four awards. This meeting was held with favorable results for ATL on three of the four contracts; the Navy retained questions concerning ATL\u2019s technical ability to perform one of the contracts. No mention was made at the meeting of Navy concerns about ATL\u2019s integrity. On the same day, July 6, 1983, ATL was filing suit in the Claims Court in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to ATL, since early 1983 the Naval Investigating Service (NIS) had been investigating ATL for certain charges alleging misconduct in performance of ongoing and prior contracts. Upon referral by the NIS, both the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. attorney in Hawaii also began investigating ATL. The charges had originally come to the attention of Captain Dallam, who had referred them to the NIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As it became apparent in March and April 1983 that ATL was low bidder on four new Navy contracts, OICC recognized that allegations impugning ATL\u2019s integrity were in investigatory hands beyond those of OICC, which was immediately responsible for awarding the bids. Since by law and regulation the Navy is constrained to award bids to \u201cresponsible\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> bidders, the results of the U.S. attorney/FBI investigation, which at that point OICC expected in late April, were highly relevant. Accordingly, OICC focused on the \u201cnon-integrity\u201d aspects of its routine pre-award surveys conducted to assure the Navy that the low bidder is indeed \u201cresponsible.\u201d Both April and May came and went, however, and, although OICC learned that the U.S. attorney intended to submit the ATL case to a grand jury, this had still not occurred by mid-June. Meanwhile, OICC\u2019s routine preaward surveys had unearthed no reason for not awarding ATL any of the four bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">By this time Captain Dallam, as OICC chief, was personally involved in the ATL matter. Most significantly, on June 16 he visited the U.S. attorney in Honolulu. There he learned that the criminal investigation of ATL would continue for several months and that an indictment was not imminent. The U.S. attorney cautioned Captain Dallam against OICC\u2019s prematurely disclosing evidence to ATL which might prove useful in a criminal investigation later. Accordingly, on the same day (June 16), Captain Dallam instructed his staff attorney to prepare the necessary papers for the captain to recommend to his superiors in Washington that ATL be suspended from all Government contract awards for lack of integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Captain Dallam did not forward the ATL suspension recommendation to Washington until July 1. In the interim he weighed whether suspension was the appropriate route, or whether he should instead reject ATL\u2019s four bids for nonresponsibility due to lack of integrity. The latter procedure would allow ATL to appeal the rejection to the Small Business Administration (SBA). Captain Dallam met with SBA representatives and confirmed that if he rejected ATL\u2019s bids and ATL appealed to the SBA, the SBA would disclose to ATL the reasons and evidentiary record for the rejection so that ATL could respond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of this, Captain Dallam decided instead to recommend suspension so as to minimize or eliminate the need to disclose to ATL evidence which the U.S. attorney might later use in a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">2. <em>Events After ATL Filed Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">ATL\u2019s complaint, filed in the Claims Court on July 6, 1983, requested a cut-off date on the Navy\u2019s responsibility review of ATL and, if necessary, referral to the SBA. On July 12 the Claims Court denied ATL immediate equitable relief but set a date for trial, July 18, at which ATL was to attempt to prove that the Navy\u2019s delays constituted a de facto debarment or suspension.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Before the trial, however, Adm. J.G. Williams, Jr., chief of Naval Material in Washington, D.C., informed ATL, by letter dated July 15, that the Navy was suspending ATL from further contracting with any Federal Government agency. OICC immediately thereafter awarded contracts on three of the four solicitations on which ATL had been low bidder, to other bidders. On July 18 the Claims Court preliminarily enjoined the Navy from awarding any of these four contracts to entities other than ATL or from permitting work by entities other than ATL to proceed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Court ordered a trial on July 19, the result of which was a detailed opinion of August 9, 1983, continuing the injunction and requiring the Navy to provide ATL with a fair hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Navy\u2019s suspension letter of July 15 to ATL listed nine items reflecting alleged lack of integrity, but the chief of Naval Material subsequently continued the suspension based on only two items, set forth in the opinion here reviewed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Briefly, these concerned (1) knowingly false certifications to the Government that workers on one of the contracts were being paid wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, and (2) receipt of payment for shaft walls to enclose air conditioning ducts in the women\u2019s head, which walls were never installed. As it developed, the first item involved a disgruntled subcontractor and a question whether ATL officials, who had allegedly merely forwarded the supposedly false certification involving that subcontractor\u2019s employees to the Government, were aware of the alleged falsehoods.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second item turned out to involve such a small sum, as well as various mitigating factors, as to make it unclear whether the Navy would have sustained the suspension on that ground alone.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The July 15 suspension letter also informed ATL that \u201cno factfinding proceeding will be conducted as the result of a request from the United States Attorney in Hawaii,\u201d but that ATL could \u201cpresent information in opposition to this suspension in person, in writing, or through representation as set forth in DAR [Defense Acquisition Regulation] l-606.3(c)(5).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On September 7 ATL did make a presentation to the Navy Debarment Committee, at which the only witnesses were ATL\u2019s. Pri- or to this presentation ATL had requested that the Navy present it with various facts and documents concerning the suspension charges.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Navy refused on the grounds that the suspension letter sufficiently placed ATL on notice of the charges and disclosure of further evidence would be contrary to the U.S. attorney\u2019s request. The Navy also informed ATL, pursuant to its request, that the members of the Navy Debarment Committee were the same individuals who had previously recommended ATL\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">After the September 7 proceeding, ATL received letters dated December 2, 1983, from the chief of Naval Material that ATL\u2019s suspension would continue, based on two of the original nine charges. ATL amended and filed again its complaint in the Claims Court which, in the decision of January 6, 1984, here under review, ordered that the Navy afford ATL a \u201cnew and proper\u201d hearing and that the injunction continue until a suspension decision is made based on such hearing. When the Government filed a motion to stay before this court,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we denied the motion, on January 31, 1984, to the extent it requested a stay of the injunction, but we granted a stay of the order for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">1. <em>The Claims Court\u2019s </em>Jurisdiction<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Congress has empowered the Claims Court to exercise jurisdiction over \u201cany claim against the United States founded * * * upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This includes the Government\u2019s implied-in-fact contract with its bidders to consider all bids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>fairly and honestly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Government contends that ATL\u2019s suit falls outside the implied-in-fact contract concept because ATL is actually a disappointed bidder attacking the propriety of the Navy\u2019s suspension decision. Under this theory the Go.vernment claims that ATL should have sought relief in the appropriate district court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">While generally the Government is correct that a contractor would attack a suspension in district court, on the facts of this particular case the Government\u2019s contention does not obtain. When ATL first filed its complaint with the Claims Court on July 6, 1983, it had no idea that OICC chief Captain Dallam had recommended to his superiors that ATL be suspended. From ATL\u2019s point of view, it knew only that the Navy was unduly delaying the awards of four contracts upon which ATL <em>had already bid </em>and was in fact low bidder in each case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the trial court has pointed out, once jurisdiction properly attaches, the long-standing rule in the federal courts is that it cannot be ousted by subsequent events.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In addition, the Government\u2019s attempt to narrow the implied contract theory by contending that it does not extend to actions performed other than by contracting officials fails in this factual context. Even assuming that the theory were so limited, which we do not, its application here, where the contracting official and the official initially recommending the suspension, Captain Dallam, were one and the same, is hardly credible. It was Captain Dallam who weighed carefully the pros and cons of rejecting ATL\u2019s bid for nonresponsibility versus recommending suspension. While we certainly presume that the admiral actually informing ATL of the suspension (and its continuation) carefully reviewed the full ATL record, Captain Dallam, as contracting official, remains a key figure in the initiation of the suspension process.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In sum, we hold that the Claims Court properly exercised jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">2. <em>The Due Process Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">Once Captain Dallam and his superiors determined to suspend ATL rather than to reject its bids for nonresponsibility, those <em>persons </em>\u2014 i.e., the Navy \u2014 likewise determined to subject themselves to their own regulations and a body of case law prescribing a fair method for executing such a suspension. Similarly, ATL for its part reasonably expected a fair carrying out of the process. Exactly what process was due ATL is something to be determined not on the validity of the general regulations, but on the facts specifically involved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has provided guidelines for the type of procedures which are constitutionally acceptable, under the fifth amendment, in adverse administrative actions, where both the governmental and private interests that are affected must be analyzed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> More specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ly, in suspension cases it is recognized that, although a citizen has no <em>right </em>to a Government contract,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and a bidder has no constitutionally protected <em>property </em>interest in such a contract,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a bidder does have a liberty interest at stake, where the suspension is based on charges of fraud and dishonesty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, the minimum requirements of due process come into play. With this background in mind, we examine the specific areas in which the Claims Court found the Navy to have denied ATL due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">a. <em>The Sufficiency of the Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Navy\u2019s regulation requires it to describe the basis of the suspension charges \u201cin terms sufficient to place the contractor on notice without disclosing the Government\u2019s evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Adequate notice of the charges is, of course, part of the process that is due the suspended contractor. The notice must be \u201csufficiently specific to permit the suspended contractor to collect and present relevant evidence refuting the charges contained therein.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It has as well been suggested that, where an agency may deny the contractor an adversary hearing and allow instead mere submission of information in opposition to the suspension, then the need for a more specific notice is especially critical.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We add that, in these particular circumstances, where the Navy has \u201cstrung along\u201d the contractor for at least twice the normal period after bid opening, such specificity in the notice is similarly critical, so that the contractor may rapidly prepare a thorough rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Nevertheless, our analysis of the Navy\u2019s notice to ATL, contrary to that of the Claims Court, causes us to conclude that the notice does pass constitutional muster in this first step of the suspension process. We note at the outset that the Navy\u2019s July 15 suspension letter contained notice of nine charges against ATL involving five separate, specified contracts. ATL succeeded in convincing the Navy to drop seven of these nine charges. The notice concerning the shaft wall in the women\u2019s head the Claims Court found to appear \u201csufficiently specific to enable the contractor to rebut,\u201d and we do not disagree.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This leaves just one charge, that concerning the allegedly false payroll certifications involving contract number N62471-78-C1317, \u201cRepairs to Bathrooms, Kitchens, and Floors, Manana Marine Housing and Camp Smith Housing, Oahu, Hawaii,\u201d which the court below found to fail for lack of specificity.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Our analysis of that one charge shows it to specify, among other things: the contract concerned; the type and location of work under the contract; the names of the three ATL officials, allegedly \u201cacting on behalf of\u201d a named subcontractor, who certified the wages being paid;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> names of five workers allegedly underpaid; and a letter of specified date in which ATL told OICC that it did not handle the subcontractor\u2019s administrative affairs. Based on this information it is reasonable to expect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ATL could begin immediately to marshal a rebuttal. It could, for instance, produce testimony and/or affidavits from the five workers that they were indeed paid Davis-Bacon wages. Or, it could gather testimony, affidavits, or other information to prove that ATL indeed had no knowledge of the subcontractor\u2019s administrative affairs. Moreover, ATL could search its own business records, or request those of the subcontractor (if it were friendly), to locate the payrolls for that contract and other correspondence and records which would refute the charges. In short, unlike the vague notice of the charges analyzed in <em>Transco,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this case the notice is sufficiently specific *to enable ATL to get its \u201cducks in a row\u201d in preparation for a meaningful response in the next step of the administrative suspension process.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Similarly, weighing the other factors which we must in the due process balancing analysis,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we do not find the risk of an erroneous deprivation of ATL\u2019s interest, at this initial point, to be so great as to require more lengthy notice. We have, with the benefit of hindsight, pointed out ATL\u2019s successful refutation of seven other charges, as well as the extensive knowledge, including business records, which it could reasonably be expected to have of this contract, especially since there apparently had been litigation previously.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We must also weigh the Government\u2019s interest, which at this point, while requiring thoroughness and specificity in the notice without tipping the criminal prosecutor\u2019s hand, should not have to include wholesale production of documents. This is especially true where the Navy could reasonably expect ATL to have many if not most of these documents. We therefore reverse the court below and hold that the Navy provided ATL with sufficiently specific notice of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">b. <em>The Navy\u2019s Failure To Provide Further Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Having found in this instance that the notice of the charge was sufficiently specific, we turn to the Navy\u2019s response to ATL\u2019s two requests for further documents and evidence prior to the September 7 proceeding before the Navy Debarment Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">As noted above, when the Navy suspended ATL, it stated flatly that no fact-finding would be conducted, pursuant to the U.S. attorney\u2019s request. Consistent with this position, the Navy flatly denied ATL additional information or even access to basic documents, such as the payrolls, as requested by ATL in letters of August 24 and 31.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This contrasts sharply with a recent pre-award suspension case we have considered, <em>Electro-Methods, Inc., </em>in which every bit of evidence which was before the Air Force Debarment and Suspension Review Board, was likewise available to, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>rebutted by, Electro.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In that case the Air Force also denied Electro fact-finding, pursuant to the written advice of the Department of Justice, but only after considerable give-and-take between the parties in terms of both pre- and post-suspension meetings and opportunities to submit information, had occurred. Electro\u2019s bottom line in that ease was an impossible dream, as we in effect held: Electro wanted to subpoena and cross-examine the FBI agents involved in the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In ATL\u2019s case, we take at face value its assertion that the July 15 suspension notice came as a bolt out of the blue. Although the notice was sufficiently specific for ATL to prepare for rebuttal, as we have held above, ATL\u2019s immediate and natural response was to request more information. In short, it wanted to know what evidence the Navy possessed to support the specified charges. Ideally, of course, it would have liked to have known what evidence the U.S. attorney in Honolulu possessed, just as Electro\u2019s \u201cimpossible dream\u201d was to have examined the FBI agents.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The Claims Court examined <em>in camera </em>the Navy\u2019s file on the payroll certification charge and concluded that the Navy could have provided \u201cmore specific information * * * as to the substance of this charge without substantial prejudice to any future criminal proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It is not our position to second-guess the trial judge on his conclusion, since we have not examined <em>in camera </em>this evidence. In our view, given that ATL made requests for additional information after receiving the suspension notice, the Navy was obligated to respond as promptly and thoroughly as it could.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Surely the Navy could not seriously contend, for example, that the U.S. attorney would find his criminal investigation prejudiced by the Navy\u2019s releasing to ATL a copy of a 3-1/2-year-old letter which ATL should have had in its own files.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Similarly, at least providing ATL the opportunity to review records in the Navy\u2019s possession, such as payrolls, should not be burdensome or unduly revealing. Particularly where the Navy is taking a flat-out position denying fact-finding, this type of prompt give-and-take, step-by-step cooperative process is, at a minimum, due the suspended contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Indeed, we are struck, as no doubt was the trial judge, by the Navy\u2019s secretive attitude here. Captain Dallam chose to initiate suspension rather than to reject the bids for nonresponsibility in order to avoid SBA review and release of records to ATL. This attitude continued in the Navy\u2019s refusal to provide ATL access to meaningful records. While certainly the Government\u2019s interest in protecting an ongoing criminal investigation is great,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> this cannot extend to obdurate uncooperativeness where the suspended contractor\u2019s interest likewise is great. The Navy must not allow a busy U.S. attorney to dictate the terms of a civil investigation. Instead, these agencies must work to \u201ccarve out\u201d as much evidence as is reasonable for release to the contractor.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> That process was lacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>here.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the Claims Court and hold that the Navy must provide ATL with such additional information, consistent with the opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">c. <em>The Adequacy of the Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">While we hold that the Navy failed in not being more cooperative with ATL prior to the September 7 proceeding, we do not go so far, as did the court below, to find that the proceeding should have provided ATL \u201can opportunity to confront its accusers and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> A full-blown trial-type hearing is not necessarily the process due a temporarily suspended contractor with a protected liberty interest, where the Government\u2019s interest in protecting an ongoing criminal investigation is considerable.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The risk of an erroneous deprivation of the contractor\u2019s interest should be adequately safeguarded by conscientiously following the lesser, but important, procedures outlined here.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Again, we do note that the September 7 proceeding produced some solace for ATL, in that the Navy subsequently dropped seven of the nine suspension charges.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We note also that the Navy Debarment Committee lacks subpoena powers, so that its ability to produce ATL\u2019s accusers would be limited.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Finally, we note the relative promptness with which this proceeding was held after the July 15 suspension notice, and after some give-and-take had occurred between the Navy and ATL. The bulk of the subsequent delay in resolving this case has occurred because of the Navy Debarment Committee\u2019s slowness (2 months) in deciding to continue the suspension, and because of docketing, motion analysis, argument, and reviewing in this court. We therefore reverse the Claims Court\u2019s holding that the hearing to be held on remand must give ATL an opportunity to confront its accusers and cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">d. <em>The Need for a Neutral Tribunal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">In this case the members of the Navy Debarment Committee, before whom the September 7 proceeding was held and whose findings formed the basis of the chief of Naval Material\u2019s (a four-star admiral) decision to continue the suspension, were the same persons who initially recommended ATL\u2019s suspension.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The pertinent regulations on who is the \u201csuspending official\u201d are silent as to whether those who recommend suspension and those who conduct the fact-finding or proceeding may be one and the same.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The court below found the Navy\u2019s practice in this case to violate due process.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>We disagree with the Claims Court on this point and therefore reverse, based on the specific facts at hand. We note first that Captain Dallam in Hawaii was the line officer who initially began the ATL suspension ball rolling when he sent his recommendation to Washington on July 1, 1983. Captain Dallam\u2019s recommendation was reviewed, we presume, by both the three-member Navy Debarment Committee and by the chief of Naval Material, Admiral Williams. The same three-member Debarment Committee conducted the September 7 proceeding and presumably recommended continuation of the suspension to then-chief of Naval Material, Admiral White. That committee (or the admiral) did reverse itself (or himself) on seven of the original nine charges, since the suspension was continued based only on the two charges here discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We cannot believe that such a triple-layer review process, ending with a foqr-star admiral in Washington, D.C., constituted a rubber stamping of the Navy\u2019s original position. As in <em>Transco, </em>a balancing of the factors here involved \u2014 ATL\u2019s protected liberty interest, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the Government\u2019s fiscal and administrative interest\u2014 leads us to conclude that the process due, \u201cthe decision of a top level administrator\u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> was afforded ATL. We do see no need for the Navy to have been so secretive about its decision-making process, however, especially when we compare this case to <em>Electro-Methods. </em>In that ease, the board\u2019s full suspension recommendation, signed and dated by three named Air Force officials, was attached to the original suspension notice.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In sum, of the four areas here examined concerning the process due ATL, we have reversed the court below on three elements \u2014 the sufficiency of the notice, the adequacy of the proceeding, and the need for a neutral tribunal \u2014 and have affirmed on one \u2014 the Navy\u2019s failure to provide further information. Thus the new hearing which the Navy must grant ATL, as we discuss in part 3 of this opinion, will be \u201cnew\u201d only in the procedural sense that ATL will come to the proceeding better armed with information upon which (or against which) to make its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">3. <em>The Relief Granted</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The court below enjoined award of the four contracts, or any work thereon, until 5 days after the chief of Naval Material reached a new decision on ATL\u2019s suspension, after a new and proper hearing in accordance with the Claims Court opinion. ATL cross-appeals, contending that the Claims Court erred in denying ATL\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment requesting immediate award of the four contracts to ATL.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">We are mindful both of the difficulty in fashioning relief in a case such as this, and of the damaging effect of the passage of time to ATL\u2019s interest. Over a year has now passed since ATL submitted its four bids on the contracts here at issue. It will not be long before ATL will have been suspended for 12 months (since July 15 of last year),<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the maximum period allowable under the pertinent regulation, unless an assistant attorney general requests a 6-month extension.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The grant of a new hearing to ATL, consistent with this opinion, cannot, of course, compensate for deferred revenues and lost business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Nevertheless, it is not our position to judge the merits of this <em>case </em>\u2014 i.e., who is right or wrong \u2014 but rather to ensure that the procedures which are followed minimize the likelihood of one side or the other acting arbitrarily or improperly.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We are likewise constrained in our review of the trial court\u2019s grant of equitable relief to a determination whether that court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">With these points in mind, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s granting of relief, except that the new hearing that the Navy must hold shall be in terms consistent with part 2 of this opinion. We likewise affirm the Claims Court\u2019s denial of ATL\u2019s request for immediate award of the contracts to it and dismiss ATL\u2019s cross-appeal to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\">.
