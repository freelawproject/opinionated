Based upon a complaint by one of Sisson\u2019s subordinates, Sisson\u2019s commanding officer directed an investigation into Sisson\u2019s activities as an Amway distributor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The investigating officer concluded that Sisson violated the regulation by soliciting and selling Amway products to military personnel who were junior in grade to himself. Sis-son was informed that he could either accept punishment under a nonjudicial disciplinary procedure or submit to a court-martial proceeding. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815 (article 15).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He chose the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-16\">At the time the district court issued its order dismissing the complaint for failure to exhaust available military remedies, the court-martial had not been convened. The failure to exhaust applied to Sisson\u2019s failure to continue through the military court system before requesting relief from the district court. By the time we heard the appeal the court-martial had convicted and sentenced Sisson to a reprimand and a forfeiture of $700 of his pay each month for four months. That sentence was approved by the convening authority, <em>see </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 860, 864) and ordered <em>into </em>execution. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(d). Sisson has not sought review of that decision despite its availability under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 869 (article 69).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>That the court-martial convened and issued a decision during the pendency of this appeal does not moot the issue. Read broadly, the complaint requests that the military be enjoined from enforcing the regulation. At the time of the complaint the injunction would have applied to the impending court-martial. Now the requested injunction applies to enforcement of the court-martial\u2019s decision. At both junctures, Sisson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The question presented before and after the court-martial is identical: whether Sisson has shown some harm greater than that \u201cattendant to resolution of his case in the military court system\u201d to justify the court\u2019s intervention into that system. <em>See Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 758, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 1313, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">We believe that the District Court was sound in dismissing the complaint. <em>Id. </em>Sisson failed to pursue his available military judicial remedies before calling on the civilian courts to act. The military judicial system allows him to request a formal court-martial and to request review of that proceeding. The record is devoid of any showing of the requisite irreparable harm that would justify his failure to exhaust that process before seeking review in the civilian courts. Mere allegations of constitutional infringements will not sustain a civilian court\u2019s intervention into military prosecutions for violations of military regulations. <em>McLucas v. DeChamplain, </em>421 U.S. 21, 33, 95 S.Ct. 1365, 1372, 43 L.Ed.2d 699 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Whatever may be Mrs. Sisson\u2019s rights, they are derivative from her relationship to her husband, and inasmuch as his complaint is not ripe for adjudication by a United States District Court her rights, if any, are also not ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATro\">.

It in no way implicated any commercial activities on the part of Mildred Sisson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AHQ\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815 (article 15) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ8\">Commanding officer's non-judicial punishment \u2014 (a) ... punishment may not be imposed upon any member of the armed forces under this article if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1348-18\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 869 (article 69) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-19\">Every record of trial by general court-martial, in which there has been a finding of guilty and a sentence, the appellate review of which is not otherwise provided for by section 866 of this title (article 66), shall be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General.
