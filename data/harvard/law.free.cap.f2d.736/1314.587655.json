The bankruptcy court found that the debt was intended as spousal support and refused to grant the debtor a discharge. <em>In re Shaver, </em>27 B.R. 452, (Bankr.D.Nev.1983). The district court concurred in the bankruptcy court\u2019s characterization of the debt, and held that the debt was nondischargeable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">Nancy Shaver, the plaintiff in this case, was divorced from the defendant-debtor, Peter Shaver, in Jun\u00e9 1979. The Indiana Superior Court granting the divorce entered an initial decree providing that three of the couple\u2019s four minor children would reside with Nancy, that Peter would pay Nancy $1500 a month in child support and $150,000 in settlement of Nancy\u2019s \u201cproperty rights\u201d. The $150,000 debt was to be paid over a seventy-five month period at a rate of $2,000 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-18\">In December 1979, after a period of negotiations between Nancy and Peter, the court entered an amended decree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under its terms, Nancy would receive $197,300 over a ten-year period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The debt was referred to in the decree as Nancy\u2019s \u201cmarital and dower rights\u201d. The payments were to cease upon Nancy\u2019s death if her death <em>occurred </em>within the ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-19\">In March 1982, Peter Shaver filed a petition in bankruptcy. He asserts that the $197,300 debt owed to Nancy is a property settlement and is dischargeable in bankruptcy. Nancy Shaver instituted this action, contending that the debt is in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support and is not dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-21\">The Bankruptcy Code of 1978 provides that an individual debtor does not receive a discharge from a debt owed \u201cto a spouse, former spouse, or child ... for alimony to, maintenance for, or support of such spouse or child\u201d if the debt is \u201cactually in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support\u201d. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)(B) (1982). This section departs from the general policy of absolution, or \u201cfresh start\u201d, that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>embodied in the federal Bankruptcy Act. It enforces an overriding public policy favoring the enforcement of familial obligations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Putative Spousal Support Right and the Federal Bankruptcy Act, </em>25 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 96 (1977); Note, <em>Dissolution of Marriage and the Bankruptcy Act of 1973: \u201cFresh Start\u201d Forgotten, </em>52 Ind.L.J. 469 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Although Indiana law does not provide for alimony in the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court was not bound by the treatment of the obligation in Indiana courts. Because of the federal interests reflected in the Bankruptcy Act, the courts look to federal law to determine whether an obligation is \u201cactually in the nature of ... support\u201d and is therefore nondischargeable. <em>Stout v. Prussel, </em>691 F.2d 859, 861 (9 Cir.1982). <em>See Erspan v. Badgett, </em>647 F.2d 550 (5 Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982), in which the court stated that \u201cregardless of how a state may choose to define \u2018alimony\u2019, a federal court, for purposes of applying the federal bankruptcy laws, is not bound to a label that a state affixes to an award, and that, consistent with the objectives of federal bankruptcy policy, the substance of the award must govern\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 555. Applying federal standards, the bankruptcy court determined that the debt at issue in this case was nondischargeable. <em>In re Shaver, </em>27 B.R. 452 (Bankr.D.Nev.1983). Because the right to a discharge in bankruptcy is a matter generally left to the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge, we disturb this determination only if we find a gross abuse of discretion. <em>Stout v. Prussel, </em>691 F.2d 859, 861 (9 Cir.1982); <em>see also In re Williams, </em>703 F.2d 1055, 1057-58 (8 Cir.1983), and <em>In re Nelson, </em>20 B.R. 1008 (D.Tenn.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">In determining whether an obligation is intended for support of a former spouse, the court must look beyond the language of the decree to the intent of the parties and to the substance of the obligation. <em>In re Maitlen, </em>658 F.2d 466 (7 Cir.1981); <em>In re Vickers, </em>24 B.R. 112, 114 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1982); <em>In re Ingram, </em>5 B.R. 232, 234 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1980); Comment, <em>Putative Spousal Support Rights and the Federal Bankruptcy Act, </em>25 U.C. L.A.L.Rev. 96, 101 (1977). The courts that have considered this issue have used several factors to aid in the characterization of the debt. If an agreement fails to provide explicitly for spousal support, a court may presume that a so-called \u201cproperty settlement\u201d is intended for support when the circumstances of the case indicate that the recipient spouse needs support. <em>See Stout v. Prussel, </em>691 F.2d 859, 861 (9 Cir.1982). Factors indicating that support is necessary include the presence of minor children and an imbalance in the relative income of the parties. <em>In re Woods, </em>561 F.2d 27, 30 (7 Cir.1977). Similarly, if an obligation terminates on the death or remarriage of the recipient spouse, a court may be inclined to classify the agreement as one for support. <em>Id.; see also Matter of Albin, </em>591 F.2d 94 (9 Cir.1979); <em>In re Ferradino, </em>14 B.R. 196, 198 (Bankr.D.Nev.1981); <em>In re Ingram, 5 </em>B.R. 232, 235 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1980). A property settlement would not be affected by the personal circumstances of the recipient spouse; thus, a change in those circumstances would not affect a true property settlement, although it would affect the need for support. The court will look also to nature and duration of the obligation to determine whether it is intended as sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>port. Support payments tend to mirror the recipient spouse\u2019s need for support. Thus, such payments are generally made directly to the recipient spouse and are paid in installments over a substantial period of time. <em>Matter of Albin, </em>591 F.2d 94, 97 (9 Cir.1979); <em>In re Smith, </em>436 F.Supp. 469 (N.D.Ga.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Each of these factors indicates that the award to Nancy Shaver was one for maintenance and support. No provision was made for Nancy\u2019s support in the divorce decree. Yet, the facts indicate that support payments were necessary. Three minor children remained in her custody. She was unemployed and possessed no special job-related skills. At the time of the divorce, Peter Shaver was the sole owner of a car dealership and had substantial income. In making the so-called property settlement in the initial decree, the judge stated that he had considered \u201c[t]he economic circumstances of the spouse at the time the disposition of property is to become effective [and] [t]he earnings or earning ability of the parties\u201d. Such considerations are irrelevant to a true property settlement, but are of primary importance to a settlement intended for support. The amended decree, entered by agreement of the parties, provided for installment payments over a substantial period of time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The payments were to cease if Nancy died within that time. These provisions are consistent with a support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">We agree with the district court that the intent of the parties in entering into the settlement agreement was to provide support to Nancy, and therefore that the obligation was \u201cin the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support\u201d under federal law. A support obligation is not dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)(B) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">. The stated purpose of the amended decree was to structure the payments in a way that would allow Peter to deduct them from his income taxes. To be deductible, the payments have to constitute support. <em>See 26 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 71(a), (c)(2) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1387-23\">. The district court found that the additional $47,300 represented the taxes that Nancy would have to pay on the support payments received from Peter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">. The rationale for the exemption from discharge for support obligations is threefold: the protection of the spouse who may lack job skills or who may be incapable of working, the protection of minor children who may be neglected if the custodial spouse entered the job market, and the protection of society from an increased welfare burden that may result if debtors could avoid their familial responsibilities by filing for bankruptcy.

Neither circumstance applies to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">. In determining the nature of an obligation imposed by a divorce decree, the federal court must consider subsequent state court alterations in the decree. <em>In re Vickers, </em>24 B.R. 112, 115 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
