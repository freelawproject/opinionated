(Certified) appeals from the district court\u2019s summary judgment denying recovery for overpayment of excise taxes assessed under I.R.C. \u00a7 4061(a). This appeal concerns the application of the \u201ccost-floor\u201d method of computing a manufacturer\u2019s federal excise tax. Specifically, the question we must decide is whether the excise tax must be computed on the basis of total cost, except to the extent it exceeds the retail price, rather than on 75% of the retail price when the sale was at retail and the total cost of manufacture exceeds 75% of the retail price. The position of the United States is that total cost, except to the extent it exceeds the retail sales price, is the proper basis of the tax. The district court, 569 F.Supp. 302 (N.C.Cal.1983), so held and we agree. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-24\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-25\">Certified is a California corporation that manufactures tank trailers and bodies used primarily for the transportation of liquids. During the period in question, 1976 through 1978, Certified made all of its sales at retail. Each sale was individually negotiated on the basis of the customer\u2019s particular specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-26\">The tank trailers and bodies manufactured by Certified are subject to a manufacturer\u2019s excise tax of 10% imposed by I.R.C. \u00a7 4061(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where a manufacturer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>sells only at retail, I.R.C. \u00a7 4216(b)(1) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to compute the excise tax based on a \u201cconstructive sale price.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For all calendar quarters in 1976 through 1978, Certified computed its excise tax by using a tax base of 75% of the retail sales price of each tank trailer sold, without regard to the cost of manufacturing each trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">The IRS, relying on Revenue Ruling 68-202, determined that the proper constructive sales price of Certified\u2019s trailers was not 75% of the retail price but the higher of (a) 75% of the retail sales price or (b) the total cost to manufacture and sell each trailer (including a 10% overhead factor), but in no event more than the actual retail sales price. Applying this \u201ccost-floor\u201d rule, the IRS assessed deficiencies against Certified for each quarter in 1976 through 1978. The actual sales price was the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d for most of Certified\u2019s sales for this period, because Certified\u2019s costs plus 10% exceeded its retail sales price in nearly every reported sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Certified paid a deficiency assessment of $2,646.09 for the second quarter of 1977 and filed a claim for refund, alleging that its tax liability should be calculated on the basis of 75% of the sales price, without regard to cost. When the IRS failed to act on the claim, Certified brought suit in district court seeking a refund of the $2,646.09 plus interest and costs. Certified and the government stipulated that if the assessment for the second quarter of 1977 were upheld the court could enter judgment against Certified for the unpaid assessments for the remaining calendar quarters between 1976 and 1978. The district court granted summary judgment for the government in the amount of $106,276 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-18\">Certified challenges the validity of using the cost-floor rule in Revenue Ruling 68-202 to determine its excise tax liability. The cost-based method of determining a constructive sales price for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 4216(b)(1) has been upheld by the courts, most recently by the Third Circuit in <em>Strick Corp. v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 1194 (3d Cir.1983). We agree with the reasoning in <em>Strick </em>and affirm the application of the cost-floor rule in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">The computation of the federal excise tax liability differs depending on whether the sale is at wholesale or retail. Ordinarily it is computed on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer. <em>See, e.g., Creme Manufacturing Co. v. United States, </em>492 F.2d 515, 518 (5th Cir.1974). However, where a manufacturer sells its products at retail only, I.R.C. \u00a7 4216(b)(1) authorizes the IRS to compute the excise tax with reference to a constructive sales price \u201cas determined by the Secretary.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The constructive sales price attempts to approximate a wholesale price for a manufacturer selling only at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">Treasury regulations issued pursuant to section 4216(b)(1) provide that where a manufacturer has no established practice of selling to wholesale distributors, \u201ca fair market price will be determined by the Commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 148.1-5(b)(l) (1983). The price so determined may not exceed the actual retail price of the article. <em>Id. </em>In a 1954 Revenue Ruling interpreting these Treasury regulations, the Commissioner determined that the \u201cfair market price\u201d for purposes of section 4216(b)(1) is the higher of (a) 75% of the actual sales price, or (b) the cost of production, not to exceed the actual selling price. Rev.Rul. 54-61, 1954-1 C.B. 259. Revenue Ruling 68-202 applies this cost-floor rule to custom manufacturers such as Certified that sell at retail but do not sell at an \u201cestablished retail price.\u201d Rev.Rul. 68-202,1968-1 C.B. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Revenue Rulings, while not binding on the Secretary or on the courts, <em>see Dixon v. United States, </em>381 U.S. 68, 73, 85 S.Ct. 1301, 1304, 14 L.Ed.2d 223 (1965); <em>Washington State Dairy Products Commission v. United States, </em>685 F.2d 298, 300 (9th Cir.1982), will be given considerable weight when explicating the Commissioner\u2019s authority to implement a congressional mandate. <em>Estate of Lang v. Commissioner, </em>613 F.2d 770, 776 (9th Cir.1980). In this instance, section 4216(b)(1) expressly grants to the Secretary discretionary power to determine a constructive sales price. Treasury regulations delegate to the Commissioner authority to determine a \u201cfair market price\u201d for purposes of the section. Treasury regulations \u201cmust be sustained unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the revenue statutes,\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Portland Cement Co., </em>450 U.S. 156, 169, 101 S.Ct. 1037, 1045, 67 L.Ed. 2d 140 (1981) (quoting <em>Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., </em>333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 698, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948)), and those issued under section 4216(b)(1) have been found to be reasonable and consistent with the intent of the statute. <em>Whattoff v. United States, </em>355 F.2d 473, 478 (8th Cir.1966); <em>see also Stride, </em>714 F.2d at 1197. Accordingly, we must give deference to the Revenue Ruling provisions fixing a constructive sales price. <em>See Estate of Lang, </em>613 F.2d at 776; <em>see also National Muffler Dealers Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 472, 484, 99 S.Ct. 1304, 1310, 59 L.Ed.2d 519 (1979) (Commissioner\u2019s consistent interpretation of a statute over time merits \u201cserious deference\u201d); <em>Hamrick v. United States, </em>585 F.2d 1015, 1020 (Ct.Cl.1978) (a Revenue Ruling may be a \u201cdetermination\u201d by the Secretary for purposes of \u00a7 4216(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">Courts have upheld the cost-floor rule contained in the Revenue Rulings because these rulings reasonably assume that \u201ca manufacturer will set his wholesale price to recover at least his costs of production.\u201d <em>Strick, </em>714 F.2d at 1199; <em>see Whattoff, </em>355 F.2d at 478; <em>Technicolor Motion Picture Corp. v. Westover, </em>202 F.2d 224, 229 (9th Cir.1953); <em>cf. Boise National Leasing, Inc. v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 633, 638-39 (9th Cir.1968) (use of costs to determine \u201cfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>market price\u201d for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 4218(e)). Moreover, the drafters of the constructive price provisions contained in section 4216(b)(1) clearly contemplated the possibility of a cost-based method of determining the constructive price. A House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-4\">This [constructive sales] price' may be established with respect to any particular sale or class of sales, for example, by existing wholesale prices, or by a system of discounts from retail prices, <em>or by a building up from cost of production, </em>whichever method may be the most practical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 708, 72d Cong. 1st Sess. (1932), <em>reprinted in </em>1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 457, 480 (emphasis added). The Third Circuit recently undertook a thorough examination of the legislative history of section 4216(b)(1) and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-6\">Timing of issuance, durability, reliance, consistency of interpretation and degree of congressional scrutiny all support a conclusion that the cost-floor alternative was not contrary to the congressional mandate during the 1954-1978 period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4jB\"><em>Stride, </em>714 F.2d at 1200. We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">Certified argues that the cost floor rule should not be applied to manufacturers that sell at retail and at a loss. This argument is supported by <em>Quaker City Iron Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>256 F.Supp. 450 (E.D.Pa.1966). In <em>Quaker City Iron Works, </em>competition had forced the taxpayer manufacturer to sell at retail below cost, resulting in net operating losses for each of six years. The district court held that where a manufacturer sold products below cost over a period of time, application of the \u201ccost-floor\u201d rule conflicted with section 4216(b)(1), which attempts to tax on the basis of a price no higher than the manufacturer could receive at wholesale. 256 F.Supp. at 453-54. The court distinguished <em>Whattoff, </em>an Eighth Circuit decision, by arguing that there was no showing in the earlier case that sales had been made below cost.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">The decision in <em>Quaker City Iron Works </em>has not been followed, and its reasoning has been questioned. The Third Circuit in <em>Strick, </em>while distinguishing <em>Quaker City Iron Works </em>on the grounds that the taxpayer before it had not lost money during the relevant period, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-11\">More fundamentally, however, <em>Whattoff </em>and analogous cases offer a more persuasive and carefully reasoned analysis of the issues and legislative history. <em>Quaker City Iron Works </em>stands almost alone in rejecting a cost-based method of calculating a constructive sales price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">714 F.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">We agree with the Third Circuit, and decline to follow <em>Quaker City Iron Works. </em>The statute under which the cost-floor rule was promulgated provides no basis for distinguishing between manufacturers operating at a profit and those operating at a loss. It is reasonable to set a constructive price based on cost, because products are ordinarily sold at a price above cost. Moreover, manufacturers are not taxed on the basis of unrecovered costs because the constructive sales price cannot exceed the actual selling price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">Nor does the cost floor rule improperly discriminate against high cost manufacturers. In <em>FW. Fitch Co. v. United States, </em>323 U.S. 582, 65 S.Ct. 409, 89 L.Ed. 472 (1945), the Supreme Court rejected a discriminatory impact claim. There a manufacturer of cosmetics argued that including advertising and selling expenses in the price on which the excise tax was imposed unfairly discriminated against manufacturers who did their own selling and advertising. The Court found that, in light of differing business methods employed by competing manufacturers, some discrimination was \u201can unavoidable consequence of an excise tax based on the wholesale selling price.\u201d 323 U.S. at 586-87, 65 S.Ct. at 411-12. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>Congressional statements relating to the desirability of eliminating discriminations against manufacturers making retail sales cannot be taken as evidence of a desire to prevent the natural inequalities that result when a tax is placed on the wholesale selling price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 587-88, 65 S.Ct. at 412 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">Cases upholding the cost-based method of determining a constructive sales price for purposes of section 4216(b)(1) have rejected the discriminatory impact argument. <em>See, e.g., Strick, </em>714 F.2d at 1200-02 (rejecting claim that the cost-floor rule in Revenue Ruling 54-61 put high cost taxpayer at a disadvantage, contrary to legislative intent of uniformity in administering section 4216(b)(1)); <em>Hamrick, </em>585 F.2d at 1019-20 (rejecting taxpayer\u2019s assertion that the constructive sales price for retail sales should be computed according to competitor\u2019s wholesale price and not according to own costs); <em>Callis-Thompson, Inc. v. United States, </em>1980-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 16,335, at 84,423 (D.Del.) (manufacturer\u2019s contention of competitive disadvantage forestalled by <em>Fitch).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">Finally, the discriminatory impact argument cuts two ways. Were Certified to prevail in this case, its basis for the excise tax (75% of the retail price) would be lower than that of a manufacturer whose retail price was the same as Certified\u2019s but whose costs were less than the retail price but higher than 75% of the retail price. Only by ignoring costs altogether, a position inconsistent with the intent of Congress, could this discriminatory impact be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-9\">Certified also argues that the cost-floor rule violates section 4216 by not permitting a manufacturer to determine its tax liability in advance of sale. This argument is without merit. The legislative history of the 1932 Act on which Certified relies addresses the need to avoid retroactive changes in methods of computing the excise tax.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It does not require that a manufacturer using an established method of computing the tax be allowed to determine its precise tax liability in advance of sale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Strick, </em>714 F.2d at 1197-1202; <em>Whattoff, </em>355 F.2d at 478; <em>Callis-Thompson, </em>1980-1 U.S. Tax Cas. \u00b6 16,335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1456-18\">.
