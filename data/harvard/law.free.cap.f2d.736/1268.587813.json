Accordingly, the memorandum disposition of November 29, 1983, is withdrawn. In its place, we file the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b1341-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">In <em>Beller v. Middendorf, </em>632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir.1980), this court held that it was constitutionally permissible for the Navy to discharge appellant James Miller, among others, for homosexuality. On November 16, 1981, when the Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari in that case, the Navy was free to discharge Miller. According to Miller\u2019s allegations, however, the Navy retained him and even gave him the equivalent of a promotion. In December 1982, the Navy finally informed Miller that he would be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">Miller responded by suing in district court for equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order. The district court denied Miller\u2019s request. A motions panel of this court then granted Miller an injunction to prevent the Navy from discharging him pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">As an initial matter, the Navy argues that we have no jurisdiction over this case because the denial of a temporary restraining order, as a general matter, is not an appealable order. But an exception to this rule allows us to hear an appeal if the \u201cdenial of <em>all </em>relief was implied in the trial judge\u2019s denial of a temporary restraining order.\u201d <em>Kimball v. Commandant Twelfth Naval Dist., </em>423 F.2d 88, 90 (9th Cir.1970). In this case, the district court denied Miller\u2019s petition by bare citation of the earlier decision in <em>Beller. </em>The district court thus implied that principles of claim preclusion prevented Miller, one of the losing parties in <em>Beller, </em>from receiving any of the relief he requested. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order meets the standard for appealability set forth in <em>Kimball.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, we conclude that the district court\u2019s application of claim preclusion doctrine was erroneous. <em>Beller </em>concerned the constitutionality of certain military regulations. Miller\u2019s petition to the district court in this action, however, set forth theories of equitable estoppel, constructive enlistment, and retaliatory discharge. Miller is essentially arguing that, even if the Navy could have discharged him when <em>Beller </em>became final, the Navy\u2019s conduct since then estops it from discharging him now. In other words, Miller asserts new claims that arose after <em>Beller </em>was decided and thus cannot be barred by preclusion principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">Because the district court applied an erroneous legal standard to Miller\u2019s petition for equitable relief, we remand and instruct the district court to issue a temporary restraining order preventing the Navy from discharging Miller. This order shall remain in force until the district court either grants or denies a preliminary injunction. We express no opinion, of course, on how the district court should rule on Miller\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. We merely preserve Miller\u2019s right to have that request decided under the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
