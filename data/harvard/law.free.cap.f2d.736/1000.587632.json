HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1072-25\">Appomattox River Water Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) petitions for review of an or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>der by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \u201cFERC\u201d) issuing a preliminary permit to Brasfield Dam Development, Ltd. (\u201cBrasfield\u201d), and denying a permit to the Authority, for exploration of the development of hydroelectric power. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The George F. Brasfield Dam is located on the Appomattox River approximately five miles upstream of the City of Peters-burg in Chesterfield County, Virginia. A reservoir, Lake Chesdin, is impounded by the dam to provide water for the area\u2019s residents and for recreation. Brasfield and the Authority filed competing applications for a preliminary permit to explore the development of hydroelectric power at the dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">On October 27, 1980, Brasfield filed its application. Brasfield\u2019s proposed plan included: (1) use of the existing dam; (2) use of the existing reservoir; (3) construction of a proposed powerhouse with an estimated installed generating capacity of 4,500 kilowatts (\u201ckw\u201d) and an estimated installed average annual energy output of 24,100 megawatt-hours (\u201cmwh\u201d); and (4) potential upgrading of approximately 2.5 miles of a low voltage transmission line to interconnect with a major transmission line of Virginia Electric Power Company (VEPCO). Brasfield proposed to sell the power produced at the facility to either the Authority or VEPCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">More than three months later, on February 10, 1981, the Authority filed a competing, preliminary permit application. Its proposed plan included: (1) use of the existing dam; (2) use of the existing reservoir; (3) construction of a proposed powerhouse with an estimated installed generating capacity of 6,000 kw and an estimated annual average output of 21,000 mwh; and (4) construction of a small power line to interconnect with VEPCO\u2019s line. The Authority proposed to utilize some of the power produced at the facility itself and to sell some of the power to VEPCO. The Authority\u2019s application, as second filed, also contained a statement of reasons why its plan was better adapted than the plan submitted by Brasfield, \u201cto develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">On August 26, 1981, the Director of the FERC\u2019s Office of Electric Power Regulation (the \u201cDirector\u201d), issued a preliminary permit to Brasfield. The Director found that neither applicant had presented a plan for hydroelectric generation based on detailed studies and concluded that, at this early stage, there were no significant, substantiated differences in the two applications which would enable him to determine which plan was superior. Relying on the FERC\u2019s first-to-file regulation, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(g)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Director denied the Authority\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">The Authority appealed, contending: (1) that the FERC should prefer local ownership of and responsibility for the project over an absentee landlord; (2) that development by .the Authority was more feasible than development by Brasfield; and (3) that hydroelectric development by a party other than the Authority would conflict with the project\u2019s function as a water supply. The FERC held that the Authority\u2019s contentions were \u201cunsubstantiated and at the permit stage not dispositive since permit proposals are speculative in nature.\u201d The FERC concluded that geographic distance from the proposed site was not a determining factor in evaluating permit proposals. The FERC further concluded that to base a best-adapted finding at the permit stage on alleged lower cost would be premature since the plans of both Bras-field and Appomattox were supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>only preliminary studies and estimates. The FERC, therefore, denied the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Director. The Authority petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On appeal, the Authority contends that the FERC erred in failing to evaluate and compare the merits of the two competing applications for preliminary permit and in awarding a permit to the first applicant to file. The Authority maintains that it was the superior applicant. First, the Authority argues that because it owns the dam and reservoir and has established a superior record of stewardship of the land and resources, it is singularly qualified to discharge the public interest responsibilities of licensees. Second, it argues that its development of the project would be economically superior to that proposed by Brasfield primarily because it will not incur any costs for the acquisition of the dam, reservoir, and lands underlying the project. Finally, the Authority argues that the FERC did not meaningfully compare the merits of the applications and that its reasons for refusing to evaluate the Authority\u2019s evidence are inadequate and irrelevant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a <em>et seq., </em>authorizes the FERC to regulate the development of hydroelectric power on United States land or on waters over which Congress has jurisdiction. The FERC exercises that authority by issuing licenses or granting exemptions from licensing for the construction and maintenance of the necessary facilities for such water development. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 797(e); 823a; 2705(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">The Act, as a predicate to the licensing process, authorizes the FERC to issue preliminary permits to enable prospective license applicants to gather data for submission of license applications and obtain necessary financial commitments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 797(f). FERC regulations require applicants for a preliminary permit to submit the following information: (1) a description of the proposed project; (2) a description of studies conducted or proposed to be conducted during the term of the preliminary permit; and (3) a statement of estimated costs and expected sources of financing. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">Where more than one person applies for a preliminary permit, the Act creates a mandatory preference for applications by states and municipalities and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-10\">[A]s between other applicants, the Commission may give preference to the applicant the plans of which it finds and determines are best adapted to develop, conserve, arid utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, if it be satisfied as to the ability of the applicant to carry out such plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 800(a). In all other cases, if the FERC finds the preliminary proposals equally well-adapted to efficient use of the water, the first filing party receives the permit. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(g)(2). A preliminary permittee maintains priority of application for a license against potential rivals for the period of the permit, not to exceed three years, during which time the recipient may conduct the necessary examinations and surveys, prepare maps, plans, specifications, and estimates, and make financial arrangements. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">At the licensing stage, the FERC accepts and evaluates proposals from all interested parties. More detailed information is required of license applicants than permit applicants. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 802; 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.40-.70. The licensee will not necessarily be the permittee; however, if license applicants\u2019 plans are equally well-adapted, the FERC will prefer the permittee. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 798, 800; 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.33(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">The scope of our review of the FERC\u2019s action is narrow. This Court may set aside the FERC\u2019s order only if we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), or unsupported by substantial evidence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(E), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825Z(b). <em>See also City of Dothan, Alabama v. FERC, </em>684 F.2d 159, 164 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Delaware River Basin Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number><em>sion v. FERC, </em>680 F.2d 16,18 (3d Cir.1982). There is no allegation that the FERC\u2019s first-in-time regulation is improper under the enabling statute. Instead, the Authority argues that the FERC failed to evaluate properly the plans of Brasfield and the Authority as a prelude to finding them adapted to the public interest objectives of the Act. We hold that substantial evidence supports the FERC\u2019s decision and that it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in granting the preliminary permit to Bras-field as the applicant that filed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">The plans of Brasfield and the Authority contained no significant differences and are, in fact, substantially identical. Although the plans differed slightly in the estimated number of generating units and capacity, the FERC has held that such differences are not dispositive at the permit stage in determining the best adapted plan, since the plans of all applicants are fluid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Authority does not contend that these project differences form a basis for finding its proposal better adapted than Bras-field\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The Authority\u2019s contention that its proposal is superior to Brasfield\u2019s is instead grounded upon differences unrelated to the project itself. The Authority argues that it owns and operates the existing dam and reservoir. The Act does not create a preference for site-owner applicants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, after denying the Authority\u2019s appeal, the FERC expressly rejected similar arguments for ownership preference in <em>Franklin Falls Hydro Electric Corporation, </em>24 FERC \u00b6 61,348 (Sept. 26, 1983). The FERC held here, and has held previously, that geographic distance from the site is not a determining factor in evaluating a preliminary permit proposal. <em>John J. Hockberger, Sr., </em>20 FERC \u00b6 61,087 (July 23, 1982); <em>Town of New Roads, Louisiana, </em>12 FERC \u00b6 61,093 (July 31, 1980). As explained by the FERC in <em>Hockberger.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-11\">[A] preliminary permit\u2019s terms and conditions themselves recognize the fluidity of the permittee\u2019s plans and that any eventual application for a license may differ in important respects from the proposal set forth in the application for a preliminary permit. To determine how the project\u2019s structures could be best adapted requires the results of the detailed studies and agency consultation to be conducted under the permit. Because of the speculative nature of preliminary permit proposals, the Commission has not attached decisional significance to factors such as geographical distance from the site____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">We find the FERC\u2019s approach to be rational. All other factors being equal, we can see no basis for making ownership or geographic proximity dispositive at the permit stage, when other, potentially offsetting considerations have not yet been studied or quantified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">Finally, we conclude that the FERC\u2019s decision to defer a comparison of economic feasibility to the licensing stage is eminently rational. The Third Circuit recognized in <em>Delaware River Basin Commission v. FERC, </em>680 F.2d 16 (3d Cir.1982), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-14\">To obtain a license [for development of a hydroelectric project], a prospective applicant must provide the Commission with a plethora of information, including feasibility studies, planned compliance with state laws and other relevant data. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 802; 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1 <em>et seq. </em>Compliance with statutory and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>tory conditions takes time and money, and an applicant may not be willing to undertake these up-front expenses without some level of protection. To deal with that situation, the Act authorizes the Commission to issue preliminary permits \u201cfor the purpose of enabling applicants for a license ... to secure the data and to perform the acts required by section 802 of this title.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 17. One of the primary studies undertaken by the permittee is determination of the economic feasibility of the project. Thus, we hold that the Authority\u2019s allegations of lower development costs will be more appropriately considered at the licensing stage than at the permit stage, after detailed studies have been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Brasfield\u2019s preliminary permit simply entitles it to maintain priority of application for a license; that is, for the period of the preliminary permit, no party other than Brasfield may file a license application. Thereafter, the Authority is not precluded from filing a competing license application. At bottom, if the Authority demonstrates that its license proposal is best adapted to the objectives of the Act, it will receive the license. The Authority\u2019s contentions will be proper factors for consideration by the Commission at the licensing stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">The Authority\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the FERC is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 800(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Alei\">.

Moreover, the FERC will impose conditions upon whoever is the permittee or licensee to insure that hydroelectric projects are administered in a manner designed to protect the environment and the public interest.
