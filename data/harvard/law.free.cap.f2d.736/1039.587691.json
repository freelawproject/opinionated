Today we decide this question \u2014 one of first impression in the courts of appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but one foreshadowed by Supreme Court authority \u2014 in the affirmative. We hold that Baylor University Medical Center (Baylor), whose inpatient and emergency room services receive Medicaid and Medicare payments, must allow the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) access to the facility and information requested for the purposes of investigating a complaint of discrimination on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>basis of handicap. In so holding, we affirm the decision of the district court. However, we find that the district court\u2019s immediate suspension of all Medicare and Medicaid payments to Baylor until it allows HHS the statutorily required access unduly penalizes beneficiaries of programs supported by these forms of federal assistance \u2014 i.e., patients and would-be patients in Baylor\u2019s inpatient and emergency programs. Vacating the district court\u2019s order as an abuse of discretion, we substitute our own order: that Baylor comply with HHS\u2019s request within 30 days or face termination of Medicare and Medicaid funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">In May 1980, HHS received a complaint that Baylor refused to allow a deaf patient to bring an interpreter into the hospital (at no expense to the hospital) so that she could understand her pre- and post-operative discussions with the medical staff. HHS informed Baylor by letter that, as a recipient of federal financial assistance, it was obliged to comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (Supp.1982), and that HHS had received a complaint that Baylor\u2019s actions may have violated the Act. Section 504 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-6\">No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">HHS stated in the letter that it was responsible for investigating the complaint of discrimination and that an on-site review would be necessary. Baylor responded that, in its view, it is not a recipient of federal assistance for purposes of coverage of Section 504 and refused to allow the investigation. Further negotiation failed to resolve the impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">In March 1982, the United States filed suit, alleging that Baylor\u2019s refusal to permit HHS access to the Center\u2019s facilities in order to investigate the complaint HHS had received violated Section 504 and federal regulations implementing the Act. Baylor moved for summary judgment on the ground that none of the federal funds it received constituted federal financial assistance for the purposes of Section 504. The United States cross-moved for summary judgment; noting that Baylor had stipulated that it received Medicare and Medicaid funds,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United States argued that these funds constituted federal financial assistance to Baylor, assistance that empowered HHS to investigate Baylor\u2019s compliance with Section 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion, 564 F.Supp. 1495 (N.D.Tex.1983). It held: (a) the government had the right to sue to enforce Baylor\u2019s contractual assurance that it would comply with Section 504, thus creating federal jurisdiction, (b) the rights and duties of Section 504 apply to recipients of federal financial assistance; since Baylor received Medicare and Medicaid funds, it is the \u201crecipient\u201d of the funds and so must honor those rights and duties if the funds are federal financial assistance, and (c) Medicare and Medicaid are \u201cfederal financial assistance\u201d for the purposes of Section 504. In reaching the last conclusion, the court noted that the substantive provisions of the Rehabilitation Act were modeled on Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d <em>et seq., </em>and Title IX, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681; therefore, in interpreting the Act, courts must look to the judicial interpretation of those two major civil rights statutes. The court found support for holding that Medicare and Medicaid trigger Section 504 in HHS regulations which explicitly state that Medicare and Medicaid are \u201cfederal financial assistance for Section 504 purposes,\u201d <em>see </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80, App. A \u00b6 121 (Medicare), and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84, App. A Subpart A, Def. 1 (Medicaid), in district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>court holdings in this and other circuits, and in the legislative history of Section 504, Title VI, and the Medicare/Medicaid legislation. Citing <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 60.3, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960), for the proposition that government benefits are not a contractual interest or property right, the court rejected Baylor\u2019s argument that Medicare and Medicaid come under the exception in- the Rehabilitation Act for contracts of insurance. Last, the court found that HHS had properly targeted a \u201cprogram\u201d \u2014 Baylor\u2019s inpatient and emergency room services \u2014 for investigation, and noted that the fact that the actual complainant was not a Medicare or Medicaid recipient did not prevent HHS\u2019s investigation since the Rehabilitation Act is intended to prohibit discrimination in <em>\u201cprograms </em>which receive federal financial assistance\u201d without limiting that protection to the direct beneficiaries of the federal assistance. The court determined that Baylor had violated Section 504 and applicable regulations in denying HHS access to the information requested and ordered that all future Medicare and Medicaid payments be suspended so long as Baylor continues to deny HHS access. This Court stayed the order pending appeal. 711 F.2d 38, 39 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">In granting a stay pending appeal, we recognized that \u201c[wjhether Medicare and Medicaid payments constitute federal financial assistance within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act is a serious legal question that could have a broad impact upon federal/state relations\u201d and, therefore, \u201ca court ... would want to make a detailed and in-depth examination of this ... issue\u201d before authorizing the investigation requested here. <em>Baylor, </em>711 F.2d at 40. This appeal also requires us to define the scope of coverage: did the district court properly define the \u201cprogram or activity\u201d receiving federal assistance in permitting the HHS investigation to cover inpatient and emergency room services? Finally, is the remedy ordered by the district court-immediate termination of all Medicare and Medicaid payments until Baylor allows HHS the requested access \u2014 within the court\u2019s power and within the judicious exercise of its discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">We hold that Medicare and Medicaid are federal financial assistance for the purpose of Section 504, and that the district court did not err in defining inpatient and emergency room services as the \u201cprogram or activity\u201d that would be the appropriate target of HHS\u2019s investigation as the result of the alleged violation of Section 504. However, we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the district court abused its discretion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in ordering immediate termination of payments, and we accordingly revise its order so as to grant the hospital a reasonable grace period to comply with HHS investigatory requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\"><em>A. </em>We ground our determination that the receipt of Medicare and Medicaid payments triggers Section 504 coverage on three congruent sources: the legislative history of that group of statutes prohibiting discrimination in federally funded programs \u2014 Title VI, Title IX and the Rehabilitation Act, judicial interpretation of these, and regulations adopted pursuant to them. Our examination of these sources indicates that this court could not excuse from the coverage of Section 504 and its counterparts hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid without frustrating Congress\u2019 clear and consistent purpose to protect handicapped persons and members of minority groups from discrimination in programs receiving federal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, set out above, is one piece of a larger statutory structure designed to prevent invidious discrimination in federally funded programs. The section was explicitly patterned on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>seminal discrimination prohibitions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in federally funded programs and echoes verbatim the prohibitions of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded educational programs. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 93-1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted at </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6373, 6390 (\u201cSection 504 was patterned after, and is almost identical to, the anti-discrimination language of section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964)\u201d; <em>Lloyd v. Regional Transportation Authority, </em>548 F.2d 1277, 1280 &amp; n. 9 (7th Cir.1977); 119 Cong.Rec. S6144-S6145 (daily ed. March 1, 1973) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey, indicating that Section 504 represented substitute for amendments to Title VI to protect the handicapped). In 1978, Congress reemphasized the identity of the prohibitions in the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services and Development Disabilities Amendments, Pub.L. No. 95-602. Section 120 of the Amendments, \u00a7 505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2) (Supp.1983) points directly to Title VI as a model for Section 504:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-4\">The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance under section [504] of this [Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\"><em>See also, </em>S.Rep. No. 95-890, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted at </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7312; <em>Community Television of Southern California v. Gottfried, </em>459 U.S. 498, 103 S.Ct. 885, 892, 74 L.Ed.2d 705 (1983); <em>Gottfried v. FCC, </em>655 F.2d 297, 312 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1144, 102 S.Ct. 998, 71. L.Ed.2d 292 (1981). Accordingly, when determining whether Medicaid and Medicare payments are federal financial assistance to a program or activity under Section 504, the legislative history and judicial interpretation of Title VI and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act provide appropriate and necessary guidance, <em>Brown v. Sibley, </em>650 F.2d 760, 767-69 (5th Cir.1981),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> particularly where, as here, we establish new rules of law that will have a significant impact on major policy issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\"><em>B. </em>Passed as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI had a single overriding purpose: \u201cto make sure that the funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination.\u201d 110 Cong.Rec. 6544 (comments of Sen. Humphrey).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute implements this purpose by preventing service providers receiving federal funds from discriminating in programs in which individual beneficiaries of the federal aid participate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Title VI binds the service provider, or \u201crecipient,\u201d thus it affords a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>remedy against discrimination by recipients to <em>all </em>participants in a federally funded program,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> not merely to the individual beneficiaries of the federal aid<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 since eligibility for a specific type of aid is determined by criteria unrelated to the discrimination Congress sought to prevent. <em>Cf. University of California Regents v. Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 285, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2745, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (Powell, J.) (\u201cThe problem confronting Congress [vis-avis Title VI] was discrimination against Negro citizens at the hands of recipients of federal money.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">One specific area of discrimination in services provided by recipients concerning Congress at the time Title VI was passed was discrimination by hospitals and other medical facilities in the provision of health care services. <em>See, e.g., </em>110 Cong.Rec. 1661 (1964) (views of Sens. Lindsay, McCulloch, Cahill, Shriver, MacGregor, Mathias, Bromwell) (Title VI should counteract existing racial discrimination in \u201cvendor payments for medical care of public assistance recipients. Hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics in all parts of the country participate in these programs____\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">One year after the passage of Title VI, Congress enacted Medicare and Medicaid as a means to assure that the aged, disabled, and poor would be able to secure necessary medical services. See Pub.L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286. Under Medicare Part A,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the subject of this lawsuit, the government pays the hospital for certain in-hospital treatment for those aged and disabled persons covered by the Act. The program is financed entirely by payroll tax deductions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 (1983), and federal payments may be made only to hospitals which meet certain conditions of participation established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395d(d)(2) (1983). The Medicaid program provides to state governments federal funds that the state, after establishing a federally approved plan, uses to pay for medical aid for the poor and disadvantaged. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">Although the issue of whether Medicare and Medicaid are federal financial assistance to a program or activity of a recipient was not extensively debated when the legislation was enacted in 1965, several Senators stated that the prohibitions of Title VI would apply to recipients of Medicare and Medicaid payments. <em>See, e.g., </em>111 Cong. Rec. 15803 (1965) (remarks of Senator Ribicoff) (in order to receive federal payments, hospitals would have \u201cto abide by Title VI\u201d); 111 Cong.Rec. 15813 (1965) (comments of Sen. Hart);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>ibid </em>(comments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>Sen. Pastore).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No senator voiced an opposing view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Indeed, the Medicaid legislation passed in 1965 merely expanded an existing program of federal aid to states for health care for the poor, the Kerr-Mills program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-306 (1964). This program was one of those cited during the passage of Title VI as being a federal program which Title VI would cover,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>see </em>110 Cong.Rec. 13132 (# 41) (1964); <em>see also </em>110 Cong.Rec. 1661 (1964) (comments of Reps. Lindsay, McCulloch, Cahill, Shriver, MacGregor, Mathias, and Bromwell).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">As noted above,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the language and legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act make it abundantly clear that Congress intended the scope and effect of that statute\u2019s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap to be exactly equivalent to Title Vi\u2019s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race. Moreover, the legislative history of the Medicare and Medicaid bill indicates that Congress had no doubt that these forms of federal assistance would trigger federal antidiscrimination protections.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Our conclusion that Congress intended Medicare and Medicaid to constitute \u201cfederal financial assistance\u201d for the purposes of Section 504 is strengthened by a recent House Committee report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">It has come to the Committee\u2019s attention that some uncertainty remains in some quarters as to whether or not health care facilities and other providers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are recipients of Federal financial assistance. In view of the Committee, it has always been clear the Medicare and Medicaid funds constitute Federal financial assistance. The Committee wishes to reaffirm that health care facilities and other providers that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds are required, under existing statutes and long-standing Department of Health and Human Services regulations and interpretations, to provide services without discrimination not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>just to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, but to all patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">H.R.Rep. No. 98-442, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (Oct. 26, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\"><em>C. </em>Those courts that have considered the issue before us have, with a single exception, interpreted the legislative intent as we do today. Only six cases have expressly considered whether Medicare and Medicaid constitute federal financial assistance to hospitals triggering Section 504 and Title VI. Five of these, including the only district court opinion to have received appellate affirmance on this point, hold that Medicare and Medicaid do indeed invoke the protections of the federal discrimination statutes. <em>See NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1247, 1248 n. 4 (3d Cir.1979), <em>aff'd in relevant part, </em>453 F.Supp. 280, later proceeding, 453 F.Supp. 330 (D.Del.1978), (affirming district court determination that hospital\u2019s receipt of Medicare, Medicaid and unspecified \u201cother\u201d assistance triggered Section 504 and Title VI); <em>United States v. University Hospital of SUNY at Stony Brook, </em>575 F.Supp. 607 (EDNY 1983), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>729 F.2d 144 (2d Cir.1984) (legislative history reveals Medicare and Medicaid are \u201cfederal financial assistance for purposes of \u00a7 504\u201d); <em>United States v. Cabrini Medical Center, </em>497 F.Supp. 95, 96 n. 1 (SDNY 1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>639 F.2d 908 (2d Cir.1981) (same); <em>Cook v. Ochsner Foundation Hospital, </em>Civ.

Bell, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984). In <em>Grove City, </em>the Court relied predominantly on Congressional exchanges in debate to hold that a college\u2019s receipt of Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOGs) \u2014federal grants extended to college students for college expenses \u2014 requires the college to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in \u201cany education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\u201d The Court noted that Congress enacted both Title IX and the BEOG program in the same bill and that the debate engendered several express references to the bill\u2019s attempt to prevent discrimination in student aid programs. The Court held that \u201cit would indeed be anamalous\u201d to suppose that a Congress so concerned over discrimination in student aid did not intend the federal student aid program it was then enacting to trigger a contemporaneous federal law reaching sex discrimination in education. \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>In reaching its conclusion, the Court specifically recognized that Title IX must be interpreted as part of a broad government policy, of which Title VI is the keystone, to prevent discrimination in programs receiving federal assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-4\">Title IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d <em>et seq. </em>(1976 and Supp. V). <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 684-685, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1951, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); 118 Cong.Rec. 5807 (1972) (Sen. Bayh). The drafters of Title VI envisioned that the receipt of student aid funds would trigger coverage, and, since they approved identical language, we discern no reason to believe that the Congressmen who voted for Title IX intended a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1218 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Similarly in this case, Congressional discussion in 1965 regarding Medicare and Medicaid demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent that those payments invoke Title VI coverage \u2014 and, therefore, Section 504 coverage.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As with BEOGs, an individual is eligible for Medicare and Medicaid payments only if the recipient (here, the hospital) participates in the Medicare or Medicaid programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\"><em>D. </em>Courts engaging in precedential analysis of statutes, as we do here, must \u201caccord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 275, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1762, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . Agency regulations implementing Section 504 and Title VI reaffirm our conclusion. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (the predecessor to the Department of Health and Human Services) expressly included Medicare and Medicaid as programs covered by Title VI, <em>see </em>38 Fed.Reg. 17982 (1973); 40 Fed.Reg. 18173 (1975) , and HHS\u2019s regulations continue to list these programs among those covered by Title VI. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. Part 80, Appendix A at Part 1, # 121 and Part 2, # 30. The Department\u2019s regulations implementing Section 504 expressly state that service providers whose only source of federal financial assistance is Medicaid \u201cshould be regarded as recipients under the statute and the regulation and should be held individually responsible for administering services in a non-discriminatory fashion.\u201d 45 C.F.R. Part 84, App. A, Subpart A(l). (source: 42 Fed.Reg. 22677 (1977)). Just as the language of Section 504 itself tracks that of Title VI, so the definitions of pertinent terms in the regulations under Section 504 substantially echo those under Title VI.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-15\"><em>E. </em>Baylor\u2019s several arguments in opposition seek to distinguish between federal aid granted directly to an institution and federal aid received by an institution by virtue of the participation of individual beneficiaries in federal programs. Although these do not lack force, we conclude that the considerations voiced by us above and the general thrust of <em>Grove City </em>foreclose them. For example, Baylor argues that the antidiscrimination statutes recognize a distinction between direct institutional assistance and aid received through individual beneficiaries; that federal assistance tied to a federal requirement that it be used to pay for participation in a specific type of program is analogous to general-purpose governmental assistance such as food stamps or disability pay (which do not trigger the statutes), and that the coverage of the statutes does not extend to the program as a whole, but is limited to the individual beneficiaries of the particular federal aid. In <em>Grove City, </em>the Supreme Court looked to the legislative history of Title VI to reject identical arguments made by the college in the context of BEOGs and Title VI, <em>see </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1217 (rejecting distinction between direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>and indirect assistance); <em>id. </em>at note 13 (rejecting analogy between BEOGs and general purpose aid); <em>id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1221, note 21 (rejecting restricting coverage to beneficiaries only). The Court's course of reasoning compels us similarly to reject these arguments in the context of the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We also reject as frivolous Baylor\u2019s argument that Medicare and Medicaid are exempt from the statutory scheme because payment occurs after treatment. Quite simply, the nature of hospital services requires payment after they are rendered, when costs can be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">One further argument made by Baylor merits our brief attention. Baylor argues that Medicare and Medicaid are insurance programs and thus exempt from the coverage of Title VI and Section 504. While it is true that Title VI excludes from coverage a federal \u201ccontract of insurance or guaranty\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we conclude that this exception does not prevent Medicare or Medicaid from triggering Section 504. We observe first that the Rehabilitation Act, unlike Title VI, contains no such exclusion. Assuming, however, that this exception implicitly applies to Section 504,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> neither Medicare nor Medicaid is the type of contractual program Congress intended to exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">As the legislative history makes abundantly clear<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>, in excluding \u201ccontracts of insurance or guaranty\u201d from Title VI, Congress intended to prevent Title VI from reaching individually owned homes financed with federally guaranteed mortgages, or individual bank accounts in a bank with federally guaranteed deposits. In other words, Congress did not want Title VI to effect a nationwide Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">Although the Medicare title of the Social Security Act is \u201cHealth Insurance for the Aged and Disabled,\u201d comments during the debate reveal that legislators used the term in the sense of \u201csocial insurance\u201d; the bill is described as \u201csocial insurance,\u201d \u201csocial legislation,\u201d or \u201cassistance for the elderly.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> More fundamentally, the mandatory nature of coverage and the financing of the program through mandatory payroll taxes distinguishes it from the voluntary, individually-financed agreements Congress intended to exempt.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>Additionally, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960), that Social Security benefits are not contractual interests and do not create property rights in the beneficiary because of the nature of the funding system, 363 U.S. at 610, 80 S.Ct. at 1372, compels finding no \u201ccontract\u201d in Medicare Part A, which uses the same funding system as the social security disability program at issue in <em>Flemming.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Nor may Medicaid be considered a federal \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d program. Federal assistance under Medicaid goes to a state which contributes funds and administers the program for health care for the poor and disadvantaged. Called \u201cassistance\u201d during the debates and in the statutes, Medicaid is in no way comparable to an insurance program, but closely resembles in its financial structure such prominent Title VI programs as the school lunch program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1751-64 (1964), and the Hill-Burton Program for hospital construction, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291 (1964), in which federal assistance given to the states was distributed by the states to local school districts or hospital construction projects.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Our consideration of Baylor\u2019s arguments strengthens our conclusion: Baylor\u2019s receipt of Medicare and Medicaid payments subjects it to appropriate federal action under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Section 504 prohibits discrimination based on handicap in any \u201cprogram or activity\u201d receiving federal financial assistance. Under Title VI provisions expressly applicable to Section 504,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the scope of HHS investigations and corrective actions is limited to actions by recipients taken under or which may affect those of the recipient\u2019s programs or activities that get federal financial assistance. <em>See North Haven Board of Education v. Bell, </em>456 U.S. 512, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982) (Title IX agency action must be program-specific), <em>Grove City, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 1219, (same). Baylor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>argues that the district court did not specify for HHS scrutiny a \u201cprogram\u201d receiving Medicare and Medicaid, as Section 504 requires, but authorized complete investigation of the hospital as an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">However, we find no fault with the district court\u2019s holding that HHS may investigate Baylor\u2019s policies for handicapped patients receiving inpatient and emergency room services. A brief reference to the Medicare statute and to Baylor\u2019s own accounting statements demonstrates that Baylor\u2019s inpatient and emergency room services are the programs receiving this federal assistance and may thus be proper subjects for HHS investigation. The Medicare statute specifically mentions inpatient and emergency room services among those covered by the Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c, 1395d, 1395f(d)(l). Also, while a recipient\u2019s bookkeeping practices may not be dispositive on the issue of which of its programs receive particular federal funds, <em>see Grove City, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1219-22, Baylor\u2019s own records confirm that its inpatient and emergency room services receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the investigation authorized was properly \u201cprogram specific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">We turn last to the appropriateness of the remedial order imposed by the district court. Having found Baylor in violation of Section 504 in refusing to provide HHS with the requested information and access, the district court ordered all future Medicare and Medicaid payments to the hospital suspended \u201cfor as long as\u201d Baylor continues to deny HHS access. This immediate termination of benefits stands in contrast to the administrative remedy provided by statute, under which the agency must file a report with Congress and thirty days must thereafter elapse before termination of funds or other sanction is imposed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-l. We find the thirty-day waiting period provided by statute indicative of Congressional intent that service providers be granted a grace period for compliance in order to avoid punishing the beneficiaries of the federal aid for the errors of service providers by abruptly depriving the providers, and hence the individual beneficiaries, of the federal aid in question. In failing adequately to consider this legislative intent in the context of the particular circumstances, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">We do not mean to imply that a federal agency seeking to enforce antidiscrimination provisions of Section 504 must resort to administrative remedies. The statute expressly states otherwise: an agency may resort to \u201cany other means authorized by law\u201d \u2014 including the federal courts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Marion County School District, </em>625 F.2d 607 (5th Cir.1980), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>451 U.S. 910, 101 S.Ct. 1980, 68 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981) (HEW permitted to sue to enforce school district\u2019s compliance agreement under Title VI). Nor do we mean to suggest that a court in the position of the district court here may not grant a remedy other than that envisioned in the context of administrative proceedings. We hold simply that the district court abused its discretion in not considering Congress\u2019 intent to cushion beneficiaries from the immediate deprivation of benefits. Moreover, we do not discern here those egregious circumstances that might warrant the imposition of a remedy as harsh as that imposed by the district court. Accordingly, we vacate the order and grant Baylor thirty days after that on which our mandate issues to comply with HHS\u2019s request; if it does not do so as of that time, we direct the immediate suspension of all future Medicare and Medicaid funds to the hospital\u2019s inpatient and emergency room services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-13\">The order below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND MODIFIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">. We recognize that in <em>NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, </em>599 F.2d 1247 (3rd Cir.1979), the Third Circuit affirmed a district court opinion holding, in part, that Medicare and Medicaid trigger \u00a7 504.

These indications that Congress intended Medicare and Medicaid to trigger Section 504 and Title VI are supported by later legislative activity. In 1974, the Senate passed an amendment to legislation regarding a White House Library Conference. The amendment would have established that Medicare payments to nursing homes run by fraternal organizations like the Masons should not be regarded as federal financial assistance, thereby exempting those homes from coverage of Title VI. Although the Senate passed the amendment, 120 Cong.Rec. 39993-39994 (1974), it was eliminated in conference. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1409, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1974), 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6779, 6797.
