The district court dismissed the action with prejudice concluding that Rothenberger filed his complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after the 180-day limitation period had run and that his complaints of retaliation and due process violations failed to state causes of action, 580 F.Supp. 210. Rothenberger appeals this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">We have carefully considered the briefs of both parties, the record on appeal, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 oral arguments. Finding no error of law or fact, we affirm based on the well-reasoned decision of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
