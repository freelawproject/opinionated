HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">First National Bank of Commerce, Elizabeth Pendleton, TK Valve Manufacturing, Inc., Terry C. Helm, and the Profit Sharing Plan of TK Valve and Manufacturing, Inc., defendants below, appeal an order remanding this case to a Louisiana state court. In addition, J.W. Soley has moved to dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">This case began as a negligent misrepresentation claim filed in a Louisiana state court by J.W. Soley. The appellants subsequently removed to a federal district court, alleging complete preemption under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109 and 1132. Soley moved to remand the case to state court, but the district court denied the motion. Soley then amended his complaint to include an ERISA breach of fiduciary duty claim. The defendants moved to dismiss the entire complaint, alleging that ERISA preempted the state law claims and that Soley failed to state a claim under ERISA. The district court, in response, vacated its earlier order denying Soley\u2019s motion to remand and issued an order remanding the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The TK Valve appellants petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus ordering the federal district court to retain jurisdiction over the case, but we denied the petition. All of the appellants have also filed notices of appeal, and Soley has filed a motion to dismiss the appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). We earlier ordered that the motion to dismiss be carried with the case, and we address the motion with the appeal at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">The district court remanded the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), which states that \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. Under \u00a7 1447(d), \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d The Supreme Court has stated that the two provisions must be construed together, so that \u201conly remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the grounds specified therein\u2014 that removal was improvident and without jurisdiction \u2014 are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 346, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>S.Ct. 584, 591, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976). But if an order falls within \u00a7 1447(c), then \u00a7 1447(d) bars review even if the remand order is clearly erroneous. <em>Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Although \u00a7 1447(d) seems fairly harsh, its purpose is to prevent delay through protracted litigation of jurisdictional issues. <em>Thermtron, </em>423 U.S. at 351, 96 S.Ct. at 593. As recently explained by the Ninth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">Congress\u2019 concern that parties might use the appeal process to protract litigation over jurisdictional issues and thereby further delay litigation over the merits of the case reflects a balancing of competing interests resolved in favor of judicial economy. The availability of a federal forum through the removal procedure had to be weighed against the interest of expeditious resolution of a dispute initiated in state court. Congress decided that in cases begun in state court, lengthy delays over jurisdictional issues are unacceptable. Consequently, the district court is the final arbiter of whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\"><em>Pelleport Investors v. Budco Quality Theatres, </em>741 F.2d 273, 277 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The appellants argue that \u00a7 1447(d) does not bar review of the district court\u2019s remand order for two reasons. First, they contend that \u00a7 1447(d) does not bar a direct appeal of a remand order based on the resolution of a matter of substantive law, citing <em>Pelleport </em>and <em>Clorox v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for N.D. of California, </em>779 F.2d 517 (9th Cir.1985). In both cases, the Ninth Circuit stated that \u00a7 1447(d) extends only to remand orders based on lack of jurisdiction. \u201c[WJhere a district court bypasses the jurisdictional arguments and reaches the merits of a ... dispute, the policy of [\u00a7 1447(d)] is inapplicable. Any delay caused by [the] appeal ... is a delay that must be countenanced.\u201d <em>Pelleport, </em>741 F.2d at 277. In <em>Pelleport, </em>the Ninth Circuit reviewed a remand order based on a forum selection clause; and in <em>Clorox, </em>it construed a petition for mandamus as a notice of appeal and reviewed a remand order based on estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Although this court has also limited the scope of \u00a7 1447(d), our opinions are narrower. While the Ninth Circuit will look \u201cbeyond the language of the remand order to all the surrounding circumstances\u201d in determining whether the order was based on a substantive decision on the merits, we have stated that we will only review remand orders if the district court \u201caffirmatively states a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <em>Compare Clorox, </em>779 F.2d at 520; <em>with In re Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>587 F.2d 642, 647 (5th Cir.1978). As we explained in <em>Merrimack:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">[I]t is now clear that <em>Thermtron </em>announced only a narrow rule that was intended to be limited to the extreme facts of that case, in which a district judge stated openly that he was relying on a non-1447(c) ground for remand. The <em>Thermtron </em>Court never stated that it was willing to construe the seemingly-absolute bar of \u00a7 1447(c) as extending beyond the exceptional facts of that case, and [Gravitt] has demonstrated its unwillingness to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\"><em>Id. Accord Royal v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>685 F.2d 124, 136 (5th Cir.1982); and <em>In re Weaver, </em>610 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Two courts have considered the applicability of \u00a7 1447(d) to remand orders based on preemption. In <em>Whitman v. Raley\u2019s Inc. </em>and <em>Krentz v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., </em>886 F.2d 1177 (9th Cir.1989), companion cases, the appellants originally removed to federal court on the ground that federal law completely preempted the state claims, and the district courts subsequently issued remand orders. <em>Whitman </em>involved a wrongful termination claim allegedly preempted by the LMRA, and <em>Krentz </em>a tortious refusal to pay benefits claim allegedly preempted by ERISA. The Ninth Circuit drew a helpful distinction between \u201ccomplete preemption\u201d, a jurisdictional issue, and the \u201cpreemption defense,\u201d a substantive inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">The jurisdictional question concerning \u201ccomplete preemption\u201d centers on wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>er it was the intent of Congress to make the cause of action a federal cause of action and removable despite the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint identifies only state claims. The latter inquiry, concerning a \u201cpreemption defense,\u201d is a substantive inquiry as to whether a legal defense exists. This would be a matter for trial by a court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIy\"><em>Id. </em>at 1181. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 66, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1548, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987), even an obvious preemption defense does not usually confer removal jurisdiction because of the \u201cwell pleaded complaint\u201d rule. Instead, \u201cthe touchstone of [a] federal district court\u2019s removal jurisdiction is ... the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Citing <em>Taylor, </em>the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u00a7 1447(d) barred review of the remand orders in both <em>Whitman </em>and <em>Krentz </em>because the remand orders were based on the \u201ccomplete preemption\u201d doctrine and also noted that, because the orders were jurisdictional, they would have no preclusive effect on the state courts\u2019 consideration of the preemption defenses. <em>Whitman, </em>886 F.2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><em>Glasser v. Amalgamated Workers Union Local 88, </em>806 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir.1986), also involved a wrongful denial of benefits claim. Again the appellants removed on the ground that ERISA completely preempted the state claims, and the district court remanded after concluding that ERISA only provided preemption defenses. The Eleventh Circuit first refused to adopt a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d exception to \u00a7 1447(d) as urged by the appellants. The court then went on to conclude that <em>Pelle-port </em>and <em>Clorox </em>were inapplicable, noting that although the decision underlying the remand order involved a conclusion of substantive law, the substantive law decision related only to the question of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1540. The court found it particularly relevant that the district court did not reach the merits of the preemption defense; its opinion thus did not affect the appellants\u2019 substantive rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The district court\u2019s remand order in this case is a bit more ambiguous than in <em>Whitman, Krentz, </em>and <em>Glasser. </em>The district court opened by stating that the case \u201cdoes not <em>arise under </em>ERISA\u201d (emphasis added), suggesting that the decision was jurisdictional. In explaining this conclusion, however, the district court reasoned that So-ley\u2019s claims were not \u201cwithin the boundaries of ERISA pre-emption\u201d and that any remedies were thus state and not federal. This explanation appears to implicate the substantive preemption defense issue rather than the jurisdictional issue. Although we thus find the order confusing, we conclude that our decision in <em>Merrimack </em>precludes review of the remand order because the district court did not clearly and affirmatively state that it relied on a non-1447(c) ground. <em>See also Royal, </em>685 F.2d at 136; and <em>In re Weaver, </em>610 F.2d at 337. We take comfort in the fact that, because we construe the order as jurisdictional, the district court\u2019s statements will have no preclu-sive effect on the state court\u2019s consideration of the substantive preemption defense. <em>See Whitman, </em>886 F.2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The appellants also argue that a substantive decision \u201cnecessarily preceded\u201d the decision to remand and that \u00a7 1447(d) does not bar a direct appeal of this \u201cseparable portion\u201d of the remand order, citing <em>Waco v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; G. Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934), and <em>Mitchell v. Carlson, </em>896 F.2d 128 (5th Cir.1990). In <em>Waco, </em>293 U.S. at 143, 55 S.Ct. at 7, the Supreme Court held that an order dismissing a cross-action, and consequently destroying diversity, was appealable because \u201cin logic and in fact the decree of dismissal preceded that of remand.\u201d We picked up on this language in <em>Mitchell </em>and concluded that the portion of a remand order that resubstituted an individual for the United States as defendant, and thus destroyed removal jurisdiction, was separable from the remand order and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The appellants suggest that the district court\u2019s remand order in this ease similarly contained a separable portion rejecting ERISA preemption as a defense. But, as discussed above, it is unclear whether the district court based the remand order on the jurisdictional issue or the substantive preemption defense. And even if the appellant\u2019s interpretation of the remand order is correct, the rejection of an ERISA pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>emption defense does not \u201cin logic and in fact\u201d precede a remand order because, under the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint\u201d rule, a defense does not confer removal jurisdiction. Instead, if the district court considered the preemption defense, it did so only because of an erroneous belief that the defense was relevant to the jurisdictional issue. The distinction is important because, in both <em>Waco </em>and <em>Mitchell, </em>the \u201cseparable portion\u201d of the order denied a right not subject to review by the state court. In <em>Waco, </em>the state court would not reconsider the dismissal of the cross-action; and in <em>Mitchell, </em>the state court would not reconsider the resubstitution order. In this case, by contrast, because we interpret the remand order as jurisdictional, the state court will have an opportunity to consider the appellants\u2019 preemption defense and the district court\u2019s order will have no preclu-sive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Because we conclude that \u00a7 1447(d) bars us from reviewing the remand order, we do not reach the appellants\u2019 arguments on the preemption issue. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
