It was claimed by the plaintiff that several of the officers of the defendants, who were charged with the care of the park, were present and assisted in taking down the pole. The pole fell against the telegraph wire, and thereby a telegraph pole, situated at the corner of Murray street and Broadway, was pulled over and fell upon her, causing injury, of which she afterward died. The testimony was that the pole was cut down by men and boys, after working hours; that Michael Reilly, a gardener, employed by the defendants, had \u201c something to do with it.\u201d That the keeper of the park, Donohue, had not received or given any order for the removal of the pole. That no order for its removal had been given by the superintendent of lands and places, whose duty it would have been to have ordered such removal, if it had been desired. That it was no part of the duty of Beilly, the gardener, to undertake the removal of the pole. It also appears that the telegraph pole was maintained and controlled hy the Metropolitan Police Department; that it was rotten at the base where it broke off. The action was tried by a jury. It was admitted by the defendants\u2019 counsel, on the trial, that the defendants, on the 27th day of June, 1865, were the owners of the city hall park, in the city of Hew York, and in possession thereof. And it was consented that the plaintiff might read in evidence, on his behalf, the ordinances of the defendants, as published by them, relevant to the issues herein; subject, however, to any objections the defendants might make as to relevancy or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then read in evidence an extract from the ordinances of the city corporation, specifying the duties of the superintendent of public parks and places, passed May 20, 1849, (chapter 5, section 29,) as follows: \u201c An ordinance organizing the departments of the munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>pal government of the city of Yew York, and prescribing their powers and duties.

The motion was denied, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">The defendants also requested the court to charge that if the jury believed the telegraph pole would not have fallen except from the fact of its being unsound, then the plaintiff could not recover. The court denied the request, and exception was taken. The defendants further requested the court to charge that the cutting down a liberty pole was not a repair such as Reilly might, without any specific direction, cause to be done. The court denied the request, and exception was taken. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, for $ 1100.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-6\"><em>Richard O\u2019Gorman </em>and <em>John K. Hackett, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMO\">I. The motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted. 1. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish affirmatively that the removal of the liberty pole was done by the corporation, through its officers. There is no such proof in the case. It is proven that \u201cmen and hoys\u201d were engaged in pulling it down. That it was done after \u201cworking hours.\u201d The only testimony tending to connect any officer of the city with the occurrence is, that Michael Reilly, gardener of the park, had \u201csomething to do with it.\u201d What that something was, whether he directed the removal, or remonstrated against it, does not appear. It is therefore submitted, that this testimony is entirely insufficient to connect the corporation with the occurrence. 2. But if it be conceded that Reilly directed the removal of the liberty pole, the corporation is not liable, <em>(a.) </em>Because the removal of the pole was not within the scope of Reilly\u2019s duties as gardener. This fact is proven affirmatively by the testimony of Ward, the superintendent of lands and places, and of Donohue, the keeper of the park. (5.) Because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>not directed to remove the pole by the defendants. Mr. Ward, the only person from whom such an order could properly issue to him, testifies that no such order was issued, (e.) It also appears that the removal of the pole was done \u201cafter working hours,\u201d at a time when the corporation had ceased to control or direct the occupation of their employees. The negligence by which the plaintiff suffered was therefore committed by Reilly while engaged in an employment not authorized or directed by the defendants. A corporation is liable for a tortious act committed by an agent pursuant to its direction in relation to matters within the scope of its powers; but not for any unauthorized act of its officers, though done <em>colore officii. (Angell &amp; Ames on </em>Corporations, 250, 330. <em>Boom </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>2 <em>Barb. </em>104. <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Cunliff, </em>2 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>165.) 3. The unsoundness of the telegraph pole was the immediate cause of the injury suffered. The falling of the liberty pole was the remote cause. <em>\u201cIn jure non remota causa sed pr\u00f3xima spectatur.\u201d (Brown\u2019s Legal Maxims, </em>202.) Lord Bacon says: \u201cIt were infinite for the law to judge the cause of causes and their impulsions one of another: therefore it contenteth itself with the immediate cause without looking to any further degree.\u201d <em>(Bac. Max. Reg. </em>1. <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dic. \u201cCausa.\u201d </em>3 <em>Barr\u2019s Rep. </em>470. 6 <em>Adol. &amp; Eilis, </em>75. 11 <em>John. </em>15.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-5\"><em>Joseph M. Pray, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APe\">I. The motion to dismiss the complaint, when the plaintiff rested, was properly denied. 1. There was evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict that the defendants had caused the injury complained of, and that it occurred through their negligence. <em>(a.) </em>The defendants had charge of the public park. It was under their exclusive control, and all improvements and repairs therein could only be carried on and all obstructions removed by their authority. (<em>Wendell v. The Mayor &amp;c. of Troy, </em>39 <em>Barb. </em>329. <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Trustees of Ithaca, 16 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>N. Y. Rep. </em>159, <em>and note. Hickok </em>v. <em>Trustees of Village of Plattsburgh, Id. Barton </em>v. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>36 <em>id. </em>54. <em>See Ordinance, fol. </em>84.) They were bound to remove the pole if it became dangerous to human life, and to remove it with proper safeguards. <em>(Austin </em>v. <em>H. R. R. Co., </em>25 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>334. <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Trustees of Ithaca, </em>16 <em>id. </em>159. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>City of Brooklyn, </em>41 <em>Barb. </em>381.) <em>(b.) </em>The testimony shows satisfactorily that they were acting, in so doing,, by their usual agents. Michael Reilly, the gardener, was engaged about it; James Donohue, park-keeper, was present and advising. <em>(Drew </em>v. <em>The Sixth Avenue Bailroad, </em>26 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>49. <em>Devin </em>v. <em>Patchin, Id. </em>441.) (e.) But they carelessly and negligently allowed a crowd of men and boys to pull the rope, apparently for sport, and, without paying attention to the wire, they pulled the rope towards it. In so doing, they not only pulled down the wire belonging to the city, crossing the park, but also thereby pulled down the pole to which the wire was attached on Murray street, and caused it to fall upon the deceased. <em>(Cases above cited. Benson </em>v. <em>Suarez, </em>19 <em>Abb. </em>61. <em>Althorf v. Wolf, </em>22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>355.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-8\">II. The motion\"to dismiss the complaint at the close of the testimony, was properly denied. 1. The defendants\u2019 responsibility was then clearer than before. 2. The proof of the falling of the liberty pole upon the wire, is sufficient and satisfactory. 3. There was at least evidence tending to prove material portions of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and therefore the case was properly sent to the jury. <em>(Mallory </em>v. <em>The Tioga Railroad Co., </em>1 <em>Transcript Appeals, </em>204. <em>Ernst </em>v. <em>Hudson River Railroad Co., 35 N. Y. Rep. </em>35, 40. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>N. Y. Central Railroad Co., </em>3 <em>Trans. Appeals, </em>8. <em>Wolfkiel </em>v. <em>Sixth Avenue Railroad, </em>5 <em>id. </em>219. <em>Van Rensselaer </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>2 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>135.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-9\">III. The condition of the telegraph pole does not affect the case; especially, as by the defendants\u2019 testimony it belonged to them; and the court properly refused to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>as requested by 'the defendants\u2019 counsel. 2. The court properly refused to charge as requested by the defendants, in reference to cutting down the liberty pole, <em>(a.) </em>The defendants were required to see that the pole was removed in a proper manner, and under proper superintendence. <em>(See Ordinances, fol. </em>84; <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Ruckman, &amp;c., </em>37 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>568; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>36 <em>id. </em>54; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>City of Brooklyn, </em>41 <em>Barb. </em>381; <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Trustees of Rondout, </em>44 <em>id. </em>385.) <em>(b.) </em>The defendants are responsible for the act of Beilly, if they allowed him to cut the pole down. <em>(Althorf </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>25 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>355.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">IV. The damages found by the jury were not excessive, and were sustained by the evidence; and no objection was taken at the trial as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the question of damages. <em>(Drew </em>v. <em>Sixth Avenue Railroad, </em>26 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>49.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">V. Bo exception was taken to the charge of the court, and no other requests to charge were made by the defendants. Without such requests and exception, the defendants are to be deemed to have acquiesced in the charge. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>N. Y. Cent. Railroad, </em>3 <em>Trans. Appeals, </em>11. <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Tioga Railroad, </em>1 <em>id. </em>204. <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>18 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>558. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Cook, 8 id. </em>78.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">VI. All the other objections taken at the trial were properly overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">VII. The appeal is taken from the judgment only, and not from the decision on the motion for a new trial, and the verdict, therefore, cannot be disturbed upon the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-10\"><em>By the Court, </em>Geo. G. Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A66\">The defendants had sole charge of the city hall park, and were bound to so manage it that life should be protected. If the pole, the removal of which caused the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, was dangerous, the defendants were bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>remove it. If for any reason the defendants wished its removal, they had the power to remove it. In any case, they were hound to remove it carefully. The defendants\u2019 gardener, on removing it, did it so unskillfully that it was precipitated against a telegraph pole, which was thereby broken off and cast against the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, causing her death. The pole which was removed had been put up for a specific purpose, which had ceased to exist, and it appears to have been dangerous, as it broke into pieces in falling. Under these circumstances, the gardener was justified in the removal, as to the defendants, without an express order, and this would make the defendants liable if the act was unskillfully done. <em>(Harlow </em>v. <em>Humiston, </em>6 <em>Cowen, </em>189.)</p>\n<court id=\"b246-7\">[New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"AAJ\">June 7, 1869.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is entirely immaterial whether the injury was caused by the liberty pole, directly, or by the telegraph pole being driven by the liberty pole. It was the unskillful removal of the liberty pole which caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A1P\"><em>Clerke, Geo. G.
