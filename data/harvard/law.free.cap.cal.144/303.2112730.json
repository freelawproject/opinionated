The only points made by his counsel are: 1. Misconduct of the district attorney on the trial prejudicial to the accused; 2. That the district attorney was permitted on the trial to read from the testimony of a witness given at the preliminary examination for tho purpose of refreshing his memory; and 3. That a witness who had testified as to a conversation with the defendant Gerard was permitted on redirect examination to testify as to another conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">These objections, with perhaps one exception, are of a trivial character. As to the last point, the matter was within the discretion of the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benc, </em>130 Cal. 165.) As to the second\u2014if there was error\u2014there was nothing in the passages read to the witness from his previous testimony that could have prejudiced the accused. As to the remaining point (under which there are several specifications) we see nothing reprehensible in the conduct of the district attorney, unless it was in asking the defendant when testifying as a witness on his own behalf whether he had not been convicted of a felony. And as to this it is unnecessary to express an opinion, as it is clear that the question\u2014which was answered in the negative\u2014could have done the defendant no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">We advise that the judgment and order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Chipman, C., and Harrison, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">McFarland, J., Henshaw, J., Lorigan, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
