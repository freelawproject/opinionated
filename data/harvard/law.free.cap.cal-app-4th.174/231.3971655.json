On retrial, a second jury convicted defendant of one count of criminal threat. (\u00a7 422.) It also determined that defendant personally used a handgun in making the threat (\u00a7 12022.5, subd.

On February 20, 2007, Meraz was outside in the complex\u2019s parking lot talking with a friend who was working on a car. Patrice Watson was also there.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">A maroon, four-door sedan pulled into the parking lot, with rap music blaring from inside. Three people exited the car. Defendant, the car\u2019s driver, was rapping and singing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Meraz told his friend that defendant\u2019s singing sounded like a song Elmo from Sesame Street had rapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Defendant heard Meraz\u2019s remark. He asked Meraz if he was trying to be funny. Surprised, Meraz stood back and went about his business. He also replied angrily and called defendant \u201cboy.\u201d Watson testified that defendant told Meraz to watch his \u201cM F\u201d mouth, and then words went back and forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Defendant and his companions walked up a flight of stairs and into an apartment. Watson stated that before defendant went inside, he broke the window of one of the apartments. Meraz did not see that act or hear any glass breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>A man nicknamed \u201cPumpkin\u201d came out of the upstairs apartment and asked Meraz if the three men had been \u201ctripping\u201d with him. Pumpkin said he would handle it. Meraz, thinking the incident amounted to nothing, did not respond, and he went back to talking with his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Eventually, defendant and his two companions came out from the apartment. Watson testified that defendant stood at the railing, telling Meraz he did not know whom he was messing with. Defendant said he ran Oak Park. As defendant walked down the stairs, he told Meraz, \u201cEve got something for you.\u201d Defendant and Meraz renewed their verbal confrontation. Meraz told defendant he was not scared. At the bottom of the stairs, defendant told Watson to tell Meraz he had better respect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Meraz testified that he did not hear, or could not recall, any of these statements by defendant. He claimed he did not exchange any words with defendant while defendant was coming down the stairs. He did, however, watch defendant come down the stairs, and he gave defendant \u201chard looks\u201d while he walked back to his car. His fists may even have been clenched. Meraz was prepared to fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Defendant and his companions got back into their car. Meraz walked up to the car in an aggressive manner. When he put his hands on the passenger door and looked in, he saw defendant seated in the driver\u2019s seat holding a handgun up to his chest. The gun was pointed away from Meraz. Defendant repeatedly asked Meraz, \u201c[I]s there a problem, bitch? Is there a problem bitch? Is there a fucking problem, bitch?\u201d Defendant put his left hand down to the side, pulled out another gun, and handed it to his front seat passenger. The passenger in the backseat leaned forward and also displayed a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Meraz suddenly felt his life was in danger. He threw up his hands, backed away from the car, and told defendant he did not want any trouble \u201clike that.\u201d Meraz backed away as far has he could to a fence. As defendant backed the car up to leave, he and his passengers continued calling Meraz a \u201cbitch\u201d and asking if there was \u201ca fucking problem.\u201d Meraz believed they were doing anything they could to get him to respond. Afraid of being shot, Meraz said nothing. He \u201csort of blacked out to what they were saying\u201d at that time. However, as the car drove away, Meraz heard someone from inside the car say, \u201c[Y]ou better not be here when we get back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Watson testified she saw defendant point his gun at Meraz as he started to back the car out. At that point, Watson moved away from Meraz. One of the passengers in the car said to her, \u201c[Y]eah, mom, go in the house.\u201d Believing the three men \u201cwere about to light [Meraz] up,\u201d Watson went into her apartment. She told her daughter and niece to take her grandchild into the room and lie down on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Meraz was able to remember the car\u2019s license plate. He ran to his apartment and called 9-1-1. He feared for his life and that of his family, and he believed the men would return to harm them. He told the operator the three men were going to come back because that was what they had said, and he wanted the police to get to the complex quickly in case the men returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the dispatch based on Meraz\u2019s call, Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Donny Vettel noticed he was driving behind defendant\u2019s car. Defendant pulled into an apartment complex and parked the car. Deputy Vettel activated his lights. Defendant and the rear seat passenger got out of the car and ran. The deputy yelled at the men to stop, but they ran around a building and out of sight. Deputy Vettel did not pursue them. No one remained in defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Robert Patton drove past the apartment complex, he saw defendant and another person running through the complex and jumping over a wall surrounding a garbage dumpster. Deputy Patton exited his car, identified himself, and ordered the two men to put their hands over their heads. Defendant and his companion looked at the deputy, jumped back over the wall, and ran through the complex. Deputy Patton ran after them, but when the two men ran in separate directions, the deputy stopped his pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Robert White arrived at the complex to assist Deputy Vettel. As Deputy White was driving around the complex, defendant ran towards Deputy White\u2019s car. Defendant\u2019s right hand was in his pants. Deputy White slammed on his brakes, got out of his car, pointed his gun at defendant, and commanded defendant to stop. Defendant turned, ran away through a parking lot, and ran behind a concrete retaining wall and out of the deputy\u2019s sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Seconds later, defendant ran around the retaining wall and jumped over a fence into a park. Both of defendant\u2019s hands were now visible. Deputy White jumped onto the fence, pointed his gun at defendant, and told him to lie down and give up. Defendant did.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Deputy White searched the area. Behind the retaining wall, he found a black wool jacket and a sock containing a .38-caliber handgun. There were five expended shell casings in the gun but no live ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department Detective John Sydow testified that defendant was a validated member of the Oak Park Bloods criminal street gang. A tattoo on the back of defendant\u2019s hand indicated he was affiliated with the 33rd Street subset of the Oak Park Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Detective Sydow related two examples of the Oak Park Bloods\u2019 primary activities, neither of which involved defendant. In the first incident, a gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>member was exchanging words with a man from a rival gang in 2005. The other man stated he was from Oak Park and asked the Bloods member why he had not seen him around Oak Park. Believing he had been \u201cdisrespected,\u201d the Bloods member responded by shooting the man five times. The man survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The second incident occurred in April 2004. A Bloods member attempted to steal a car and yelled at the Russian driver to get out of the car. When the Russian man refused to get out, the Bloods member shot him in the chest. The man ultimately died from the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Detective Sydow stated the apartment complex where Meraz and Watson lived was generally controlled by the Oak Park Bloods and specifically by the Ridezilla subset of the Oak Park Bloods for the sale of narcotics.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ridezilla and Oak Park Bloods gang members would intimidate the residents and neighbors to prevent them from reporting the gang\u2019s drug sales to the police. The police received many calls from residents, but when officers responded, the complaining residents could not be found or would deny placing the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Detective Sydow opined that in a hypothetical situation based on the facts of this case, the criminal threats were done for the benefit of the Oak Park Bloods. If a citizen of the apartment complex were to stand up to a Bloods member, others would watch to see whether the gang member would respond. In the deputy\u2019s opinion, the gang member could not let the confrontation pass without responding. In order to earn respect for himself and his gang, the member would do whatever was necessary to intimidate the citizen. Without earning this type of respect, the gang would be unable to accomplish its crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">I-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\n<em>Multiple Convictions of Violating Section 148</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Defendant claims error occurred when he was convicted of three separate misdemeanor counts of resisting a peace officer in the discharge of his duty. (\u00a7 148, subd. (a).) He asserts that because the multiple counts arose from a single, nonviolent act, he can be convicted at most of only one count. Alternatively, he claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not move to dismiss two of the counts. We disagree with both of his arguments. Defendant can be convicted for each peace officer he resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Unless the Legislature says otherwise, if a defendant commits a single criminal act that affects multiple victims, he can be convicted of multiple counts of violating the same statute only if the gravamen of the offense \u201cis centrally an \u2018act of violence against the person.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilkoff v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 345, 351 [211 Cal.Rptr. 742, 696 P.2d 134], quoting <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 20 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Regarding section 148, the Legislature has said otherwise. It has treated violations of section 148 similar to how the courts treat a violent criminal act that affects multiple victims. A defendant can be convicted under section 148 for each peace officer he obstructs, even if he engages in only one act of obstruction. This rule is found in subdivision (e) of section 148. The statute reads, in pertinent part: \u201cA person may be convicted of multiple violations of this section [section 148] if more than one public officer, peace officer, or emergency medical technician are victims.\u201d (\u00a7 148, subd. (e).) (Neither party cited this subdivision to us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The Legislature could not have been clearer. If, in the course of resisting an officer, a defendant resists another officer, he is guilty of committing a second separate offense and may be convicted separately for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The facts of this case highlight why section 148, subdivision (e), is good policy. The pursuing deputies attempted to apprehend defendant while knowing he might have been armed, and one of the deputies drew his weapon to make the arrest. Defendant put himself, the deputies, and the public at risk of harm each time, and in each place, he refused to obey the deputies. His conduct in this case makes him more culpable than a person who resists arrest by only one officer in one location.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1159 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 694] (Garcia) to assert he is subject to only one conviction, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that case is distinguishable. There, the defendant was convicted of three counts of felony evading a peace officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a)). <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>at pp. 1161-1162.) The Court of Appeal reversed two of the counts. Although the pursuit had involved multiple peace officers in multiple vehicles, \u201cthe evading was an uninterrupted single course of conduct, i.e., one continuous act of driving lasting 30 minutes. The statutory language . . . contemplates a continuous course of driving, which may transpire over a short or long period of time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1163.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Here, even if defendant\u2019s acts of resisting arrest were one continuous act, the statutory language is different. Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Garcia, </em>section 148 expressly states a defendant can be convicted for each officer whose exercise of duty he resists. <em>Garcia </em>does not apply to this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The evidence shows defendant resisted arrest by three different peace officers. Under the express language of section 148, defendant could be convicted for each officer whose exercise of duty he resisted. Thus, there was no error, and defense counsel did not render ineffective assistance by not moving to dismiss two of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\n<em>Multiple Punishments on Section 148 Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">We turn from the issue of multiple convictions to the issue of multiple punishments. Defendant claims the trial court violated section 654 when it imposed concurrent one-year jail terms for each violation of section 148. He argues section 654 required the court to stay imposition of sentence on two of the misdemeanor counts because the three convictions were based on a single course of conduct and the acts of resisting were incident to one objective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Section 654, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Case law has expanded the meaning of section 654 to apply to more than one criminal act when there is a course of conduct that violates more than one statute but nevertheless constitutes an indivisible transaction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1211 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].) \u201cSection 654 precludes multiple punishment for a single act or indivisible course of conduct punishable under more than one criminal statute. Whether a course of conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the \u2018intent and objective\u2019 of the actor. <em>(Neal v. State of </em>California[, <em>supra,] </em>55 Cal.2d [at p. 19].) If all of the offenses are incident to one objective, the court may punish the defendant for any one of the offenses, but not more than one. <em>(People v. Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 551 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) If, however, the defendant had multiple or simultaneous objectives, independent of and not merely incidental to each other, the defendant may be punished for each violation committed in pursuit of each objective even though the violations shared common acts or were parts of an otherwise indivisible course of conduct. <em>(People v. Beamon </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 625, 639 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681, 504 P.2d 905].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 263, 267-268 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cThe determination of whether there was more than one objective is a factual determination, which will not be reversed on appeal unless unsupported by the evidence presented at trial. [Citation.] The factual finding that there was more than one objective must be supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Saffle </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 434, 438 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 648].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Defendant claims the facts at best support a finding that he violated section 148 with one and the same objective\u2014to avoid arrest by the officers. The Attorney General argues the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implicit determination that defendant violated section 148 three times with an independent criminal objective for each violation\u2014to avoid arrest by each particular officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We agree with the Attorney General. Defendant formed a new and independent intent with each officer he encountered. Moreover, each encounter between an armed peace officer and an armed, fleeing felon carried with it the potential for death or great bodily injury for the officer, for defendant, and for differing sets of residents of the apartment complex where the three encounters occurred. We conclude on the facts of this case that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implicit determination that defendant had a separate objective for each violation of section 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>VII, VIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Scotland, P.

The <em>Smith </em>court made no mention of the Legislature\u2019s contrary directive in section 148, subdivision (e), perhaps because the defendant in that case pleaded guilty to only one count of violating section 148, even though he violated the statute numerous times against at least two peace officers. <em>(Smith, supra, </em>at pp. 693-694, 696-697.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 231.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
