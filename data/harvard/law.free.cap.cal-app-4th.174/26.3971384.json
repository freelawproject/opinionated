In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we agree with some of defendant\u2019s arguments regarding his probation conditions and will modify those conditions accordingly; otherwise, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments and will therefore affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">On a late afternoon in September 2007, Mary Harris was in her car, which was parked near the Gottschalks store at El Camino and Watt Avenues in Sacramento. As she was waiting for a call on her cell phone, she saw two men about 20 feet away \u201ckind of wandering in the general direction of [her] car.\u201d One of the men was an African-American, about 17 or 18 years old, wearing a dark \u201choodie.\u201d The African-American man moved toward the passenger side of her car while she lost sight of the other man. As she reached to start the car, a man whom Harris believed to be the other man she had seen walking toward her car appeared at her window with his hand under his shirt and said, \u201cgive me your purse, bitch.\u201d Harris \u201ckind of froze for just a second,\u201d and the man said, \u201cgive me your [purse] or I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d as he tapped a gun on the car window. Harris handed him her purse, and he turned and ran back in the direction from which he had come.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">A witness in a nearby pickup truck saw the two men walking together, then heard, faintly, \u201cgive me your purse.\u201d He then saw two men running away, one holding a purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Another witness saw defendant, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, walking in the parking lot. She later saw defendant and another man, whom she identified as codefendant Pham, running; defendant was holding a purse, which he shoved under his shirt. They ran around the other side of a van, and when the van drove away, the men were gone, so she assumed they had jumped inside. As the witness was later driving away from the mall, she spotted the van again. The witness called 911 and followed the van. As she did so, she saw defendant and Pham pulling items out of the purse. The witness continued following the van on El Camino Avenue and then on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Fulton Avenue until the van pulled into a parking lot and was surrounded by police cars. Two people, one of whom was a Black male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, jumped out of the van and ran toward a nearby business called Goore\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">An employee of Goore\u2019s saw a person with a black \u201choodie\u201d in the store. After hearing from a coworker that the person had gone into the bathroom, the employee checked the bathroom and found the hoodie hidden under the trash bag in the trash can.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Upon receiving information that a Black male had left Goore\u2019s and gone to a nearby Burger King, the police found defendant there and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Defendant, Pham, and another individual were charged with robbery, and it was alleged that a handgun was used in the commission of the crime. Defendant and Pham were tried together using separate juries. Pham\u2019s jury found him not guilty of robbery but guilty of the lesser offense of grand theft. The jury also found the firearm allegation was not true. Defendant\u2019s jury found him guilty of second degree robbery and found the firearm allegation was true. The trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on five years\u2019 probation subject to various conditions. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\n<em>CALCRIM No. 372\u2014The Flight Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The trial court instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 372, as follows; \u201cIf the defendant fled or tried to flee immediately after the crime was committed, that conduct may show that he was aware of his guilt. [][] If you conclude that the defendant fled or tried to flee, it is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of that conduct. [][] However, evidence that the defendant fled or tried to flee cannot prove guilt by itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">On appeal, defendant contends \u201cCALCRIM No. 372 is unconstitutional because it deprives a defendant of the presumption of innocence and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>rights to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d He also contends the instruction should not have been given because there was no substantial evidence to support it. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\n<em>Constitutionality of CALCRIM No. 372</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Defendant first contends CALCRIM No. 372 \u201cundermines the presumption of innocence, relieves the prosecution of the burden to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt and deprives the defendant of a jury verdict . . . because the instruction presumes \u2018the crime was committed.\u2019 \u201d According to defendant, \u201c[t]he conditional term \u2018if\u2019 applies only to the fact of flight, and the permissive term \u2018may\u2019 applies only to the inference to be drawn from the fact. These terms do not apply to the glaring assertion that \u2018the crime was committed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On review, we examine the jury instructions as a whole, in light of the trial record, to determine whether it is reasonably likely the jury understood the challenged instruction in a way that undermined the presumption of innocence or tended to relieve the prosecution of the burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People v. Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 958 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Viewing CALCRIM No. 372 in this light, we reject defendant\u2019s argument. Even viewing the instruction in isolation, the word \u201cif\u2019 in the operative clause\u2014\u201cIf the defendant fled or tried to flee immediately after the crime was committed\u201d\u2014does not logically modify <em>only </em>the phrase \u201cthe defendant fled or tried to flee,\u201d as defendant contends. Rather, \u201cif\u2019 modifies the entire phrase, including the words \u201cafter the crime was committed.\u201d Thus, it is highly unlikely a reasonable juror would have understood the instruction as dictating that \u201cthe crime was committed.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Daener </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 827, 833 [216 P.2d 511] [flight instruction \u201cdid not presuppose the commission of the crime charged\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">This conclusion is supported by the other instructions, which told the jury the following things (among others); (1) \u201cYou must decide what the facts are\u201d; (2) \u201cIt is up to all of you and you alone to decide what happened\u201d; (3) \u201cA defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent. This presumption requires that the People prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt[]\u201d; and (4) \u201cRemember that you may not convict a defendant of any crime unless you are convinced that each fact essential to the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s guilt[] of that crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Also, the trial record demonstrates that there was no real question about whether a crime was committed when Harris\u2019s purse was taken. The only real question in defendant\u2019s case was whether defendant was a participant in the taking. Under these circumstances, we conclude it is not reasonably likely the jury misunderstood the phrase \u201cthe crime was committed\u201d in CALCRIM No. 372 in a way that undermined the presumption of innocence or tended to relieve the prosecution of the burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendant argues at some length about how the language of CALCRIM No. 372 differs from the language in Penal Code section 1127c, which provides for the giving of a flight instruction when appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of this exercise is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, to the extent defendant intends to suggest the CALCRIM instruction is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful because of these differences, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Defendant first points out that CALCRIM No. 372 tells the jury that flight may show awareness of guilt before telling the jury that flight alone is not sufficient to prove guilt, while Penal Code section 1127c communicates those ideas in the opposite order. To the extent defendant suggests this difference makes the CALCRIM instruction constitutionally deficient because the first sentence of the instruction \u201cstrongly suggests . . . that evidence of flight is in fact sufficient to show guilt,\u201d we are not persuaded. The first sentence of CALCRIM No. 372 suggests no such thing, and in any event the final sentence of the instruction positively refutes any such suggestion. In reviewing an instruction for constitutionality, we do not view it in isolation from the other instructions the court gave and we certainly do not view one part of an instruction in isolation from another part. Viewed as a whole and in light of the other instructions, CALCRIM No. 372 is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Next, defendant complains that while Penal Code section 1127c \u201cin no way tells the jury how it should interpret flight, if proved, nor what conclusion it may draw from the fact of flight,\u201d CALCRIM No. 372 \u201ctells the jury flight may prove guilt.\u201d Defendant, however, makes no effort to explain why this difference is significant. It has long been accepted that if flight is significant at all, it is significant because it may reflect consciousness of guilt, which in turn tends to support a finding of guilt. (See, e.g., <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Hutchinson </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 342, 346 [78 Cal.Rptr. 196, 455 P.2d 132].) That CALCRIM No. 372 tells the jury this does not in any way make the instruction unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Finally, defendant complains that while Penal Code section 1127c \u201caddresses flight \u2018after <em>the commission of a crime,\u2019 \u201d </em>\u201cCALCRIM No. 372 addresses flight \u2018after <em>the crime was committed.\u2019 \u201d </em>By this argument, however, defendant simply repeats the contention that the CALCRIM instruction unconstitutionally presumes the crime was committed, which we have rejected already. Accordingly, we do not address the argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In summary, defendant has failed to show any constitutional defect in the flight instruction given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">B<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">II, III*</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The weapons condition on defendant\u2019s probation is modified as follows: \u201cDefendant shall not own or possess any dangerous or deadly weapons nor remain in any building or vehicle where he knows any person has such a weapon, nor remain in the presence of any person he knows is armed with such a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The gang condition on defendant\u2019s probation is modified as follows: \u201cDefendant shall not associate with any person whom he knows, or whom his probation officer informs him, is a gang member. Defendant shall not be in places frequented by persons whom he knows, or whom his probation officer informs him, are gang members. For purposes of this condition, the word \u2018gang\u2019 means a criminal street gang as defined in Penal Code section 186.22, subdivisions (e) and (f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Sims, Acting P.
