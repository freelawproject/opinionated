ORS 475.992(4). The charges arose out of the possession of nine pills and their delivery to an undercover informant on April 13, 1981. He assigns as error the admission of evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d; the failure to grant a continuance or alternatively to exclude the other crimes evidence because of claimed pretrial discovery violations of ORS 135.805, <em>et seq; </em>the failure to merge the two convictions; and the revocation of his probation on four earlier drug related convictions. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The undercover informant, Batsell, provided most of the evidence used to convict defendant. According to his testimony, on April 13, 1981, he and his girlfriend were driving from Lexington to Boardman, in Morrow County, when he saw defendant hitchhiking. Batsell did not know defendant but stopped and picked him up. Batsell engaged defendant in a conversation about drugs and asked if he knew where there was any cocaine. Defendant said that he had been \u201cbusted\u201d twice before and had to be careful. After further conversation, however, defendant said that he would give Batsell \u201ca sample\u201d of some drugs that he had with him and handed Batsell nine pills, later determined to contain methamphetamine. During the conversation, defendant also stated that he had dealt in drugs in Seaside and Alaska. He said that he had \u201c100 pounds\u201d of drugs for sale and that Batsell could contact him at his father\u2019s tavern in Lexington if he wanted more.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objections, Batsell testified to the arrangement of an attempted, but cancelled, meeting with defendant in Lexington on April 15 and a successful meeting in the parking lot at the \u201cBlue Bucket\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on April 17, at which time Batsell had purchased 800 pills from defendant for $250. The pills were later found to contain amphetamine and methamphetamine. Batsell\u2019s girlfriend testified to the conversation between Batsell and defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>She said that Batsell had asked defendant for drugs and that defendant had handed him some pills. She also testified that defendant had told Batsell to try the pills and that he could get more.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Although defendant did not testify, it is his contention, through his attorney\u2019s opening and closing statements, that the drug exchange did not take place and that Batsell, supported by his girlfriend, fabricated the entire story. To this end, his attorney attempted to show on cross-examination that the witnesses had a financial stake in securing drug convictions and that their testimony was unreliable. The attorney argued that defendant had been selected for the false charges because of his admitted prior involvement in drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">We first consider defendant\u2019s claim that the state failed to comply with statutory pretrial discovery. ORS 135.815 to 135.873. He argues that pursuant to ORS 135.865, the trial court should have excluded evidence of the Blue Bucket sale or, in the alternative, a continuance should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On the morning of trial, the state gave notice of its intention to offer evidence of \u201cother bad acts as evidence of motive.\u201d The \u201cbad acts\u201d was the Blue Bucket sale on April 17, four days after defendant gave Batsell the nine pills. When the state gave notice of its intention to offer other crimes evidence it also delivered to defense counsel certain written materials relating to the Blue Bucket sale.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Defendant moved to exclude the other crimes evidence because the \u201cfailure to provide discovery [was] very nearly deliberate.\u201d He also expressed a willingness \u201cto accept a continuance, if that\u2019s the best I can do * * *.\u201d Defendant did not claim any specific prejudice that would result by reason of the claimed discovery violation. He told the trial judge that, because he had just received the material and lacked time to read it or reflect, he had no idea how it would prejudice defendant. Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to exclude the evidence or to grant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">A party must disclose discoverable material \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d following the filing of the indictment. ORS 135.845. If a party has disclosed some material and later finds other discoverable material, \u201ceither before or during trial,\u201d then that party \u201cmust promptly notify the other party of the additional material or information.\u201d ORS 135.845(2). Sanctions may be imposed for the failure to comply. ORS 135.865 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cUpon being apprised of any breach of the duty imposed by the provisions of ORS 135.805 to 135.873, the court may order the violating party to permit inspection of the material, or grant a continuance, or refuse to permit the witness to testify, or refuse to receive in evidence the material not disclosed, or enter such other order as it considers appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The state argues that defendant was neither surprised nor prejudiced by the state\u2019s untimely disclosure. Defense counsel knew before trial about the Blue Bucket sale. He acknowledges he had discussed that sale with Batsell in an earlier interview. He had also discussed the sale with the prosecutor in the context of plea negotiations. Nonetheless, the fact is that the state\u2019s last minute disclosure of the material was neither \u201cprompt\u201d nor \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d The state breached its statutory duty to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The trial court, when faced with a breach of the duty of discovery, may choose among sanctions, which include the granting of a continuance or a refusal to admit the evidence not disclosed. ORS 135.865; <em>State v. Dyson, </em>292 Or 26, 636 P2d 961 (1981); <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>273 Or 518, 542 P2d 482 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Other crimes evidence carries with it the hazard of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The failure to timely disclose the discoverable evidence thwarts the purposes of discovery. Surprise looms large, and defense counsel is denied the opportunity to meet the evidence. The denial of a continuance to prepare for such grave evidence was actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Even if defendant were not substantially prejudiced by the use of the evidence, sanctions might still be appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201c[A]nother important purpose of the criminal discovery statutes is one of efficient judicial administration, i.e., to avoid unnecessary trials, to expedite trials, and to prevent the expense and delay of continuances when either party claims to be unprepared to go to trial because of failure by the other party to comply with these discovery statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Dyson, supra, </em>292 Or at 36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The effective administration of justice requires that discoverable evidence be provided much sooner than \u201cmoments\u201d before trial. We hold that the trial court should have at least granted a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Because defendant is entitled to a new trial, we address his assignment of error concerning the admissibility of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. Defendant claims that it was error to admit evidence, during the state\u2019s case in chief, of the alleged sale of 800 pills on April 17, 1981, at the Blue Bucket. He argues that the relevance and probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the unfair prejudicial portrayal of defendant as \u201ca large quantity drug-dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The state contends that the evidence was relevant to prove motive and that its prejudicial impact is insignificant because of other substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement in prior illegal drug activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">All relevant evidence is admissible unless it falls within one of the \u201cexclusionary rules of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Manrique, </em>271 Or 201, 205, 531 P2d 239 (1975). As a general rule, evidence of other crimes in a criminal prosecution is excluded for the reason that its prejudical impact would outweigh its probative value. <em>State v. Manrique, supra, </em>271 Or at 205-06. The rule is subject to various exceptions. <em>State v. Madison, </em>290 Or 573, 580, 624 P2d 599 (1981). Common exceptions are made for showing motive, intent, the absence of mistake or accident, common scheme or plan and identity. <em>State v. Lehmann, </em>6 Or App 600, 602, 488 P2d 1383 (1971). The list of exceptions may be limitless. McCormick, Evidence 446, \u00a7 189 (2d ed 1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The exceptions, however, do not \u201copen wide the courtroom doors to whatever evidence may be offered in their names.\u201d <em>State v. Manrique, supra, </em>271 Or at 210, quoting from <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>492 F2d 1141, 1155 (5th Cir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>1974). The trial judge must undertake to balance the relevance and probative value of the evidence against unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Hockings, </em>29 Or App 139, 144-45, 562 P2d 587 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"> Evidence of the sale of 800 pills to Batsell is relevant to prove defendant\u2019s motive. The evidence is that defendant delivered the nine pills as a \u201csample\u201d of the 100 pounds of drugs that he had for sale. Without evidence of the later sale, the state is left with the unexplained gift of nine pills by a hitchhiker to a paid drug informant. \u201c[A] party cannot be required to \u2018sanitize\u2019 his evidence by deleting background information to the point that the evidence actually presented seems improbable or incredible to some degree.\u201d <em>State v. Hockings, supra, </em>29 Or App at 147, quoting from <em>State v. Remington, </em>15 Or App 170, 515 P2d 189 (1973), <em>rev den </em>(1974); See also n 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The final inquiry is whether the evidence was so prejudicial that it outweighed its probative value. <em>State v. Manrique, supra; State v. Hockings, supra. </em>Defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence portrayed him as a drug-dealer is a reasonable inference to draw from the evidence. However, there was an abundance of other evidence, some of which defendant elicited himself, <em>see </em>n 4, <em>supra, </em>that would permit the jury to infer that defendant had long been active in illegal drug transactions. The Blue Bucket sale evidence did not unfairly prejudice defendant, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the evidence. <em>State v. Madison, supra; State v. Miller, </em>53 Or App 493, 495, 632 P2d 493 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The remaining assignments of error do not require lengthy discussion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It appears that defendant\u2019s present convictions precipitated the revocation of his probation on four earlier drug related convictions. Apart from this conviction, it is unclear from this record whether probation would have been otherwise revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial and a new probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> The Blue Bucket is described as \u201cnot located in Morrow County,\u201d where the initial transaction occurred and this case was tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Defense counsel described the material to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201c[I]n addition I have just this morning [been] supplied first of all with notice of intent to offer and notices respecting evidence number 13.

However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that admitting evidence of other crimes, specifically the Blue Bucket sale, was not error and, therefore, dissent from that part of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In his first assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the alleged April 17 Blue Bucket drug sale. He argues that the relevance and probative value of the evidence are outweighed by its prejudicial effect in that it tended to portray defendant as a large quantity drug dealer in a case in which he was charged with possession and delivery of only nine pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The controlling principles are stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201cThe fundamental rule of evidence is that in order to be admissible evidence must be relevant, i.e., have some probative value to prove some issue in a case, and that all relevant evidence is admissible unless it falls within one of the so-called \u2018exclusionary\u2019 rules of evidence. * * * It is equally well established that evidence may be rejected, although relevant, if its probative value is outweighed by various other considerations, including the danger of prejudice. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201cFor this reason it is the general rule in criminal cases that the state may not offer evidence that the defendant was guilty of other crimes in addition to the crime for which he is charged. Although evidence that a defendant has committed other crimes may have some probative value in that it may be \u2018more likely\u2019 that such a person committed the crime in question, it is generally recognized that the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant outweighs any such probative value.\u201d <em>State v. Manrique, </em>271 Or 201, 205-06, 531 P2d 239 (1975). (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The majority asserts that evidence of the April 17 sale is relevant to show defendant\u2019s motive in giving the informant the nine pills on April 13. The difficulty with that argument is that neither motive, nor intent, (the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>are often linked),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is an issue here. All that the prosecution needed to prove is that defendant did, in fact, knowingly hand the nine pills to the informant. His motive in doing so is immaterial \u2014 the statute is violated whether defendant delivered the pills as a present sale, in order to secure a future sale or as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">It is true that proof that a defendant had a <em>particular </em>motive for committing a crime may be probative of whether he did so, especially when it would otherwise seem highly unlikely that the defendant would have committed the crime. For example, evidence of other crimes has been admitted to show motive where the defendant has been accused of murdering a member of his or her immediate family. <em>State v. Sack, </em>210 Or 552, 300 P2d 427 (1956), <em>cert den </em>353 US 962 (1957); <em>State v. Hansen, </em>195 Or 169, 244 P2d 990 (1952); <em>State v. Hembree, </em>54 Or 463, 103 P 1008 (1909); <em>State v. Eacret, </em>40 Or App 341, 595 P2d 490, <em>rev den </em>287 Or 409 (1979). <em>See also </em>McCormick, Evidence 450-51, \u00a7 190 at n 44 (2d ed 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">For many crimes, however, the motive is implicit in the act and a more specific need to show motive has been required before evidence of other crimes may be admitted. With respect to evidence of prior drug crimes, for example, we have found that evidence of a drug deal in which the defendant lost a large sum of money approximately one year before his arrest was inadmissible merely to show the defendant\u2019s need for money as a motive for the drug offenses for which he was arrested and tried. <em>State v. Knutson, </em>45 Or App 1051, 609 P2d 922 (1980). We have found that it was error to admit evidence of a sale of marijuana to one undercover police officer in a trial on charges arising from sales to another officer, working independently of the first, merely to show defendant\u2019s knowledge that the substance was marijuana. <em>State v. Lehmann, </em>6 Or App 600, 488 P2d 1383 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">It is clear that the probative value of evidence of the April 17 sale to prove motive for the April 13 delivery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>minimal at best.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the subsequent sale was hardly necessary to explain the \u201cearlier \u2018giveaway\u2019 of drugs between virtual strangers,\u201d which, the majority suggests, the jury would otherwise find implausible. The state put on evidence that the nine pills were a \u201csample\u201d and that defendant said he had more for sale. Certainly a jury would have no trouble believing that someone would give away nine pills worth approximately $2.81<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> either in payment for the ride, in the hope of inducing a later sale or merely as an act of friendship or generosity. Evidence of the later sale has only marginal relevance to any material element of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Furthermore, other factors to be considered in the analysis weigh against its admission. Whatever relevance evidence of the later sale might have must be balanced against the prejudice caused by admitting it. Some of the factors to be weighed are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he actual need for the other-crimes-evidence in the light of the issues and the other evidence available to the prosecution, the convincingness of the evidence that the other crimes were committed and that the accused was the actor, and the strength or weakness of the other-crimes-evidence in supporting the issue, * * * the degree to which the jury will probably be roused by the evidence to overmastering hostility.\u2019 McCormick, Evidence 326, 332, \u00a7 157 (1954).\u201d <em>State v. Lehmann, supra, </em>6 Or App at 603.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Here, whether the jury would convict defendant turned essentially on the credibility of the informant and, to a lesser extent, of his girlfriend. The informant testified (1) that defendant handed him nine pills on April 13, (2) that defendant stated that he would sell the informant more pills if the informant were satisfied with the nine, and (3) that a subsequent sale took place in another county four days later. Satisfactory proof of the first assertion is all that is needed to convict. And while motive makes it somewhat more likely that the first assertion is true, motive is equally and sufficiently demonstrated either by a <em>statement </em>of defendant that he was giving the informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the pills as a sample for purposes of a larger sale later or by the <em>fact </em>of a later sale. Here evidence of both was received, but because the informant\u2019s testimony to the later sale was <em>uncorroborated, </em>it did nothing to strengthen his testimony that defendant stated he would sell him more drugs if he was satisfied with the sample. That is, whether defendant is convicted depends on whether the jury believed the informant\u2019s assertion that defendant handed him the nine pills. That statement does not become significantly more believable because the same informant <em>also </em>asserts that defendant handed him 800 pills four days later. <em>See State v. Lehman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In sum, evidence of the subsequent sale had little, if any, probative value and its potential for prejudice was great, because it tended to portray defendant as a large scale drug dealer in a case involving transfer of a small quantity of drugs. I do not view this error as harmless, as the majority does. The state\u2019s case was based solely on the testimony of the informant, who is not a regular police officer, and whose livelihood is dependent on conviction of persons he accuses of drug crimes, and on corroboration by his girlfriend. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>State v.
