Felix Soutier.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b686-4\"><em>Justice's court </em>\u2014 Pleading\u2014Trespass\u2014Affidavit\u2014Waiver <em>of defects.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b686-5\">1. Plaintiff made an affidavit before a justice of the peace, in which he stated that he had a good and just cause of action against the defendant, \u201cagainst whom he applies for process by warrant, for wrongfully trespassing upon the close of the affiant [describing it by metes and bounds], by entering upon the aforesaid land, and tearing down the fence situate upon said land belonging to affiant, greatly damaging this affiant by leaving his said land open to the commons, and letting this, the affiant\u2019s, cattle, sheep, and hogs out of said close.\u201d The justice issued a warrant commanding the arrest of the defendant to answer to the plaintiff in a plea of trespass, who was accordingly arrested and brought before the justice. The plaintiff filed a declaration substantially following the affidavit, to which defendant pleaded the general issue, and on his application the case was adjourned. On the adjourned day the defendant appeared with his attorney, who, after looking over the papers, stated that the \u201cplea was all right,\u201d and demanded a jury trial. After the jury and a witness were sworn, the defendant\u2019s attorney moved to quash the proceedings on the ground of the insufficiency of the affidavit, which motion was overruled, and the trial proceeded, resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff of nominal damages, upon which a judgment was entered, which was reversed in the circuit court on <em>certiorari, </em>which latter judgment is reversed, and one entered for the plaintiff, the Court holding\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b686-6\">a \u2014 That the motion came too late.

F. Tibbitts (A. G. Day, </em>of counsel), for appellant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-5\">1. The affidavit is specific, and avers a trespass positively, and the plea of the general issue virtually admits plaintiff\u2019s title; citing How. Stat. \u00a7 6894, and cases cited; <em>McFarlane v. Ray, </em>14 Mich. 465; <em>Vandoozer v. Dayton, </em>45 Id. 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-7\">2. The defendant could not remove the cause without pleading title, giving notice, and filing a bond; citing How. Stat. \u00a7 6890-6893; Ra<em>wson v. Finlay, </em>27 Mich. 268.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b687-9\"><em>F. L. Gray, </em>for defendant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-10\">1. In support of claim that the affidavit is insufficient, counsel cited <em>Proctor v. Prout, </em>17 Mich. 473; <em>People v. McAllister, </em>19 Id. 215; <em>Badger v. Reade, </em>39 Id. 771.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-12\">2. The case of <em>Maxwell v. Deens, </em>46 Mich. 37, does not hold that mere pleading waives such a defect in an affidavit, as Mr. Justice Campbell says, \u201cWe think the defect in the affidavit was waived by going to trial and judgment without <em>at any stage of the cause </em>bringing the matter to the attention of the justice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-14\">3. The defendant claimed a right of way over plaintiff\u2019s land, as the evidence tended to show, and the justice had no jurisdiction; citing <em>Fowler v. Hyland, </em>48 Mich. 179; How. Stat. \u00a7 6815.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> See <em>Dailey v. Kennedy, </em>64 Mich. 208; <em>Luton v.

Defendant removed the case to the circuit court by <em>certiorari, </em>where the judgment was reversed, and plaintiff brought it to this Court by writ of error. The suit was commenced by warrant based upon the affidavit of plaintiff. Plaintiff filed the usual declaration in trespass. Defendant pleaded the general issue, and asked for an adjournment, which was granted. Upon the adjourned day defendant was present with his counsel, who, after examining the pleadings, expressed himself as satisfied and ready for trial. A jury was impaneled and sworn. After the taking of testimony had commenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>defendant moved to quash all proceedings on the ground that the affidavit was not sufficient to authorize the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The motion came too late. If the affidavit was defective the defect was waived by the plea and proceeding to trial without objection. No notice of title or other special defense was given, and the justice had jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Judgment reversed, and a judgmeut entered in this Court for plaintiff, with costs of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-6\">Champlin, O.
