It also awards to plaintiff the sum of $2,044.62, as and for past damages, together with $232.49, costs and disbursements. We are of opinion that the preponderance of evidefiee sustains the findings of the court below, and justifies the judgment. The case seems to have been carefully tried, and we find no error in the rulings that would warrant a reversal. Judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
