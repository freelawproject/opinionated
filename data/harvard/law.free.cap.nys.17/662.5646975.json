It does not follow that, because one party makes a charge of fraud against another, there must be a question for a jury. Fraud is a question of fact; but to go before the jury there must be legal evidence, and whether such evidence exists, and, if it does, whether of sufficient weight to sustain a verdict, is a question for the court. The court below propeily refused to submit the question to the jury. There is no foundation for the claim that the instrument was a mortgage. The goods were sold to pay a precedent debt, and it was not difficult for counsel, but putting the words into the mouth of the witness, to get him to say he received them as \u201csecurity for \u00e1 debt.\u201d There was no possibility of a surplus. The transaction was a sale, and not a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
