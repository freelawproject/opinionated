The affidavits read upon the motion were quite conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">The order appealed from was granted by the same justice who presided at the time the orders were granted, which the order appealed from directed should be amended. We must assume that he knew whether the orders were, in fact, the ones he granted. Having determined that they were not, he very properly directed the entry of an order amending them so that they would truly express the meaning and direction of the court. It was obviously a discretionary order, and is not reviewable by this court. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
