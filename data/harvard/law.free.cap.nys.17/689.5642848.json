Prom an order granting a new trial plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AG6\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-12\">On the 3d day of March, 1890, Robert P. Hare, the deceased, was in the employ of the defendant as car-repairer, and at work in the defendant\u2019s repair-shop, in the village of Norwich, repairing one of its cars, which stood upon a track running into and through the building, and extending from the building to another track in defendant\u2019s yard connected therewith by a switch. The servants of the defendant coupled one of its engines and tender to a platform-car heavily loaded with scrap-iron, and drew it beyond the intersection of the track that ran into the repair-shop, and then uncoupled the platform-car, reversed the engine, and ran up said track leading into said shop; and it is alleged in the complaint that the car was \u201ccarelessly and negligently shunted or kicked, * * * with so much force that it could not be stopped by the brakeman thereon, but said ear went crashing through the closed doors of said shop, and came in collision with the car under which said Robert P. Hare was at work for the defendant, repairing the same as aforesaid, and pushed said car upon and against said Hare with so much force that he died on the 4th day of March, 1890, of the injuries thus sustained.\u201d After the opening made by the plaintiff the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was made upon the complaint itself; and the defendant\u2019s counsel stated \u201c that here is a direct allegation of custom to do this very thing set. out in the complaint,\u2014a custom that had been existing for some time,\u2014and they say that the company ought to have knowledge of it; and, if the company ought to have knowledge of it, the man working on the same track should have knowledge of it; and, of course, if he did, there could be no recovery.\u201d In response to that motion and statement the court observed; \u201cI will hear the evidence in the case, and deny the motion.\u201d An exception was taken by the defendant. The general rules of the defendant, found in a printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>book containing 690 rules, were introduced in evidence by the plaintiff, \u201cfrom which it appeared that there was no rule forbidding the kicking or shunting of cars upon these three cripple tracks, or, in terms, regulating the movement of cars thereon.\u201d When the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved for a non-suit. Thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cThe cause of action is that they were bound to establish a reasonable and proper rule for the protection of the workmen in the machine-shop. \u201d Thereupon the court observed: \u201c My present impressions in this case are that a rule by the company, assuming the practice to be dangerous, would not be called for unless the practice was so prevalent as to give them constructive notice of the fact that it was being done; and, if the practice was prevalent enough for that purpose, that it would be prevalent enough for the purpose of giving notice to this man, who had an equal opportunity, at least, of ascertaining what the fact was, and ascertaining the danger; and, if he remained an employe of the company, I don\u2019t think the defendant would be liable. But I will not decide the case now, but will hear the evidence of the defendant on the other branch of the ease, on the question as to the defect in this car. * * * I will deny the motion for a nonsuit at present. \u201d An exception was taken by the defendant. After the defendant\u2019s evidence was closed, the plaintiff again stated: \u201cWe say that this is a question for the jury to say as to whether this company should have made a rule prohibiting the kicking of ears on these cripple tracks; and if they should have made such a rule, and failed to do so, that they are liable in this action; and also whether this deceased was chargeable with knowledge of this custom to an extent to relieve the defendant from liability.\u201d In the course of the observations made by the court in denying the motion, it was said: \u201cNow, if it had notice of the fact that such was the custom, I think it would be a question for the jury to say <em>whether\u2014First, </em>it was a dangerous custom; and, <em>second, </em>whether the defendant had this notice; and, <em>third, </em>whether, having this notice .of the dangerous custom, it was the defendant\u2019s duty to promulgate a rule forbidding it. Now, that would create a liability on the part of the defendant for any injury resulting, unless the plaintiff had knowledge of the fact that such custom existed, in which case the defendant would be relieved from liability; because a railroad corporation, or any master, is not bound to take any more care for the safety of an employe than he is bo.und to take for his own- safety. And if he knew of the fact of a dangerous custom existing,- and made no complaint and no request to obviate it, then it.is very clear that, if he does not take care of his own safety, his employer is not bound to take care of his safety. There is some evidence from which, possibly, the jury might find that he did not know; that is, there is enough, I think, possibly, to submit to the jury on the question as to these two or three other employes or co-employes of the plaintiff. They\u2014some of them\u2014having sworn they did not know of that fact, there may be some evidence to submit to the jury as to whether he did know of the custom, notwithstanding the fact that he had been there eight months. I shall hold this as a matter of law, unless the plaintiff will stipulate, upon a motion for a new trial, in case they should be successful, that, if I determine that the evidence is not sufficient to go to the jury, I may then set aside any verdict they may obtain, and grant the motion as of nonsuit, and as of the time before the verdict was taken. If they will stipulate to that effect, I will submit this case to the jury upon the questions: (1) As to whether there was a custom of shunting or kicking these cars into these cripple switches; (2) as to whether this defendant had constructive notice of such custom; (3) as to whether there should have been a rule of the company forbidding the shunting of these cars into these cripple switches; (4) as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had notice of the custom of shunting these cars in; (5) as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was guilty of contributory negligence. \u201d Thereupon the counsel for the plaintiff stated: \u201cThat is satisfactory to us, only we wish it understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>that, if you should decide against us, we shall stand in precisely the same relation and position that we would if you granted them a nonsuit here to-day.\u201d In response thereto the court observed: \u201cThe court will protect the plaintiff in the matter. You may insert any requests to go to the jury, and a refusal and exception.\u201d Thereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel took an exception to the denying of the motion for a nonsuit at this time. In the course of the charge delivered to the jury the court observed: \u201cBut if you find that such a custom existed; that it was known to the defendant\u2019s officers to exist; and that a reasonable regard for the safety of employes required that a rule should be made, forbidding the kicking of cars into these cripple tracks,\u2014then you will reach the fourth proposition, which the plaintiff must establish in order to recover, and that is that Bobert P. Hare did not himself have knowledge of this custom. * * * If Bobert P. Hare had been working there from July, and he had had knowledge of the fact that these cars were being kicked in, and he had made no complaint to the company, then, if the company were held liable for this death, you can see it would be unreasonable; for the company is not bound to take greater care of his life than he himself chooses to take.\u201d At the close of the charge the court, in response to certain requests, charged \u201cthat, if Bobert P. Hare had the means of knowledge, he should have known of the custom; <em>second, </em>that, if he had the opportunity of knowing, he should have known of the custom.\u201d In response to a request to charge, \u201cIf the custom was in operation,\u2014was used around him,\u2014he would be presumed to know,\u201d the court observed, \u201cI decline to charge upon that other than I have already charged;\u201d and the defendant took an exception. After the verdict of $4,000 was given for the plaintiff, an order was made allowing the defendant to have 90 days to make and serve a case and exceptions, and the plaintiff to have a like time to make amendments, \u201cand that until the hearing and determination of said motion for a new trial entry of judgment and all other proceedings herein be stayed.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b711-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEqj\">We have looked into the opinion delivered by the learned circuit judge commenting upon the case, and we And the conclusion of his opinion to be as follows: \u201cIt must be held, therefore, as a matter of law, that the decedent, Hare, bad equal opportunities of knowledge of the custom of the employes in kicking cars into that cripple track as had the defendant company, and that by continuing in their employ, without protest and with that knowledge, he had assumed the risk, and for the injury resulting therefrom the company cannot be held liable.\u201d The court made an order \u201cthat the motion for a new trial be, and the same is hereby, granted, with costs to the defendant to abide the event of the action. \u201d Important and serious questions were involved in the trial. It was, in effect, stipulated upon the trial that if the court should at a subsequent stage be of the opinion that the plaintiff was, for any reason, not entitled to recover, the decision should be made, and the plaintiff should \u201cstand in precisely the same relation and position that\u201d he had if the nonsuit were granted upon the trial. Apparently the court yielded to the language used by the plaintiff in the stipulation given by the plaintiff on the trial. The order made upon granting a new trial does not observe and carry out the stipulation made during the progress of the trial. Without passing upon the serious questions involved in the merits of the action, we are inclined to hold that there was a mistrial. We are therefore inclined to the conclusion that the rights of the respective parties can be more safely and reasonably protected by requiring a new trial to be had, before expressing our opinion upon the questions involved in the merits. We therefore direct a new trial, and in form sustain the order appealed from. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>think the order should be affirmed, without costs to either party. Order affirmed, without costs. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\">Martin, J., concurs in result. Merwin, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
