On the failure of the purchaser to perform a contract for the sale of personal property, the vendor, among other remedies, may sell the property, acting as the agent for this purpose of the vendor, and recover the difference between the contract price and the price obtained on such sale. <em>Dustan </em>v. <em>McAndrew, </em>44 N. Y. 72; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Greider, </em>51 N. Y. 231; <em>Cahen </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>69 N. Y. 352; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>72 N. Y. 599; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Wormser, </em>94 N. Y. 442; <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>114 N. Y. 469, 21 N. E. Rep. 1012. The expenses of making such sale, as well as the expenses of preserving and taking care of the property after default and before the sale, together with the difference between the contract and selling price, is the proper measure of damages in such action. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>114 N. Y. 469, 21 N. E. Rep. 1012; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Greider, </em>51 N. Y. 231. When we read the complaint in the light of the authorities cited, we are unable to discover that it contains more than one cause of action. The action was obviously to recover the difference between the contract price of the hops and the price at which they were sold, together with the expense of taking care of and selling them. If the order had required the plaintiff to make his complaint more definite and certain as to the items, or what constituted the $50 claimed as damage in caring for the hops and for expenses in selling them, another question would have arisen. The order granted required the plaintiff to serve a new complaint, setting up in the first count a cause of action for breach of contract, and in separate counts any further causes of action which he might have against the defendant, and to pay the defendant $10 costs of that motion. There being but one cause of action stated in the complaint, we think the order was improper, and should be reversed. Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
