Shaw and Marium M., his wife, to the plaintiff, dated July 1,1884. At that date, in consideration of the sum of $2,821 received by the defendant PerLee B. Shaw from the plaintiff, which sum was made up of 21 shares of the capital stock of the Utica, Chenango &amp; Susquehanna Valley Railroad Company, of the value of $2 300 in fact at the time, and as agreed upon by and between the plaintiff anu said Shaw, and $421 in cash, the said PerLee E. Shaw executed and delivered to plaintiff a bond dated July 1,1884, in the penal sum of $5,642, and having the following condition: \u201cThe condition of this obligation is such that, if the said PerLee E. Shaw, or his heirs, shall at his house, in the town of Norwich, aforesaid, furnish and provide the said Mary B. Gilbert with a room, board, fuel, and light during the term of her natural life, she to provide furniture for the said room, and the said PerLee B. Shaw or his heirs shall pay to the said Mary B.

Shaw to Delos Fowlston on or about the 10th day of January, 1884, to secure $5,000.00 and interest, both of interest and principal, without default or delay, promptly, according to the terms of the said bond and mortgage, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue; and it is further provided that in case of default in any of the foregoing conditions, including the provisions in relation to payments on the Fowlston bond and mortgage, then and in that case there shall immediately become due to the said Mary E. Gilbert hereon the said sum of $2,821.00, together with interest thereon from the date of such default at six per cent, per annum, and all interest accruing before such default. In case no default occurs in the life-time of said Mary E. Gilbert, then the said principal sum is not to be paid. PerLee E. Shaw. [l. s.]\u201d As collateral security for the payment of the said indebtedness, and the performance of all the conditions of the bond, Shaw and wife, upon the same day, executed and delivered to the plaintiff the mortgage in suit, being upon certain premises in the town of'Norwich. It was duly recorded July 5,1885. No payments have been made on the bond and \"mortgage, except the interest on the sum of $2,821, at 3 per cent, per annum, paid to July 1, 1890. The bond and mortgage to Fowlston, referred to in the condition above set out, were dated January 10, 1884. The mortgage covered the same property as the mortgage to the plaintiff, and was recorded January 10, 1884; and its condition, as well as that of the accompanying bond, was for the payment of the sum of \u201c five thousand dollars ten years from date, the first day of April then next, with interest annually at five per cent, per annum from and after the said first day of April; $300 of said principal sum to be paid on the first day of April, 1887, and $300 thereof on the first day of April in each and every year thereafter.\u201d On the days when the interest and payments of principal became due on the bond and mortgage to Fowlston for four years, Shaw did not pay the same, but such non-payment was with the consent and acquiescence of Fowlston, who then held the bond and mortgage, and with the understanding and agreement that, instead of paying such principal and interest to Fowlston at the times when due, he (Shaw) would put improvements upon the farm described in the mortgage, in building a hop-house and procuring hop-poles, or otherwise, and that Shaw did build a hop-house upon the farm, and did put hop-poles upon the farm, which became a part of the real estate, and were of the value of $1,200. Long before the commencement of this action, and before the giving of any notice by the plaintiff in any way that she intended to foreclose or should foreclose her mortgage, Shaw paid to Fowlston all payments of principal that had become due, and all accrued interest that had become due; and, at the time this action was brought, no principal or interest upon the Fowlston mortgage was due. The balance of the principal unpaid was $3,800. The payments were made in cash, and were not the improvements referred to. The interest going to the plaintiff on her bond and mortgage has been promptly paid. On-the 5 th September, 1890, she demanded of Shaw payment of the principal sum of $2,821, which was refused; and this action was commenced on the 15th September, 1890. The foregoing facts are admitted by the pleadings or conceded at the trial. The court also found that the plaintiff, with full knowledge of the facts, accepted the payments to her of interest; that the plaintiff\u2019s security was not impaired by the failure to make payments to Fowlston as they became due; that the intent and purpose of the provision in the bond and mortgage to plaintiff that the sum of $2,821 should become due upon any default was to prevent injury to plaintiff\u2019s security from the enforcement of the Fowlston mortgage, and to secure to plaintiff the prompt payment of her interest, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>was intended as penalty or forfeiture. As conclusions of law it was held: \u201c(1) That this court has the power, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to relieve the defendant PerLee E. Shaw from the default claimed to have occurred by the non-payment of the principal and interest due to Fowlston on the days when due by the terms of the mortgage. (2) That the plaintiff not having suffered any damage, and her security not having been impaired, but in fact increased, and prompt payment having been made at all times of the interest due to her, and she having accepted and received such interest, and all payments due to Fowlston, both of principal and interest, having been made long before the commencement of this action, and before any notice that the plaintiff claimed a default or claimed the right to foreclose her mortgage, equity demands that the defendant be relieved from such default. (3) That the acceptance of the interest due to the plaintiff by her, on the days when due, operated as a waiver of her right to claim the forfeiture of the $2,821. (4) The defendants are entitled to a judgment relieving them from the aforesaid default, and declaring that the principal sum of $2,821, secured by the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, is not due or payable. (5) The defendants are entitled to a judgment dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff. (6) That, under the circumstances of this case, it is inequitable to permit an enforcement of the penalty or forfeiture by permitting a foreclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage for $2,821, and a judgment of foreclosure is therefore refused.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b643-6\">Argued before Hardin, F.

We must therefore assume that in other respects the defendant Shaw has fully performed the contract upon his part. The theory of the plaintiff is that the failure of Shaw to make any payment to Fowlston at the exact time it became due gave immediately to her the right to recover back the full amount of the consideration that she parted with upon receiving the bond and mortgage, and that this right was not taken away or affected by any subsequent performance by Shaw. The transaction between the plaintiff and defendant Shaw was, in substance, that plaintiff paid and transferred te Shaw certain money and property of an agreed value, and Shaw, in consideration thereof, agreed to furnish plaintiff with a room, board, fuel, and light during her natural life, and also pay her annually, during her life, interest at 3 per cent, per annum upon the amount of the consideration, at the agreed value. To secure those things to the plaintiff the defendant gave to plaintiff a mortgage upon his farm, which was at the time incumbered by a prior mortgage. In order to protect plaintiff\u2019s security against being interfered with by this mortgage the defendant agreed to make promptly the payments on the prior mortgage as they became due. Then came the provision that, in case of default in the performance by defendant of any of these agreements, there should immediately become due to the plaintiff the full consideration, with interest from date of the default. According to the wording of the bond, it made no difference whether the default was great or small, or whether it was the first year of the contract or the last year of the plaintiff\u2019s life. If he fully performed during the whole period, he then became absolute owner of the property or fund that he had received of plaintiff, and was in possession of. The right of ownership dated from the time he made the contract and undertook its performance; and any condition which operated after-wards to take away or destroy this right, in effect, deprived the defendant of something of value, which he otherwise would have possessed. Such condition was therefore in the nature of a forfeiture. Shaw, by his performance of the provisions of the contract for several years, had rendered to plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the compensation, in part, which she was to have for the money and property she gave to the plaintiff. In this view the casejs; in principle, somewhat analogous to the sale of real estate by contract, which by its terms is to become void on failure by the vendee to perform in any respect. After part performance the vendee has ordinarily equitable rights, although the legal title is absolute in the vendor by reason of lack of strict performance. <em>2 </em>Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1315. In such cases the title is deemed to be held as security.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We are referred by the learned counsel for plaintiff to many cases where, in a security for a loan payable on time, there has been a provision that if the interest was not paid promptly, or at a certain fixed time, the whole debt should become due, and it has been held that no relief would be given from the effect of a default in the payment of interest at the prescribed time, and that it was not a case of forfeiture. Those cases do not apply here. The money and property advanced by plaintiff were not, at all events, to be returned. It was, therefore, not a loan. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>29 N. Y. 167. Nor does the case of <em>Trustees, etc., </em>v. <em>McKechnie, </em>90 N. Y. 618, apply. In that case the question was whether the event, upon the happening of which certain moneys advanced to the Ontario Female Seminary should be returned, had in fact happened. No question was made as to the liability, provided the event in question had happened. Nor does the case of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>L. R. 4 H. L. 1, help us. There it was held that the reservation of a right to have full payment of money actually due on an existing contract, should there be a failure to pay a smaller sum on a day certain, cannot be treated as a penalty,. In substance, the creditor offered to compromise on certain terras, the debtor did not comply with the terms, and thereupon the creditor was remitted to his original rights. He got nothing beyond his debt. In <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>62 N. Y. 486, relief was given from a forfeiture in a lease incurred by the failure of the tenant to pay taxes and assessments. The rule is there laid down that where the covenant is simply for the payment of money the forfeiture is regarded as a security merely for such payment, and equity will not allow it to be enforced after the party has obtained all that it was intended to secure to him. Mere' delay is not a bar, if no new rights have intervened, or the position of the parties been changed. A similar doctrine was applied in <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>124 N. Y. 175, 26 N. E. Rep. 316. In that case there was an agreement by the owner of a mortgage with the owner of the equity of redemption that he would not enforce the mortgage during the life of the latter, provided, among other things, that no taxes or assessments on the premises remained unpaid and in arrears for more than 30 days. Default was made in the payment of a sewer assessment, and thereupon foreclosure of the mortgage was commenced. It was held that the default would result in a forfeiture, from which or its consequences a court of equity had power to relieve'; it being said that a court of equity has power to relieve a party against forfeiture or penalty incurred by the breach of a condition subsequent, where no willful neglect on his part is shown, upon the principle that a party having a legal right shall not be permitted to avail himself of it for the purpose of injustice or oppression. A similar view was taken by Judge Daniels <em>in Shaw </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>(Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 527. In <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>40 Cal. 3, failure by the vendee in a land contract to strictly perform his covenant to pay a prior mortgage was held not to be fatal to the rights of the vendee, although by the terms of the contract such failure made it void; it appearing that the vendee acted in good faith, and the vendors were not damaged thereby. In <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Tupper, </em>29 Vt. 358, it was held that a court of equity might, in its discretion, give relief from a forfeiture occasioned by the breach of an agreement for support. In 1 Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7 451, the general doctrine is laid down as follows: \u201cIn the absence of special circumstances giving the defaulting party a higher remedial right, a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>equity will set aside or otherwise relieve against a forfeiture, both where it is incurred on the breach of an agreement expressly and simply for the payment of money, and also on the breach of an agreement of which the obligation, although indirectly, is yet substantially a pecuniary one.\u201d See, also, 2 White &amp; T. Lead. Cas. (4th Ed.) 2044.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In the present case it is conceded that long before the commencement of the action, and before the giving of any notice by the plaintiff that she intended to foreclose, the defendant Shaw paid to Fowlston all that was due. So that when this action was begun there was no actual default. All payments of interest due the plaintiff liad been promptly made, and the court, among other things, found that such interest was accepted by plaintiff with full knowledge of the facts, and that, therefore, she waived her right to claim a forfeiture. It may be, as claimed by plaintiff, that the evidence does not fully warrant the finding that she had full knowledge of the facts. Stili, presumptively, she was living upon the premises, and must have known to some extent of the improvements going on. Apparently, if she had made inquiry, she would have found out that the payments were not being promptly made. If she did not inquire, it would indicate that she did not deem knowledge in that respect of vital importance; and so it would if she did inquire, and found out the situation, and still received her payments without question. Her acquiescence, in either aspect of the case, while it might not be a waiver, would have some bearing on the character or intent of the original transaction, and on the propriety of giving defendant relief. It is quite clear that the plaintiff\u2019s security was not impaired. It may also be said with a good deal of force, as an inference from the conceded facts, that the provision making the original amount collectible was intended only as security, so far, at least, as it related to the payment of the prior mortgage. It seems to me that a proper case was presented for the exercise of the equitable power of the court, and that the special term did not err in giving defendant relief from the forfeiture, and in refusing to grant foreclosure of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. The judgment should therefore be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
