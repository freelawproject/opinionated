Plaintiff testified to the signature, and introduced a specimen of the decedent\u2019s signature in evidence, but defendant did not offer evidence of like nature. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict, based upon inspection and comparison by the jury of the decedent\u2019s signature so produced with the signature to the note, would not be set aside on appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-12\">Appeal from circuit court, Westchester county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-13\">Action by Bridget Meyers against David Hunt, as executor of Harrison Hunt, upon a promissory note alleged to have been made by defendant\u2019s testator, but which defendant claimed was a forgery.

That neglect is most significant; almost an express admission that the note sued upon is genuine. The plaintiff produced one specimen which the jury compared with-the note, and their verdict, based upon that inspection and comparison, cannot be interfered with. In view of the above the opinion of the witnesses is of slight importance. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
