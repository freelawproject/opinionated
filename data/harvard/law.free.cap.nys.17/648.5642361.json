Boylan, assignee of Thomas Shevlin, against Charles A. Brown and another to recover damages for the loss of a horse and cart caused by a fall from defendants\u2019 dumping dock, which was insufficiently provided with means to prevent dumping carts from going over; the string-piece intended for that purpose having been worn down so low as to be no longer safe.

Y. 396, 5 N. E. Rep. 56; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>106 N. Y. 512, 13 N. E. Rep. 339; <em>Splittorf </em>v. <em>State, </em>108 N. Y. 205, 15 N. E.

But in addition it may be added that there was no adequate proof that the device for dumping here used was not proper for the purpose it was intended to serve. Again, it is doubtful if the nature or condition of this platform either caused or contributed to the accident, but rather that the accident was proximately caused by fright of the horse or unskillfulness of other drivers using the dump at the same time. A nonsuit was properly granted, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
