November 23, 1889,- defendant delivered to plaintiff her deed dated that date, whereby she conveyed said premises, \u201csubject, however, to two certain mortgages thereon,\u2014one of Thomas McGuire to Cecile Rusch for $12,000, and another for $2,000 by said McGuire to Michael Duffy;\u201d and, among other things, defendant covenanted that the premises conveyed \u201care now free, clear, discharged, and unincumbered of and from all other former grants, titles, charges, estates, judgments, taxes, assessments, and incumbrances, of what nature or kind soever, except as aforesaid.\u201d After the making of the contract of sale, and before the delivery of the deed, the then holder and owner of said second mortgage of $2,000 began an action to foreclose the mortgage, and filed a notice of the pendency of the action. Margaret K. Douglass was a party defendant in the foreclosure suit, and the notice of pendency of action was Socketed against her, and the summons and complaint served upon her before the delivery of said deed. After the delivery of the deed plaintiff paid $76.25, the taxable costs up to such time, for the purpose of procuring a discontinuance of the foreclosure suit and the cancellation of the <em>Us pendens, </em>but no judgment was ever entered in such suit. Plaintiff brought this action on the covenant in her deed against incumbrances, to recover the amount paid <em>to </em>obtain the discontinuance of the suit and a release of the <em>lis pendens. </em>Judgment at the trial term was given for plaintiff, which, on appeal, was affirmed by the general term, and defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b198-11\">Argued before Bookstaveb, P.

We also think the payment of costs was a voluntary payment on the part of the plaintiff in this action, and is not recoverable under the covenants of her deed. There should therefore be a reversal of the judgment, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
