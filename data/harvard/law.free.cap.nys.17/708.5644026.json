Assuming a partnership, Curtiss had sold the business to his mother before the notes in question, except the $100, were given. The notes were given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ostensibly to buy out Bent\u2019s share in the business; and, while the defendant inserted in the letter inclosing the notes that they were to be payable \u201cas soon as I can get a partner who has sufficient means to place the business on a sound footing, \u201d the words were idle. The business had been sold before the letter was written, and by means of the letter and the notes a good title was made to the business in the defendant\u2019s mother. Defendant alone signed the bill of sale to her. It would be a very inequitable result if by this clause in the letter the defendant could get a title to the property which he had wrongfully sold, and pay Bent nothing. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide event. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
