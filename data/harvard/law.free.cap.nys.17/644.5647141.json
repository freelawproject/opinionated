Brown, who demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The demurrer was overruled, with leave to the \u25a0defendant to answer within 20 days on payment of costs. An order to that \u25a0effect was entered, but no interlocutory judgment. The defendant did not answer within the 20 days after the service of the order, and thereupon the plaintiff made motion for final judgment against the defendant Brown, which was granted, and this appeal is from that order. The order is erroneous. The defendant desired to appeal from the decision overruling the demurrer, but could not do so until an interlocutory judgment was entered. . The decision upon the demurrer granted the defendant leave to answer, and required an intermediate judgment, and the defendant was not in default until such judgment was entered. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1021; <em>Liegeois </em>v. <em>McCrackan; </em>22 Hun, 69; Rum. Pr. 236, 237; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Rothschild, </em>13 Civil Proc. R. 359. Under the old Code the appeal could be taken from the order, but now that is changed, and the appeal must be fiom the judgment. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Rothschild, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>supra; Bank </em>v. <em>Bussell, </em>14 Abb. N. C. 99; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>76 N. Y. 514. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion should be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
