The evidence tended to show, and the \u2022trial court found, that on the 1st day of December, 1888, a Mr. Lenher, being then the owner of 12 shares of the stock of said mat company, of the par val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ue of $100 a share, made an absolute assignment of the certificate of said stock to the defendant on that day; and that on or prior to the 28th day of December, 1888, the defendant became a stockholder in said company. The evidence upon which these findings were based consisted of the original certificates of the 12 shares issued to Lenher, May 16, 1888, upon the back of which was a written assignment thereof to the defendant in the usual form, dated December 1, 1888; and attached thereto was the certificate of a notary public of the county of New York, certifying that Lenher came personally before him on the 1st day of December, and acknowledged the execution of the assignment; and also three letters from the defendant addressed to the Kochester Steel Mat Company, the first one dated December 28,1888, in which he states that he has inclosed 12 shares of the capital stock of the mat company, standing in the name of S. J. Lenher, which he wished transferred to himself; and the letter of January 4, 1889, in which, in answer to one from the mat company inquiring what his interest in the stock was, lie stated that his position was that of owner of the 12 shares, \u201cwhich 1 sent to you to have transferred to me on December 28, 1888, and which was transferred to me by S. J. Lenher, for value received, and you will please send me certificate without delay.\u201d The third letter, of April 6th, made inquiry as to whether there was any dividend due him, and informing the company that he would like an offer for his stock. Other witnesses testified to the admissions of the defendant that the certificate of stock was delivered to him at the date of the notary\u2019s certificate, December 1, 1888. The contradictive evidence consisted of the oral testimony of the defendant and Lenher, to the effect that the stock was in fact transferred to the appellant on the 28th day of December, 1888; and that, for the purpose of preventing the mat company from offsetting a claim which they had against Lenher to any dividend which may have been declared upon the stock, they induced the notary to antedate his certificate. And they further testified that the transfer of the stock to the defendant was not an absolute transfer, but that the defendant held it as trustee for his brother simply. The trial court gave credence to the certificate of the officer, the letters of the defendant, and his admissions, and disbelieved his testimony and that of Lenher given upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">We think the defendant has no just cause to complain of the conclusion arrived at by the trial court. The certificate was not in fact transferred to the defendant upon the books of the company till the 11th day of January, 1889, subsequent to the time the debt was contracted; but, the appellant being the actual owner of the stock at the time the debt was contracted, he was liable for the debt, under sections 10 and 25<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the general manufacturing act of 1848. He became the legal owner of the stock when the transfer was made, and was from that time entitled to any dividends which might be declared upon the stock. He occupied the place of the prior owner. 1 Mor. Priv. Corp. \u00a7 304; <em>Brisbane </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>94 N. Y. 204; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Underhill, </em>52 N. Y. 203. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.
