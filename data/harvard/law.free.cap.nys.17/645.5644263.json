Wright against Henry E. Burritt and another on a check drawn on defendants by the Bheubottom &amp; Theall Manufacturing Company at Weedsport, Cayuga county, H. Y\u201e where defendants, bankers, then resided. Plaintiff\u2019s contention was that a special deposit had been made to meet the check, and he expected to rely <em>on </em>the testimony of Homer E. Rheubottom to show that fact. Defendants expected to prove by residents of Cayuga county that Bheubottom was unworthy of belief, and moved for a change of venue to that county. The court denied the motion on condition that plaintiff should stipulate that defendants\u2019 Cayuga witnesses would testify that Rheubottom\u2019s character was bad, that he was unworthy of belief, etc. From the order denying such motion defendants appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AfS\">Reversed.'1</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b665-10\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The case is a Cayuga county case. The transactions out of which the cause of action arose were all there. All the persons who knew any of the material facts are naturally located there, and we think the moving papers made a case requiring the removal of the cause to that county. The court evidently hesitated over the denial of the motion absolutely, and required the plaintiff to stipulate that certain witnesses of the defendants would testify as the defendants stated they would in their moving papers. Such a stipulation, however, is a poor substitute for the actual presence and testimony of the witnesses before the jury, and the defendants might well hesitate to rely upon such a stipulation without producing the witnesses. We think the defendants are entitled to an opportunity to try the cause in the usual way, and to have the trial in the county of Cayuga. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion should be granted, with $10 costs to defendants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
