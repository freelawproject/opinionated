The allegation in the fifteenth paragraph is the \u201cliving in adulterous intercourse. \u201d Under this allegation it would be manifestly improper to exclude proof of a nature which, though circumstantial, might point to such living in adulterous intercourse, but be wholly unsatisfactory as proof of a particular act of adultery at a particular date or place. It is therefore ordered that the order of the special term be modified by striking out the words \u201cand fifteenth, \u201d and by the insertion of the word \u201cand\u201d between the words \u201cthirteenth\u201d and \u201cfourteenth,\u201d and, so modified, the order be affirmed, the defendant to serve a copy of the modified order, and the plaintiff to have 10 days thereafter to complj' therewith; the appellant to have $10 costs of this appeal and printing disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
