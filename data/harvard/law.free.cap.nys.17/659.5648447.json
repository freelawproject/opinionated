Walters, deceased, against Albert B. Kraemer, to recover a debt. Plaintiff caused a notice of pendency of action to be filed, and obtained a warrant of attachment. The property described in the notice when the same was filed, belonged to Fredericka Kraemer, who subsequently conveyed the premises to a third party. She afterwards ascertained that the <em>lis pendens </em>was on file, indexed against her name, and caused a motion to be made in the supreme court for an order directing the county clerk to discharge the <em>lis pendens </em>from record, which motion was denied, on the ground that she had no standing to make the motion after having conveyed away the property. From the order denying such motion the said Fredericka Kraemer appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AmF1\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b679-11\">Argued before Barnard, P.

It is immaterial whether it was proper for plaintiff to file a notice of pendency of action, and index it against Fredericka Kraemer upon this motion, as she has no standing in court sufficient to enable her to bring this appeal. She is neither a party to the suit, nor, so far as appears, has any interest in the subject-matter of the action, nor is she aggrieved by the order appealed from. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>69 N.
