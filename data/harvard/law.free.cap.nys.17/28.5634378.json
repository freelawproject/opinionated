Carriers\u2014Connecting Lines\u2014Advances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-8\">Defendant, a steam-ship company, entered into a bill of lading with other carriers which provided that it should not be liable \u201cfor loss or damage on any article or property whatever, by fire or other casualty, while in transit, or while in deposit, or places of transshipment, or at depots or landings at all points of delivery. \u201d Plaintiff, as the last of five connecting carriers, had paid all charges on a consignment of cotton, and placed it on a wharf preparatory to delivery to defendant, but before such delivery the cotton was destroyed by fire. <em>Meld, </em>in an action by plaintiff to recover freight charges advanced by it, and its own charges, from defendant, that there was no liability upon defendant, under the bill of lading, to pay said advances and charges.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-9\">8.

Upon the previous appeal it was held that the plaintiff had no right to recover, and there does not seem to have been any change made in the evidence which requires a new discussion of the points which were disposed of upon the former appeal. We think, therefore, that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed upon the opinion given by Mr. Justice Daniels upon the former appeal, and which is adopted as the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-17\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-18\">Barrett, J., concurs in the result.
