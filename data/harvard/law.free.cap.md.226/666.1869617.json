Counsel was appointed upon his affidavit that he was without funds, and he elected trial before the court. After a hearing, he was found to be still a defective delinquent and recommitted. He noted an appeal, which the court treated as an application for leave to appeal under Code (1960 Supp.), Art. 3 IB, sec. 11. There was no attempt, however, to comply with Maryland Rule 894-2 (a), which provides: \u201cThe application shall contain a concise statement of the reasons why the order should be reversed or modified, and shall include a list of the errors allegedly committed by the lower court.\u201d In the absence of any specification of errors, there is nothing before us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
