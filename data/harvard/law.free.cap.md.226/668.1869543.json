Was the court within its right to impose a term for a narcotic violation where none existed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201c(2). Could petitioner be legally convicted of a narcotic violation when narcotic was said to be obtained in an attempted burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201c(3). Could petitioner he legally charged, convicted and sentenced separately for an offense that grows out of primary charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201c(4) Should the court have accepted a plea of \u2018guilty\u2019 where no new and separate crime existed?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">It is apparent from these questions that the applicant in effect contends (i) that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict and (ii) that he was twice placed in jeopardy. Time and time again we have said that both of these contentions might have been raised on direct appeal, but not in a collateral proceeding. See, for example, <em>Burgess v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 610, as to the sufficiency of the evidence; and <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 635 and <em>Young v. Warden, </em>218 Md. 636, as to double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
