He sought a reduction in his sentence from twenty years to ten years. After a hearing at which both the applicant and the State were represented by counsel (counsel for the applicant having been appointed for him as an indigent), Judge Tucker denied the application in a fifteen page opinion and order, which sets forth adequate grounds for his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We find no merit in the applicant\u2019s first contention with regard to failing to advise him of his rights. See <em>Snead v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 595, 135 A. 2d 630 (generally) ; <em>Tillett v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 677, 154 A. 2d 808 (effect of plea of guilty) ; <em>Dorris v. Warden, </em>222 Md. 586, 158 A. 2d 105 (right to seek a new trial or to appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">We also find no merit in the second contention. As Judge Tucker points out, experienced counsel was appointed to represent the applicant in the original proceedings, he entered pleas of guilty for the appellant in his presence on one count of each of two indictments, and the applicant made no objection. <em>Parker v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 632, 139 A. 2d 728; <em>Savoy v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 616, 139 A. 2d 257, cert. den. 356 U. S. 963; <em>Spencer v. Warden, </em>222 Md. 582, 158 A. 2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The applicant\u2019s third contention is equally untenable. Guilt or innocence cannot be retried in post conviction proceedings. <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, 155 A. 2d 643. Even if such a contention could properly be considered in these proceedings, it would be without force, since an unloaded pistol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>has been held to constitute at least a dangerous weapon, which is one of the terms used in both Secs. 36 and 488 of Art. 27 of the Code (1957). <em>Hayes v. State, </em>211 Md. 111, 126 A. 2d 576. A sentence of twenty years is authorized under the latter section for robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The applicant seeks to raise a new contention in this Court \u2014a claim of \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d No factual basis for it is either stated or apparent; but since this ground was not included in the proceedings in the trial court, it is not properly before this Court. <em>Preston v. Warden, </em>225 Md. 628, 169 A. 2d 407, cert. den. 366 U. S. 974 (to cite only one of many cases). We see no need for appointing counsel to represent the applicant on this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
