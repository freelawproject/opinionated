Johnson, executrix <em>v. </em>The Hudson River R. R. Co.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-9\">Although, as a general rule, \u201c ordinary prudence\u201d is all that can be exacted from a railroad company in respect to passengers on the same road, yet the rule is not to be understood as meaning that only the same degree of care is to be required in all cases.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-10\">The only safe interpretation of the rule is, that the company is bound to use a degree of care and vigilance, to prevent accidents and injury to others, which is proportioned to the dangerous character of its business, and of the mode and means of conducting it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-11\">The true rule may, therefore, be stated in these words: The degree of vigilance which the law exacts in its requirement of ordinary care, varies with the probable consequences of negligence, and also with the command of means to avoid injuring others possessed by the person on whom the obligation is imposed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-12\"><em>Held, </em>that applying this rule to the facts in evidence before him, the Judge, upon the trial, properly instructed the jury that, 'considering the nature of the business in which the defendants were engaged, and the hazards attending the running of cars in the streets of the city, particularly on a dark night, they were bound to use the utmost care and diligence, and for the purpose of avoiding accidents endangering life, were bound to use all the means and measures of precaution that the highest prudence would suggest, and which it was in their power to employ, and that if the use of bells and lights upon the cars was a measure by which disastrous accidents would probably be avoided, the omission to use them, if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was culpable negligence, and it was for the jury to say whether to this negligence the fatal accident which had given rise to the action might not justly be imputed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b665-13\"><em>Held, </em>therefore, that applying to the defendants the true rule of ordinary care, the Judge, under the circumstances detailed in the case, could not have required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>from them a less degree of diligence and prudence than that which he laid down as the measure of their obligation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-5\">The defendants\u2019 counsel insisted that the Judge erred in leaving the jury to determine whether the defendants should have carried lights or bells instead of determining, as a question of law, whether such use of lights or hells was exacted from the defendants in the exercise of ordinary care.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-6\"><em>Held, </em>that there was no error on the part of the Judge, that he did determine the question of law, namely, that the prudence exacted of the defendants was'that which, in view of the hazardous character of their business, would tend to diminish the danger of accidents, and that he properly left to the jury, as a question of fact, whether the use of lights or bells was a measure of that character.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-7\">The Judge charged the jury, that the deceased person, whose death was attributed to the negligence of the defendants, was hound to exercise only ordinary care; ' and he defined that care as the care and foresight which men of ordinary prudence are accustomed to employ, and which, placed in like circumstances, they probably would have employed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-8\"><em>Held, </em>that there was no error in this instruction to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-9\"><em>Held, </em>that the Judge properly refused to charge the jury, that the manner in which the deceased was found on the track of the railway, without any explanation as to how he got there, was presumptive evidence of negligence on his part.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-10\">It appeared on the trial that the deceased was a young man, between the ages of thirty and forty, and in good health, and the Judge charged the jury, that the probable continuance of his life was at least twenty years.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-11\"><em>Held, </em>that the expectation of life is a known scientific fact, to which a Judge, upon the trial of a cause, has the same right to advert as to a known historical fact, and as the expectation of life between the ages of thirty and forty is known to exceed thirty 'years, there was no error in the charge of the Judge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b666-12\">Judgment for plaintiff affirmed, with costs.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b666-13\">(Before Duer, Slosson, and Woodruff, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b666-14\">November 20, 1856 ;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsQ\">March 21, 1857.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-15\">Appeal by defendants from a judgment at Special Term in favor of the plaintiff for $4,456.18, damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-16\">The action was brought, by the plaintiff as executrix of the last will, etc., of her deceased husband, Peter A. Johnson, and the complaint averred that his death was occasioned by the culpable negligence of the defendants or their servants, a.nd demanded judgment for $5,000 as the pecuniary loss to his widow and children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-17\">The answer denied the negligence imputed, and averred that the fatal accident was solely owing to the negligence of the deceased himseff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-18\">The cause was tried before Duer, J., and a jury, at a Trial Term in January, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>It appeared on the trial, that on the night of the 28th of August, 1853, the deceased was run over by a freight car of the defendants\u2019 on the track of their road in West street at its intersection with Gansevoort street, in the city of New York, and that he died shortly thereafter, solely in consequence of the injuries and wounds which he then received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-5\">It also appeared that the night was very dark, and it was, in effect, determined by the verdict of the jury, that there were no bells on the horses nor lights on the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">It is needless to state more particularly the evidence given on the trial, or any of the exceptions taken in its progress, since the argument at General Term was confined entirely to the exceptions that were taken to the Judge\u2019s charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-7\">When the testimony was closed, he charged the jury \u201c That there were two questions which the jury, in the first instance, must consider, and both of which must be determined in favor of the plaintiff to entitle her to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-8\">These were\u20141st, Whether the accident, which resulted in the death of thfe deceased, was owing to the negligence of the defendants or their servants?\u2014and, 2d, Whether there was any negligence on the part of the deceased that directly contributed to the \u00fcccident? If both these questions were determined in favor of the plaintiff, the next question would be what sum, not exceeding that limited by the statute on which the action was founded, ought to be awarded to her as damages. That it was the exclusive province of the jury to decide these questions; and that his duty was limited to a statement of the rules of law by which their deliberations ought to be governed. That the negligence imputed to the defendants was, that there were no bells on the horses to warn persons of the approach of the car, and no lights on the car to enable the driver to see the track in front of his horses; and that he was driving more rapidly than was consistent with ordinary prudence. That it was his, the Judge\u2019s, duty to instruct them, that considering the nature of the business in which the defendants were engaged, and the hazards attending the running of cars in the streets of the city, and particularly on a dark night, they were bound to exercise the utmost care and diligence; and for the purpose of avoiding accidents endangering property and life, were bound to use all the means and measures of precaution that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the highest prudence would suggest, and which it was in their power to employ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\">Hence, if the use of bells and of lights was a measure that the prudence and foresight they were bound to exercise ought to have suggested, and if by such use disastrous accidents would probably be avoided, the omission to use them, if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was culpable negligence; and it was for the jury to say, whether to this culpable negligence the fatal accident that had given rise to the action might not justly be imputed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-7\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-8\">That it appeared to him, for divers reasons, that the driver of a car at night ought to be enabled to see whether there were any obstacles or persons on the track in front of him; and if the light afforded by the lamps in the street was not sufficient for that purpose, the use of lamps on the car seemed to him a necessary precaution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-9\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-10\">It was not to be supposed that the driver of the car had seen deceased on the track, and had wilfully run over him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-11\">To which opinion and proposition,- the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-12\">It was more probable, that from the want of light he could not see in front of his horses; or, if there was sufficient light, that his attention was directed another way; and, upon either supposition, there was negligence, to which the accident might reasonably be imputed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-13\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-14\">That according to the testimony of the witnesses of the plaintiff, there were neither bells on the horses, nor lights on the car, when the accident happened, and that the jury had a right to take into consideration the fact that none of the servants of the defendants who were on the car, neither the conductor nor driver, nor brakeman, had been called as witnesses for the defence, and as their absence had not been explained, it was a reasonable presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>that, if called, they would not have contradicted materially the witnesses of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">The Judge next said, that although the jury might be satisfied that there was culpable negligence on the part of the defendants, still the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, if the jury believed, from the evidence, that there was any negligence on the part of the deceased that directly contributed to the accident. Certainly he would not have been killed had he not been on the track of the railroad, and if his being there, as seemed to be contended, was conclusive proof of negligence, there was an end to the action. He certainly had not seen or heard the approach of the car in time to make his escape, and if this fact was alone sufficient to bar a recovery, no action like the present, however gross and culpable the negligence of a railroad company, could ever be maintained. It would be a sufficient answer to the plaintiff to say the deceased was on the track of the road, and, therefore, perished by his own rashness and folly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">To which opinion and proposition, the defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">The Judge then said that, in his opinion, this was not a conclusion that the jury were bound to draw, the deceased was bound to exercise ordinary prudence and no more, and the question the jury were to determine, was whether it appeared from the evidence that there had been a want on the part of the deceased of that care and foresight that men of ordinary prudence are accustomed to employ, and which, placed in like circumstances with the deceased, they probably would employ, and in judging of the conduct and motives of the deceased, they were bound to consider all the circumstances of the case as they had been established by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-8\">To which part of said charge, the defendants then and there duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-9\">The defendants specially excepted to the phrase, \u201cthis was not a conclusion the jury were bound to draw.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-10\">The defendants also specially excepted to the instruction that \u201c the deceased was bound to exercise ordinary prudence and no more, and the question the jury were to determine was, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>it appeared from the evidence that there had been a want on the part of the deceased of that care and foresight, that men of. ordinary prudence are accustomed to employ, and which, placed in like circumstances with the deceased, they probably would employ, and in judging of the conduct and motives of the deceased, they were bound to consider all the circumstances of the case as they had been established by the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-5\">1.

Because, if otherwise correct, it was calculated to mislead the jury. First, in the use of the word \u201c probably,\u201d and second, in the use of the words \u201cplaced in like circumstances,\u201d which tended to make intoxication, or sleep of the deceased, an excuse for the want of care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-8\">The Judge then stated the evidence bearing upon this branch of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-9\">On the question of damages, the Judge said, that if the jury should be of opinion, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, they could give no other or greater damages\u2014not exceeding $5000\u2014than would be sufficient to compensate the pecuniary loss which the widow and children had sustained from his death. There was no certain mode of estimating this loss, as it consisted entirely in a deprivation of the support and maintenance which they would have derived from him had he continued to live, and the question of its amount was therefore one not of positive calculation, but of mere probability. The deceased was a young man, in good health, and the probable continuance of his life was at least twenty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\">To that part of said charge which speaks of the probable duration of the life of the deceased, the defendants then and there duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-11\">During this time it was reasonable to believe that his wife and his children, during their minority, would have been supported by him; and the jury would, therefore, give such damages as in their judgment would be a full compensation for the loss of this support, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-12\">The said defendants, by their counsel, asked the said Justice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>charge the jury, that the fact that the manner in which the deceased was found on the track, without any explanation as to how he got there, was <em>prima, facie </em>evidence of negligence on his part. The said Justice refused so to charge, and to such refusal the said defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">The said defendants, by their counsel, asked the said Justice to charge the jury, that the defendants were not bound to carry bells on their horses when drawing their cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-6\">The said Justice refused so to charge, and to such refusal the said defendants, by their counsel, did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-7\">The defendants, by their counsel, further requested the said Justice to charge the j ury, that the defendants were not bound to carry lights on their cars when being drawn by their horses through the streets. The said Justice refused so to charge, and the defend ants\u2019 counsel excepted to the refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-8\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed her damages at $4000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-9\"><em>Fullerton, </em>for defendants, appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-10\"><em>J.

Slosson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArR\">On the 28th day of August, 1853, at about 8 o\u2019clock in the evening, the deceased, (Peter A. Johnson,) was run over by a freight car of the defendants\u2019, in West street, at its intersection with Gansevoort street, and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">The day had been rainy, and the evening was very dark. The verdict of the jury determines that there were no bells on the horses nor lights on the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The deceased was a cartman, and was on his return home in the evening, driving up on the east side of the track; a sewer was in the process of construction through Gansevoort street, it had extended across the track in West street; but at the time of the accident, it had been so far completed, as that it had been arched over on the west side to about the middle of the track, while on the east side it was open, so that no vehicle going north could pass on that side beyond the south line of Gansevoort street, at which point there was a mound of earth and some barrels which had been placed there to prevent any attempt at a passage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>A temporary bridge bad been thrown across the sewer, where the rails crossed it, to enable the horses attached to the cars to pass over. During the day a pole was placed across the track to prevent carts passing over the bridge, which was taken down when the cars were to pass, and appears to have been removed altogether at night. On the west side of the track carts could pass, according to some of the witnesses, to some little distance north of the sewer, when the projection of a pile of lumber narrowed the passage to nine or ten feet, and just beyond this, a building used as a corporation office, formed another projection, so as to leave between it and the track only four feet four inches. It was shown that ordinary carts are seven and'a half feet wide, while dirt carts are two feet narrower, so that neither description of cart could pass at this point except by running in part on the track itself. This corporation office was nearly opposite the north sidewalk of Gansevoort street, and at the same point there was a pile of stones and dirt from a foot to a foot and a-half in height. One witness says, that the west side of the track, by which I understand him to mean the side west of the track, <em>\u201c </em>was impassable on account of the excavation, the dirt, the paving stones, and the corporation office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">As has been stated, the night was very dark; the sound of the rolling of the car was obstructed by the water on the rails, though the clattering of the horses\u2019 feet was heard half a block off, and might have been heard farther, as one witness states, by one in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The deceased appears to have stopped and tied his horse near the embankment, on the east side of West street, at about twenty feet below the south line of Gansevoort street, and to have dismounted and gone on to the track, for when the cars had passed, he was found lying across it, about six feet south of the embankment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">It is reasonable to conjecture that his object in going upon the track, was to make a personal examination of the bridge over the causeway, with. a view of ascertaining whether he could safely pass over it, with his cart. The car had crushed one of his legs. He was removed to the hospital, and died soon afterwards. He was between thirty and forty years of age, of good habits, and making from $25 to $30 a week by his business. He left a widow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(the plaintiff,) and three infant children, the youngest but three months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On the trial, a motion was made for a non-suit on the ground, among others, that the plaintiff had offered no pooof showing affirmatively that the deceased was not guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident, which motion was overruled, and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">This court has never recognized the rule which seems to be laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>The Utica and Schenectady Railroad Co., </em>(5 Barb. Rep. 337,) to wit: That absence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff is to be shown by him affirmatively, but have held directly otherwise. The case of <em>Britton, </em>admx. v. <em>The Hudson River Railroad Co., </em>recently decided by the General Term of this court, is directly in point. It had been previously so decided in this very case. (5 Duer, 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The Judge, in charging the jury, told them, \u201cthat considering the nature of the business in which the defendants were engaged, and the hazards attending the running of cars in the streets of the city, and particularly on a dark night, the defendants were bound to exercise the utmost care and diligence, and for the purpose of avoiding accidents, endangering property and life, were bound to use all the means and measures of precaution that the highest prudence would suggest, and which it was in their power to employ. Hence,\u201d he added, \u201c if the use of bells and of lights was a measure that the prudence and foresight the defendants were bound to exercise ought to have suggested, and if by such use disastrous accidents would probably be avoided, the omission to use them, if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was culpable negligence, and that it was for the jury to say, whether to this culpable negligence the fatal accident that had given rise to the action might not justly be imputed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">To both the general proposition itself, and the application of it by the Judge, the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Brand </em>v. <em>The Schenectady and Troy Railroad Co., </em>(8 Barb. R. 368,) held, \u201c that ordinary prudence was all that could be exacted from a railroad company, as between it and a foot passenger in the street, being the same rule or degree of care which is exacted, as between each other, in the case of two carriages using a comm on highway to which each has an equal right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\"With the highest respect for the learning and ability of the eminent Judge who pronounced the decision in that case, I cannot but think that this proposition is open to serious criticism. It seems to me that the only safe rule in such a case, is this, to wit: That the company is bound to use a degree of care and vigilance in respect to the use of the means whereby accidents or injury to those using the same thoroughfare in common with themselves, may be avoided, which is proportioned to the dangerous character of its business, or of the mode and means of conducting the same, while the foot passenger is bound to that degree of caution which persons thus exposed on a public thoroughfare ought in common prudence to exercise. This prudence may in both be called ordinary, yet the degree of diligence and precaution which it exacts of each is as widely different, as is the risk to which each exposes others from the want or absence of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In the case of <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Barney and </em>others, (2 Kern. R. 425,) which was a case of collision between two vessels, Johnson, Justice, in defining ordinary care, uses this language: \u201c The degree of vigilance which the law will exact, as implied by the requirement of ordinary care, must vary with the probable consequences of negligence, and also with the command of means to avoid injuring others, possessed by the person on whom the obligation is imposed. Under some circumstances a very high degree of vigilance is demanded by the requirement of ordinary care; where the consequence of negligence will probably be serious injury to others, and where the means of avoiding the infliction of injury upon others are completely within the party\u2019s power, ordinary care requires almost the utmost degree of human vigilance and foresight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The learned Justice refers in his opinion to the case of the <em>Scioto, </em>in which Judge Ware uses the expression that \u201ca vessel entering a harbor in the night time, is put on her utmost vigilance.\u201d Hot that the vessel so entering the harbor would be responsible, if by any possible means the danger of a collision might have been avoided, but that from the increased hazard arising from the circumstance of entering the harbor in the night time, an increased vigilance and watchfulness would be required, which Judge Ware exemplifies by saying, that under such circumstances the master and crew ought to be on deck, and in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>parts of the vessel as to be able to control her motions, and see any vessel which lies in her track. It certainly would not be contended that it would be necessary that both the master and the crew should all be on the look-out and on deck if the vessel were entering the port in broad day-light. The principle asserted is, that the vigilance and care are to be proportioned to the risk and danger to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The good sense and soundness of this view of the question cannot, I think, be doubted. \u2022 If the vigilance and care are to be proportioned to the danger to be avoided, it becomes immaterial by what name the obligation is designated or defined. If the Judge in the case at bar had instructed the jury, that in the exercise of ordinary care, the defendants were bound to the exact degree of vigilance which he stated as the measure of their actual obligation, I do not see how the charge could have been complained of; and certainly if the standard of care which he laid down was correct, the question\u2014whether a proper definition was given to it or not ?\u2014is wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The Judge, in applying the rule to the case in hand, defines his meaning so clearly, that it cannot, I think, be misapprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">He told the jury that, if the use of bells and lights would probably prevent the occurrence of such disasters, and if their use was a measure that the prudence and foresight the defendants were bound to exercise ought to have suggested, it was culpable negligence in them not to have used them. Now I think it must occur to the commonest apprehension, that the very least or lowest degree of vigilance which could be required at the hands of the defendants in running loaded cars at night, with four horses, through the streets of a crowded city, would be the use of bells and lights, or some similar precaution, to give warning of their approach. In submitting to the jury, therefore, the question of their use as a measure called for by the prudence which the law exacted from the defendants, the Judge left them clearly within the range of the rule of .ordinary care, as commonly understood, if he did not, indeed, limit them to it altogether. Nor was this left to them as a question to be arbitrarily determined; its propriety was to be tried by this criterion, to wit: Whether the use of bells and lights would probably prevent the occurrence of disasters of this nature? Of this the jury were exclusively the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>judges, and if, in their opinion, such would be the beneficial result of the use of bells and lights, then, as upon any rule of prudence, the defendants were bound to guard against the danger of such accidents, their use was a measure called for by the degree of care which the law imposed upon the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Nor do I think that in judging of the propriety of the use of bells and lights, the jury were led by any thing in the charge to <em>adopt a </em>standard of obligation on the part of the defendants, which was not the true one, or that the result would have been at all different had the Judge prefaced his definition of the prudence to which the defendants were bound, by calling it \u201cordinary care.\u201d Nor do I think that in any definition of ordinary care, as applied to these defendants under the circumstances detailed in this case, he could have required a less degree of vigilance and prudence than that which he laid down as the measure of their actual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">- The good sense of the charge SQems to me to be plainly this : The defendants, considering the great hazard to which their business exposes the lives and safety of the passers by and travellers in the street, are bound to use that diligence and care, if practicable, by which the danger of casualty may be diminished. They cannot run their cars without any precautions whatever, and no precautions will suffice, save such as tend to secure against the occurrence of the disasters to which the exercise of their business peculiarly exposes others; and if, in the judgment of the jury, the use of bells and lights would have this tendency, then the use of that expedient was one which the prudence, exacted of them by the law, required at their hands. The test of the obligation to use them, as the case was thus put to the jury, was not the formal definition of the rule of diligence, but the tendency of the expedient to diminish the danger of those disasters, which the defendants were bound, upon the commonest principles of humanity, and under the lowest obligations of a reasonable diligence, to guard against.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u2022 The defendants\u2019 counsel denies altogether that the use of bells or lights is called for by the rule of ordinary care; on the contrary, he says, the degree of care which should be exercised in any given case, is a matter of law to be determined by the court; and that in leaving to the jury to determine whether the defendants should have carried lights or bells, the court shifted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>itself to the jury the duty of determining whether the defendants ought not to have exercised more than ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">We think there is a fallacy in this proposition. The Judge did not leave to the jury to say, whether the defendants were bound to carry bells and lights, but whether the use of them was called for by that prudence which they were bound to exercise. In other words, whether, in view of the peculiarly hazardous character of their business, and under all the circumstances of the case, it would have been a prudent measure on the part of the defendants, rendering danger of accident less liable; and if so, then, as a matter of law, he instructed them the defendants were bound to have used them; and not to have done so, was negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">He therefore did determine the question of law, to wit: That the prudence exacted of the defendants was that which, in view of the hazardous character of their business, would tend to diminish the danger of accident, leaving to the jury only this question\u2014whether the use of bells and lights was a measure of that character? which was a question purely of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I think the rule laid down by the Judge at the trial is the true one, to wit: A degree of care proportioned to the danger to others\u2014whether this be called \u201c ordinary\u201d care, or \u201cthe utmost,\u201d or \u201chighest\u201d care, or \u201cdiligence,\u201d is immaterial, a mere question of words; so long as the standard is right, its name is \"a matter of no consequence. A great principle may easily be lost sight of in this adherence to definitions. It seems to me that no other rule can be safely adopted. It is one which is not dependent on contract or the consideration of a compensation for service, but is founded on the general principle of humanity towards others, and the obligation so to use one\u2019s own property and exercise one\u2019s own rights as not to injure others.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The Judge also charged, that as respects the deceased, he was bound to exercise only ordinary care; and to this there was an exception. This is certainly not a proposition that the defendants should quarrel with, as it is the one they contend should be applied to themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The difficulty of applying the rule of diligence to either party in cases of this kind, arises from the very terms in which the law has, from custom, clothed the definition of it. \u201c Ordinary \u201d care, in its common acceptation, means the same thing, to whomsoever applied, and under whatever circumstances. The only solution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>to the difficulty, is, in measuring the requirements of \u201cordinary care\u201d by the circumstances of the party; and to use the language of the learned Judge, in <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>already cited: \u201c By the probable consequences of negligence, and by the command of means to avoid injuring others, possessed by the person on whom the obligation is imposed.\u201d As respects these defendants, the probable consequences of their negligence would be death, or maiming to the party injured; and as to the command of means to avoid such a disaster, if the use of bells or lights would tend to such a result, it is for them to show that it is not in their power to adopt such an expedient, or they should be estopped from denying that the obligation of prudence exacts it at their hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">When, however, we speak of ordinary prudence, as applied to a passenger in the street, we mean something widely different. His being on the track, may, under certain circumstances, be negligence, which would relieve the company from liability for the consequences of an injury to him, but it is not a negligence which exposes them to hazard; the prudence which he is to exert is one which is necessary for his own protection, and must be of precisely that degree which is commensurate with the danger to which he is exposed. To attempt to pass in front bf a carriage driven slowly, at a moderate distance, might not violate any rule of prudence, while to make the same attempt in front of a car, approaching at the same speed, and at the same distance, might be extremely hazardous. There is no applying \u201c ordinary care \u201d by a fixed measure, to all possible cases. It must vary in the degrees of its requirement according to circumstances. \u201c Reasonable care\u201d would have been a much happier and more intelligible expression. We think the Judge sufficiently and promptly defined it when he said that it was \u201cthat care and foresight which men of ordinary prudence are accustomed to employ, and which, placed in like circumstances with the deceased, they probably would have employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendants also contend that it was error in the Judge to have charged that the negligence of the plaintiff, which would excuse the defendants, must have contributed directly to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">This ruling is in exact accordance with the language of the court, in <em>Caldwell </em>v. Murphy, (1 Duer R., 233,) and with the decision in <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>N. Y. and N. H. Railroad Co., </em>(1 Duer, 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The Judge further told the jury, that it was probable that from the want of lights the driver of the car could not see in front of his horses, or if there was sufficient light, that his attention was directed another way; and that upon either supposition, there was negligence to which the accident might reasonably be imputed, and to this part of the charge also the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">As the Judge had already left it to the jury to say whether the use of lights in the cars was a measure that the prudence and foresight which the defendants were bound to exercise ought to have suggested, this part of the charge must be read in that connection; and thus read, the meaning of it is, that if the jury should find the question thus submitted to them in the affirmative, then the absence of lights, enabling the driver to see in advance of his horses, was negligence; or if in fact there were lights, but his attention was not given to his horses, but diverted elsewhere, that would be negligence. It was reiterating in another form the proposition already advanced by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We think the Judge properly refused to charge that the manner in which the deceased was found on the track, without any explanation as to how he got there, was <em>prima fade </em>evidence of negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">He was not discovered until after the car had passed over him, and to hold that, because he was then found lying athwart the track, his position was presumptive evidence of negligence on his part, which, unexplained, would excuse the negligence of the defendants, would be giving the latter the benefit of their own wrong, and would forever preclude the possibility of a recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The Judge further told the jury, in this connection, that the deceased \u201ccertainly had not seen or heard the approach of the ear in time to make his escape, and if the /act of his being found on the track was alone sufficient t\u00f3 bar a recovery, no action like the present, however gross and culpable the negligence of a railroad company, could ever be maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The defendants contend that it was error in the Judge to tell the jury that the deceased \u201c certainly had not seen or heard the approach of the car in time to make his escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">As it was not pretended that the deceased was a voluntary victim, it seems to follow that he could not have seen or heard the approach of the cars. Was it negligence in him not to have done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>so ? The defendants contend that it was. That question was not withdrawn from the jury, for they were told that if they believed from the evidence that he was guilty of any negligence directly contributing to the disaster, the plaintiff could not recover. The effect of the language in question is this: The deceased was, certainly, not on the road for the purpose of self-destruction; no presumption of this kind can be entertained, and if so, then the mere fact that he was found dead on the track does not, of itself, raise a presumption of negligence on his part which will bar a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Judge also charged, that the omission of the defendants to call either the conductor, driver, or brakeman, as witnesses on their behalf, unexplained, raised a reasonable presumption, that if called, they would not have contradicted materially the witnesses of the plaintiff, and to this there was an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">This is in clear accordance with an elementary rule, that a party who has the power to produce the best evidence on the subject, and omits to do it without excusing the omission, justifies by such omission the presumption that the evidence, if adduced, would operate to his prejudice, or, at least, would not help his case. (1 Starkie\u2019s Ev. 34; C. &amp; H.\u2019s Notes, n. 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">On the question of damages, the Judge, among other things, said to the jury, that the \u201c deceased was a young man in good health, and the probable continuance of his life was at least twenty years.\u201d The defendants contend that it was error thus to have instructed the jury in respect to the probable continuance of the life of the deceased. The evidence was, that he was over thirty years old\u2014how much does not appear; but the reasonable inference from the expression, \u201c over thirty years of age,\u201d is that he was under forty.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">I have been referred to certain tables prepared from the combined experience of seventeen life insurance offices, from which it appears that the expectation of human life at thirty years of age is 34-43 years, and at forty years is 27-28 years, so that the Judge was within limits when he said that it was at least twenty years. This is a matter of experience, about which it was not error in the Judge to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">On the whole case,, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Justice Woodruff dissented from the foregoing opinion and its conclusions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
