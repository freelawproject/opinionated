(Reported in 14 How. Pr. E. 18.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b712-13\"> Notice of the judgment was served on the 13th of March, 1856. The motion for leave to file exceptions to the decision of the referee, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>was made in March, 1857. The decision in <em>Sheldon, et al </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>was probably made on the strength of <em>Seeley v. Prichard, </em>(3 Duer, 669.) Subsequent to-tlie latter decision the case of <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>(1 Kern. 274,) was reported. At the June General Term, 1858, the Superior Court, held before Bosworth, Hoffman, Slosson, Woodruff, and Pierrepont, J.J., decided (Hoffman, J., dissenting), that the eonrt had no power to enlarge the time prescribed by statute for taking an appeal from the Special Term. (The case of <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>not yet reported). If that de cisi\u00f3n be correct, it may well be doubted whether the court has any more power to allow exceptions to the final decision of the court or of a referee to be filed, after the expiration of the time given by the Code, than it has to allow exceptions to be taken after judgment to a' decision made during the progress of the trial._ Rep.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
