In such a case, if the debt for the recovery of which, or the obligation on which the action is brought, was not fraudulently contracted or incurred, the defendant cannot be held to bail. The order, refusing to vacate an order of arrest, on which defendant was held to bail in the sum of $45,000, reversed. (13 How. Pr.

To authorize an order for his arrest, he must have been guilty of a fraud in incurring the obligation for which the action is brought, in which the order of arrest is made or applied for. Code, \u00a7 197, sub. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">......The contract, or obligation, on which this action is brought, was made or incurred without any fraud being practised to procure it. It was accepted as a settlement of the transaction, in respect to which the alleged fraud was practised, and with full knowledge of it. I think this ground sufficient to require a reversal of the order appealed from.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
