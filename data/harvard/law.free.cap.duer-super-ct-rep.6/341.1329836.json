The same <em>v. </em>The same.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-5\">One Potter, of Massachusetts, and Stebbins, the defendant, on the 15th of August, 1864, exchanged notes, each giving to the other his two notes, of the same date and amount, and having the same time to run. Potter, holding the two notes received from the defendant, on the security of them and of other notes, amounting in all to $11,956.04, procured the plaintiffs on the 23d of August, 1854, to discount his note of that date for $8000, payable ten days thereafter. He failed to pay his $8000 note. He was proceeded against as an insolvent, in Massachusetts, and on the 11th of October, 1854, Shaw <em>&amp; </em>Swain were appointed trustees of his estate by a commission of insolvency, and he assigned his property to them as such trustees. When both of the said notes, so made by Stebbins, became due, and separate suits had been brought thereon, only $3614.67 of the other collaterals had become due, and they had been paid. When the said two actions were tried, and they were tried together, all of the other collaterals had matured and produced enough to pay the note which the plaintiffs discounted for Potter, into the sum of $196.11, including interest.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-6\"><em>Held, </em>that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment in the actions on the notes made by Stebbins for the amount of the notes, with interest and the costs of the actions; that each note was a good consideration for the one exchanged for it; that at the time Potter conveyed his estate to Shaw <em>&amp; </em>Swain, as trustees in the insol- . vency proceedings, the defendant could not have compelled the notes made by him to be set-off against those he received in exchange therefor; that any equities which Stebbins might have, could only be considered and determined . in an action or proceeding, to which Potter, Shaw, and Swain were parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aq2\">That an order or provision in the judgments, permitting him to be discharged therefrom on paying to the plaintiffs the balance due to them from Potter on the $8000 note, and the costs of the twc actions, and the residue of the moneys into court, to abide its further decision, on application for such moneys to be made either by Shaw <em>&amp; </em>Swain, or by the defendant, on due personal notice to the other of the time and place,of such application, secured to the defendant all the relief to which he was entitled in such actions on such a state of facts.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b373-7\">(Before Duer, Bosworth and Woodruff, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b373-8\">December 13, 1856;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWTF\">February 14, 1857.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">These actions came before the court on an appeal by the defendant from the judgment rendered in each of them.

The plaintiffs held the note as collateral security only, with other collaterals, to secure a loan by them to Thomas Potter. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>payment of Potter\u2019s indebtedness to them, all the surplus col-laterals reverted to Potter as the party beneficially interested in them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">II. The plaintiffs have been paid all Potter\u2019s indebtedness to them, except $183.23. All beyond that amount is prosecuted for the benefit of Potter, who is the party beneficially interested, and whom the plaintiffs represent as his agent; and the note set up in the answer is a good set-off beyond the $183.23 and interest, and beyond this the plaintiffs are in precisely the same position that Potter would be were he the plaintiff. (Barbour on Set-off, p. 71, and authorities cited; id. p. 115 to 129, and authorities; 2 R. S. 4th Ed. 354, \u00a7 12, sub. 7; <em>Coppin </em>v. Craig, 7 Taunton, 243; <em>Hawkins </em>v. Whittin, 10 Barn. &amp; Cress. 217; <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Cass, </em>1 Barn. &amp; Adolph. 343.) (a.) The plaintiffs, nor Potter\u2019s assignee in insolvency, can claim any better or superior equities than Potter himself could.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">III. The question of the insolvency of Potter, under the laws of Massachusetts, or any proceedings thereunder, is immaterial and cannot arise in this case, to the prejudice of Stebbins\u2019 defence or set-off. <em>(Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Selden, 320; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>pr. Paige, J., p. 350, 351; Barbour on Set-off, p. 115 to 129.) <em>(a.) </em>The defendant objected to the testimony of such insolvency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">IV. The statutory insolvent proceedings against Potter, in Massachusetts, whereby his property was assigned to a commissioner in bankruptcy, under the insolvent laws of Massachusetts, did not operate to transfer the debt due by the appellant Stebbins, a resident of this state, as maker of the note in suit, or so as to prejudice or affect his right of set-off or counter-claim, or other defence as against Potter. And the foreign assignees of Potter stand in precisely the same position as against Stebbins, that Potter himself would, if there had been no insolvent proceedings had against him. <em>(Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Selden, p. 320; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>pr. Paige, J., p. 350 and 351, and authorities cited; <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Plestero, </em>3 Wend. 538; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>23 Wend. 89; <em>Willett, president </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>12 Howard Sp. T. R. p. 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">V. So long as Stebbins held the note of Potter before his insolvency or bankruptcy, it can be set-off against the note in suit. (Barbour on Set-off, 115 to 129; <em>ex parte </em>Hall Co. Bank Laws, 553; <em>Root </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>20 John. 137; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Brinckerhoff, </em>8 Bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>bour, 519, affirmed; 2 Selden, 388; <em>Hancock </em>v.

The judgment was against law, and should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">YH. The stay of proceedings under the order should be extended, so as to preserve the rights of the appellant, in case he should deem it advisable to appeal bom the furtller judgment of this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-7\"><em>West &amp; </em>Clover, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-8\">By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8n\">The note, on which the first action was brought, matured on the 18th.of October, 1854. That on which the second action was brought, matured on the 18th of November, 1854. The first action was commenced on the 3d of November, and the second on the 25th of November, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">On the 23d of August, 1854, the plaintiffs discounted for Thomas Potter his note of that date, for $8000, payable ten days after its date, on the deposit of the two notes in suit, with others, as collateral security. When the second action was commenced, the amount due to the plaintiffs, on the $8000 note, exceeded the aggregate of the two notes in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Thomas Potter was a citizen of Massachusetts. On the 10th of October, 1854, before either of the two notes in suit had become due, Potter being insolvent, an assignment of his property was made to John H. Shaw and Alanson Swain, by a commissioner of insolvency, under the insolvent laws of the state of Massachusetts. The effect of such an assignment, according to those laws, is not stated in the case, nor are the laws themselves referred to. The fact that such an assignment was made is alleged in the defendant\u2019s answer, and was admitted on the trial. It was also admitted that the defendant proved, before the commissioners in insolvency, the notes made by Potter and given to the defendant in exchange for the two in suit. The admissibility of proof of these facts was objected to by the defendant, but not the nature or sufficiency of the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The assignment must be deemed effectual to transfer to the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>signees, Shaw &amp; Swain, all the right, title, and interest of Potter, to the notes in suit. That gave them a right to claim of the plaintiffs the surplus of the collaterals over and above the amount necessary to satisfy the $8000 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">If the present defendant had instituted an action on the 10th of October, 1854, against Potter and the plaintiffs, before the assignment to Shaw and Swain, to compel a set-off of one set of notes against the other, it would have been of no avail. The plaintiff would have had a right to have the amount of the two notes then applied towards the payment of the $8000 note. Neither the notes made by the defendant, nor those made by Potter, were due when that assignment was made. The note of llOSOylnr, made by Potter, had been discounted for the defendant, and from that time until he took it up, on the day of its maturity, he was not the owner of it. The notes made by the defendant cannot be set-off against those made by Potter, under the Revised Statutes, in relation to set-offs, because neither of the notes was due at the time of Potter\u2019s assignment in insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Courts of equity follow the law in regard to matters of set-off, unless there is some intervening natural equity going beyond the statutes of set-off, which constitute the general basis of set-off at law. <em>(Howe, et al. </em>v. <em>Shephard, </em>2 Sum. 412; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Lewis, et al. </em>ib. 633-634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">It is also a general rule, that one of two persons indebted to each other, may file a bill to compel a set-off, if the debt owing to himself is due, though the one owing by himself is not due, if the other party is insolvent; but he cannot do so before the debt owing to himself is due. <em>(Keep </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>2 Duer, 78; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Angel, </em>3 Coms. 475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">But that rule is applicable only to the parties themselves, when no rights of third parties have intervened. That is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">If Potter had owned the notes in suit when they matured, and had then been insolvent, it may be true that the present defendant could have maintained an action to compel a set-off of the one set against the other. But this case does not present any such question. There is no allegation in the answer, that there was any expectation or agreement that one note should be set-off against the other, or that Potter should pay at maturity the notes made by Stebbins. The inference, from the allegations of the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>swer, as well as from the facts found by the court, is that it was expected each party would pay the notes made by himself, and that the notes of the one were the consideration given for those o\u00ed the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">I think it quite apparent, that the legal and equitable rights of the defendant upon the facts, as they existed at the time of the trial, depend upon the effect of the insolvent proceedings in Massachusetts, and upon the effect, also, of the act of the defendant, in proving before the Commissioners in Insolvency, the two notes made by Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Shaw and Swain are necessary parties to any proceedings which may be had to determine those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The utmost relief to which the defendant is entitled, is exemption from liability to the plaintiffs, on paying to them $196^-, and their costs in both actions, with interest, and the residue of the judgments into court to abide its further order.
