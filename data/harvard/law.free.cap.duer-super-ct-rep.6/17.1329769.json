The action was brought by the plaintiff, as owner in fee of the dwelling-house known as 496 Broadway, in the city of New York, to recover damages for the injuries alleged to have been done to his dwelling-house, by the wrongful disturbance and removal of an ancient party-wall, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>by depriving the house of the plaintiff of the support to which it was entitled. <em>The </em>defendants answered separately, and in their answers denied all the material allegations of the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">The cause was tried before Boswobth, J., and a jury, in March, 1855, and after the cause had been opened on the part of the plaintiff, the counsel for the defendant moved the court for judgment for the defendants, upon the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court denied the motion, and the counsel for the defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">The counsel for the plaintiff then proved that the premises 494, as well as 496, were portions of a row of similar buildings which had been erected previous to the year 1820, with partition-walls in common as at present, and then gave evidence tending to show that the defendants had lowered the floor of the first story of the premises 494 Broadway; that for that purpose the foundation of the division-wall between Hos. 494 and 496, on the north side of <em>No. </em>494, had been cut down about eighteen inches; that the cellar of Ho. 494 had been dug down to about the same depth, and the division:wall underpinned; that in consequence thereof, the division-wall had settled down some two or three inches, carrying down the floors of 496, and that the front and rear brick walls of that building were cracked, and that the damage to Ho, 496 was from six hundred to fifteen hundred dollars. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that a common and proper manner of underpinning a wall, under which excavations to a small depth are made, is to dig out the earth in sections of two or three feet in length, and to underpin the wall in those sections before digging any more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">On the cross-examination of George Peckham, a witness on the part of the plaintiff, he testified that the premises, Ho. 496 Broadway, were leased by the plaintiff for a term of years by a written lease, to which he was subscribing witness. The counsel for the defendants called upon the counsel for the plaintiff to produce such lease. The counsel for the plaintiff produced the same, and the counsel for the defendants read it in evidence in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">\u201c This agreement, made the eighth day of February, in the year 1851, between Amos R.

Lawrence, administrator of the goods, etc., of Isaac Lawrence, deceased, to the plaintiff, and one John J. Phelps; and also a deed, bearing date the 18th day of June, 1846, made by the said John J.

Lawrence had lawful authority to make said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">The counsel for the plaintiff offered in evidence a deed, bearing date the 20th day of Hovember, 1839, purporting to have been made by Isaac Lawrence, and Cornelia B., his wife, to Julia B. L. Wells, for the premises now known as 494 Broadway, in which deed the said premises are described in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">All that certain house and lot of land, lying and being in the fourteenth ward of the city of Hew York, on the easterly side of Broadway, now known and distinguished as Ho. 494, in said street, bounded as follows, to wit: westerly, in front, on Broadway ; easterly, in the rear, by land now or formerly of John Jacob Astor; northerly, by the house and lot of the said John Jacob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Astor, containing in breadth, in front and rear, twenty-three feet, and in depth, on each side, one hundred feet, be the same more or less. The northerly wall of said house, hereby conveyed, being a party-wall, and the northerly side of said lot, hereby conveyed, being in a line through the centre of said wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">The counsel for the defendants objected to the reception of said deed in evidence, on the ground that the plaintiff has complained as for injuries to an ancient wall, and is not entitled to give evidence by deed of a reservation to his grantor of an easement in the wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The court overruled the objection, and received the deed in evidence, to which the counsel for defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">The counsel for the plaintiff then proved, that the defendant Del Vecchio is the lessee for a term of years of the premises at 494 Broadway, and that the defendant Snyder had made the alterations on those premises for the defendant Del Vecchio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\">The counsel for the plaintiff rested his case, and the counsel for the defendant Snyder moved for a dismissal of the complaint, as to said'defendant, on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">1st. There is no evidence to connect Snyder with the injury complained of. 2d. The plaintiff must elect whether he will go against Del Vecchio or Snyder.

There is no proof showing that this would be an injury to the reversion\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">Which motion was denied by the court, and the counsel for the defendant Snyder duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\">The counsel for the defendant Del Vecchio moved for a dismissal of the complaint, as to said defendant, on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-12\">1st. There is no evidence showing that the plaintiff had an easement in that part of the wall which stood on the defendant\u2019s lot. 2d. That the plaintiff, by his complaint, claims damages to both the possession and the freehold; the proof shows an outstanding lease for years, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for injuries to the possession, and can only recover for injuries to the freehold by complaining as reversioner. 3d. There is no evi-dence that Del Vecchio did the work which occasioned the alleged injury, or employed the men who did it. 4th. This action can not be maintained jointly against the principal and agent. 5th. There is no evidence to show that the alterations on the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Del Yecchio\u2019s premises were done in a negligent or unskillful manner; but, on the contrary, the evidence is, that it appeared to have been done carefully. The complaint is not sustained by the evidence, and should be dismissed. 6th. The action is improperly brought. It should have been an action of trespass, and not on the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">Which motion was denied by the court, and the counsel for the defendant Del Yecchio duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The counsel for the defendants then gave evidence tending to show that the alterations in the premises No. 494 Broadway were made in a prudent and careful manner, that the undermining of the division wall was done in sections of two or three feet at a time, and that the division wall, and the front and rear walls of the plaintiff\u2019s house, were cracked at the time of the alterations in No. 494 Broadway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">The defendants also gave evidence tending to prove that the front of the building 496 Broadway had been so altered and repaired, as to make the same as perfect as before the alleged injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-8\">The counsel for the defendant Del Yecchio called as a witness upon his behalf the defendant John Snyder, who testified that he was employed by the defendant Del Yecchio under a contract to make the alterations on No. 494 Broadway, that he did malee those alterations pursuant to such contract, furnished the materials therefor, and employed and paid the men who did the work; that before he commenced work he called on the tenant in possession of 496 Broadway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-9\">The defendant Del Yecchio offered to prove, that before the work on 494 Broadway was commenced the witness called on the tenant in possession of 496, who was the assignee of the lease of the plaintiff to Losee, and notified him of the intention to make the alterations on No. 494, and that he assented thereto. The counsel for the plaintiff objected, the court sustained the objection, and the counsel for the defendant Del Yecchio duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-10\">The counsel for the defendant Snyder offered to prove the same facts by the defendant Del Yecchio, the counsel for the plaintiff objected, the court sustained the objection, and the counsel for the defendant Snyder -duly excepted. When the evidence was closed, the counsel for the defendant Del Yecchio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>moved the court to direct the jury to find a verdict in his favor, on the ground that it appeared that the work was done by the employees of the defendant Snyder, that the relationship of master and servant did not exist between the defendant Del Vecchio and the men who did the work, and he is not responsible for their negligence, which motion was denied, and the counsel for Del Vecchio duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">The counsel for the defendant Del Vecchio requested the court to charge the jury\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">1st. That if Snyder did the work under a contract with Del Vecchio, and the work was done by Snyder\u2019s employees, Del Vecchio is not liable for their negligence, and the jury must find for him. 2d. That Del Vecchio had a right to cut down the wall, dig out the cellar, and underpin the wall on his own premises if he chose to do so, and would be responsible only for the negligence- of his own immediate employees. 3d. That the wall in question is not, in view of law, a party-wall. 4th. That the defendants were not bound to give the plaintiff notice of their intention- to cut down and underpin the wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">The court refused so to charge, and the counsel for the defendant Del Vecchio duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">The counsel for the defendant Snyder requested the court to charge the jury\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-9\">1st. That if they should find for the plaintiff, he is only entitled to such damages as the plaintiff has sustained as reversioner only, after the expiration of the term of the lessee, and the plaintiff has given no evidence of such damages. 2d. That there must be some act as tortious, in which both parties concurred, before they can find for the plaintiff in this joint action. 3d. That as the plaintiff has a covenant to repair by the tenant, with security, the plaintiff is not shown to have sustained any injury in consequence of any of the acts complained of. 4th. That the- mason was under no obligation to give notice of the doing of the work; that if there was any such obligation, it rested with Del Vecchio, and Snyder can not be held responsible for the omission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\">The court refused so to charge, and the counsel for the defendant Snyder duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-11\">The court charged the jury that where an owner conveys land, declaring a wall to be a party-wall, each subsequent- owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>land so conveyed, and of the adjoining land, has a perfect right to have the wall continued as it was, without any alterations, except by his consent, and that if either of such owners should make any alterations to such wall upon his own side thereof, without the consent of the other, he would be liable to such other owner for any damages sustained by reason of such alterations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">To which charge the counsel for the defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">The court also charged, that if, by reason of the alterations to the party-wall, the plaintiff has sustained damage, both defendants are liable for the whole damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">To which charge the counsel for the defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-8\"><em>G.

He cited, among other authorities, the following: (4 Comstock, 196; 1 Seld. 48; 1 Maule &amp; Selw. 234 ;5 Cush. 592 ; 4 Exch. Rep. 24; 1 Eng.

A. </em>Nichols, for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIb\">argued at large, that none of the exceptions taken on the trial could be sustained, and insisted, that the charge of the Judge was throughout correct, and in accordance with the rule of law; that a party who contemplates alterations upon his own premises, endangering those adjoining, must give reasonable notice, and is chargeable with all the consequences of a neglect to give such notice; he cited 4 Paige, 169; 9 Barn. &amp; Cres. 725; 1 Cromp. &amp; Jarvis, 20. He also insisted that the plaintiff had an easement in the use of the wall in question by prescription and by grant. He cited 12 Mass. 157, and <em>Gale </em>and <em>Wansly's </em>case, 9 Barn. &amp; Cres. 148 to 161.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-11\">By the Court. Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">When this case was before the court in October, 1854,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> nearly all of the questions raised by the present appeal were presented to the consideration of the court. We regard the- opinion then given as so far conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>upon those questions, that it is not proper to open them here for discussion. That opinion must therefore be taken as the opinion of the court in relation to all matters embraced therein, or which are impliedly covered thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It was then decided that, in any view of the rights and liabilities of the parties, the plaintiff was entitled to notice of the defendants\u2019 design to take down the wall in question ; but that if it was found that the wall in question was a party-wall, then that the question of notice or no notice to the plaintiff was immaterial, because in that case the defendant had no right to interfere with the wall at all without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, unless he could do so without injury to the plaintiff\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under what circumstances the wall is to be deemed a party-wall, is stated, so far as is material to the present case, in the following propositions, with the conclusions therefrom :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u201c 1st. If the owner of two adjoining lots erects buildings upon them with a wall partly on each, to be used as a support to both buildings, and which is necessary to furnish such support, and which is used for that purpose from the time of its erection, a conveyance of either house and lot, with its appurtenances, grants an easement, for the support of the house so conveyed, in so much of the wall as stands on the other lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\"><em>\u201c2d. </em>After such a grant and a continued use of such party-wall, to support both buildings for more than twenty years, neither can remove the wall, nor so deal with it as to render it an insufficient support for the other\u2019s building, without his consent. If he does he is liable to the other for the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u201c 3d. If either wishes to improve his own premises before the party-wall has become ruinous, or incapable of further answering the purposes for which it was erected, he may underpin the foundation, sink it deeper, and increase, within the limits of his own lot, the thickness, length, or height of the party-wall, if he can do so without injury to the building on the adjoining lot; and to avoid such injury he may shore up and support the original party-wall a reasonable time to excavate and place a new underpinning beneath it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u201c 4th. But he cannot interfere with it in any manner unless he can do so without injury to the adjoining building, or without the consent of the owner of such building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>In regard to the rule of damages, in case the plaintiff should be under these propositions entitled to recover, the rule is stated to be that \u201c he will be entitled to recover such sum as will put him in the state in which he was before the injuryin other words, he is entitled to be \u201cindemnified to the full extent of the injury occasioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Both upon the former trial and upon the present, it appeared that the premises owned by the plaintiff were under lease to the tenant in possession thereof, which lease would not expire until the first day of May, 1856, and that, in addition to the covenant by the tenant for the payment of rent, there was a covenant \u201c also to make all alterations and repairs at his own cost and expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The evidence upon the new trial ordered by the General Term showed, that the two houses referred to were \u201c portions of a row of buildings erected previous to 1820, with partition-walls as at present.\u201d Also that Isaac Lawrence, under whom the defendant Del Vecchio holds, conveyed the lot held by the said defendant in 1889, describing the wall in question as a party-wall, and that the administrator of the said Isaac Lawrence, (under authority for that purpose admitted by the defendants,)conveyed the plaintiff\u2019s lot to him. Although the deeds were objected to, it is on this appeal conceded that their admissibility was in substance decided by the General Term by the opinion above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The evidence was that the defendant Del Vecchio, being lessee of one of the buildings, employed Snyder, his co-defendant, to make alterations, digging down the foundations and lowering the floor, making the cellar also deeper, and in consequence of his doing it, the wall in question settled, and the front and rear walls of the plaintiff\u2019s house were cracked, and that the damage to his building was from $600 to $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">On the trial the defendants offered to prove, each by the other of them, notice to the tenant in possession of the plaintiff\u2019s house, of an intent to make the alterations, and that he assented thereto. The plaintiff\u2019s objection to this evidence was sustained, and we think properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\"><em>First, </em>because this defence, if it was a defence, was not peculiar to either defendant; if good as to either, it was so as to both. But <em>secondly, </em>and quite conclusively, because the assent of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tenant could only affect his right to complain of what was done, and could not prejudice the plaintiff. The tenant had no authority, express or implied, for any such, purpose. He had no right 'to commit waste himself and could not authorize another to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The charge of the Judge appears to us to be in entire conformity to the decision of the General Term, in relation to what constituted a party-wall, and the rights and liabilities resulting from the common interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">It is suggested that the defendant Del Vecchio is not responsible for the acts of Snyder his employee. The cases relating to the liability of a person for the negligence of another, who stands to him in the relation of an independent contractor, and not of servant, have we think no application to the present case. Here one defendant employs and directs the other defendant to commit a trespass. Both are liable for the consequences jointly and severally. The question of negligence was wholly immaterial, or at least it was wholly unnecessary that the plaintiff should prove any negligence. The trespass was committed at the peril of being responsible for all the injury sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The only other question which it is necessary to notice is, whether the rule of damages was correctly stated to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The views of the court at General Term on that point are above stated. The charge to the jury was as follows: \u201cThat, as the plaintiff had leased the premises before the injury complained of, for a term of years which had not yet expired, and was not in possession of the premises, he could not recover for any interruption in or interference with the' use of the premises, nor because the use and enjoyment of them had been rendered less valuable to the lessee or his tenants.\u201d This is not-the subject of exception, it is within the conceded rule that the plaintiff cannot recover for an injury to the possession merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The charge further proceeded, \u201c that he could only recover for damages to the structure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\u201c That the jury would inquire what it would cost to repair the injuries done to the building itself and restore it substantially to the condition it was in before it was injured by the acts complained of: that amount, and no more, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>To this last paragraph the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">They urge that the plaintiff in his complaint does not describe himself as reversioner, and, therefore, cannot under this complaint recover at all. This point was not only sufficiently disposed of on the former argument, but it appears to us to be without foundation. The plaintiff complains that the defendants\u2019 acts injured his house, damaged its walls, etc., etc., and although he avers that he was disturbed in the use and enjoyment thereof, the other averments are sufficient, though the latter is not proved. If it were deemed necessary to insert the prior condition of the plaintiff\u2019s title in this respect, we should not hesitate to direct an amendment conforming the complaint to the fact proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">No other objection to this part of the charge is stated, except that because the tenant had covenanted to make all alterations and repairs, therefore the plaintiff cannot proceed against the wrongdoers. We know of no such rule, and no authority is cited in support of the proposition. There can be but one satisfaction for the same wrong, and to that satisfaction the plaintiff is at all events entitled. It does not lie with the wrong-doer to say, \u201c I will not make compensation to the owner, because he has it in his power to seek redress against another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">If it were conceded that the tenant was, under the covenant above referred to, bound to repair damages of this description, caused by a wrong-doer, and that he might, therefore, have had an action for this same injury, the case would not be widely different from the very common examples in which one who has a special property in a chattel, as bailee, may recover against a wrong-doer for an injury done thereto, and yet no one supposes that the owner himself may not maintain the action. It is enough that there can be but one satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">It has not been claimed that the measure of damages, i. e., the actual cost of repairing the wall, was too enlarged a measure, and probably, on observing that the evidence given is stated in the case to have \u201c proved \u201d that the damage was from $600 to $1500, and that the jury found for the plaintiff only $350, the defendants have no occasion to complain of the rule, in fact, adopted by the jury in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-12\"> Reported 4 Duer, 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
