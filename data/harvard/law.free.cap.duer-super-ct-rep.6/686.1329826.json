In the case of an injunction, if the protection, by the security substituted for an injunction, should become entirely lost, as by the insolvency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>all the obligors, the right to the injunction would be restored; and if it is partially diminished, the question remains open, as it was originally, what will afford the party reasonable indemnity.</p><p id=\"b719-5\">It is a question of judicial discretion, whether to allow a bond given on a claim of personal property, or for an injunction, to remain, where one surety has become insolvent and the remaining surety solvent, or direct that fresh surety be given.
