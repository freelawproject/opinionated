It is not one of the actions specially named in \u00a7 308.</p><p id=\"b690-12\">It is not an action for the recovery of money, within the meaning of those words, as used in \u00a7 308, and sub. 4 of \u00a7 304, of the Code.</p><p id=\"b690-13\">Those words are used in the same sense in both of these sections, and do not include actions in which relief, other than a judgment for money, must be granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>enable a plaintiff to maintain the action, although the ultimate result in view and purpose is to realize money.
