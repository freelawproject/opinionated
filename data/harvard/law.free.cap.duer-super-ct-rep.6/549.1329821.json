That firm dissolved that day, and Evans and Davis formed a new firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>with Dodge, under the name of Davis, Evans and Dodge. Plaintiff gave up the notes of the old firm and took two new notes of $7500 each, dated September 23, 1850, payable \u201c on demand after date,\u201d one of which was signed by Evans, and the other by Dav.is, of the firm of Evans, Davis and Lownd.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b582-5\">Plaintiff signed the partnership agreement of Davis, Evans and Dodge; that stated, that the amonnt of $15,000 due to the plaintiff from the old firm \u201cis to remain in the new concern during the continuance of the copartnership,\u201d he receiving interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum. Under same date, Davis, Evans and Dodge and the plaintiff, signed a paper stating they had received from plaintiff $15,000, \u201c being the amount contributed by him as special partner to the concern of Davis, Evans and Dodge.\u201d Davis, Evans and plaintiff, signed another paper of the same date, stating that they had formed a limited partnership under the name of Davis, Evans and Dodge, the nature of its business, the residence of the partners, that plaintiff is the special partner, and as such has contributed $15,000 in cash, and that Davis, Evans and Dodge, were the general partners. Enough was not done to create a limited partnership. The new firm failed and was dissolved within a year, and before this suit was brought, owing some $30,000 more than it could pay. This suit is brought on the note for $7500 given by Davis to plaintiff when the new firm was formed. On that note, and also on the other note for a like sum, given by Evans, there is indorsed: \u201c This note is given as security to Levi Brown, (the plaintiff,) for one half of the $15,000 advanced to Davis, Evans and Dodge. Egbert Davis.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b582-6\"><em>Held, </em>1. The plaintiff never discharged Davis and Evans from liability for the amount the firm of Davis, Evans and Lownd owed him, but took the note of each for half of that sum.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b582-7\">2. Though that sum was continued, in the assets which represented it, as a loan to the film of Davis, Evans and Dodge, it was not placed, as between themselves, at the risk of its business, h'or lent on an agreement to look solely to the new firm for payment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b582-8\">3.

Permitting such a recovery will not withdraw from the legal or equitable process of the courts any property which should be appropriated to the creditors of the new firm, though held t\u00f3 be composed of Davis, Evans and Dodge, and the plaintiff, as general partners. A judgment by such creditors against the four, and appropriate ulterior proceedings, will reach all the individual property of each, as well as all the effects of the new firm.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b582-11\">(Before Oakley, Ch.

A verdict was ordered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, subject to the opinion of the court, whether the action could be maintained upon the facts which the evidence given established, and the case was directed at the trial to be heard in the first instance at the General Term.

Evans, the defendant Davis, and Charles Lownd, in the business of the manufacture and sale of files, in the city of New York. To this firm the plaintiff had advanced money from time to time by way of loan, so that on the said 23d of September, 1850, they were indebted to him for such advances in the sum of $14,069.38, for which he held their notes. On that day the firm was dissolved by mutual consent, and a new partnership was formed to continue the business, from and after the dissolution, by the defendant, said Evans, and David S. Dodge, under the style of Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge. The agreement of partnership was in writing, bearing date the 23d of September, 1850, and with the receipts and stipulations indorsed thereon, was given in evidence, and is hereto annexed, marked <em>\u201cA.\u201d </em>To this agreement the plaintiff was* also a party, and appended his signature, as thereby appears. And, with the assent of the plaintiff, an advertisement of the formation of the partnership was published by the firm, which is given in evidence, and is hereto annexed, marked \u201c B.\u201d It further appeared that, in pursuance of the articles of agreement, the plaintiff, on the same day, and at the time of their execution, transferred to the new firm the loan he had made to the old one, by executing his receipt (indorsed on the articles) to the old firm for the amount due him, $14,069.38, and taking the receipts of the new firm (also indorsed on the articles) for $15,000. It did not distinctly appear how the difference was made up, but no part of the $15,000 was paid or advanced by the plaintiff, or received by the new firm, in cash or otherwise, than as above stated. The plaintiff was thereupon credited on the books of the new firm with the sum of $15,000 cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>And the plaintiff thereupon received from the defendant the note in suit, and from said Evans another note for the same amount, and of the same tenor at the time of the execution of said articles, both given for the advance of $15,000 made by the plaintiff, as above stated, and for the purpose of securing its repayment. And at the same time gave up the notes which he held against the old firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">It further appeared that the old firm, at the time of its dissolution, though still conducting business, was in reality insolvent. That the new firm failed for a large amount, about one year after-wards, being insolvent, to the extent of $30,000. And that no part of plaintiff\u2019s advance, or the interest thereon, or of either of said notes, had ever been repaid him, except three small items of cash charged him in the books of the firm, amounting to about $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">Upon these facts the Chief-Justice directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount due on the note and interest, subject to the opinion of the court upon the question whether the action could be maintained upon the foregoing facts, and directed the case to be heard in the first instance at the General Term, with leave to either party to turn the case into a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">And the jury accordingly returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $10,740.38, subject to the opinion of the court on the questions reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">EXHIBIT A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">This memorandum of agreements made this twenty-third day of September, 1850, by and between Robert Davis and Francis B.

The consideration of the note in suit, was one-half the loan of $15,000 made by the plaintiff to the defendant and his partners. This sum was advanced in cash to the former firm, and their notes taken therefor, and was transferred to the new firm by agreement, the first notes being taken up, and this note, with another of the same tenor, given in their stead. This fully appears from the case, and is also shown by the indorsement on the note, which is conclusive between the parties as to the consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-12\">H. The contract between the parties did not make the plaintiff a partner, either special or general, in the firm of Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge. He had no interest in the profits or loss. His advance to the firm was a mere loan, to be repaid with legal interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-13\">^ III. The notes given the plaintiff for this loan, by Evans and the defendant, in place of those he held against the old firm, were, therefore, in any view, perfectly valid in their inception, and founded upon a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-14\">PV\". The subsequent advertisement by the parties, under a mistake as to the legal effect of the transaction, that the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>become a special partner, did not invalidate these notes. Whether it operated to make the plaintiff liable to creditors as a general partner, or whether a judgment upon this note would be permitted, in equity, to take precedence of a creditor\u2019s judgment, who had trusted the creditors on the faith of the advertisement, are very different questions. The case shows no such illegal intent as would preclude legal remedies, and, among themselves, the rights \"of the parties must depend upon the real contract between them. Under that contract, the validity of the notes is unquestionable. Certainly the mere publication of a mistaken advertisement, which did no harm so far as appears, and was not intended to do any, could not divest the plaintiff of his right to recover for money previously and honestly loaned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">\"V\". Even if the plaintiff could be regarded as a special partner, he would still be entitled to recover in this action. 1. Because no defence growing out of this fact is set up in the answer. The defence disclosed by the pleadings is entirely different. In no case can a defendant plead one defence, and rely at the trial upon another; and least of all where the defence is technical and without merit. 2. If the facts were properly pleaded, they amount to no defence, as between the parties, whatever might be their effect between the firm and its creditors. A note given by a general to a special partner, for the capital contributed by the latter, might be void as to creditors, or might make the partnership a general one; but, if given in good faith, would be valid between the parties. <em>(Beers </em>v. Reynolds, 12 Barb. 288; affirmed, 1 Kernan, 97.) No principle of law forbids such a contract; nor is it in conflict with any provision of the partnership act. On the contrary, the statute evidently contemplates agreements of this kind, and carefully provides against creditors being prejudiced thereby in the event of insolvency. (Revised Statutes, p. 767, \u00a7 23.) This clause has been held to apply to the claim of the special partner against his insolvent firm for his capital, <em>(Bower </em>v. <em>Ar</em>gall, 24 Wendell, 496.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-6\"><em>A. R. Ryett </em>and <em>L. R. </em>Frederick, <em>for </em>defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXq\">made and argued the following points:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">I. The note, as alleged, was given as security to the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>for one half of $15,000 claimed by him to have been advanced to Davis, Evans <em>&amp; </em>Dodge. The plaintiff proved that this was the consideration of the note. The proof showed that no such money was advanced by Brown to Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge by the plaintiff, but the alleged advance of $15,000 was by receipting a debt due to the plaintiff from another firm, of which the defendant was a member, and taking a receipt from Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge for $15,000; the money, in neither receipt, having been paid or received. The firm of Davis, Evans &amp; Co. were insolvent at the time, and the plaintiff was credited on the books of the new firm with $15,000, whereas he had not advanced any money whatever to them. There was, therefore, no consideration for the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">II. The note was an illegal contract, and against public policy, and its consideration was also illegal. The plaintiff published to the world that he had contributed this $15,000 as capital stock to the firm of Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge, without contributing one cent. And in the partnership articles he stipulated to receive seven per cent, on this fictitious advance or capital, whichever it was\u2014and took this note as security, from Davis, for money never advanced, and which he so published to the world was capital, thus drawing away from the funds of the new firm $1050 a year, instead of aiding them by $15,000 capital. Indeed the new firm instead of having $15,000 capital added by plaintiff was, by the arrangement, $15,000 in debt to the plaintiff, making a difference to the creditors of $30,000, and making the new firm assume a debt to the plaintiff, without any consideration, to the diminution of its actual assets to that extent, instead of an increase of them, $15,000. The firm failed for $30,000, and it was no wonder. This arrangement was a fraud upon the Act, a fraud upon the public, and illegal, (1 R.

The $15,000 was in fact advanced as capital, and at the risk of the business, and the true construction of the indorsement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the note is, that the note is to secure payment to him of his capital, if not lost in the business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">IY. The action is not brought on the old loan to Davis, Evans &amp; Co., nor on the old notes to them, which were given up; whether the old loan or the old notes were paid, or whether an action might be sustained on the old loan or old notes against the old firm is not a question here. The suit is on a note of Davis. If the suit be brought on the old loan or old notes, it cannot be against Davis alone, but against'all the members of the old firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">Y. This note and indorsement was a contract of suretyship. No action would have lain against the firm of Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge, for the recovery of this $15,000, indeed it cannot be pretended such an action could lie.

The judgment should be for the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-8\">By the Court. Oakley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1MG\">This action is brought to recover the amount of a promissory note made by the defendant, dated the 23d of September, 1850, by which he promised to pay on demand, after date, to the order of the plaintiff $7500, value received.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">For two years prior to the date of the note, Evans, Davis and Lownd had been partners. That firm, the name of which was Evans, Davis &amp; Co., owed the plaintiff $14,069.38, for money ad-' vanced to it; that firm dissolved, and the plaintiff surrendered its notes, and took new notes, one of them being the note.in question, and another note, in all respects like it, made by Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Upon these facts alone, the only change of liability is this:\u2014 The plaintiff relinquished the liability of the firm and the notes made by it, and took for the same claim the individual- notes of two members of that firm, viz.: the note of each for half of the amount of the whole claim. Before these \u2019notes were given, Davis, as one of the firm of Evans, Davis &amp; Co., was liable for the whole debt. That liability has been converted, as to him, into his individual liability for $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Ip there any thing in the other facts of the case 'which impairs this liability ?</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">On the date of this note, Davis &amp; Evans, as parties of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>part, entered into a written agreement with David S. Dodge, as party of the second part, to form a partnership between themselves, under the name of Davis, Evans &amp; Dodge, to continue for the term of ten years. The agreement thus signed, makes them the only parties constituting the firm, and the only persons who were to participate in its profits. The plaintiff, instead of compelling the old firm to pay the money he had lent it, and thus diminish its assets accordingly, agreed to continue the loan, treating it as one made to the new firm, and he was made a creditor of the new firm on its books, to a corresponding amount, Brown agreed that this sum might remain in the new firm \u201c during the continuance of the said copartnership,\u201d \u201c he receiving interest for the same at the rate of seven per cent, per annum.\u201d The new firm failed within a year after it was formed, and thenceforth ceased to exist, and has paid no part of the principal nor any interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Dodge was to contribute, as capital, $20,000, in three instalments. The theory of the agreement seems to be, that this sum was treated as equivalent to a third interest in the business as it stood, because, without declaring in terms of what the capital of Evans &amp; Davis should\u2022 consist, it declares that \u201cit is understood that any difference in the amount of capital furnished by either shall be adjusted by interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">There is no agreement on the part of Brown to look exclusively to the new firm, as his debtor for the $15,000. He continued the liability of Dax is &amp; Evans, by taking the note of each for $7500. That liability he now seeks to enforce. The indorsement on the back of the note, in connection with the written papers signed by the plaintiff, might be a defence to a suit on the note, if the firm of Evans, Davis &amp; Dodge was continuing. But that firm ceased to exist long before this suit was brought, and was owing some $30,000 more than it could pay. Brown now seeks to collect his note. Looking at its terms only, it is due; looking at the agreement, as to the time the new firm should have the $15,000, and the fact that such firm has ceased to exist, it is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">A party is never bound to prosecute the principal debtor, as a condition precedent to his right to sue the surety, unless such suit is required by the terms of his contract, or necessarily implied from the terms used. <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>17 Wend. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">It is quite clear, at all events, as between the plaintiff and de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>fendant, that this $15,000 was not to be at the risk of the success of the new firm. By the terms of the partnership agreement, to'\" which the plaintiff assented by signing it, the $15,000 \u201c was to remain in the new concern during- the continuance of the partnership,\u201d and the defendant gave this note to secure to the plaintiff actual payment of one half of that sum. If he put it at risk, as between himself and the firm, he did so only on the terms of having the note of the defendant for half of the amount, and of Evans for the other half. The plaintiff was to have only interest and no profits. The three members of the firm were to have all the profits, and consequently were to bear all the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We think the note is upheld by sufficient consideration, and was due when the action was brought. There is no suggestion that it was not due, if the claim as between the plaintiff and the firm was due. The claim of the plaintiff against the firm was due when the firm ceased to exist as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">But it is alleged that the note was an illegal contract, and against public policy, and, therefore, no recovery upon it should be permitted. We do not think the facts proved justify the conclusion of any actual fraudulent intent, on the part of the plaintiff. He had, in fact, advanced to the old firm about $15,000. It was represented by enough of the assets of the new firm to pay it. It was to be continued in the new firm. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that either he or Mr. Dodge supposed there was any ground to doubt the success of the new firm. There is none to suppose that Evans &amp; Davis did, unless it is to be inferred from the fact that the firm failed within a year after it was formed, and that an actual subsequent investigation disclosed that the old firm was insolvent at the time the new one was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Brown was probably gratified with the idea of being advertised. as a special partner, who had put in $15,000 cash; but there is nothing to j ustify the idea, that it was any part of his purpose to contribute to a credit, with the expectation or belief that it would be the cause of loss to those who might deal with the new firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Giving effect to the contract of the parties, as between themselves, will not necessarily tend, -of itself, to produce a fraud on the public. It will neither diminish the means which they otherwise might reach, nor impair the remedies to which they otherwise might resort, to collect their demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>All that was done and advertised did not create a limited partnership, under the statute. Brown may be liable, as a general partner, to all who have dealt with the firm. (1 R. S. 765, \u00a7 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">But holding Evans &amp; Davis individually liable upon their notes to the plaintiff, will not withdraw from the legal or equitable process of the courts any property that could be reached by a judgment against the general partners, so called, and subsequent proceedings founded upon it. A judgment against the firm, and appropriate ulterior proceedings, will reach all the individual property of each, as well as all the effects of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This case is unlike an action by one of several creditors, upon a note given to him by a debtor, for an amount beyond his proportion of the amount which each creditor of such debtor had agreed to take, of his claim or demand, and discharges the debtor, in cases where the composition agreement is made upon the representation that all have agreed to come in on equal terms. To allow a recovery in such a case, would operate as a fraud on those who released their own claims for a stipulated percentage on the faith that the creditor, who secretly stipulated for payment of the whole of his claim, had also released his claim on receiving the like percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">If the assets of the firm, and the individual property of each, are sufficient to satisfy the creditors of the firm, they will obtain payment. If insufficient, several judgments in favor of one of the firm against two of its members will not diminish their means or chances of obtaining payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">If the fact had been found by the jury, upon sufficient evidence, or if we ought to hold, as a matter of law, upon the facts found, that it was the design of the parties, by this arrangement, to defraud the public, the court might very properly refuse to enforce any claim of either against the other, founded on such an arrangement. But the plaintiff wras not to have, in any event, more than a debt justly his due, and which, for aught that appears, the partners in the old firm were able to pay. This debt, and interest upon it, were all the advantages for which he stipulated. He had no motive, and there is nothing to justify the belief, that he was a party to an actual intent to defraud the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The certificate published contains false statements, and as a necessary consequence, the plaintiff may be liable for engagements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the firm, and yet he may not have contemplated, and probably did not contemplate, such a contingency, as that the firm should be without means sufficient to pay its debts, as at all likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We think the plaintiff should have judgment on the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
