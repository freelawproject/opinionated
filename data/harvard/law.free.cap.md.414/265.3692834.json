We hold that the sanction was outside the scope of the Board\u2019s authority. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand the case to that court with directions to reverse the Board\u2019s imposition of that sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Appellant, Thanner Enterprises, LLC, holds a Class D alcoholic beverages license for the benefit of its establishment, a bar and restaurant named Dock of the Bay, which is located in Baltimore County, Maryland. Appellant provided live and recorded music and other entertainment to its patrons at the establishment. Some of that entertainment took place outside of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">In July 2007, four people who lived in the neighborhood of Dock of the Bay lodged complaints with the Board, asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that on July 1, 2007, outside music at Dock of the Bay was unduly loud. Based on these complaints, the Board sent Appellant a Notice of a Show Cause Hearing alleging violations of Article 2B, \u00a7 10-401 of the Maryland Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and several Liquor Board Rules and Regulations (the \u201cBoard Rules\u201d). <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-401 &amp; 10-403 (dictating the process by which a liquor license board may revoke or suspend a license).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Specifically, the notice alleged that Appellant violated the following Board Rules: Rule 2, entitled \u201cProhibited Practices,\u201d which prohibits a licensee from violating any laws or from committing actions that are contrary to the \u201cpublic peace, safety, health, welfare, quiet, or morals\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 3, entitled, \u201cNoise and Music,\u201d which regulates \u201cmechanical music boxes, live music and sound-making devices\u201d and precludes a licensee from \u201cdisturbing the peace, tranquility, safety, health, and quiet of the neighborhood\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Rule 16, entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cCooperation,\u201d which requires that a licensee cooperate with certain government officials conducting official business at the licensee\u2019s establishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The Board held the Show Cause Hearing on August 6, 2007. At the hearing, several of the neighbors who initiated the complaint testified, alleging that on July 1, 2007, the outside music was unduly loud between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. The Board also heard testimony from a neighbor in the area who, contrary to the complaints, asserted that the music on that day was not too loud. In addition, several Dock of the Bay employees testified that on the date in question they received a complaint about the music and, in response, turned the music down. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board sustained the violations set forth in the hearing notice, finding that Appellant had violated \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 and 10-403 and Rules 2, 3, and 16. Consequently, the Board imposed a $1,000 fine on Appellant and indefinitely prohibited Appellant from playing outdoor music.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Appellant sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Appellant contested the Board\u2019s authority to impose a sanction prohibiting Appellant from playing outdoor music but did not contest the $1,000 fine. The Circuit Court held oral arguments on April 22, 2008. On May 7, 2008, the Circuit Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order affirming the Board\u2019s decision. The Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cuit Court determined that the Board \u201cacted within the scope of its express statutory authority in prohibiting [Appellant] from playing outside music at their licensed establishment.\u201d The court reasoned that the Board\u2019s express authority was derived from \u00a7 9-201(a)(2), which provides that, \u201cby regulation,\u201d a local liquor board may \u201c[r]egulate and limit the use of mechanical music boxes and other sound-making devices.\u201d Further, the court reviewed the record of the Board\u2019s hearing and determined that the Board\u2019s findings that Appellant had violated Rules 2 and 3 were supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">On May 28, 2008, Appellant appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration by that court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion and ordered that the case be docketed for consideration. <em>Thanner Enterprises, LLC v. Baltimore County, </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 793 (2008). Appellant presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">Whether the Board of Liquor License Commissioners exceeded its authority by prohibiting the Appellant from having outside music at the licensed premises?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">Whether the Board of Liquor License Commissioners\u2019 decision was arbitrary and unreasonable?[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The lawfulness of the Board\u2019s prohibition of outside music at Appellant\u2019s establishment turns on whether the General Assembly has granted the Board the authority to impose such a sanction. Appellant, relying on a trilogy of cases, <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners v. Hollywood Productions, Inc., </em>344 Md. 2, 684 A.2d 837 (1996), <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners, v. Fells Point Caf\u00e9, Inc., </em>344 Md. 120, 685 A.2d 772, (1996), and <em>Board of Liquor License Commissioners v. J.R. Brothers, Inc., </em>119 Md.App. 308, 705 A.2d 16 (1998), submits that liquor boards may only impose sanctions that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>either expressly or impliedly authorized by Article 2B, or to which a licensee has consented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant contends that no provision of Article 2B expressly or impliedly authorizes the sanction imposed by the Board. Consequently, Appellant maintains, the sanction is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Appellee does not dispute that the liquor boards are restricted to the powers the General Assembly set forth in Article 2B. Appellee submits, however, that \u00a7 9-201(a)(2) grants the Board the express authority to prohibit Appellant from playing outdoor music. Appellee maintains that, because \u00a7 9-201(a)(2) grants liquor boards the power to \u201c[r]egulate and limit the use of mechanical music boxes and other sound-making devices,\u201d the Board may limit licensees\u2019 use of such devices as it \u201cdeem[s] appropriate.\u201d Appellee points out that, pursuant to that provision, the Board promulgated Rule 3 of its Rules and Regulations, which \u201cexpressly prohibit[s] licensed establishments from disturbing the peace.\u201d Appellee contends that the sanction was authorized pursuant to the Board\u2019s authority to determine that Appellant had \u201cdisturbed the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood\u201d and therefore violated Rule 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The scope of our review of a local liquor licensing board\u2019s decision is limited under \u00a7 16\u2014101(e)(l)(i), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">Upon the hearing of such appeal, the action of the local licensing board shall be presumed by the court to be proper and to best serve the public interest. <em>The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner </em>to show that the decision complained of was against the public interest and that the local licensing board\u2019s discretion in rendering its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>was not honestly and fairly exercised, or that such decision was arbitrary, or procured by fraud, or unsupported by any substantial evidence, or was unreasonable, or <em>that such decision was beyond the powers of the local licensing board, and was illegal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Appellant challenges the Board\u2019s decision on the ground that the decision went \u201cbeyond the powers of the local licensing board, and was illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When we review the decision of an administrative agency, such as the Board, \u201cwe look \u2018through the circuit court\u2019s ... decision! ], although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate! ] the decision of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Loyola College, </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166, 173 (2008) (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The scope of the Board\u2019s authority under Article 2B is a question of statutory interpretation and, thus, a question of law. In <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), we clarified a court\u2019s role when reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s conclusions of law. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">[A] court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency!.] Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. ... Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 571, 873 A.2d at 1154-55 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). <em>Accord Crofton Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>413 Md. 201, 215, 991 A.2d 1257, 1265, 2010 Md. Lexis 112, at *19-20 (2010) (\u201c[E]ven when reviewing an agency\u2019s legal conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sions, an appellate court must respect the agency\u2019s expertise in its field.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Nevertheless, \u201cwhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572 n. 2, 873 A.2d at 1155 n. 2 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cDeference to the interpretation of the agency, however, does not mean acquiescence or abdication of our construction responsibility. Despite the deference, \u2018it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 121, 896 A.2d 320, 331 (2006) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005)). For reasons we shall explain, we agree with Appellant that the sanction the Board imposed on Appellant exceeded the scope of the Board\u2019s express and implied authority, as delegated by the General Assembly, and therefore constituted an illegal act \u201cbeyond the powers of [a] local licensing board.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-101(e)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">An agency\u2019s authority extends only as far as the General Assembly prescribes. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 701, 684 A.2d 804, 814 (1996) (\u201cAn administrative agency, as a creature of statute, has only the power its enabling statute delegates to it.\u201d) (Bell, J., dissenting); <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 10, 684 A.2d at 841 (\u201c[R]egardless of any rule making authority that the Liquor Board may enjoy, it may not impose a sanction that exceeds the confines of its expressly or impliedly delegated powers.\u201d). When the General Assembly has vested an agency, such as a liquor board, with the authority to impose sanctions, those sanctions must be expressly or impliedly authorized. <em>See Lussier, </em>343 Md. at 685-87, 684 A.2d at 805-07 (rejecting the argument that \u201cadministrative agencies lack the authority to fix penalties in the absence of specific statutory authorization from the Legislature\u201d and concluding that agency-imposed sanctions are valid if consistent with the agency\u2019s implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>authority (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Of course, whether an agency is expressly authorized to impose a particular sanction is a matter of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u201c[T]he interpretation of an agency rule is governed by the same principles that govern the interpretation of a Statute.\u201d <em>Miller v. Comptroller, </em>398 Md. 272, 282, 920 A.2d 467, 473 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Our primary objective \u201cis to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 576, 870 A.2d at 193. The most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the statute\u2019s plain language as ordinarily understood. <em>Id., </em>870 A.2d at 193. \u201cIf statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 870 A.2d at 193. Section 16-507(e) prescribes, \u201cwith particularity,\u201d the sanctions that the Board may impose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">In Baltimore County, the Board <em>of </em>License Commissioners, after a public hearing and on finding a violation, may impose a fine not exceeding $2,000, and/or may suspend or revoke a license, for any violation that is cause for suspension or revocation under the alcoholic beverages laws and rules and regulations affecting Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00a7 16-507(e); <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 15, 684 A.2d at 844 (\u201cIn general, there appear to be three sanctions to which the General Assembly intends the liquor boards to resort in the appropriate circumstance: monetary fines, license suspension, and license revocation.\u201d). The prohibition of outdoor music does not constitute a fine or the revocation or suspension of a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Appellee argues, however, that \u00a7 9-201(a)(2) expressly authorizes the Board to \u201climit licensees from playing music and other sound-making devices.\u201d As previously mentioned, \u00a7 9-201 grants liquor boards the power to promulgate regulations that \u201c[r]egulate and limit the use of mechanical music boxes and other sound-making devices.\u201d \u00a7 9-201 (a)(2). This provision is an enabling law that permits local liquor boards to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>establish rules and regulations governing, among other things, the playing of music and the use of sound-making devices. Appellee correctly argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 9-201, the Board was expressly authorized to promulgate Rule 3 of its Rules and Regulations, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">All holders of Alcoholic Beverage Licenses in Baltimore County shall cease the playing of mechanical music boxes, five music and sound-making devices at 11:00 p.m. every day unless such licensed establishments are sufficiently enclosed or located in an area where the sound will not disturb the peace of nearby residents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Appellee contends that, because the Board was authorized to promulgate Rule 3 and to determine that Appellant had violated that rule, the indefinite prohibition of outdoor music was expressly authorized. This argument rests on a flawed interpretation of \u00a7 9-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">An agency\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations restricting certain conduct does not necessarily grant that agency the authority to impose any conceivable sanction for violations of those regulations. <em>See Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 10, 684 A.2d at 841 (\u201c[R]egardless of any rule making authority that the Liquor Board might enjoy, it may not impose a sanction that exceeds the confines of its expressly or impliedly delegated powers.\u201d). By its language, \u00a7 9-201 authorizes local liquor boards, <em>by regulation, </em>to restrict and limit music playing. Nowhere in \u00a7 9-201 does the General Assembly expressly authorize local liquor boards to issue sanctions that restrict and limit music playing.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that \u00a7\u00a7 9-201 and 16-507(e) apply to the same situation, the more specific provision controls. <em>See Suter v. Stuckey, </em>402 Md. 211, 231, 935 A.2d 731, 743 (2007) (\u201cIn the case where two statutes apply to the same situation, we first attempt to reconcile them, and then, if the statutes remain contradictory, the more specific statute controls.\u201d). In this case, \u00a7 16-507(e) is the more specific provision. Section 16-507(e) explicitly lists three sanctions and leaves no room for an inference that other sanctions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>available. Furthermore, under this interpretation, the two provisions are easily reconciled. Section 9-201 authorizes the Board to promulgate regulations restricting and limiting the use of music boxes and other sound-making devices, and \u00a7 16-507(e) sets forth the sanctions that the Board may impose when a licensee violates those regulations. Accordingly, we hold that the Board was not expressly authorized to impose a sanction that indefinitely prohibits Appellant to play outdoor music at its establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">We turn now to whether the Board is impliedly authorized to impose sanctions that prohibit licensees to play music. The scope of an agency\u2019s implied powers \u201cturns on the General Assembly\u2019s intent in empowering the agency and the statutory scheme under which the agency acts.\u201d <em>Hollywood Prods., 344 </em>Md. at 11, <em>684 </em>A.2d at <em>842. </em>When the General Assembly has bestowed upon an agency a broad delegation of power, we liberally construe the scope of that agency\u2019s implied powers. <em>Id., </em>684 A.2d at 842; <em>see also Christ v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., 335 </em>Md. 427, 439, 644 A.2d 34, 39 (1994) (\u201cIn any particular area of legislative concern, whether there should be a broad general delegation of regulatory authority to administrators, or a more specific delegation, is a choice for the General Assembly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">When considering the implied powers of local liquor boards, this Court has consistently held, based on a survey of the Article 2B statutory scheme, that the General Assembly intended to grant the boards specific delegated powers, rather than broad delegated authority. <em>See, e.g., Fells Point Caf\u00e9, Inc., 344 </em>Md. at 137, 685 A.2d at 780; <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 12-13, 684 A.2d at 842-43 (\u201cIn the field of regulatory law, more attention has perhaps been given by legislatures to the control and management of the liquor business than of any other traffic[.]\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Coalition for Open Doors v. Annapolis Lodge No. 622, Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, </em>333 Md. 359, 373, 635 A.2d 412, 418 (1994). \u201c[T]he General Assembly has chosen to closely control by statute even the more detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>aspects of the alcoholic beverages industry.\u201d <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 13, 684 A.2d at 842-43; <em>see also Annapolis Lodge No. 622, </em>333 Md. at 371-72, 635 A.2d at 418 (observing that Article 2B covers a \u201cmyriad of subjects,\u201d including <em>inter alia </em>the \u201ctypes of places which may be licensed, the types of beverages which may be sold, the hours of sale, the license fees,\u201d and conditions in licensee establishments, \u201cthe conduct of licensees, ownership of establishments, membership requirements for association or club licensees\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Because the General Assembly enacted such a comprehensive statutory scheme, \u201cthe authority of the administering agencies necessarily is more circumscribed than the typical administrative body\u201d; the local liquor boards\u2019 authority to impose sanctions is no exception to this rule. <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 13, 684 A.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In <em>Hollywood Productions, </em>we considered a sanction imposed by the Baltimore City Board of Liquor Commissioners that restricted the hours during which a licensee could operate its nightclub. 344 Md. at 6, 684 A.2d at 839. We concluded that, because the General Assembly had expressly granted some local liquor boards the power to change the hours of sale, but had not granted the Baltimore City Board the same authority, that Board did not have the power to modify a licensee\u2019s hours of operation. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 684 A.2d at 844. We further concluded that, because Article 2B explicitly sets forth the sanctions available to local liquor boards and prescribes individually the maximum fine that each local board may impose, the General Assembly did not intend to authorize the local liquor boards to impose sanctions \u201cfashioned on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>684 A.2d at 844. (\u201cSuch an elaborate statutory scheme suggests a specific, rather than broad, delegation of authority to the liquor boards and contradicts the notion that restrictions, penalties, and sanctions may be fashioned on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Fells Point </em>when we considered whether the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City properly could impose on a license, as a sanction, restrictions that prohibited live entertainment, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>D.J., dancing, and exotic entertainment. 344 Md. at 135, 685 A.2d at 779. We held that the only sanctions available to local liquor boards \u201cto punish licensee misconduct\u201d are the three set forth in Article 2B: monetary fines, license suspension, and license revocation. <em>See id. </em>at 136-37, 685 A.2d at 780 (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly did not intend the Board to have the power to place restrictions on a license as an enforcement mechanism, because it did not so state in Article 2B\u201d). In other words, the specificity with which the legislature prescribed in Article 2B the powers of the local liquor boards, including the sanctions that they may impose, precludes any reasonable inference that the General Assembly impliedly granted the local liquor boards the power to impose sanctions other than those that appear expressly in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">As to Appellee\u2019s contention that the Board derives from the rule-making authority conferred by \u00a7 9-201 the power to impose sanctions that prohibit licensees to play music, that power is no more impliedly conferred than it is expressly granted by that section. It would be disingenuous to infer from \u00a7 9-201 that the General Assembly intended to grant the Board the power to impose the sanction at issue despite that \u201cArticle 2B precisely establishes the sanctions available to a liquor board in responding to a licensee\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Hollywood Prods., </em>344 Md. at 16, 684 A.2d at 844. To be clear, the specificity and detailed nature of the provisions of Article 2B foreclose the possibility that the General Assembly impliedly authorized the local liquor boards to impose sanctions other than those clearly delineated in Article 2B: monetary fines, license revocation, and license suspension. Because the sanction at issue in this case, the indefinite prohibition of outdoor music, is none of these, we hold that the Board exceeded the scope of its authority.
