Specifically, Petitioner Della Ratta argues that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County\u2019s orders dissolving his partnership and LLC are invalid because the original petition for dissolution was filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a tribunal that lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the issue. We hold that the statutes limit subject matter jurisdiction for ordering dissolution to the particular county where the principal office is located. Nevertheless, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County had jurisdiction over the other counts in the complaint filed by Respondent Dyas, and jurisdictional problems with the claim for dissolution were avoided when the case was transferred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the Circuit Court for Montgomery County before entry of judgment on the dissolution and winding up claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Della Ratta also appeals the trial court\u2019s decision to dissociate him from his partnership with Dyas, its exclusion of an accounting exhibit during the winding up phase of the action, and its finding that the parties entered into a fixed price contract for the construction of a hotel. The Court of Special Appeals (\u201cCSA\u201d) held that sufficient evidence existed to support the trial court\u2019s conclusions, and affirmed the judgment of the lower court. We agree, and therefore affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">This dispute follows the disintegration of a twenty-year business relationship between Joseph M. Della Ratta and Edward J. Dyas. Dyas alleges that Della Ratta swindled him throughout the course of their collaboration to build three Ocean City resorts: the Best Western Sea Bay Inn, completed in 1988 (\u201cSea Bay\u201d); the Maresol Condominiums, in 2004 (\u201cMaresol\u201d); and the Best Western Hotel and Suites, finished in 2006 (\u201cthe New Hotel\u201d). Dyas further alleges that in 2004, Della Ratta attempted to \u201cwrongfully squeeze out\u201d Dyas from the partnership by maliciously calling in Dyas\u2019 indebtedness to the entities that the two developers formed for the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Dyas and Della Ratta formed both a partnership\u2014Spa Motel General Partnership<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cSpa GP\u201d)\u2014in 1987 and a limited liability company\u2014Bay View Condominiums, LLC (\u201cBay View\u201d)\u2014-in 2002. The two men utilized the partnership for the construction of both Sea Bay and the New Hotel, while opting for the LLC when commencing Maresol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Marked differences between the accounting practices of both men contributed to the downfall of their partnership. Dyas always created a new LLC for each of his projects in order to protect himself from liability if the job went bad. Also, Dyas preferred bank financing as much as that was possible. Della Ratta, on the other hand, had a more \u201cloose\u201d accounting practice whereby \u201che freely transferred money back and forth between [his own two corporate entities] to meet construction costs, overrun, et cetera.\u201d One of his corporate entities, a construction company called Della Ratta, Inc. (\u201cDRI\u201d), provided construction for all three projects. Moreover, the two hotels were managed by Commercial Management Company (\u201cCMC\u201d), also solely owned by Della Ratta. When Sea Bay\u2019s opening was delayed because it could not acquire financing for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, Della Ratta provided a loan from CMC to cover the leasing of those items. The terms of that loan were very favorable to CMC, and Dyas cites this as the first in a series of instances in which Della Ratta (in favoring his own interests) systematically fleeced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Later, in the Maresol project, Dyas and Della Ratta could not agree as to how to spend Bay View\u2019s newly acquired revenue following the sale of forty condominiums. Dyas disagreed with Della Ratta\u2019s desire to use the money to pay off a bank loan because the loan was not yet in default. Dyas alleges that Della Ratta then deceptively and unilaterally disposed of Bay View\u2019s funds to repay the loan and then attempted to force Dyas out of the partnership by seeking an assignment of the loan documents in order to foreclose on Dyas.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The last straw for Dyas came during the construction of the New Hotel in December 2004, when Della Ratta issued three \u201ccapital call letters\u201d to Dyas, demanding repayment of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>associated with Sea Bay and the New Hotel, as well as other cash advances purportedly made by Della Ratta. On January, 10, 2005, Dyas filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking a temporary restraining order invalidating Della Ratta\u2019s three capital call letters. On February 9, 2005, Dyas amended his complaint, requesting judicially supervised dissolution of Spa GP.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On November 3, 2005, Della Ratta moved to transfer the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, arguing that Section 9A-803(a) of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conferred exclusive jurisdiction over the dissolution action on Montgomery County because Spa GP\u2019s principal office was located in that county. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 9A-803(a) of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cCA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dyas responded by filing a third amended complaint, in which he requested judicial dissolution of Bay View under CA Section 4A-903. Della Ratta also challenged the court\u2019s ability to hear this dissolution matter, articulating the same subject matter jurisdiction argument he presented in defense against the dissolution of Spa GP.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Despite Della Ratta\u2019s protests, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County held a ten-day trial on the merits. After a bench trial, Judge Caroom ruled in favor of Dyas, enjoining Della Ratta\u2019s capital calls and appointing an auditor to inspect the accounts of Dyas and Della Ratta with respect to Spa GP and Bay View. The judge determined that Della Ratta\u2019s conduct prevented the partnership from continuing in a reasonably practicable manner, and therefore ordered Della Rat-ta dissociated from Spa GP pursuant to CA Section 9A-601(5)(iii), but reserved the actual order for dissolution of Spa GP and Bay View LLC pending the transfer of the case to Montgomery County. On June 23, 2006, Chief Judge Bell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>pursuant to Article IV, Section 18 of the Constitution of Maryland,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> specially designated Judge Caroom to sit as a Judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in this case and thereafter to render a verdict. Sitting in that capacity, Judge Caroom officially ordered the dissolution of Spa GP and Bay View and instructed Della Ratta to return over three million dollars to Bay View before the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Following the trial on the merits, the dispute crossed into its accounting phase, during which the auditor prepared a statement of the accounts of both entities. During this phase, on April 17, 2007, the trial court held a hearing on all open motions. At the hearing, Della Ratta sought to introduce into evidence Defendant\u2019s Exhibit L26, which comprised twelve checks made payable to Spa GP and signed by Della Ratta. The trial court declined to reopen the evidence for the admission of L26, finding that Della Ratta\u2019s accounting practices rendered \u201cthe records [ ] woefully incomplete, inaccurate and unreliable.\u201d After two interim accounts and distributions, the auditor submitted his final report, which was approved by final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Della Ratta appealed the trial court\u2019s final judgment, and, in <em>Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>183 Md.App. 344, 961 A.2d 629 (2008), the CSA affirmed. Della Ratta then filed a timely petition for \u2022writ of certiorari to this Court, and we granted his petition to consider the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">I. Did the Trial Court have the subject matter jurisdiction to dissolve Bay View and judicially supervise the winding up of Spa GP?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">II. Did the Trial Court err in dissociating Della Ratta as a general partner of Spa GP based on his conduct in Bay View?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>III. Did the Trial Court err in refusing to allow Della Ratta the opportunity to introduce proffered exhibit L26 into the record before the court appointed auditor during the accounting phase of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">IV. Did the lower courts err when they found that the parties formed an enforceable agreement to construct the Maresol Condominiums on a firm, fixed price basis?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A8e4\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(c), where, as here, an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. We will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 8-131(c). \u201cThe appellate court must consider evidence produced at the trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party....\u201d <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834, 835 (1975). \u201cIf there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109, 1123 (2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, are not entitled to the deference of the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 554, 954 A.2d 1092, 1099 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">\n<em>A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction vs. Venus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcS\">Della Ratta argues that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County did not have the subject matter jurisdiction to dissolve Bay View and to supervise the winding up of Spa GP. Specifically, Della Ratta focuses on language found in three sections of the Corporations and Associations Article describing the appropriate arbiter for such matters, i.e., \u201cthe circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the partnership is located[.]\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argues that Dyas\u2019s claims for dissolution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>wind up of both Spa GP and Bay View were inappropriately submitted to and heard by the wrong court because Montgomery County is, indisputably, the location of the principal place of business for both entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>1. Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005). \u201cThe first step in determining legislative intent is to look at the statutory language and if the words of the statute, construed according to their common and every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>day meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). If, however, the statute is ambiguous, the court may supplement its analysis by turning to legislative materials, such as \u201crelated statutes, pertinent legislative history and other material that fairly bears on the ... fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 874 A.2d at 446 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Throughout this process, this Court \u201cmust always be cognizant of the fundamental principle that statutory construction is approached from a \u2018commonsensical\u2019 perspective. Thus, we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\n<em>2. Dissolution and Wind Up of Spa GP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Della Ratta concedes that any court can order the dissolution of a partnership. CA Section 9A-801 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">A partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of the following events: ... (5) On application by a partner, <em>a judicial determination </em>that: ... [it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of the partnership].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">(emphasis added). Here, there is no question that the General Assembly did not restrict which court could make the \u201cjudicial determination\u201d of whether dissolution of a partnership is appropriate and render an order accordingly. Thus, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County possessed the subject matter jurisdiction to hear the dissolution count for Spa GP and would have been able to issue the final order of dissolution rather than transfer the matter to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Della Ratta instead challenges the validity of the order for the wind up of Spa GP on grounds that the application requesting wind up was made in the Circuit Court for Anne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Arundel County when it should have been made in Montgomery County. There is no dispute that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County supervised the wind up of Spa GP, but Della Ratta asserts that the language of CA Section 9A-803 (\u201con application of any partner, ... the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of the partnership is located ... may order judicial supervision of the winding up\u201d) required Dyas to <em>file </em>his application for wind up in Montgomery County. Judge Rodowsky, writing for the CSA, rejected this argument, stating that the use of \u201capplication\u201d in the statute was meant to refer to the class of persons who can request judicial supervision of the winding up process, rather than to limit the filing of an application to a specific court. <em>Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>183 Md.App. 344, 363, 961 A.2d 629, 640 (2008). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The statute permits an order for judicial supervision of winding up of a partnership \u201con application <em>of </em>any partner, partner\u2019s legal representative, or transferee.... \u201d CA \u00a7 9A-803 (emphasis added). The General Assembly could have, but did not, describe the petition for judicial supervision as an \u201capplication <em>to </em>the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of the partnership is located.\u201d Instead, the General Assembly coupled the word \u201capplication\u201d with \u201cof a partner, [etc.],\u201d indicating its intention to regulate who would have standing to make such an application, not the place where persons with standing could file such an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The CSA also rejected Della Ratta\u2019s challenge to the order for wind up of Spa GP on the grounds that requiring severance of Dyas\u2019s dissolution actions from his other twelve claims would not be a commonsense application of the statute. <em>Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 364, 961 A.2d at 641. It noted that actions for involuntary dissolution are often linked to claims of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and possibly fraud. <em>Id. </em>As Dyas did not seek dissolution of Spa GP until after he had filed his other claims in Anne Arundel County, Della Ratta\u2019s theory would require Dyas to file a separate claim for dissolution in Montgomery County rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>than attaching the count onto his third amended complaint in Anne Arundel County. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 961 A.2d at 640 (\u201cOrdinarily, Dyas would have been entitled to a stay of the dissolution action, pending resolution of his claims in Anne Arundel County.\u201d). If Dyas had been successful on his other claims (as he was here), collateral estoppel would lead to an order of dissolution in Montgomery County. \u201cBy trying the issues in Anne Arundel County, and transferring the entire action to Montgomery County prior to the order of dissolution, Dyas has achieved the same result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 961 A.2d at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Again, we agree with the CSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>3. Dissolution and Wind Up of Bay View, LLC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">To contest both the dissolution and the winding up of Bay View,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Della Ratta focuses on the General Assembly\u2019s authorization of \u201cthe circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the limited liability company is located\u201d both to decree the dissolution of an LLC (under CA Section 4A-903) and to wind up the affairs of the LLC (under CA Section 4A-904(b)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Della Ratta claims that the statute is unambiguous and requires any adjudication of dissolution to be in the county described. The CSA disagreed, reasoning that the statute was ambiguous because it was unclear as to whether the language restricted jurisdiction to a specific county or simply indicated a non-binding preference for a particular county. We disagree with the CSA, however, because, in our view, such a holding contravenes the statutory interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>canon that a court should read a statute \u201cas a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplus-age, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 275, 983 A.2d 138, 153 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Reading the language as a mere preference for a particular county would render it surplusage because, pursuant to the \u201ccarries on a regular business\u201d clause in the Maryland\u2019s general venue statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> venue would exist in the county where the principal office is located regardless of the existence of the \u201cprincipal office\u201d provision. Furthermore, such a reading would render the provision nugatory because a plaintiff could ignore the preference and bring a dissolution action in any county permitted by the general venue statute. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 6-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Accordingly, because this Court should not read any portion of the statute as ineffectual, we do not interpret Section 4A-903 as signaling simply a \u201clegislative preference.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the statute confers exclusive subject matter jurisdiction for ordering dissolution of an LLC on the county where the principal office of the LLC is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Even if this Court were to agree with the CSA that Section 4A-903 is ambiguous, we would still interpret the statute as we did above because of its legislative and statutory history. Again, we disagree with the CSA on this point. The CSA explored the legislative history of the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (\u201cMLLCA\u201d) (CA Title \u20194A), the Maryland Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cMUPA\u201d) (CA Title 9), the Maryland Revised Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cMRUPA\u201d) (CA Title 9A), and the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Act (\u201cMRULPA\u201d) (CA Title 10). According to a special Joint Committee of the Sections of Taxation and Business Law of the Maryland State Bar Association (\u201cthe Committee\u201d), which drafted the legislative bill that became the MLLCA, CA Section 4A-903 was derived from MRULPA\u2019s Section 10-802, and it was \u201cintended that all circumstances which justify judicial dissolution under [MRULPA] will justify judicial dissolution of a limited liability company.\u201d <em>Draft of Third Report of the Special Joint Committee on the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act </em>84 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Both CA Sections 4A-903 and 10-802<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> contain the \u201cprincipal office\u201d provision, and the CSA relied on the Committee\u2019s statement in holding that the MLLCA dissolution section contained the provision simply because it was in the MRULPA. <em>See Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 360, 961 A.2d at 638-39. The comment to CA Section 10-802 (found in Chapter 801 of the Acts of 1981) explains that the Section is derived from CA Section 9-603(a)(4) of MUPA and \u201cis not intended to modify existing law.\u201d 1981 <em>Md. Laws </em>3047. Section 9-603(a)(4) does not contain the \u201cprincipal office\u201d provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, the CSA reasoned, the language in Section 4A-903 does not limit subject matter jurisdiction because its statutory genesis did not restrict which courts could order the dissolution of a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>We agree with Della Ratta\u2019s challenge to the CSA\u2019s reliance on the Committee\u2019s stated intention not to modify the law as it existed before the adoption of CA Section 10-802. Relying on the Third Report of the Special Joint Committee on the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (June 1,1992), Della Ratta asserts that the intent was only to \u201cborrow the \u2018circumstances which justify judicial dissolution\u2019 from the [MRULPA,]\u201d not the law on subject matter jurisdiction. We believe this is the best reading of the comment. The General Assembly\u2019s insertion of language restricting the court that may order dissolution in the MLLCA and the MRULPA, while omitting the same language in MRUPA\u2019s dissolution statute, indicates that Maryland\u2019s legislative body intended to impose an additional limitation. There is no question that the General Assembly considered such language when it promulgated the MRUPA because the clause is present in the MRUPA\u2019s winding up statute. Thus, we conclude that the deviation is intentional and a more substantive restriction on subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Ultimately, the plain language of CA Section 4A-903 as well as a logical examination of legislative and statutory history persuades us that the MLLCA accords subject matter jurisdiction exclusively in the circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the LLC is located.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We also read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>same restriction in the plain language of CA Sections 4A-904(b) and 9A-803.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">A <em>Transfer of the Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Although, as we explained above, the MLLC and the MRUPA restrict subject matter jurisdiction of this action to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the trial court\u2019s transfer of the case to that circuit court and Judge Caroom\u2019s special designation as a judge of that court cured the jurisdictional problem. Judge Caroom, sitting as a judge for the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, made findings regarding the appropriate relief on all fourteen counts presented by Dyas. At that time, he found that the evidence indicated that Dyas and Della Ratta could not reasonably carry on with Bay View LLC and thus dissolution was warranted. Judge Caroom, however, was very careful to explain that the judgement of dissolution was not final because Anne Arundel County did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhM6\">I find that the facts are sufficient for the Court to grant the dissolution but that I don\u2019t have the subject matter jurisdiction so the Court will transfer it to Montgomery County. And the Circuit Court there, unless there is something else presented to persuade it otherwise, in all likelihood would find that it might be appropriate to grant that relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Through an order dated June 23, 2006, Chief Judge Bell specially assigned Judge Caroom to sit as a Judge for the Circuit Court of Montgomery County. In his Amended Interlocutory Judgment issued from Anne Arundel County, Judge Caroom transferred the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, effective August 7, 2006. On March 12, 2007, Judge Caroom, sitting specially as a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, ordered the dissolution of Spa GP and Bay View LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">To be sure, the mere transfer of a case for the formality of issuing an order will not comply with the dictates of CA Section 4A-903. Yet in this case, Judge Caroom did not close the dissolution matter before transferring it to Montgomery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>County.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the judge\u2019s statement indicates, Della Ratta would have had the opportunity to persuade him, when sitting as a judge of the Montgomery County Circuit Court, that the facts did not justify dissolution. According to the orders dissolving Spa GP and Bay View, the parties were able to advance their arguments during a February 28, 2007 telephone conference, and those arguments along with the applicable law and the record in the case prompted Judge Caroom to order dissolution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During oral argument, Dyas conceded that no additional evidence was presented on dissolution once the case was transferred. Absent some proffer of additional evidence by Della Ratta, however, it was appropriate for Judge Caroom to rely on his findings regarding the other twelve counts in the Anne Arundel County case. Indeed, once the Anne Arundel County judgment became final, Della Ratta would be collaterally estopped from disputing the findings on the other twelve counts, and those issues could provide the necessary support for dissolution. The exercise of subject matter jurisdiction does not depend on the parties\u2019 decisions to submit additional evidence, but rather on whether the matter was adjudicated by the appropriate court. Thus, by providing the parties the chance to convince the Montgomery County court that dissolution was not necessary, Judge Caroom ensured that the order for dissolution did not violate the statutory restriction on subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Circuit Court made no error with respect to the dissolution and winding up of Spa GP and Bay View.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>B. Dissociation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Della Ratta also takes issue with the trial court\u2019s decision to dissociate him from Spa GP. He does not challenge the trial court\u2019s factual findings, but claims that the trial court erred by ordering his dissociation from the partnership based on his management of Bay View. He contends that the court inappropriately \u201cpierce[d] the corporate veil\u201d because it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2b\">obvious that the trial judge was extremely upset about Mr. Della Ratta\u2019s diversion of Bay View cash to DR Palm Beach,[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] CMC, DRI and himself in repayment for advances they made to cover cost overruns on the construction of the Maresol condominiums ... [as well as] Mr. Della Ratta\u2019s refusal to put Maresol\u2019s top floor units on the market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A03\">As this is conduct associated with Bay View, Della Ratta asserts that it cannot serve as the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision and must be disregarded. The third ground for dissolution, according to Della Ratta, was his sloppy bookkeeping, which he insists is cancelled out by Dyas\u2019s neglect of his own duties. Della Ratta concludes that the nullification of these three reasons removes any grounds that could support the order of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The trial court ordered Della Ratta\u2019s dissociation from Spa GP pursuant to CA Section 9A-601(5)(iii)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because it determined that Della Ratta\u2019s actions made it not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>practicable to carry on the business in partnership with him. Della Ratta\u2019s wholly owned company, CMC, managed both the Sea Bay and the New Hotel, and CMC\u2019s vice president testified that the management company loaned $520,262 from the Sea Bay Operating Account to the New Hotel construction, in contravention of the management agreement between CMC and Spa GP. An additional violation of the agreement came in the form of numerous checks issued by CMC to Spa GP that \u201cbore no notation of purpose, or merely noted \u2018loan\u2019 or \u2018advance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 365, 961 A.2d at 641. Finally, the parties stipulated that CMC violated its management contract when it improperly paid itself $580,000 for executive office expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Even if the aforementioned incidents constituted nothing more than negligence, Della Ratta\u2019s capital calls of December 10, 2004 were, in fact, malicious. The CSA succinctly summarized the substance of the capital calls as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">Writing to Spa as President of CMC, Della Ratta claimed $1,485,650.04 in cash advances to Spa, including interest, for operating losses and CMC claimed $640,920, including interest, to be due on lease financing for furniture, fixtures, and equipment for [Sea Bay]. Writing to Spa as president of DRI, Della Ratta claimed $1,439,110, including interest, for cash advances. Writing to Spa for his own account, Della Ratta claimed $1,967,030.97, including interest, for cash advances. Each claim demanded payment on or before January 14, 2005. Then, writing as general partner of Spa, Della Ratta called for capital by January 14, 2005, of $5,532,711, of which Dyas\u2019s share would be $ 2,766,-355.50____ In addition, Della Ratta claimed on behalf of Spa, payment by Dyas, by January 14, 2005, of $798,047.50, representing fifty percent of $1,596,095, the projected cost overrun on the New Hotel. Dyas was also requested to pay a total of $225,146.50 in monthly payments from December 2004 through April 2005 for projected cash requirements of the two hotels. [One of these New Hotel capital calls was issued when the hotel was still under construction and had a stop work order due to DRI\u2019s failure to cure various defects found by the inspectors.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 365-66, 961 A.2d at 641-42. The trial court found that the issuance of these capital calls occurred after Della Ratta had taken steps to deprive Bay View, and thus Dyas, of funds that would have been necessary to meet those obligations. Thus, the trial court concluded, the call letters were issued in bad faith. While Della Ratta surreptitiously emptied Bay View\u2019s accounts, it was to Spa GP that he issued the call letters at a time when he knew they could not be satisfied, in an attempt to squeeze out Dyas without following the proper legal procedures.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In sum, the trial court\u2019s evidentiary support for dissociation related to Della Ratta\u2019s activities while a partner in Spa GP. The record contains sufficient evidence of Della Ratta\u2019s inappropriate conduct to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that it was not reasonably practicable for Spa GP to continue with Della Ratta as a partner. Thus, the trial court did not err in ordering Della Ratta\u2019s dissociation from Spa GP.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\n<em>C. Accounting Exhibit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Della Ratta also seeks reversal of Judge Caroom\u2019s exclusion of an accounting exhibit (\u201cL26\u201d) proffered by Della Ratta after the conclusion of the trial on the merits. After entering its Interlocutory Judgment, the trial court ordered an accounting of Della Ratta and Dyas\u2019s finances with respect to Spa Motel and Bay View and appointed an auditor. In its August 4, 2006 Amended Interlocutory Judgment, the court set forth the parameters by which the auditor was to conduct the accounting. One such guideline was that \u201cthe auditor shall perform the accounting herein based solely limited [sic] on the documents and exhibits which were provided by the parties at trial and which constitute the record of this case[.]\u201d The trial court articulated two reasons for this restriction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>1) the parties to such complex litigation are entitled reasonably to rely upon the discovery process and, after the day of trial has come and gone, they generally should not be required to reopen the process when one party desires to offer new evidence with the benefit of the trial-date\u2019s and the judgment\u2019s education; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">2) the parties should be required to present all evidence to a single fact-finder, particularly where, as here, witness credibility and a pattern of conduct are involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The August 4, 2006 order did allow for the auditor to consider \u201cother books and records\u201d if the trial court determined that additional evidence or findings of fact were \u201cneeded to properly state and settle the accounts between the parties[.]\u201d Maryland Rule 2\u2014543(b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen an matter is referred to an auditor, the order shall state the purpose and scope of the audit. The order may prescribe the manner in which the audit is to be conducted----\u201d In accordance with Judge Caroom\u2019s directions in his referral to an auditor, the admission of additional evidence was within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Under the parties\u2019s central management agreement, CMC was tasked with keeping the accounts. The agreement required CMC to, among other things, comport with the Uniform System of Accounts for Hotels and to furnish monthly reports of all transactions occurring within the month. Despite these guidelines, CMC and Della Ratta\u2019s actual accounting practices \u201cconstituted an accountant\u2019s nightmare[.]\u201d For example, CMC ignored corporate boundaries when it used partnership hotel funds \u201cto pay for dental insurance and HMO costs on the payroll of [DRI] with a note commenting \u2018Cyndy\u2014Please adjust however you need to.\u2019 \u201d CMC also used Spa GP\u2019s hotel funds to satisfy \u201cthousands of dollars of payroll expenses and taxes for a separate hotel owned by Della Ratta, which had no legal connection to the partnership.\u201d Not surprisingly, an expert witness as to financial management practices for hotels testified that CMC\u2019s records were \u201cgrossly inadequate and failed to comply with the \u2018UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTING FOR HOTELS.\u2019 \u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>articulated the legal implications for a party who is responsible for managing the books and who fails to do so properly, in that it must \u201csuffer from the inaccuracies and uncertainties in the evidence by having presumptions and inferences drawn against him or her for the failure to properly account.\u201d It was against this backdrop that the trial court supervised the accounting phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The CSA described the events of the accounting phase of the litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">In his report, the auditor included a balance sheet for Spa as of December 31, 2005. It included among long-term liabilities two items to which [Della Ratta\u2019s] argument is directed. These were \u201cCMC Investment Loan/Suites $193,297.13\u201d and \u201cCMC Investment Loan/Sea Bay $330,913.66.\u201d These two amounts appeared on an unaudited financial statement of Spa, as of that date, that had been maintained among the business records of Spa. It had been introduced as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit H18 at trial. There was no other evidence before the court-appointed auditor explaining these \u201cliabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">In his report, the auditor included a section of \u201cACCOUNTS AS TO WHICH INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTIONS.\u201d Among these were \u201call advances made by CMC to the Sea Bay Inn, the New Hotel and/or the Partnership.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Dyas excepted to the inclusion, <em>inter alia, </em>of the two amounts as liabilities of Spa to CMC. On January 18, 2007, [Della Ratta] responded, asserting that supporting evidence was found in Exhibits H4-H18. That same day [Della Ratta] also moved to reopen the evidence, without proffering any particular evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">A hearing was held by the trial court on April 17, 2007, on all open motions. That day, [Della Ratta] served on Dyas and presented to the court [his] proffer that certain checks be accepted in evidence as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit L26. Six of the checks comprising proffered Exhibit L26 totaled $330,913.66, and the other six checks totaled $193,297.13[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>At the hearing on the motion, [Della Ratta] submitted that the account on which the twelve checks had been drawn was shown by uncontradicted testimony to be Della Ratta\u2019s personal checking account. [He] pointed out that the checks in proffered Exhibit L26 were part of a larger bundle of checks that had been produced in discovery and that had been pre-marked for trial as Exhibit C3. [Della Ratta] represented that when the court held that the construction contract for the New Hotel was a fixed price contract, counsel concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cthe checks that Joe Della Ratta wrote to fund in [sic] cost overruns thereby became [inadmissible. The problem I had in trial was that I didn\u2019t know how to pull the checks apart. I didn\u2019t know what checks were construction and what checks were[,] I\u2019ll call[,] hotel operations checks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 370-71, 961 A.2d at 644-45.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The trial court refused Della Ratta\u2019s request to reopen the evidence for the admission of L26. The court questioned the purposes of the advances documented by the checks, which themselves gave no explanation for the amounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>For example, items 5 &amp; 8 refer to \u201ccapital\u201d and/or \u201cconstruction\u201d of the Sea Bay Inn; in fact, there was no evidence of ongoing construction or capital improvement to the older, Sea Bay hotel in this period. Thus, these checks may have been intended for construction of the [New Hotel], for non-capital items (operating expenses?) at [Sea Bay], or a combination of each. Without any backup documentation, it is impossible for the Court to know and the Court properly cannot speculate. The same problems arise with items 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11 &amp; 12 which are Delphically opaque as to their purposes. Again, the inferences must be drawn against the Defendants who had the obligation properly to keep the books.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">These twelve checks were reminiscent of CMC\u2019s and Della Ratta\u2019s other accounting records, which the trial court characterized as \u201cwoefully incomplete, inaccurate and unreliable.\u201d The trial court acted within its discretion when it elected to exclude such untrustworthy evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In sum, we see no error in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of L26.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>D. Fixed Price Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Finally, Della Ratta appeals the trial court\u2019s finding that DRI entered into a verbal agreement with Bay View to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>construct Maresol on a fixed price basis. He argues that the evidence indicates that the contract was actually a cost-plus contract. The absence of a written agreement required the trial court to construct the terms using letters between Dyas and Della Ratta, the testimony of both men, and various other company documents. The trial court found that the parties originally agreed upon a fixed price of $4,585,825, but increased that amount to $5,613,438 through authorized change orders. The trial court also found that the defendants received $3,163,517.13 in excess of the contract and ordered them to return that amount to Bay View.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Della Ratta first challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusions by zeroing in on a misstatement made by the judge as he rendered his opinion from the bench. When examining an August 6, 2002 letter authored by Della Ratta, the trial court read part of one sentence as: \u201cWe started with a <em>fixed-price contract .\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The language Della Ratta actually used was: \u201cWe started with a <em>fixed contract price </em>____\u201d (emphasis added). We do not view the judge\u2019s inversion of \u201ccontract\u201d and \u201cprice\u201d as indicative of an inappropriate reading of the substance of the letter. Either version could reasonably lead a trier of fact to read Della Ratta\u2019s letter as acknowledging the existence of a contract that fixed a price at which DRI was to construct Bay View. Della Ratta\u2019s own testimony supports this interpretation. When asked about the letter, he did not attempt to deny that the statement referred to a fixed price contract, but rather simply characterized it as a clerical error. This supposed error extended to the next sentence in the letter, which explained that the increase in costs from $4,585,825 to 5,613,438 \u201care the responsibility of Della Ratta, Inc.[,]\u201d instead of Bay View, as Della Ratta contends.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The 2002 letter did not contain the sole clerical error in this case, as conceded by Della Ratta. During the construction of Maresol, Bay View obtained a loan from Severn Bank. Thereafter, DRI and Bay View executed twelve change orders, all of which were signed by Della Ratta and an agent of DRI. Each of these change orders listed $4,585,825.56 as the guaranteed maximum price, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">The original (Contract Sum)(Guaranteed Maximum Price) was $4,585,825.56.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">The net change by previously authorized Change Orders $966,180.84</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">The (Contract Sum)(Guaranteed Maximum Price) prior to this Change Order was $5,552,005.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">The (Contract Sum)(Guaranteed Maximum Price) will be (increased) (decreased) (unchanged) by this Change Order in the amount of $23,668.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">The new (Contract Sum) (Guaranteed Maximum Price) including this Change Order will be $5,575,674.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0E\">The Contract Time will be (increased) (decreased) (unchanged) by ZERO (0) days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The alleged error in the language was authorized by Della Ratta a dozen times, yet it never came to his attention until trial. Ultimately, the trial court did not accept Della Ratta\u2019s argument and concluded that \u201creferences to fixed price contracts were not clerical errors, but they were actual expressions of the parties\u2019 understanding.\u201d The CSA supplemented the trial court\u2019s finding by observing that it was consistent with the parties\u2019s contemporaneous course of conduct where, after constructing Maresol, DRI also agreed to construct the New Hotel under a fixed price contract. <em>See Della Ratta, </em>183 Md.App. at 369, 961 A.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Della Ratta extensively quotes from his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Dyas, arguing that Dyas\u2019s testimony conflicts with his argument for a fixed price contract. The trial court also considered this, but \u201c[did not] find that the trial testimony or any other evidence overcame [the admission in the 2002 letter].\u201d \u201cWeighing the credibility of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533-34, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003) (quotation marks and citations omitted). As an appellate court, we do not re-weigh the evidence, but rather determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 823 A.2d at 668. We believe that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that the parties entered into a fixed price contract and thus the trial court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We hold that, with respect to the dissolution and winding up of a LLC and the winding up of a partnership, the \u201cprincipal office\u201d clause in CA Sections 4A-903, 4A-904(b) and 9A-803(a) restricts subject matter jurisdiction to the county in which the principal office of the business entity is located. The Circuit Court complied with those statutes when, after adjudication of the multi-count action, it transferred the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to adjudicate finally the requests for dissolution and winding up. Therefore, we affirm the court\u2019s final orders of dissolution and the winding up of Spa GP and Bay View. Additionally, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it dissociated Della Ratta from the partnership or when it excluded exhibit L26 from consideration by the appointed accountant, and thus also affirm those decisions. Finally, we hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that the parties had entered into a fixed price contract to construct Maresol was supported by the evidence and thus is not a reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
