Although Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tioner concedes that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses on the afternoon of June 22, 2006, he argues that there are two reasons why he is entitled to a new trial: (1) the Circuit Court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence of what was said by an unknown person who had placed a call to Petitioner\u2019s cell phone, and (2) the Circuit Court failed to comply with the requirements of Md. Rule 4-215 when ruling on Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">After those arguments were rejected by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Garner v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 122, 960 A.2d 649 (2008), Petitioner requested that this Court issue a writ of certiorari to answer four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals, purporting to rein in the \u201cexpansionist tide that produced\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Stoddard [v. State, </em>389 Md. 681, 887 A.2d 564 (2005) ] and <em>Bernadyn [v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 887 A.2d 602 (2005) ], err in holding that an out-of-court statement by a non-testifying, unnamed caller to Petitioner\u2019s cell phone in which the caller said, \u201ccan I get a 40,\u201d was not hearsay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">2. Where Petitioner unequivocally expressed a desire to discharge counsel, the trial court ruled that he could do so, and the docket entry reads: \u201c[c]ourt finds defendant has a right to proceed without counsel today and [attorney] may advise,\u201d did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that counsel was not \u201cdischarged\u201d for purposes of Rule 4-215, because Petitioner responded affirmatively when the trial court asked him, \u201c[w]ould you like me to have him [the attorney] stay to be\u2014sit next to you at the trial table to be on call if you need his help during the trial,\u201d and the attorney participated in all stages of the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">3. Is the State precluded from arguing that counsel was not \u201cdischarged\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s concession at the motion for new trial hearing that \u201cthe court allowed [the attorney] to stay to assist\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>4. Did the trial court fail to comply with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-215?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">That request was granted. 408 Md. 148, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009). For the reasons that follow, we hold that (1) the \u201cout-of-court statement by a non-testifying, unnamed caller to Petitioner\u2019s cell phone in which the caller said, \u2018can I get a 40,\u2019 \u201d was properly received into evidence, and (2) it is clear from a review of the trial transcript that Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that a docket entry indicated a \u201cfinding\u201d by the Circuit Court that Petitioner \u201chas a right to proceed without counsel today and [Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel] may advise.\u201d We shall therefore affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"AhM\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following factual summary that is relevant to question 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhU\">At 3:45 in the afternoon on June 22, 2006, Trooper Jeremy Gussoni of the Maryland State Police and Scott Myers, a State Police Academy candidate, stopped the appellant, who was driving on U.S. Route 301 in Queen Anne\u2019s County, for no less than three minor traffic infractions. As they approached the appellant\u2019s stopped car, they heard him yell into a cell phone that he had been \u201cprofiled.\u201d The appellant immediately handed Trooper Gussoni an identification card and volunteered that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended. Trooper Gussoni verified the fact that the driver\u2019s license had been revoked. Trooper William Heath arrived on the scene and arrested the appellant for driving on a revoked license. A search incident to the appellant\u2019s arrest revealed 13 individually wrapped baggies containing what turned out to be cocaine \u201csecreted in the vehicle\u2019s glove box, inside a fuse box.\u201d The aggregate weight of the cocaine was 6.9 grams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">183 Md.App. at 125-26, 960 A.2d at 650-651.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">According to Petitioner (in the words of his Petition):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>This case presents \u201ca fascinating evidentiary issue,\u201d as described by the Court of Special Appeals. At the police station, Mr. Garner was stripped of his personal items, including his cell phone. Trooper Gussoni subsequently answered the cell phone. Gussoni was allowed to testify, over objection, that after he said \u201chello\u201d a male caller replied, \u201ccan I get a 40,\u201d and then hung up when asked his name. The State relied upon the caller\u2019s utterance to characterize Petitioner\u2019s possession as commercial in nature and not as simple possession for personal use. During opening statement, the prosecutor told the jurors that the caller \u201csaid he needed a 40 ... you\u2019ll hear from Corporal Michael a 40 is slang for a $40 piece of cocaine.\u201d During closing argument he told the jury, \u201cwhy pr[ay]-tell [sic], would you call [a] user and ask him for a 40. Because he is not a user.\u201d And during rebuttal he told the jury, \u201c[b]ut I keep coming back, I know I said this before, you do not, you do not ca[ll] [a] user a mere user of cocaine and ask him for a 40.\u201d The question before this Court is whether the utterance, \u201ccan I get a 40,\u201d which the State offered to prove that Petitioner was a dealer, was hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The record shows that the following transpired during Trooper Gussoni\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Q While you were filling out your paperwork, back in the trooper\u2019s room, what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">A While I was typing, Mr. Garner\u2019s cell phone\u2014the cell phone I received off of him, was ringing non-stop. I had spoken with his girlfriend earlier, I was figuring she might be calling him, wanting to know what\u2019s happening, not knowing if he\u2019s allowed to keep his cell phone on his person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Q What happened when you noticed the phone ringing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">A Again, it was just continually ringing, ringing. I picked up the telephone and said hello. On the other fine was a male voice. He said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">MR. ANDERSON: Objection, Your Honor, as to what the other\u2014as to what the voice on the other line said. Objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tion as to what the voice on the other line said and I believe that might be hearsay, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">BY [STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">Q You can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">A On the other line was a male voice, sounded like a male. I said hello. He said, yo, can I get a 40. I asked his name, he then hung up the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">Q Did you tell him who you were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">A Not that one, but that phone was ringing off the hook. Q Is that the only time you answered it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">A I answered it twice, the next one was a female. After that, another member of the drug task force answered the phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The following factual background is relevant to questions 2, 3, and 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Petitioner\u2019s initial appearance before the Circuit Court occurred on September 8, 2006. On October 10, 2006, Curt Anderson, Esq. entered his appearance as Petitioner\u2019s privately-engaged trial counsel. When Petitioner\u2019s case was called for trial, on November 30, 2006, Mr. Anderson informed the Circuit Court that Petitioner \u201cdoesn\u2019t think that I have his best interests at heart with regard to this case,\u201d and Petitioner stated to the Circuit Court that defense counsel \u201cis trying to force a plea, make me take a plea that I don\u2019t want to take.\u201d The Circuit Court stated to Petitioner, (1) \u201cI\u2019m not going to make you take a plea,\u201d and (2) \u201cI\u2019m not going to postpone this case.\u201d The following transpired at this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">THE COURT: Are you going\u2014do you want to discharge him, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">THE COURT: All right. Would you like me to have him stay to be\u2014sit next to you at the trial table to be on call if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>you need his help during the trial? What I\u2019m saying is we are going to have a trial today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A91\">THE DEFENDANT: Is there any kind of way I can discharge him from representing me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">THE COURT: I said you can do\u2014you have an absolute right to represent yourself, if you want to. You have an absolute right to get an attorney. You can\u2019t wait until the day of trial and come in and tell me that you are going to fire your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, I didn\u2019t know to go to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">THE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">THE DEFENDANT: I didn\u2019t know who to go to to let anybody know, know what I mean, what kind of situation it was. My best interests was to come to the judge that\u2019s hearing the case and let him know that I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t have anything to do, you chose the attorney. If you had problems, you had to work it out with him. Mr. Anderson is a member of the bar, I\u2019m sure if you told him what your feelings were, I\u2019m sure he would have done something about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I have told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">THE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">THE DEFENDANT: He can sit there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The following transpired when the jury panel entered the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">MR. ANDERSON: I\u2019m still in the case and on Mr. Garner\u2019s behalf, I want to make a motion here, not in the presence of the jury, to dismiss this jury pool as not being representative of Mr. Garner\u2019s peers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">(Emphasis supplied). That motion was denied, and jury selection followed, during which the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-18\">THE COURT: Thank you. Mr. Anderson, would you stand up, please. Does any member of the prospective panel know Mr. Curtis Anderson, the attorney for the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>in this case? I see no responses. Mr. Anderson, would you introduce your client, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">MR. ANDERSON: Stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">THE COURT: Turn around and face the jury. Does any member of the prospective panel know Mr. Alphonso Garner, the defendant in this case? You may have a seat, Mr. Garner. Do you have any other witnesses you\u2019d like to introduce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">MR. ANDERSON: I do have one, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">MR. ANDERSON: Would Tina Brisco please stand up. Come forward, please. You can stand right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">THE COURT: Does any member of the prospective panel know this young lady. I see no responses. You may sit down. Thank you. Anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">MR. ANDERSON: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">THE COURT: All right. You may have a seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">The following transpired at the conclusion of the jury selection process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">THE COURT: Is the jury as seated acceptable to the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">THE COURT: To the defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">MR. ANDERSON: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">THE COURT: ... Swear the jurors. Everything okay with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-19\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-20\">THE COURT: Mr. Anderson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-21\">MR. ANDERSON: Yes. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">The following transpired at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-23\">THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-24\">MR. ANDERSON: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>THE COURT: I also note that, for the record, your objection to the portion of the opening statement that dealt with the matter that we discussed at the bench. I saw you stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">MR. ANDERSON: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">THE COURT: But then you saw that I saw it. I just wanted to put it on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">MR. ANDERSON: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">THE COURT: You did make the objection. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">MR. ANDERSON: Good morning. My name is Curt Anderson. I\u2019m the attorney for Mr. Garner. Mr. Garner is seated right here. First, what I\u2019d like to do is thank you all for being here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">As noted by the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">Mr. Anderson professionally and ably conducted the complete defense of this case from start to finish. He conducted the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors and then selected the jury. He made a motion in limine. He delivered the opening statement. He cross-examined the State\u2019s witnesses and made objections. He called the [Petitioner\u2019s] girlfriend as a defense witness. He made motions, at the end of the State\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case, for a judgment of acquittal. He delivered a closing argument. He referred to the [Petitioner] as \u201cmy client.\u201d The State referred to him as \u201ccounsel\u201d: \u2018Tour Honor, I\u2019m going to file the additional penalties I previously served on counsel, subsequent offender notice.\u201d He represented the appellant at sentencing. He filed and argued a new trial motion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">From the opening gavel through the conclusion of the motion for a new trial, there was never the remotest indication that Mr. Anderson was not full-fledged counsel for the defense. The appellant himself did not actively participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>in the conduct of his trial in any way nor did he protest his passive role.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">183 Md.App. at 133, 960 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Petitioner cites <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>389 Md. 681, 887 A.2d 564 (2005) and <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 887 A.2d 602 (2005) in support of his argument that the Circuit Court should have sustained the \u201chearsay\u201d objection to Trooper Gussoni\u2019s testimony about the call to Petitioner\u2019s cell phone. Although those cases hold that certain \u201cimplied assertions\u201d constitute hearsay evidence as that term is defined in Md. Rule 5-801(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> neither <em>Stoddard </em>nor <em>Bemadyn </em>presented the issue of whether the \u201cverbal part of an act\u201d is subject to exclusion under the rule against hearsay, or the issue of whether the rule against hearsay is applicable to every out-of-court declaration that constitutes circumstantial evidence of the declarant\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not either reaffirm or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>overrule either of those fact-specific cases in order to hold that the rule against hearsay was not violated by Trooper Gussoni\u2019s testimony about the telephone call at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">When a telephone is used to receive illegal wagers or to receive orders called in by persons who wish to purchase a controlled dangerous substance, the telephone becomes an instrumentality of the crime. As the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">The making of a wager or the purchase of a drug, legally or illegally, is a form of contract. <em>Little v. State, </em>204 Md. 518, 522-23, 105 A.2d 501 (1954). There is an offer and an acceptance. The telephoned words of the would-be bettor or would-be purchaser are frequently categorized, therefore, as verbal parts of acts. They are not considered to be assertions and do not fall under the scrutiny of the Rules Against Hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">183 Md.App. at 140, 960 A.2d at 659. We agree with that analysis, which is entirely consistent with the prior opinions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In <em>Baum v. State, </em>163 Md. 153, 161 A. 244 (1932), while affirming gambling convictions based in part on a Sergeant\u2019s testimony that he placed a bet on a horse race by calling the number of a telephone proven to have been installed at the residence of one of the defendants, this Court explained why that testimony was admissible even though the witness did not know the identity of the person who took the bet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">The question raised by the next exception to be considered is the contention that testimony as to a telephone conversation with an unidentified person is not admissible in evidence. The identity of the person answering the phone at the house in question, when called by Sergeant Hitzelberger, was not known to him, and no effort is being made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>identify any of the appellants as being the particular person who talked with Hitzelberger. The purpose was to show that the police officer attempted to, and actually did, place a bet on a horse race with the person who answered the phone located at 129 West Mt. Royal Avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 161 A. at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In <em>Courtney v. State, </em>187 Md. 1, 48 A.2d 430 (1946), this Court affirmed bookmaking convictions based in part on a Baltimore City police officer\u2019s testimony that, during the execution of a search warrant at a premises used by the defendants, he answered the telephone and received bets from unidentified persons. While holding that the Circuit Court correctly overruled hearsay objections to that testimony, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">The appellants earnestly contend that evidence as to the placing of bets over the telephone with Officer Trencamp was inadmissible, because the bettors were not identified---- In <em>Beard v. United States, </em>65 App. D.C. 231, 82 F.2d 837 [ (1936) ], officers overheard bets being called in by telephone. The court said (65 App. D.C. at page 235, 82 F.2d at page 841): \u201cThe case, therefore, is not one in which evidence of a telephone conversation is introduced against a particular person. In such case, it is, of course, necessary to establish the identity; but here the evidence, as we have seen, was offered to show that the place in question was a gambling place and that some or all of the persons found therein were engaged in taking bets in violation of law. For these purposes it was proper.\u201d Similar questions have been considered by the California courts, where it has been held that bets called in during a raid constitute a part of the <em>res gestae. </em>See <em>People v. Reifenstuhl, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 402[,405], 99 P.2d 564[, 566 (1940) ]; <em>People v. Kelley, </em>22 Cal.2d 169[, 176], 137 P.2d 1, 5 [(1943)]; and <em>People v. Klein, </em>71 Cal.App.2d 588[, 591-592], 163 P.2d 71, 73 [ (1945) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">187 Md. at 5-6, 48 A.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">In <em>Little v. State, </em>204 Md. 518, 105 A.2d 501 (1954), the proprietor of a Cumberland pool room who was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>gambling violations argued that the State\u2019s <em>admissible </em>evidence was insufficient to establish that he maintained a premises for the purpose of accepting bets on horse races, and that the Circuit Court should have prohibited the State from presenting evidence that two State Police plainclothes officers went to the pool room and placed a bet with a person named Edward Capel. While affirming the convictions, and rejecting the appellant\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court should have excluded testimony about conversations that he neither participated in nor overheard, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">The appellant contends that the officers\u2019 testimony as to Capel\u2019s statement to them, \u201cI got it up,\u201d is hearsay, made out of the presence of the accused, and hence inadmissible. We think, however, that it was part of the <em>res </em>gestae.... The verbal act of taking a bet, with or without the knowledge or consent of Little, was germane to the charge of maintaining premises for gambling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 105 A.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Telephone calls like the one testified to by Trooper Gussoni have been held to be admissible in an unbroken line of state and federal appellate decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although some commentators have disagreed with the courts\u2019 analysis of precisely <em>why </em>such testimony is admissible, the commentators have not asserted that the testimony should be excluded. Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">Courts often reach the right outcomes, but few opinions penetrate the problem well. Those that admit such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>evidence sometimes justify the result by saying the behavior is not an assertion or is not offered to prove what the actor/speaker asserted\u2014positions at odds with reality. Here are some examples:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">1. <em>Bets and drug orders. </em>During searches or raids of drug houses or bookmaking establishments, investigating officers often intercept incoming calls from people trying to place bets or buy drugs. Such calls are usually a mix of act and assertion. The voice on the line might commit the caller to a bet or purchase on certain terms, virtually binding him to perform if the terms are accepted. Or the voice simply make inquiries that convey an interest in doing business, amounting to an attempt to do so or to set something up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">Whether the caller makes a commitment or just tries to make a bet or buy drugs, placing the call is not simply an assertion but action seeking to achieve these ends, and the performative quality of such behavior justifies nonhearsay treatment when it is proved as a means of showing that bets are taken or drugs are sold where the call is received. Courts admit such evidence in both gambling and drug cases, and this result seems sensible. In some settings, one might also avoid the hearsay objection by using the incoming calls as proof of the illegal use to which the premises are put, which is tantamount to saying that placing bets and buying drugs (or attempting to do either one) are themselves elements of an offense relating to the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_0\">Christopher B.

There is no independently relevant act, apart from the statements placing the bets themselves, for the statements to characterize. The statements are irrelevant if offered solely for the fact they were said. For any of the telephone calls to be relevant to establish that the establishment where the 40 telephones were located was a betting parlor, the declarant who placed the telephone call must have intended to call the number reached. Moreover, the declarant must have believed that the number dialed was a betting parlor. In addition, the declarant must have intended to place a bet, instead of, for example, playing a practical joke. Finally, and most importantly, the declarant\u2019s intention to place a bet must have been formed in reliance upon previously acquired personal knowledge that the number dialed is in fact a betting parlor. Thus the out-of-court statement placing a bet is relevant only when offered to prove the truth of the matter necessarily implicitly being asserted by the out-of-court declarant, i.e., that the establishment reached is in fact a betting parlor. As presented such statements also fall within the residual hearsay exception of Rule 807.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Michael H.

Later that day, at the police station, the pager associated with Lewis began beeping. Officer Jerry Price called the number displayed on the pager and identified himself as Lewis. The person on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>other end asked Price \u201cDid you get the stuff?\u201d Price answered affirmatively. The unidentified person then asked \u201cWhere is Dog?\u201d Price responded that \u201cDog\u201d was not available. He then tried to arrange a meeting with the unknown caller, but no one showed up at the appointed rendezvous. The evidence at trial revealed that \u201cDog\u201d is Wade\u2019s nickname.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1179. While affirming the ruling of the district court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">The questions asked by the unknown caller, like most questions and inquiries, are not hearsay because they do not, and were not intended to, assert anything.

Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>565 F.3d 312 (6th Cir.2009), while reversing a district court ruling that excluded a DEA agent\u2019s testimony about ten requests to purchase heroin made by persons who called the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone shortly after his arrest, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Because the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing, the record does not reveal exactly what the anonymous callers said to Agent Perryman. We do not even know whether the callers phrased their statements as declarations (\u201cI want some heroin.\u201d), questions (\u201cCan I get some heroin?\u201d), or commands (\u201cBring me some heroin.\u201d). But whatever their grammatical mood, the statements are not hearsay because the government does not offer them for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>their truth. Indeed, if the statements were questions or commands, they could not\u2014absent some indication that the statements were actually code for something else\u2014be offered for their truth because they would not be assertive speech at all. They would not assert a proposition that could be true or false. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>343 F.3d 849, 865 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] question is typically not hearsay because it does not assert the truth or falsity of a fact.\u201d); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>451 F.3d 543, 548 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cQuestions and commands generally are not intended as assertions, and therefore cannot constitute hearsay.\u201d (citations omitted)). Even if the statements were assertions, the government offers them, not for their truth, but as evidence of the fact that they were made. The fact that Rodriguez received ten successive solicitations for heroin is probative circumstantial evidence of his involvement in a conspiracy to distribute heroin. <em>See Headley v. Tilghman, </em>53 F.3d 472, 477 (2nd Cir.1995) (Questions from an unidentified caller were not admitted for their truth but as circumstantial evidence that the defendant used his beeper to receive requests for drugs).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 314-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">While there may be an \u201cimplied assertion\u201d in almost any question, in the case at bar, the only assertion implied in the anonymous caller\u2019s question was the assertion that the caller had the funds to purchase the drugs that he wanted to purchase. Because the caller\u2019s request did not constitute inadmissible hearsay evidence, the rule against hearsay does not operate to exclude evidence of the \u201cverbal act\u201d that established a consequential fact: Petitioner was in possession of a telephone called by a person who requested to purchase cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">II-IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Petitioner argues that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court failed to comply with the requirements of Md.

Although the colloquy at that time was a bit vague, there loomed at least the possibility that [Mr.] Anderson might be discharged and might remain available only in a standby capacity by way of giving legal advice if such advice were to be sought by the pro se defendant. In fact, no such watered down relationship ever asserted itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In this case, it was Mr. Anderson and not the [Petitioner] who \u201ccalled the shots\u201d from start to finish.

As to this issue, the majority holds that this statement is a verbal act, and, therefore, is not hearsay and is admissible. <em>Garner v.

Adopting the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 rationale, the majority holds that the petitioner\u2019s defense counsel \u201c Vas never discharged as counsel ... and that the provisions of Rule 4-215(a)(3), therefore, never came into play.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garner v.

I disagree with the majority on both issues, and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The facts may be briefly stated. During a routine traffic stop on the afternoon of June 22, 2006, it came to Trooper Jeremy Gussoni\u2019s attention that Alphonso Garner, the petitioner, was driving on a suspended license. Having arrested the petitioner for the infraction, the Trooper and his partner searched the petitioner\u2019s vehicle. The search \u201crevealed 13 individually wrapped baggies containing what turned out to be [6.9 grams of] cocaine.\u201d <em>Garner, </em>183 Md.App. at 126, 960 A.2d at 651. Trooper Gussoni testified that, subsequently, at the police station, the petitioner\u2019s cell phone rang and that, when he, Trooper Gussoni, answered it and said \u201cHello,\u201d the caller asked, \u201c \u2018Can I get a 40?,\u2019 but then hung up when Trooper Gussoni asked him for his name.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The petitioner was charged in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County with, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and, possession of drug paraphernalia. He appeared for trial represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Before the commencement of trial, the following colloquy concerning the petitioner\u2019s desire for new counsel, occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZL\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... For the last couple of days, I\u2019ve explained to Mr. Garner the nature of the case, the evidence against him. In other words, things that a lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>does prior to trial and I had recommended to Mr. Garner a certain disposition in this case, as opposed to going to trial and I have, apparently, done [so] too consistently because Mr. Garner has indicated to me that he doesn\u2019t think that I have his best interests at heart with regard to this case. He doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m going to try the case wholeheartedly because of my continued assertions that he take a plea in the case.... So I thought I ought to bring that to the Court\u2019s attention because I think he was going to stand up and say it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... Mr. Garner, you heard what Mr. Anderson said, do you want to add anything to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

He is trying to force a plea, make me take a plea that I don\u2019t want to take.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">After assuring the defendant that the court would not make him accept a plea, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, then you should have done something about it before. You come in and you ask for postponements and everything else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">The defendant maintained, and his counsel confirmed, that the defendant had not requested the previous postponement. This prompted the following colloquy, the effect and purpose of which was to continue with the proceedings that day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, anyway, you\u2019re not asking for a continuance, you are going to represent yourself, is that what you [would] like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I would love to have a continuance to get me another lawyer because I got a steady job now and I need the continuance to get me a lawyer that I feel that is going to represent me in my best interests, as far as my case is concerned. I have a steady job, might take me a month to get some money to have me another lawyer that I feel I would get the best representation for my behalf on my case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">After refusing to grant a continuance, the trial court continued its colloquy with the petitioner, this time inquiring as to the petitioner\u2019s intention with respect to the discharge of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVS\">\u201cTHE COURT: I see. Are you going\u2014do you want to discharge him, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Would you like me to have him stay to be\u2014sit next to you at the trial table to be on call if you need his help during the trial? What I\u2019m saying is we are going to have a trial today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Is there any kind of way I can discharge him from representing me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I said you can do\u2014you have an absolute right to represent yourself, if you want to. You have an absolute right to get an attorney.

Thank you. Go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Although defense counsel was asked by the trial court to be, and the petitioner agreed that the defense counsel could be, standby counsel, counsel acted as lead counsel throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">One of the motions made by the defense counsel was a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the contents of a phone call to the petitioner\u2019s cell phone. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... my client, apparently, had a cell phone which was answered by a state trooper later in\u2014 after he was arrested and the caller on the other end said something [\u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d] that I think would be very damaging to my client in this particular case. I don\u2019t think that evidence or that statement should be admitted or the call on the other end of the phone, should be admitted for a couple of reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">\u201cObviously, it\u2019s an anonymous call. We don\u2019t know who it was from, we don\u2019t know if they got the right number and I\u2019m not able, obviously, to cross-examine. I think the reliability of whatever was said on the other end is subject to suspicion and I think the probative value of that would certainly not outweigh the prejudice that it would weigh on my client in this particular case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">In response, the State relying on <em>Best v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 422, 526 A.2d 75 (1987), argued: \u201cit[\u2019]s a verbal act.... [I]t was offered as evidence that the call was made for the purpose of arranging an illegal drug transaction.\u201d The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion, without explanation. That denial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">In an attempt to establish that \u201cCan I get a 40?,\u201d indicated that the call was for drugs, the State called Corporal Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>with the Maryland State Police Drug Task Enforcement Division. He testified <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Corporal Michael ... are you familiar with cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Okay.... [T]hrough your training and experience, what increments is cocaine sold in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Its usually known in money denominations, is the common way it is referred to, such as a 20 rock, a 40 rock, 60, 80 and even as high as an 100 probably for a street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Have you, through your training and experience and debriefing individuals, have you heard the term 40 before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Do you have an opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, as to what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Forty is a quantity of crack cocaine that is commonly referred to. It\u2019s approximately four-tenths of a gram. Just like a 20 is about two-tenths of a gram.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">The petitioner was later convicted of the charged offenses and sentenced to 41 years in prison. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment below. <em>Garner v.

In short, verbal acts, are admissible to show a play-by-play of the ongoing events.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">A verbal act references or describes an action that is ongoing or gives rise to further action. It is particularly \u201crelevant because it explains some observed act by the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 227, as it relates to the crime charged. That said, there is an important distinction between those cases where the statement is offered to describe the defendant\u2019s action or reaction to a statement or circumstances, and cases in which the statement is offered for another purpose. In those instances where the defendant is not directly participating in or responding to an action, the statement may be admissible to explain some relevant act or event, <em>i.e., </em>perhaps to describe how the premises are being used, but it cannot be used to explicate an action\u2014because there is none\u2014of the defendant. Cases involving evidence secured during the raid of a betting or gambling house make this point clear. In these cases, the statements are offered to prove the nature of the activity occurring on the premises, and not to prove the defendant\u2019s complicity. Other evidence is needed to make that connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Courtney v. State, </em>187 Md. 1, 2, 48 A.2d 430, 430 (1946), for instance, the defendant was charged with \u201cunlawfully making and selling books or pools on horse races and with keeping a house for the purpose of betting and gambling.\u201d The State sought to prove \u201cthat the place in question was a gambling place and that some or all of the persons found therein were engaged in taking bets in violation of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 48 A.2d at 432. The Court in that case makes clear that the evidence at issue was not \u201c\u2018evidence of a telephone conversation ... introduced against a particular person,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>but the evidence was being introduced to illustrate that the place itself was being used as a criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Likewise, in <em>Little v. State, </em>204 Md. 518, 520-21, 105 A.2d 501, 502 (1954), two State police officers in Cumberland went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>to a pool room operated by Leonard Little. Acting undercover, the officers placed bets on horse races. <em>Id. </em>The officers gave money to Edward Capel (\u201cCapel\u201d) to secure their bet. <em>Id. </em>Capel went into the back room and when he came back, he informed the police that \u201c T got it up,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>apparently meaning that their bets were made. At trial, Little contended that the \u201cofficers\u2019 testimony as to Capel\u2019s statement to them, T got it up\u2019 [was] hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 105 A.2d at 503. The Court disagreed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cWe think, however, that it was part of the <em>res gestae. </em>The statement did not purport to repeat anything said to Capel by Little, or even to implicate him directly in the transaction. It merely indicated an acceptance of their offer by Capel, either on his own account or for an undisclosed principal. The verbal act of taking a bet, with or without the knowledge or consent of Little, was <em>germane to the charge of maintaining premises for gambling.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 105 A.2d at 503 (emphasis added). In <em>Little, </em>the statement was not introduced to implicate the defendant, it was meant to prove the charge of maintaining the premises for gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Where the statement is introduced for the specific purpose of implicating the defendant, it is considered a verbal act only if it describes an action or reaction of or by the defendant. <em>Stevens v. Florida, </em>642 So.2d 828 (Fla. 2nd Dist.Ct.App.1994) is illustrative. There the defendant, Stevens, was found guilty of two counts of delivery of cocaine. The evidence introduced was that of his co-defendant, Hill, who negotiated with an undercover officer for the sale of cocaine, during the course of which he went over to the defendant\u2019s, Stevens\u2019s car, and yelled \u201c T need a dime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829. The officer testified that Stevens \u201creach[ed] into his pocket ... and grab[ed] a whole bunch of plastic baggies, at which point he gave Mr. Hill one, put the rest back in his pocket, then Mr. Hill came back to me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting Stevens\u2019s argument that the statement, \u201c T need a dime,\u2019 \u201d was inadmissible hearsay, <em>id., </em>the Florida court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cAppellant\u2019s participation could not have been demonstrated any other way. Since the testimony was not offered for its truth, it is not hearsay----We, accordingly, affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of cocaine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Id. </em>In that case, Hill\u2019s statement precipitated, and described, the defendant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Where the statement neither explains nor evokes an action or reaction by the defendant, it is just a statement that does not assist the fact-finder in understanding or evaluating the actions of the defendant, and, accordingly, is subject to a hearsay analysis. This point was made in <em>Antunes-Salgado v. Florida, </em>which involved a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) arranging to buy drugs from a party who was not the defendant. 987 So.2d at 223. \u201cDuring the cell phone calls that led up to the transaction, Tranquilino [an associate of the defendant] told the Cl that other people would be with her at the transaction, but she did not\u201d name the person or persons. <em>Id. </em>At the drop-off site, the defendant, Antunes-Salgado, was in the back seat. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the police stormed the truck, they found five kilograms of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant was later charged with trafficking cocaine and conspiracy to traffic cocaine, <em>id., </em>and the statements made to the Cl were used to convict him. Reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Florida Court of Appeals noted the distinction between hearsay and verbal acts, stating: \u201c[T]he statements at issue are not nonhearsay Verbal acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. The court then went on to explain this distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cThus, for example, had Tranquilino told the Cl that An-tunes-Salgado would be accompanying her to the transaction, that statement would have been a Verbal act\u2019 because it would have served to explain Antunes-Salgado\u2019s presence in the back seat of the truck and might have established his involvement in the transaction. However, none of the statements actually offered by the State at trial were relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>explain any act by Antunes-Salgado.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Instead, the statements are relevant only to prove the truth of the matter asserted in them; <em>ie., </em>that Antunes-Salgado had an agreement -with the codefendants to deliver cocaine to the Cl.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUP\"><em>Id. </em>at 227. It explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cFor example, in <em>Banks [v. State, </em>790 So.2d 1094 (Fla.2001) ], an undercover police officer was standing at a pay phone when a car driven by Banks approached. 790 So.2d at 1096. Banks\u2019 passenger, Goodman, spoke to the officer and asked her what she needed. <em>Id. </em>The officer first asked Goodman whether Banks was \u2018straight up.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>After Goodman replied that he was, the officer asked Goodman if she could purchase drugs from him. <em>Id. </em>Goodman told the officer that it would be no problem____Goodman then sold the officer the drugs. <em>Id. </em>Goodman did not testify at trial, and Banks challenged the admission of Goodman\u2019s statements as hearsay; however, the trial court admitted the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cOn appeal, the supreme court noted that many of the statements Goodman made to the officer arranging the drug sale and arranging to meet in the alley appeared to be admissible as \u2018verbal acts\u2019 because those statements explained Banks\u2019 conduct in driving the car into the alley after the initial encounter. <em>Id. </em>at 1099 n. 3. That conduct had independent legal significance because it implicated Banks in the transaction. <em>Id. </em>However, the statement that Banks was \u2018straight up\u2019 was not a verbal act because it did not explain the nature of the act or transaction but rather simply implicated Banks in the transaction.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] <em>Id. </em>at 1098. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Therefore, the statement directly incriminating Banks was not a verbal act and was not admissible. <em>Id. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">987 So.2d at 227. <em>Antunes-Salgado </em>and <em>Banks </em>show that verbal acts are restricted to those statements which describe an action or reaction by the defendant and not those that are introduced for the purpose of \u201cdirectly incriminating\u201d the defendant. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Banks v. Florida, </em>790 So.2d at 1098).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In this case, the phone call, and, in particular its content, did not describe or explain any action on the defendant\u2019s part. In fact, the defendant was not even present and may not have been aware of the call at all. He was detained and, therefore, unavailable to take the phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">An additional concern is the anonymity of the caller and the actual behavior of the caller. Defense counsel specifically stated: \u201c... it\u2019s an anonymous call. We don\u2019t know who it was from, we don\u2019t know if they got the right number and I\u2019m not able, obviously, to cross-examine.\u201d Notably this call was less meaningful than a conversation \"with an unidentified person. Here, not only was the caller unidentified, but, unlike many of the cases below, the caller did not ask to speak to anyone when the officer picked up the phone. <em>Contra Courtney, </em>187 Md. at 3-4, 48 A.2d. at 431 (\u201cDuring the period of an hour various persons call[ed].... some of the callers asked for Nick, others for Nat.\u201d). The declarant, rather, after asking one question, ambiguous without expert testimony, hung up the phone when asked to identify himself. As the defense counsel argued, it is not at all clear whether the declarant even meant to call the petitioner. Indeed, in truth, the declarant\u2019s behavior is not at all inconsistent with that of an individual who calls the wrong number and hangs up when he or she realizes that the wrong number was dialed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Nevertheless, the call was offered against the petitioner. Although it is contended that its purpose was a benign one, to show that such a call was made to a phone that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>possessed, that proposition alone would not further the State\u2019s case and, in fact, merely that the call was made, without more, would not tie the petitioner to the sale of cocaine. In truth, its only effect, if not its purpose, was to prove that the petitioner was distributing cocaine. Thus, the statement was assertive and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">By this holding, any question posed by an unidentified caller to a cell phone belonging to a defendant, but in police control, even if it does not explain an action or reaction by the defendant, and whose only purpose and effect is to implicate the defendant in a criminal act, constitutes a verbal act admissible without regard to its prejudicial effect or analysis pursuant to Rule 5-801. This turns the concept of verbal act on its head and undermines the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">B. Why \u201cCan I get a 40?,\u201d is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Having established that this case falls squarely within the rule against hearsay, I return to the statement itself and the majority\u2019s conclusion that it \u201cestablished a consequential fact: \u201cPetitioner was in possession of a telephone called by a person who requested to purchase cocaine.\u201d <em>Garner v. State, </em>414 Md. at 388, 995 A.2d at 704. To be sure, the statement does tend to establish that fact, but that fact has meaning and probative force only if the assertions it implies\u2014that the owner of the cell phone is the owner of, and will sell, the cocaine the caller wants to purchase\u2014are true. Thus, the statement by the declarant is in violation of our rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The hearsay rule excludes statements of non-testifying individuals offered in court to prove the matter they assert. Md. Rule 5-801(c). Although \u201c[m]uch verbal evidence may be sorted into hearsay and non-hearsay without too [much] searching,\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 689, 887 A.2d at 569, not all cases are so simple. A statement is considered hearsay when the assertion it implies \u201cis relevant only in that, by asking it, [the declarant] may have revealed, by implication, a belief that,\u201d <em>id., </em>implicates the defendant. \u201cThe implied assertions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>doctrine focuses on the implications or inferences contained within or drawn from an utterance, as distinguished from the declaration\u2019s literal contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 887 A.2d at 569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>Stoddard, </em>the defendant, \u201cwas convicted of second degree murder and child abuse resulting\u201d in the death of Calen DiRubbo. 389 Md. at 683, 887 A.2d at 565. The evidence showed that \u201cStoddard was the only adult supervising Calen,\u201d and \u201cher cousin Jasmine Pritchett.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 887 A.2d at 566. Jennifer Pritchett, Jasmine\u2019s mother, testified over the objection of defense counsel, that Jasmine, after the incident, \u201casked [her mother] if Erik was going to get her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 887 A.2d at 566. The State offered \u201cthis utterance as evidence that the child had witnessed Stoddard commit the murder,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 683, 887 A.2d at 565, prompting the defendant to argue that the statement was inadmissible hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 686-87, 887 A.2d at 567. The question presented to the Court was \u201cwhether the trial court erred in admitting testimony recounting an out-of-court utterance allegedly made by a non-testifying eighteen month old child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 887 A.2d at 565. We answered in the affirmative, applying the implied assertion doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12, 887 A.2d at 581-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In a section of the <em>Stoddard </em>decision, entitled, \u201cOther Courts in Accord with Our View,\u201d we cited to several cases in support of our conclusion that the admission of implied assertions cannot be considered apart from the subject\u2019s literal contents: <em>United States v.

Dullard, </em>668 N.W.2d 585, 594-95 (Iowa 2003) (\u201c[W]e do not believe indirect or unintentional assertions in speech are reliable enough to avoid the hearsay rule. We think the best approach is to evaluate the relevant assertion in the context of the purpose for which the evidence is offered.\u201d); <em>Ginyard v.

We reported, with approval, the holding of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that the evidence was hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">\u201c \u2018Reynolds\u2019 statement is ... ambiguous and susceptible to different interpretations. As the government uses it, the statement\u2019s probative value depends on the truth of an assumed fact it implies. Unless the trier assumes that the statement implies that Reynolds did not tell the postal inspectors that Parran was involved in the conspiracy to defraud, even though Parran was in fact involved, the statement carries no probative weight for the government\u2019s case. For if the trier assumes that the statement implied that Reynolds did not tell the postal inspectors that Parran was involved because there was nothing to tell, the statement has no relevance to the government\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c \u2018Its only relevance to the government\u2019s case is tied to an assumed fact of petitioner\u2019s guilt that the government argues the utterance proves. Thus, depending on the interpretation given the content of Reynolds\u2019 statement, it is either probative or not. Consequently, we believe that, as the government uses it, the statement\u2019s relevance goes well beyond the fact that it was uttered. It is not merely intended to prove that Reynolds could speak, or that he could speak in English, or even that he directed a statement toward Parran. Instead, the government offers it to prove the truth of the assumed fact of defendant\u2019s guilt implied by its content.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 704-05, 887 A.2d at 578 (quoting <em>Reynolds, </em>715 F.2d at 103).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In <em>Lyle, </em>letters outlining the testimony, Kemp, the co-defendant wrote for two potential witnesses to give at trial written, <em>id. </em>at 429, were admitted against the defendant at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>murder trial. Explicating the court\u2019s analysis in reversing his conviction for violation of the hearsay rule, this Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u201cThe court found these letters to be hearsay, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201c \u2018Believing the alibi to be false, the prosecution obviously did not seek to introduce the letters in order to demonstrate the truth of the particular statements they contained. Rather, the government intended to have the jury infer from the statements that Kemp was attempting to obtain fabricated alibi testimony, an act that revealed a \u2018guilty mind\u2019 on his part regarding the shootings. This guilty mind inference in turn invited the jury to infer Kemp\u2019s substantive guilt. Thus, in determining whether the letters constitute hearsay, we must decide whether the inferences that the government sought to elicit by introducing them should be included within the set of \u2018assertions\u2019 that the letters make.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201c \u2018Although we consider the question of the proper classification of the letters exceedingly close, we find that the inferences they necessarily invite form an integral part of the letters. They were introduced because by inference they assert the proposition of fact that Kemp and Lyle committed the robbery and hence need an alibi. Accordingly, we conclude that the letters are hearsay.\u2019 <em>[Lyle, </em>720 F.2d] at 432-33 (citations omitted).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 706-07, 887 A.2d at 579. Having set the foundation for what an implied assertion looks like and the manner in which this Court classifies it, the <em>Stoddard </em>Court turned to the facts before it and Jasmine\u2019s statement, \u201cis Erik going to get me,\u201d noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cContrary to the State\u2019s contention, the words are not relevant if offered merely to prove that Jasmine was afraid of Stoddard. Jasmine\u2019s fear of Stoddard is irrelevant unless it stems from a belief that she had seen Stoddard assault Calen. Although it is conceivable that Jasmine\u2019s fear, taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>together with her presence during the relevant time frame, was circumstantial evidence that Jasmine witnessed Stoddard assault Calen, this conceptualization is a distinction without a difference. Jasmine\u2019s fear of Stoddard is relevant only if it is rational, <em>ie., </em>only if it stems from a real-world condition or event. To rationally fear Erik Stoddard is to believe the proposition, T have a reason to fear Erik Stoddard.\u2019 Jasmine\u2019s belief in this proposition is relevant only if the \u2018reason\u2019 at issue is her having witnessed Erik assaulting Calen. Thus, in offering Jasmine\u2019s fear as evidence, the State implicitly would be offering Jasmine\u2019s belief in the proposition T have a reason to fear Erik Stoddard and that reason is that I saw him assault Calen.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 887 A.2d at 569. It further explicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cIn order to accept the words \u2018is Erik going to get me\u2019 as evidence that Jasmine witnessed Erik Stoddard assaulting Calen DiRubbo, the jury needed to make numerous inferences. It needed to infer first that Jasmine meant those words to convey a sincere inquiry as to whether Erik Stoddard was going to harm her. It needed to infer next that, by making this inquiry, Jasmine revealed unambiguously a belief that she had witnessed Stoddard assaulting Calen. It needed to infer further that Jasmine remembered accurately her perceptions of June 15, 2002. And it needed to infer finally that Jasmine\u2019s perceptions were correct at the moment she experienced them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cIn the absence of cross-examination, and particularly in light of Jasmine\u2019s age[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>], these inferences are largely untest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ed and (insupportable. The jury had no information about the context in which Jasmine spoke these words, and hence little basis from which to conclude that she used \u2018get\u2019 to mean \u2018harm,\u2019 or that these words were spoken seriously and not in play. The jury had no information about other, unrelated reasons why Jasmine might have feared Stoddard. It had no information about Jasmine\u2019s ability to remember accurately past events, nor any information about the amount of time that had elapsed between Calen\u2019s death and Jasmine\u2019s utterance. It had no information about factors that would have affected Jasmine\u2019s perceptions during the alleged assault, such as distance, angle of view, obstructions, or Jasmine\u2019s cognitive ability to distinguish an assault from some other frightening but innocuous event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 711-12, 887 A.2d at 582. (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The ruling of the <em>Stoddard </em>Court was affirmed in <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. at 11, 887 A.2d at 608 (\u201cOur discussion and reasoning in <em>Stoddard </em>determines the outcome of this case.\u201d). In <em>Bemadyn, </em>defendant, Michael Bernadyn, was charged with and convicted of various drug offenses and maintaining a common nuisance. 390 Md. at 3, 887 A.2d at 603. Bernadyn asserted at trial that he did not reside at the home where, during the execution of a search and seizure warrant, the contraband and paraphernalia where found. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 887 A.2d at 604. To rebut that assertion, the State offered, over objection of defense counsel, an envelope, which also had been seized from the home during the search, from John Hopkins Bayview Physicians, which \u201ccontain[ed] the language \u2018Responsible party: Michael Bernadyn, Jr. 2024 Morgan Street, Edge-wood, Maryland 21040.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 887 A.2d at 603-604. Concluding that \u201cthe medical bill seized by police ... when used by the State to establish that Bernadyn lived at that address, constitutes inadmissible hearsay,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3, 887 A.2d at 603, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cIn order to accept the words \u2018Michael Bernadyn, Jr., 2024 Morgan Street, Edgewood, Maryland 21040\u2019 as proof that Bernadyn lived at that address, the jury needed to reach two conclusions. It needed to conclude, first, that Bayview Physicians wrote those words because it believed Bernadyn to live at that address, and second, that Bayview Physicians was accurate in that belief. As used, the probative value of the words depended on Bayview Physicians having communicated the proposition that Michael Bernadyn lived at 2024 Morgan Street. The words therefore constituted a \u2018written assertion\u2019\u2014and hence, under Md. Rule 5-801(a), a \u2018statement\u2019\u2014that Michael Bernadyn lived at 2024 Morgan Street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 11, 887 A.2d at 608. It, therefore, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cWhen used to prove the truth of that assertion, the bill was hearsay under Md. Rule 5-801(c), because it contained \u2018a statement ... offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">This Court is not unique in its view that implied assertions are inadmissible hearsay. <em>See Lyle v. Koehler, </em>720 F.2d 426; <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>715 F.2d 99; <em>Antunes-Salgado v. Florida, </em>987 So.2d at 228; <em>United States v. Palmar-Ruedas, </em>121 F.3d at 857 (\u201cWhole Quinones may not have offered the statement for its express meaning, he did offer it for the implied assertion that he had never met Avendano.\u201d); <em>Stevens v. State, </em>642 So.2d 828. In <em>United States v. McGlory, </em>968 F.2d 309 (3d Cir.1992), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, on review of four consolidated drug-related cases, <em>id. </em>at 314, addressed a similar issue when four defendants \u201cobjected to the admission of the notes seized from McGlory\u2019s trash or his residences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. Although the government asserted \u201cthe notes were offered as circumstantial evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 332, similar to the majority in this case, <em>Garner v. State, </em>414 Md. at 380-82, 995 A.2d at 699-700, the court was not persuaded. From the outset, the court expressed that it \u201chas disfavored the admission of statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>which are not technically admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, whenever the matter asserted, without regard to its truth value, implies that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\u201d <em>McGlory, </em>968 F.2d at 332. The court concluded that the State\u2019s witness did \u201ctestif[y] as to the truth of the statements written on the notes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 333, and that, therefore \u201cthese notes were hearsay and should not have been admitted unless they come within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><em>Stoddard v. State </em>and <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>control the disposition of this case. When \u201c[t]he probative value of the words [are] dependent],\u201d <em>Bernadyn, </em>390 Md. at 11, 887 A.2d at 608, on the truth of facts implied by the statement, it is inadmissable hearsay. The caller here posed a question: \u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d Whether that question is offered for the truth of the matter it asserts, expressly or impliedly, is, of course, dependent upon the meaning, express or implied, it conveys or was intended to convey. If certain \u201cimplications or inferences\u201d are necessary to be made or drawn in order that the statement be probative of the proposition for which it is offered, then the \u201creasonable test is to ask whether the words would remain probative if it could be established that the declarant <em>did not believe </em>the factual proposition for which they are offered.\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 703 n. 5, 887 A.2d at 577 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Here, the State intended, by introduction of the question, \u201cCan I get a 40?\u201d to show that the petitioner was distributing cocaine. The statement alone does not have that effect. To be probative of that proposition, which it had to prove for the distribution prosecution to be successful, the statement had to relate to, be directed to, the petitioner. In addition to establishing that a \u201crequest[ ] to purchase cocaine,\u201d <em>Garner v. State, </em>414 Md. at 388, 995 A.2d at 704, was made, the State first had to show that the statement was directed to the petitioner and that the petitioner sold cocaine. These \u201cfacts\u201d could only be established by implying them from the fact that the declarant made the statement in a call to the petitioner\u2019s cell phone and the implications must be accepted as true. Only by believing both implied facts to be true does the statement, \u201cCan I get a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>40?\u201d have the meaning and probative effect that the State intends, and needs. \u201cCan I get a 40?,\u201d without those two assumptions, implied facts, even with the expert testimony that gives it meaning in the criminal context, would have no connection or relevance to the petitioner. Using the test proposed by the <em>Stoddard </em>Court, 389 Md. at 703 n. 5, 887 A.2d at 577 n. 5, if the declarant, the caller, did not believe those two assumptions to be true, then the State would have no reason to introduce the statement; the statement, in that event, as it relates to the petitioner, simply would be neither probative nor relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The State intended to, and did indeed, introduce the statement for a particular purpose, to establish that the person on the phone wanted cocaine, which could be purchased upon request from the petitioner, who sold, or was selling, drugs. The latter two implied assertions are, when offered for their truth, hearsay, whose admission into evidence is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s previous holdings in <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Bemadyn, </em>respectively, and impermissible under Md. Rule 5-801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II. <em>Waiver of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The petitioner asserts that, although the trial court permitted him to discharge his counsel, albeit after having found that he did not have a meritorious reason for doing so,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> thus requiring him to go to trial unrepresented, it failed to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>with Md. Rule 4-215(e)\u2019s mandate that \u201cit shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.\u201d The State, in response, argues that counsel was never discharged. The majority agrees, holding, as did the Court of Special Appeals: \u201c \u2018The bottom line is that [Mr.] Anderson was never discharged as counsel for the [Petitioner] and that the provisions of Rule 4\u2014215(a)(3), therefore, never came into play.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garner v. State, </em>414 Md. at 389, 995 A.2d at 704 (quoting <em>Garner, </em>183 Md.App. at 132, 960 A.2d at 654).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">This holding is belied by the transcript of the proceedings and by the docket entries. The transcript reflects that the petitioner responded, \u201cyes, sir,\u201d in response to the trial court\u2019s question: \u201cAre you going\u2014do you want to discharge him, is that it?\u201d To the petitioner\u2019s affirmative response, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cAll right. Would you like me to have him stay to be\u2014sit next to you at the trial table to be on call if you need his help during the trial? What I\u2019m saying is we are going to have a trial today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Thus, the petitioner indicated a desire to discharge his counsel, and, although the petitioner eventually acquiesced<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>court\u2019s suggestion that counsel \u201cstay to be\u2014sit next to [him] at the trial table ... if [he] need[ed] help during the trial[,]\u201d the trial court permitted him to do so. The docket entry so reflects: \u201cDefendant wants to discharge attorney and requests continuance. Court finds defendant has right to proceed without counsel today and Mr. Anderson may advise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that Anderson was never discharged also runs contrary to this Court\u2019s understanding of what standby counsel is. Standby counsel, we have held, \u201cassist[s] a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right of self-representation, and ... assist[s] \u2018the court in maintaining some measure of control over the proceeding.\u2019\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 506, 687 A.2d 970, 974 (1997). This is consistent with the view of such counsel taken by the United States Supreme Court. It described standby counsel as one who aids \u201cthe accused if and when the accused requests help, and [is] available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary.\u201d <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834 n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541 n. 46, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 581 n. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 687 A.2d 970 is instructive. Although the issue in <em>Harris </em>was whether the trial court could order the Office of the Public Defender to serve as standby counsel after the defendant had voluntarily and knowingly discharged counsel, <em>id. </em>at 499, 687 A.2d at 971, the manner in which the Court talks about standby counsel provides guidance on this issue. In <em>Harris, </em>the defendant in the underlying case, Bruce W. Koenig, wished to discharge his counsel. He specifically asked to \u201c \u2018proceed as I wanted to, in what [counsel] described as a [\u2018 ]hybrid defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501 n. 2, 687 A.2d at 972 n. 2. The <em>Harris </em>Court, citing <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 265, 523 A.2d, 597, 599 (1987), explained hybrid representation as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201c \u2018encompassing both the participation of the defendant in the conduct of the trial when he had not effectively waived the assistance of an attorney to defend him, and the participation by an attorney in the conduct of the trial when the defendant was proceeding <em>pro se.\u2019 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Harris, </em>344 Md. at 501 n. 2, 687 A.2d at 972 n. 2. Accordingly, the trial court explained to the defendant that hybrid representation is not a recognized type of representation in Maryland, given that \u201c \u2018there are only two types of representation constitutionally guaranteed\u2014representation by counsel and representation <em>pro </em>se\u2014and they are mutually exclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 265, 523 A.2d at 599). While the defendant \u201cpersisted in his intention to discharge counsel,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>344 Md. at 501, 687 A.2d at 972, he also requested the trial court to \u201cappoint standby counsel\u2014\u2018someone who would sit with him, provide him legal advice,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 501-02, 687 A.2d at 972, although the defendant, himself, \u201c \u2018would drive the case,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 502, 687 A.2d at 972, and \u201c \u2018determine what [is] to be done.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to provide the defendant standby counsel, the trial court made a finding that \u201cKoenig\u2019s \u2018motion to discharge counsel is freely, voluntarily and understandingly made\u2019 and that he \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019 elected to represent himself, \u201cwith the assistance of standby counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court then \u201cissued an order striking counsel\u2019s appearance as counsel for Koenig, but directing OPD to provide standby counsel for Koenig.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In order for a lawyer, who once represented the defendant, to serve as his or her standby counsel, the trial court must first discharge the lawyer as counsel. Once discharged, the lawyer is no longer the defendant\u2019s attorney; the lawyer remains in the case only for the purpose of assisting the defendant as he or she needs it. <em>Parren </em>and its progeny make clear that, when a defendant has been afforded the opportunity to have standby counsel, the defendant remains the \u201ccaptain of the ship.\u201d <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 264, 523 A.2d at 599. Given this Court\u2019s firm and consistent stance that \u201cthe right to counsel and the right to defend <em>pro se </em>cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>asserted simultaneously,\u201d <em>id,., </em>counsel\u2019s discharge is a prerequisite to the lawyer later serving as standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Here, Anderson was discharged. The trial court then asked the petitioner if he \u201cwould ... like\u201d Anderson to \u201cstay ... sit next to [him] at the trial table to be on call if [the petitioner] need[ed] [Anderson\u2019s] help during the trial.\u201d The petitioner maintained that he wanted to discharge Anderson, stating: \u201cIs there any kind of way I can discharge him from representing me?\u201d After the trial court assured him that he could, but made clear to the petitioner that the trial would continue, and he would have to represent himself, the petitioner acquiesced and permitted Anderson to serve as standby counsel, stating \u201c[Anderson] can sit there.\u201d The Court responded: \u201cOkay. Thank you. Go ahead.\u201d As indicated, and as we have seen, the docket entries support the discharge, with Anderson as stand-by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">It is true that, immediately upon discharging counsel, Anderson assumed control of the case and the petitioner did not object. That the petitioner may have permitted counsel to seize control has relevance with regard to the petitioner\u2019s right, subsequently, to complain about the decisions counsel may have made in his behalf; it has absolutely no relevance on the issue of whether the trial court failed to meet its responsibility to comply with the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judge HARRELL joins in the views expressed in Part I of this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-5\">.

This is intended to be a different rationale and assertion than offered by the State. Under the State\u2019s argument, there necessarily was an implied assertion that the call was properly placed, that it was intended for the petitioner, who, it also implies, in answer to the request, would supply the cocaine. The same implied assertions must be indulged under the majority\u2019s approach however much it may wish that they did not apply. That a call was placed to a cell phone possessed by a person has resonance only if the person in possession of the phone was the intended recipient of the call and, further, be the source of the drugs requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\">.

Morgan, <em>A Suggested Classification of Utterances Admissible as Res Gestae, </em>31 Yale LJ. 229, 229 (1922). In an attempt to classify the subsets under the umbrella term, <em>res gestae, </em>Professor Morgan identified seven classes of cases which fell under <em>res gestae. </em>They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">1. Words that constitute an operative fact,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">2. Words used as circumstantial evidence of an operative fact,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-13\">3.

Utterance that is contemporaneous with a non-verbal act which sheds light or gives meaning to the event, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">7. State of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\"><em>See </em>Edmund M. Morgan, <em>Res Gestae, </em>12 Wash. L.Rev. 91, 91-100 (1937); Morgan, <em>A Suggested Classification of Utterances Admissible as Res Gestae, </em>31 Yale. L.J. at 231-38. Cognizant of the complexities involving hearsay and citing to Morgan\u2019s formulation, courts began to move away from the all-encompassing term <em>res gestae. </em>Instead of relying on <em>res gestae, </em>the term was replaced by the actual rule or rules applicable to the utterance. Although the majority, makes general references to verbal acts without specificity, it is important, especially in the hearsay matrix, to be as clear and as exact as possible. With that in mind, verbal acts, as referred to by the majority likely refers to number three (3) of Morgan's classifications. In this class, non-verbal acts are given meaning by the admission of the verbal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">. Similarly the anonymous call at issue here did not identify the defendant by name or explain any ongoing or future action. There is, in fact, absolutely nothing about this call that would differentiate it from a wrong number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">. Additionally, the <em>Banks v. Florida </em>court, notes that when a statement does not \"explain the nature of the act or transaction, but rather ... implicate[s]\u201d the defendant, it is not a verbal act. 790 So.2d 1094, 1098 (Fla.2001). This is consistent with both <em>Courtney v. State, </em>187 Md. 1, 6, 48 A.2d 430, 432 (1946), and <em>Little v. State, </em>which pointed out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the \u201cstatement did not purport ... to implicate\u201d the defendant \"directly in the transaction.\u201d 204 Md. 518, 523, 105 A.2d 501, 503 (1954).

Notably, one of the reasons the <em>Stoddard </em>Court ruled the way it did was Jasmine\u2019s unreliability as a witness; she was unable to testify and \"particularly in light of Jasmine\u2019s age.\u201d <em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 711, 887 A.2d at 582. Although concerns about the declarant's age have not been raised, as mentioned above the declarant is unknown. Less information about the declarant in this case is known than was not known by the <em>Stoddard </em>Court about Jasmine, the declarant in that case. What is clear is that the jury had no background information about the declarant, no evidence to suggest or confirm that he called the right number, no reason to speculate as to the declarant\u2019s mental fitness to \"remember ... past events\" or more important, no evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>which to conclude that the declarant \"spoke[] seriously and not in play.\u201d <em>See Id. </em>at 711-12, 887 A.2d at 582.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\">. Maiyland Rule 4-215(e) contemplates that counsel may be discharged whether or not the defendant has a meritorious reason for doing so. There is a price to pay for discharging counsel without a meritorious reason: there will be no continuance of the trial and the defendant will, therefore, be required to go to trial unrepresented; he or she would have to represent him or herself. If there is a meritorious reason to discharge counsel, the court is required to continue the case. The Rule then provides: \"If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-215(e). It is this provision that is at issue. There may be some interesting issues with respect to how this provision applies when the discharge of counsel is for a non-meritorious reason; however, we do not reach them in this case, as the only issue decided, and even argued, was whether counsel was discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">.
