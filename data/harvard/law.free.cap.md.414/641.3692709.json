Vol., 2006 Supp.). Although Harriette Julian, the Petitioner and alleged foreclosure rescue scam victim, failed to file a supersedeas bond<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to stay the ratification by the Circuit Court for Charles County of a foreclosure sale of a property in which she had been in the chain of title, her appeal is not moot. In reaching the merits of her appeal, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>that her conveyance in that chain of title would be voidable if the proof adduced during a hearing on her exceptions warranted that action, and that the Circuit Court erred in overruling her exceptions to the foreclosure sale during an earlier hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">When facing foreclosure of her Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland, home as a result of her delinquency on a mortgage with AMC Mortgage Services, Inc., Harriette Julian became embroiled in an alleged foreclosure rescue scam perpetrated by Metropolitan Money Store, whereby she conveyed the property in fee simple to a LaShawn Wilson, who procured from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., an Adjustable Rate Mortgage in the amount of $482,000, which was secured by a Purchase Money Deed of Trust on the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">At settlement, Ms. Julian signed numerous documents, including a HUD-1 listing her as the Seller and Ms. Wilson as the Buyer, a \u201cFee Sheet\u201d outlining the disbursements under the \u201cForeclosure Reversal Program,\u201d as well as a document granting a Power of Attorney to Fordham &amp; Fordham Investment Group in order to complete the sale, but also to allegedly open a mortgage escrow account in her name. According to the Power of Attorney and the Fee Sheet, Fordham <em>&amp; </em>Ford-ham was to place the equity from the sale of the property into a mortgage account from which Wells Fargo would be paid monthly for the mortgage in the amount of $4,201.66 per month for twelve months. At the bottom of the \u201cFee Sheet\u201d signed by Ms. Julian, the document did not provide notice of Ms. Julian\u2019s right to rescind, and in fact, provided notice that she could <em>not </em>rescind the transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">BY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT YOU ARE STATE-ING [sic] YOU UNDERSTAND THE ABOVE STATEMENT AS IT READS AND YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN NOT RESEND [sic] THIS LOAN AFTER TODAY DECEMBER 18 2006[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">According to the HUD-1, Ms. Julian not only received $81,650.87 at the settlement table, but she was relieved of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>obligation under her original mortgage with AMC in the amount of $379,948.92; the Fee Sheet contradicted the HUD-1, and listed a $95,628.87 disbursement to Ms. Julian, with $50,419.92 being placed in escrow, $20,134.17 being applied to closing costs, $10,000 being paid to Fordham &amp; Fordham, $10,000 being paid to an \u201cInvestor,\u201d and $5,074.78 being paid to Ms. Julian. Ms. Julian believed the \u201cInvestor\u201d was Ms. Wilson, the putative purchaser of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Approximately one month after settlement, Wells Fargo assigned the loan to U.S. Bank, as trustee for Citigroup Trust, but Wells Fargo continued to service the loan. Approximately six months after settlement, in June of 2007, the Deed of Trust was recorded among the land records of Charles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">No payments were ever made on the Note, and Wells Fargo, as servicer of the loan, directed the substitute trustees, Joseph V. Buonassissi, II, Richard E. Henning, Jr., Richard A. Lash, Keith M. Yacko, and Brian S. McNair, to pursue a foreclosure action against the Waldorf property and Ms. Wilson under the name of the current note holder, U.S. Bank, which was done on August 27, 2007, in the Circuit Court for Charles County, as <em>Joseph Buonassissi, et al. v. LaShawn Wilson.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the same day, Ms. Julian filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for recording among the land records of Charles County a \u201cNotice of Revocation of Power of Attorney and Rescission and Cancellation of Foreclosure Consultant Contract and Foreclosure Reconveyance Deed\u201d (\u201cNotice of Rescission\u201d), putatively under the Protection of Homeowners in Foreclosure Act, Sections 7-301 to 7-321 of the Real Property Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl. Vol., 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Supp.) (PHIFA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Julian\u2019s Notice of Rescission recited that Ms. Wilson was a \u201cforeclosure consultant\u201d and/or \u201cforeclosure purchaser,\u201d the property was a \u201cresidence in foreclosure,\u201d the Deed of Trust was a \u201cforeclosure reconveyance,\u201d and because Ms. Wilson failed to provide the disclosures and notices required by PHIFA, Ms. Julian had the absolute right to rescind or cancel any foreclosure reconveyance for a period of three business days after Ms. Wilson had complied with the disclosure notices required by PHIFA. Ms. Julian alleged that because of the failure of notice required by PHIFA, she had the right to revoke, rescind, and cancel all documents she had signed, including any powers of attorney, all foreclosure consulting contracts, and the Deed of Trust or any reconveyance by Ms. Julian to Ms. Wilson or her agents, successors, or assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The substitute trustees, however, did not discover, and could not have discovered, the Notice of Rescission when they performed a title search at the beginning of August. They did, however, publish notice of the public sale, and mail a letter to Ms. Julian\u2019s home, addressed to \u201cTenant(s)\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">It is my understanding that you may have an interest in the Trustee\u2019s sale of the above-referenced property. I enclose herewith a copy of the notice of a Trustee\u2019s sale concerning the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Thereafter, the Trustees did discover Ms. Julian\u2019s Notice of Rescission during a final title search, days before the public sale to be held on September 20, 2007. At the sale, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>substitute trustees, on behalf of U.S. Bank, purchased the property for $480,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">A notice that the sale of the property would be ratified and confirmed, unless cause to the contrary was shown, was issued by the Circuit Court, and Ms. Julian filed a Motion to Intervene, which was granted by a Circuit Court judge. Ms. Julian then filed Exceptions to the Sale in which she alleged that because the \u201cagents\u201d of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank perpetrated the scheme to illegally acquire Ms. Julian\u2019s property, the sale must be set aside based upon the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">Because of the scheme perpetrated by the agents of the Plaintiffs <em>(ie., </em>Tomlin, Regional Title and Escrow, and the Metropolitan Money Store) in helping Defendant Wilson to illegally acquire the Property from Ms. Julian\u2019s equity and interests in the Property, the Plaintiff banks cannot now come before this Court seeking its aid. The Court of Appeals has said unequivocally that this Court cannot help lenders with unclean hands and in this case, because of the acts of its agents in the transactions, the Plaintiffs cannot claim clean hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Ms. Julian then claimed that the Deed of Trust was void <em>ab initio </em>because it was obtained in violation of PHIFA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">In the present case, it is clear that Defendant Wilson and her affiliates and agents (who also acted on behalf of the Plaintiffs) acted as both a Foreclosure Consultant and Foreclosure Purchaser under PHIFA. Defendant Wilson is clearly a foreclosure purchaser, as [s]he obtained title to Ms. Julian\u2019[s] home while that home was in foreclosure, as the result of a reconveyance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Defendant Wilson obtained an <em>illegal </em>interest in Ms. Julian\u2019s property that clearly violates the public policy of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">Here, Ms. Julian properly rescinded her transfer of title to Defendant Wilson on August 27, 2007. The rescission document was then recorded in the land records of Charles County, Maryland. This document clearly sets forth that the transaction being rescinded falls under PHIFA. Upon this rescission, title to the Property was in the name of Ms. Julian, and the deed to Defendant Wilson was rendered void <em>ab initio.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">(Alterations added and citations omitted). She further alleged that Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank had been on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d that a foreclosure scam was being effectuated so that the sale to Ms. Wilson was not <em>bona fide:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">[Wells Fargo\u2019s] agents were also affiliates or agents of Defendant Wilson in the foreclosure scheme. [Wells Fargo was] therefore on notice of the foreclosure rescue scheme when it extended the mortgages to Defendant Wilson, making it clearly non-bona fide. Therefore, it could not transfer an interest to [U.S. Bank] here which was greater than it had, and which was subject to rescission by Ms. Julian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">[Wells Fargo was] also on notice due to the foreclosure proceeding that had been docketed against the Property, due to a lease agreement[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] for Ms. Julian to remain in the Property post-sale, and due to other facts. [Wells Fargo\u2019s] settlement agent, whose knowledge is imputed to [U.S. Bank], also had knowledge of various irregularities in the transaction that, at the very least, put it on notice and required investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Moreover, Ms. Julian had a <em>lis pendens </em>on the Property beginning from the filing of the original class action lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>in the Circuit Court [for] Prince George\u2019s County and the current suit pending in federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">(Alterations and footnote added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She then claimed that because she was neither joined as a required party to the foreclosure action nor \u201cproperly\u201d notified of the foreclosure action, the suit must be dismissed because the foreclosure sale was improper and irregular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">[T]he disposition of this action would most certainly \u201cimpair or impede\u201d Ms. Julian\u2019[s] claimed interest in the Property, which is the only subject of this action. Ms. Julian recorded a rescission of any transfer of her deed, filed a lawsuit on the subject, among other things, to occupy the Property and retain possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Ms. Julian is the record owner of the Property, and therefore, should have been timely and appropriately notified of these proceedings and she was not. Ms. Julian rescinded any transfer of the deed to the Property under the PHIFA statute and recorded that rescission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">She finally argued that as a result of U.S. Bank\u2019s failure to join or notify her of the foreclosure sale, her due process rights were violated, and she did not have an opportunity to exercise her right of redemption before the sale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">Ms. Julian did not have an opportunity to defend [her] home from being foreclosed upon and sold at auction. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Julian had no knowledge of the foreclosure sale details until after the sale occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">(Alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The substitute trustees filed an opposition claiming that Ms. Julian\u2019s claims were insufficient to meet her burden of proof. They alleged there were no defects in the manner of sale of the property, and arguments to the contrary were merely \u201cacademic,\u201d because Ms. Julian received notice of the sale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeAc\">Because [Ms. Julian] alleges that she occupied the Property per an under-the-table \u201csale-leaseback\u201d transaction, by her own admission, she could not escape receiving notice directed to the property. [The substitute trustees] gave notice addressed not only to [Ms. Wilson], but to the Property, and if, as alleged, [Ms. Julian] occupied the Property, then she received notice. [The substitute trustees] sent notice by both certified mail and first class mail. Although the certified letters were unclaimed despite being left at the premises, the sending, and even delivery, of the regular mail notices is presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">(Alterations added and citations omitted). The substitute trustees claimed that Ms. Julian lacked standing to raise exceptions, but even if she had standing, her exceptions were limited to those addressing alleged defects in the manner of the sale, and \u201c[o]ther than the fabricated claim of lack of notice, [she] has not presented any valid exceptions, and therefore the sale must be ratified.\u201d The substitute trustees then argued that if the sale were not ratified, Ms. Julian must file a bond:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">A bond is necessary because Wells Fargo lent $482,000 of the purchase money for Defendant Wilson to acquire the Property, of which $879,948.92 was used to pay off [Ms. Julian\u2019s] prior deed of trust, and $81,650.87 was reported as paid to [Ms. Julian] on the HUD-1 she signed. Thus, while Wells Fargo has ongoing losses due to its loan not being paid, [Ms. Julian]\u2014by her own allegations\u2014continues to occupy the property for free. [Ms. Julian] is not paying Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage; she is not making any payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>on the prior deed of trust that was paid off at settlement using funds originating from Wells Fargo. Nor is [Ms. Julian] paying rent under the alleged \u201csale-leaseback.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">(Alterations added). The substitute trustees further alleged that Ms. Julian\u2019s Notice of Rescission did not affect Wells Fargo\u2019s rights under the previously recorded Deed of Trust, because her \u201crescission is not alleged to have been given prior to the Defendant Wilson\u2019s conveyance of the Deed of Trust.\u201d Furthermore, they argued that there was no <em>Us pendens </em>because the \u201clawsuit was initiated after Wells Fargo loaned funds to Defendant Wilson and obtained its interest under the Deed of Trust. In any event, a class action lawsuit that does not name the lender or trustee as a party to the lawsuit cannot serve as the basis of a <em>lis pendens.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The substitute trustees then turned to PHIFA and claimed that because its provisions \u201cdo not apply to a national bank, such as Wells Fargo,\u201d that it \u201ccannot serve as the basis to invalidate its interest in the deed of trust on the subject property.\u201d The substitute trustees next contended that even if they were subject to PHIFA, Ms. Julian \u201c[was] not entitled to rescind the transaction because she [had] not returned the purchase money and accrued interest,\u201d and then claimed that her failure to perfect her rescission by failing to return the money together with <em>8% </em>interest within sixty days, resulted in a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">They also subsequently argued that Wells Fargo was a <em>bona fide </em>lender for value, U.S. Bank was a <em>bona fide </em>assignee for value, and Ms. Julian did not allege \u201cany facts suggesting that Wells Fargo [had] actual knowledge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">There are no facts alleged suggesting that Wells Fargo is anything but a bona-fide lender for value without notice of any defect in its grantor\u2019s title. Had Wells Fargo any knowledge or facts of such nature, it would not have lent $482,000 to Defendant Wilson. Moreover, even if [Ms. Julian\u2019s] claims regarding the other parties are true, equity should not allow [Ms. Julian] to now attack Wells Fargo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>interest after she actively participated in deceiving Wells Fargo into making a $482,000 loan to Defendant Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">Additionally, regardless of Wells Fargo\u2019s status as a bonafide lender, [U.S. Bank] itself is a bona fide assignee for value, without notice of the supposed consulting arrangements between [Ms. Julian] and Defendant Wilson, and therefore takes its security interest free from the equities claimed by [Ms. Julian].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">(Alterations added). The substitute trustees further alleged that no agency relationship existed, but if it did, it would have been between Metropolitan Money Store and Ms. Wilson and/or Ms. Julian, and not Wells Fargo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">Wells Fargo\u2019s dealings were limited to providing a loan to Defendant Wilson. Wells Fargo had no interaction with [Ms. Julian] and had no need for any interaction with [Ms. Julian].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">Moreover, Metropolitan Money Store (\u201cMMS\u201d) has no exclusive relationship with Wells Fargo and worked on behalf of Defendant Wilson to find her a loan, and could at most be an agent or independent contractor of Defendant Wilson. Interestingly, to the extent that [Ms. Julian] claims that she too engaged MM S to avoid foreclosure under her prior deed of trust, MMS may even be her agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">Here, neither MMS, [Regional Title and Escrow (\u201cRTE\u201d) ], nor any other party was subject to Wells Fargo\u2019s right of control, or had the requisite power or duty. Neither MMS or RTE had any power or authority to alter the terms of the loan between Wells Fargo and Defendant Wilson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">(Alterations added and citations omitted). Furthermore, the substitute trustees argued that Regional Title and Escrow acted as an escrow, not an agent of any party, but even if there were an agency relationship, the adverse actions of Metropolitan Money Store and Regional Title and Escrow could not be imputed to Wells Fargo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>[B]ecause the alleged interests of MMS and RTE in the alleged \u201cunder-the-table\u201d deal would be directly adverse to Wells Fargo\u2019s interest, knowledge of the \u201cunder-the-table\u201d deal cannot be attributed to Wells Fargo\u2014even if they were an agent. Nor would such transaction be within the scope of the alleged agency____Wells Fargo would not knowingly expose itself to a $482,000 loan if it knew of any impropriety in the deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">[Ms. Julian\u2019s] allegations rely on MMS and RTE deceiving Wells Fargo into making a loan. [Ms. Julian\u2019s] allegation that RTE Title falsely prepared the HUD-1 statement relies on RTE deceiving the lender to cover-up the \u201cunder-the-table\u201d dealings\u2014dealings which [Ms. Julian] is a participant\u2014and deceiving Wells Fargo into loaning $482,000.... No respectable lender, such as Wells Fargo, would make a loan knowing that their security interest was in dispute or doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">(Alterations added and citations omitted). The substitute trustees also argued that Ms. Julian\u2019s allegations of equity stripping and an \u201cunder-the-table\u201d transaction did not involve Wells Fargo, because \u201ceven if ... the \u2018over-the-table\u2019 documents were inaccurate, those documents were relied upon by Wells Fargo in lending the $482,000, and Wells Fargo was statutorily required to deliver the settlement funds to the parties\u2019 closing agent....\u201d Moreover, the substitute trustees claimed that the mortgage could not be invalidated because Wells Fargo was not a party to any fraud, and \u201ceven if [Ms. Wilson] obtained title through fraudulent conduct, Maryland law recognizes the validity of an instrument given to a lender.\u201d (Alterations added). Finally, they contended that the class action lawsuit tiled in federal district court against Metropolitan Money Store and others, did not include Wells Fargo or any other lender as a defendant, and Ms. Julian\u2019s counsel \u201ctruly know[s] that they have no claim against Wells Fargo....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>A hearing on the exceptions to the ratification of the sale was held in the Circuit Court for Charles County in January of 2008, during which Ms. Julian testified. She explained that several months after the closing on her home, she received a note placed inside the storm door of her home from Wells Fargo, but when she contacted the Bank, no one would speak with her because only Ms. Wilson\u2019s name was on the Promissory Note. Ms. Julian testified that she contacted Ms. Wilson, and in March of 2007, together proceeded to place a telephone call to Wells Fargo, during which they were informed that payments were not being made on the Note. Allegedly, as a result of the telephone call, Ms. Wilson received and completed a \u201cfraud packet\u201d and \u201cID Theft Affidavit\u201d forwarded same to Wells Fargo, but no proof of receipt or acknowledgment from Wells Fargo was evidenced. Ms. Julian testified that she and Ms. Wilson also had another conference call with Wells Fargo to figure out \u201csome kind of payment arrangements,\u201d but no arrangements were forthcoming, because Ms. Wilson did not have sufficient financial income.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Ms. Julian\u2019s next witness, David Schickner, an investigator from the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, testified that he spoke to Ms. Julian during the course of an investigation of Metropolitan Money Store, but that he did not have personal knowledge of any relationship\u2014collusive or otherwise\u2014between Wells Fargo and Regional Title and Escrow, the settlement agent. Ms. Julian\u2019s final witness, Brian Terlinsky, an attorney from the trustees\u2019 law firm, Buonassissi, Henning &amp; Lash, testified that his office received the foreclosure matter from the servicer of Ms. Wilson\u2019s loan, Wells Fargo, who directed the substitute trustees to pursue foreclosure against the Waldorf property and Ms. Wilson under the name of the current noteholder, U.S. Bank. Mr. Terlinsky testified that LaShawn Wilson was the only name listed on the Note, and that his firm did not review the transaction between Ms. Wilson and Ms. Julian. He finally explained that in anticipation of the sale, an initial title search on the property was performed at the beginning of August 2007, and did not find Ms. Julian\u2019s Notice of Rescission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>because it was recorded weeks later on August 27, 2007. He acknowledged that the Notice of Rescission did turn up in a final title search right before the public sale on September 20, 2007, but another notice to Ms. Julian was not given as a result of the discovery because Ms. Julian\u2019s Notice was found among the land records within thirty days of the sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The substitute trustees moved for a directed verdict at the close of Ms. Julian\u2019s case and the trial judge, in granting the directed verdict, reflected that Ms. Julian was \u201cscammed,\u201d but that she did not make a prima facie showing that Wells Fargo was complicit in a fraudulent foreclosure rescue scheme or that there was an agency relationship between Wells Fargo and the perpetrators of the fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">Because in this situation I have not heard evidence that satisfies me even to the point of being able to say well, they made a prima facie showing that the lender itself, Wells Fargo, had an employee who was complicit in the fraud ... we have other people down the line who are assignees for value of whatever they had who were without notice who have some rights in this, too.

The court ratified the trustees\u2019 report of the foreclosure sale and ordered the matter to be referred to the Court Auditor for the \u201cStatement of an Audit.\u201d Ms. Julian appealed to the Court of Special Appeals <em>(Julian </em>I), but did not request a stay of the Circuit Court Ratification Order or file a supersedeas bond as required by Rules 8-422<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 8-423.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The substitute trustees filed a \u201cMotion to Require a Supersedeas Bond or Strike the Appeal\u201d; another judge, without a hearing, ordered a supersedeas bond of $430,000 or \u201csuch amount sufficient to secure that amount pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-423(b)(2),\u201d in order to facilitate any stay of the Order ratifying the sale.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. Julian failed to file the bond, and appealed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>supersedeas bond order as well <em>(Julian II). </em>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court in <em>Julian I, </em>but declined to address the bond issue, which was then pending in that Court, because it had not been briefed. The intermediate appellate court held that violations of PHIFA rendered the deed voidable and not void <em>ab initio. </em>The Court also held that U.S. Bank enjoyed the same protection as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, because Ms. Julian failed to produce any evidence that Metropolitan Money Store, Regional Title and Escrow, or Ms. Wilson were agents of Wells Fargo and/or U.S. Bank or that Wells Fargo or U.S. Bank had sufficient notice to inquire into whether the transaction between Ms. Julian and Ms. Wilson was <em>bona fide. </em>We granted certiorari in <em>Julian I, Julian v.

In <em>Mirjafari v.

Thus, \u201c[t]he law is clear that [mortgagors] may not litigate the validity of the foreclosure at the expense of others; the posting of security is required on [the mortgagor\u2019s] part to protect the purchasers and lenders alike.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">(Alterations and footnote in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The two exceptions to the supersedeas bond requirement are 1) when a mortgagee or its affiliate purchases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>disputed property at the foreclosure sale, and 2) the occasion of unfairness or collusion between the purchaser and the trustee. <em>Baltrotsky, </em>395 Md. at 475, 910 A.2d at 1093; <em>Pizza, </em>345 Md. at 674, 694 A.2d at 98; <em>Leisure Campground, </em>280 Md. at 223, 372 A.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The first exception exists because \u201c \u2018a mortgagee who buys at a foreclosure sale does not free himself from the underlying dispute to which he is a party, and with the land in his hands, there is no reason why he should not be bound by a decision of the court requiring delivery of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pizza, </em>345 Md. at 674, 694 A.2d at 98, quoting <em>Leisure Campground, </em>280 Md. at 223, 372 A.2d at 598. Thereby, the mortgagee who purchases at its own sale does not have the status of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, whose liabilities upon purchase require the filing of a supersedeas bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>Leisure Campground &amp; Country Club Ltd. Partnership v. Leisure Estates, </em>280 Md. 220, 223, 372 A.2d 595, 598 (1977), we relied on <em>Silver v. Benson, </em>227 Md. 553, 177 A.2d 898 (1962), to formulate the mortgagee buy-in exception to the supersedeas bond requirement, and held that a mortgagee who buys in at a foreclosure sale does not have the status of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. This exception was based upon the assumption that a <em>bona fide </em>mortgagee is involved in the underlying proceedings and \u201cstill in court and amenable to court orders,\u201d thereby binding the mortgagee to a decision of the court requiring delivery of the property. <em>Silver, </em>227 Md. at 559, 177 A.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We have yet to address, in reality, whether the assignee <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of an original mortgagee who buys at a foreclosure sale has the status of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser who deserves the protection of a supersedeas bond, or that of a mortgagee who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>buys at its own foreclosure sale, who under the exception articulated in <em>Leisure Campground, </em>does not. It is clear, however, that U.S. Bank, by its nature as the foreclosing party that purchased the property at the foreclosure sale was \u201cstill in court and amenable to court orders,\u201d whether or not it was an assignee or the original mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">U.S. Bank, nevertheless, asserts that as a <em>bona fide </em>assignee, it is entitled to protection as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, conflating purchase with assignment. Ms. Julian, conversely, claims that her Notice of Rescission deprives U.S. Bank of its favored status as a <em>bona fide </em>assignee for value without notice because that notice was filed three weeks prior to the foreclosure sale and months after the assignment to U.S. Bank occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In this regard, it is important to our analysis to recognize that U.S. Bank\u2019s status as a <em>bona fide </em>assignee, however, is distinct and separate from its status as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. As we explained in <em>Wilson Brothers v. Cooey, </em>251 Md. 350, 247 A.2d 395 (1968), an assignee\u2019s status as <em>bona fide </em>for value and without notice is not changed by subsequent events; rather, an assignee\u2019s status is determined at the time of assignment. <em>See also People\u2019s Banking Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>165 Md. 657, 681, 170 A. 544, 554 (1934). In <em>Wilson, </em>Holiday Barn, Inc. (Barn), purchased an unimproved lot and mortgaged the lot by borrowing $110,000 from Colonial Estates, Inc. (Colonial). Consideration was lacking in the Barn-Colonial transaction, but Colonial, nevertheless, assigned the mortgage to Farmers and Mechanics National Bank of Frederick (F and M), which in reliance on the mortgage as well as three other mortgages, and without notice of any defects in the Barn-Colonial transaction, lent money to Colonial. After Colonial defaulted on its loan and Barn defaulted on its mortgage, F and M assigned the Barn\u2019s mortgage to Cooey for foreclosure proceedings. The Barn\u2019s property was sold at a public sale and the sale was ratified, but after ratification, Maryland National Bank and several parties holding mechanics\u2019 liens against the property intervened, claiming proceeds of the foreclosure sale. On appeal, we explained that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>there was no consideration in the transaction between the original mortgagor and the original mortgagee, \u201conce an assignment of a mortgage is made to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value without notice, an entirely different set of rules comes into play.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>251 Md. at 356, 247 A.2d at 399. We then expounded on how F and M, as a <em>bona fide </em>assignee without notice, was afforded greater protection than the original mortgagee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">While a case can be postulated where an assignee, because of notice, of insufficient consideration, or of lack of good faith might wholly or partially lose the protection accorded an innocent assignee for value, the lack of diligence exhibited by Farmers and Mechanics, about which the Lienors complain, is not sufficient to tip the scales. Farmers and Mechanics exercised reasonable prudence, and that is enough. An assignee for value of a mortgage which appears valid on its face, who has no notice of irregularity or reason to suspect it, is chargeable with what appears in the land records but is not to be put to the broader investigative burden customarily shouldered by the mortgagee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 247 A.2d at 400 (emphasis added). In this regard, and importantly for our purpose, F and M\u2019s status as a <em>bona fide </em>assignee for value and without notice was determined <em>at the time </em>of the assignment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, we held that although the Barn\u2019s mortgage was invalid as to Colonial (the original mortgagee) it was valid as to F and M, the assignee. We also noted that, \u201c[e]ven though the mortgage was gotten without consideration by the mortgagee [Colonial] and could, therefore, be set aside by the mortgagee even in the hands of an assignee, yet if the mortgage gets into the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>assignee for value, who has no notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>lack of consideration, it will be good as against creditors of the mortgagee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 247 A.2d at 399 (alterations added). We further noted that, \u201c[a]n assignee for value of a mortgage which appears valid on its face, who has no notice of irregularity or reason to suspect it, is chargeable with what appears in the land records but is not to be put to the broader investigative burden customarily shouldered by the mortgagee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 247 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Although U.S. Bank may have enjoyed <em>bona fide </em>assignee status <em>at the time it took the assignment, </em>a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, in the case of a foreclosure sale, \u201c \u2018is a purchaser who takes the property without notice of defects in the foreclosure sale.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mirjafari, </em>412 Md. at 484 n. 9, 988 A.2d at 1002 n. 9, quoting <em>Baltrotsky, </em>395 Md. at 474-75, 910 A.2d at 1093; <em>see also Pizza, </em>345 at 674, 694 A.2d at 98. Thus, in order for U.S. Bank to be protected by the supersedeas bond rubric, U.S. Bank must have enjoyed <em>bona fide </em>purchaser status <em>at the time it purchased the property </em>at the foreclosure sale, so that it would have had to have no knowledge of any defects in the title or the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In granting the supersedeas bond, the Circuit Court judge, without a hearing, had to have assumed the <em>bonafides </em>of U.S. Bank\u2019s status. This was error. Rather, because U.S. Bank, admittedly, had notice of an alleged defect prior to the foreclosure sale, its <em>bona fide </em>status at the time of the sale was in question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> U.S. Bank, therefore, did not carry its burden to prove entitlement to the supersedeas bond protection, after having filed its motion; as a result, because of the trustees\u2019 knowledge of the Notice, under our jurisprudence, most recently explicated in <em>Mirjafari, </em>the prerequisite for requiring a bond was not met and Ms. Julian\u2019s failure to file a bond does not render her appeal moot. We proceed to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Ms. Julian initially argues that the transfer and recording of the deed of trust, as well as Ms. Wilson\u2019s failure, as the foreclosure purchaser, to provide notice to Ms. Julian of her rescission rights under PHIFA, were statutory violations rendering their agreement under PHIFA and the Deed of Trust void <em>ab initio. </em>In doing so, she relies on a number of cases involving contracts, rather than deeds of trust, for the proposition that violations of PHIFA rendered her deed to Ms. Wilson void from its inception. <em>See Queen v. Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 346, 412 A.2d 733, 735 (1980); <em>Douming Dev. Corp. v. Brazelton, </em>253 Md. 390, 398-400, 252 A.2d 849, 854 (1969); <em>Thorpe v.

Haeffer, </em>53 Md. 187, 190 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">U.S. Bank asserts that, even assuming that Ms. Julian was induced fraudulently to enter into a foreclosure consulting agreement with Metropolitan Money Store and Ms. Wilson, fraudulent inducement renders the instant deed of trust, at most, voidable. U.S. Bank contends that if the Legislature in PHIFA intended to abrogate the common law, it would have done so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The distinction between a transaction being deemed void and voidable is clearly an important one. A void contract \u201cis not a contract at all,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 7 cmt. a (1981), and all parties, present and future, would be equally allowed to avoid the contract. <em>See United States for the Use of the Trane Co. v.

A forged deed, on the other hand, is void <em>ab initio.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A voidable contract, on the other hand, is \u201cone where one or more parties thereto have the power, by a manifestation of election to do so, to avoid the legal relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>created by the contract, or by ratification of the contract to extinguish the power of avoidance.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 7 (1981); <em>see Coopersmith v.

We have long recognized that contracts obtained by fraud are not absolutely void, but are \u201cvoidable at the election of the parties affected by the fraud\u201d and \u201cbinding until properly avoided.\u201d <em>Urner v.

As a result, we have been circumspect at common law<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in finding a deed void <em>ab initio </em>and have limited our rulings regarding voidness to circumstances that go to the face of the deed, <em>e.g., </em>forgery. <em>See Maskell v. Hill, </em>189 Md. 327, 335, 55 A.2d 842, 845 (1947) (holding that a forged deed is a nullity); <em>see also Harding, </em>20 Md.App. at 214, 315 A.2d at 135 (\u201cA forged deed ... is void <em>ab initio\u201d). </em>In <em>Harding, </em>our intermediate appellate court discussed how a forged deed, void from inception, does not protect <em>bona fide </em>purchasers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>[Tjhere can be no <em>bona fide </em>holder of title under a forged deed. A forged deed, unlike one procured by fraud, deceit or trickery is void from its inception. The distinction between a deed obtained by fraud and one that has been forged is readily apparent. In a fraudulent deed an innocent purchaser is protected because the fraud practiced upon the signatory to such a deed is brought into play, at least in part, by some act or omission on the part of the person whom the fraud is perpetrated. He has helped in some degree to set into motion the very fraud about which he later complains. A forged deed, on the other hand, does not necessarily involve any action on the part of the person against whom the forgery is committed. So that if a person has two deeds presented to him, and he thinks he is signing one but in actuality, because of fraud, deceit or trickery he signs the other, a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, without notice is protected. On the other hand, if a person is presented with a deed, and he signs that deed but the deed is thereafter altered <em>e.g. </em>through a change in the description or affixing the signature page to another deed, that is forgery and a subsequent purchaser takes no title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 215, 315 A.2d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">With respect to alleged violations of statutes, we have recognized that not all contracts that transgress in that regard are necessarily void, but are dependent upon legislative intent. <em>See Beard v. American Agency Life Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 235, 254-55, 550 A.2d 677, 686-87 (1988); <em>DeReggi Constr. Co. v.

As we recognized in <em>Lester v. Howard Bank, </em>33 Md. 558, 564 (1871), we examine the statute as a whole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG9\">\u201c[Bjefore the rule can be applied in any case of a statute prohibiting or enjoining things to be done, with a prohibition and a penalty only for doing a thing which it forbids, ... the statute must be examined as a whole to find out whether or not the makers of it meant that a contract in contravention of it should be void, or that it was not so to be. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>words, whatever may be the structure of the statute in respect to prohibition and penalty, or penalty alone, that is not to be taken as granted that the Legislature meant that contracts in contravention of it were to be void, in the sense that they were not to be enforced in a court of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Harris v.

In so doing, we contrasted the language of Section 119 with the \u201cRetail Instalment Sales Act,\u201d then found at Sections 116 to 140 of Article 83, Maryland Code (1951), which, by its provisions, rendered contracts made in contravention of its provisions absolutely void:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">Sec. 135 (Waivers by Buyer.)

Section 10-702(g)(l) required the seller of residential real property to complete and deliver to the purchaser a disclosure or disclaimer statement on or before entering into a contract of sale and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">(g) <em>Effect of failure to deliver a </em>statement.\u2014(1) If the disclosure statement is delivered later than 3 days after the vendor enters into a contract of sale with the purchaser, the contract is <em>void.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">(Emphasis added). In interpreting the meaning of the word \u201cvoid,\u201d we declined to interpret it literally to mean \u201cnull and void.\u201d We stated that to do so, would have permitted the seller to get out of a disadvantageous deal, by choosing to withhold the required disclosure statement. We noted that to define \u201cvoid\u201d literally would be inconsistent with the legislative intent to grant rescission rights to purchasers rather than sellers. In holding that the term \u201cvoid\u201d meant \u201cvoidable at the option of the purchaser,\u201d we concluded that the failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the seller to deliver a disclosure or disclaimer statement as required by the statute did not render the entire residential real estate contract void. <em>Romm, </em>340 Md. at 697-98, 668 A.2d at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Turning to the present context, we note that PHIFA was enacted in 2005 as emergency legislation in order to protect financially distressed homeowners from con artists who would convince the owners to transfer title to their property to \u201cinvestors\u201d and enable the scammer to take the equity in the home or the value of the house less the money owed on it. Sections 7-301 to 7-321 of the Real Property Article originated as Senate Bill 761 and House Bill 1288, and the resulting enactment became effective on October 1 as Chapter 509 of the Maryland Laws of 2005.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The preamble to the statute<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provides that the legislation was intended, in pertinent part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201cFOR the purpose of ... prohibiting foreclosure consultants and foreclosure purchasers from engaging in certain practices; requiring a homeowner to be provided with copies of certain documents; providing that certain provisions in certain documents are void; prohibiting certain documents from being recorded within a certain period;.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Under PHIFA, a \u201cforeclosure purchaser\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is obliged to provide the homeowner with a document entitled \u201cNotice of Right to Cancel Transfer of Deed of Title,\u201d as well as furnish a copy to the homeowner immediately upon execution of any document that includes a foreclosure reconveyance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">(c) <em>Notice of right to cancel </em>transfer.\u2014(1) If a foreclosure reconveyance is included in a foreclosure consulting contract or arranged after the execution of a foreclosure consulting contract, the foreclosure purchaser shall provide the homeowner with a document entitled \u201cNOTICE OF RIGHT TO CANCEL TRANSFER OF DEED OR TITLE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">(d) <em>Same\u2014Copy to </em>homeowner.\u2014The foreclosure purchaser shall provide the homeowner with a copy of the Notice of Right to Cancel Transfer of Deed or Title immediately on execution of any document that includes a foreclosure reconveyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Section 7-310. The language in the statute is absolutely devoid of references regarding whether the dearth of such notice renders the deed void or voidable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">PHIFA also provides homeowners with the right to rescind:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014In addition to any other right under law to cancel or rescind a contract, a homeowner has the right to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">(1) Rescind a foreclosure consulting contract at any time; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">(2) Rescind a foreclosure reconveyance at any time before midnight of the 3rd business day after any conveyance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>transfer in any manner of legal or equitable title to a residence in foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Section 7-305(a). The time period for rescission \u201cdoes not begin to run until the foreclosure purchaser has complied with [Section 7-310],\u201d which includes providing the homeowner with notice of her right to rescind. Section 7-310(e). In addition, PHIFA states that a deed or other document affecting title to the homeowner\u2019s residence may not be recorded during the 3-day rescission period. Section 7-310(k). Again, no language in the statute describes whether noncompliance with these requirements renders the deed void or voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In enacting PHIFA, the Legislature did explicitly state that activities that were violative of certain provisions of the statute were void. The provisions expressly declared void by PHIFA are those that would waive a homeowners\u2019 rights; the provisions, rather than the entire deed, are subject to being declared void. <em>See </em>Sections 7\u2014306(f), 7\u2014310(f), 7-314(f), and 7-318(b).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Ms. Julian, however, contends that the Statute need not contain a \u201ctalismanic phrase specifying that any transaction in violation of the statute is void <em>ab initio,\u201d </em>to render the deed of trust void, and relies on <em>Pagenhardt v. Walsh, </em>250 Md. 333, 243 A.2d 494 (1968), <em>Dryfoos v. Hostetter, </em>268 Md. 396, 302 A.2d 28 (1973), and <em>Ameriquest Mortgage Co. v. Paramount Mortgage Services, Inc., </em>184 Md.App. 120, 964 A.2d 279 (2009), for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In <em>Pagenhardt, </em>we interpreted Section 30 of Article 21, Maryland Code (1957, 1966 Repl. Vol.), requiring affidavits of consideration to import validity to a mortgage or deed of trust, and provided that a mortgage or deed of trust is not valid except as between the parties thereto, unless there was an affidavit regarding consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">No mortgage or deed of trust shall be valid except as between the parties thereto, unless there be endorsed thereon an oath or affirmation of the mortgagee or the party secured by a deed of trust that the consideration recited in said mortgage or deed of trust is true and bona fide as therein set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The affidavit of consideration in question was sufficient and otherwise correct, except the affiant\u2019s name was omitted. We interpreted the explicit statutory language that no deed of trust \u201cshall be valid except as between the parties thereto, unless ...\u201d as meaning that where the affidavit of consideration was deficient in form, as opposed to content, the mortgage was not valid, but was to be given effect as an equitable mortgage as between the parties and those having actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In <em>Dryfoos, </em>the question presented involved a deficient affidavit of disbursement, which completely voided the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>action. Equity was not invoked because of statutory language that had been added by Chapter 718 of the Maryland Laws of 1968, to wit, that a deed of trust was not valid either as between the parties or as to any third parties, unless there was an affidavit regarding disbursement of funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">(b) No purchase money deed of trust involving land any part of which is situated in Maryland, shall be valid either as between the parties or as to any third parties unless such deed of trust contains or has endorsed upon it at a time prior to recordation, the oath or affirmation of the party secured by such deed of trust stating that the amount of the loan which said deed of trust has been given to secure was paid over and disbursed by the party secured by the deed of trust to either the borrower or the person responsible for disbursement of funds in the closing transaction or their respective agent at a time no later than the final and complete execution of the deed of trust, provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where a deed of trust is given to a seller in a transaction in order to secure payment to him of all or part of the purchase price of said property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ash\">Section 80 of Article 21, Maryland Code (1957,1966 Repl. Vol., 1971 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In the present situation, the Legislature has spoken clearly when a provision was to be voided for violation of PHIFA. With respect to the notice of rescission language, the Legislature failed to include a reference to \u201cvoid,\u201d as well as the word \u201cvalid,\u201d which was the term that precipitated the results in <em>Pagenhardt </em>and <em>Dryfoos. </em>In the absence of any language requiring the abrogation of a deed for violation of the notice requirement, we would be loathe to render such deeds void from their inception. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>359 Md. 180, 216, 753 A.2d 84, 103 (2000) (Cathell, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he Legislature is presumed to be aware of the common law as it stands at the time of the enactment and that the law is not intended to change the common law absent an express, specific declaration to do so.\u201d). To declare a deed void because of lack of notice could and would radically alter the protection of all <em>bona fide </em>purchasers in a subsequent chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Our conclusion is consistent with the Courts of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the avowed failure to give the requisite notice of rescission rights may render the deed in question only voidable, and not void. We, though, differ from our intermediate appellate court in our application and result. While the Court of Special Appeals explored the issues surrounding Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank\u2019s acquisition of the mortgage, our emphasis under PHIFA goes to whether U.S. Bank was on notice at the time of the foreclosure sale of a potential defect in the chain of title, as well as whether the rescission notice was sufficient under the statute and whether rescission actually occurred. Because the Circuit Court did not make any findings on these issues and instead focused on whether Wells Fargo had notice at the time it loaned money and whether U.S. Bank had notice at the time it took assignment, we must remand the case for further findings and a determination under PHIFA as to whether the instant deed is voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In remanding this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, Ms. Julian will have the burden of production and persuasion regarding whether her Notice of Rescission was effective, as against U.S. Bank\u2019s interests, under PHIFA, <em>ie., </em>what the filing of her Notice of Rescission in the land records of Charles County put U.S. Bank on notice of, how that notice affected its status as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser or <em>bona fide </em>lender, and whether the notice complied with the proper form as required by PHIFA. ' Should Ms. Julian make a prima facie showing on these matters, the burden of production and persuasion would shift to U.S. Bank to give it the opportunity to prove, unlike what it failed to show as regards the supersedeas bond question, that it nonetheless was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser or <em>bona fide </em>lender for value. In this regard, U.S. Bank must adduce evidence supporting its apparent contentions that PHIFA does not apply to the transaction, that Ms. Julian was not entitled to file her Notice of Rescission under PHIFA, or that Ms. Julian\u2019s problems with the scam transaction should not be visited upon U.S. Bank as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser or <em>bona fide </em>lender for value. Should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>U.S. Bank meet its burden, the case ends, but if U.S. Bank does not carry its burden, the burden of production and persuasion would shift back to Ms. Julian to show that her rescission was valid as against U.S. Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

On the one hand it holds, like the Court of Special Appeals (\u201cCSA\u201d), that U.S. Bank is a bona fide lender for value, as a matter of law. The Majority points to the absence of any evidence that U.S. Bank knew that there was a foreclosure consulting contract in place, within the meaning of PHIFA, when it paid value and took title to the Julian note and deed of trust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the other hand, the Majority departs from the CSA in \u201capplication and result[,]\u201d because it resolves the appeal by focusing not on U.S. Bank\u2019s notice at the time of assignment, but on its notice at the time of the foreclosure sale\u2014of a potential defect in the chain of title created by Julian\u2019s rescission notice. Maj. op. at 677-78, 997 A.2d at 125-26. The Majority therefore vacates and remands because the Circuit Court \u201cdid not make any findings on these issues[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 997 A.2d at 126. In short, the Majority\u2019s opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>means that (i) although at the time it was assigned the note and deed of trust, U.S. Bank was a bona fide lender for value without notice of a foreclosure consulting contract, (ii) it may lose this status when the loan goes into default because of a recently filed notice of rescission. I do not see how these two propositions can be harmonized.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">A bona fide lender or a bona fide purchaser of real property takes free of defects or claims, and it does not lose this status once it is attained. Maintaining land records and adopting the notice system of priorities depends on this principle. Bona fide purchaser and bona fide lender status is defined by statute, Section 3-203 of the Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u00a7 3-203 Subsequent deed; priority of deed first recorded Every recorded deed or other instrument takes effect from its effective date as against the grantee of any deed executed and delivered subsequent to the effective date, unless the grantee of the subsequent deed has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">(1) Accepted delivery of the deed or other instrument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">(i) In good faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(ii) Without constructive notice under \u00a7 3-202; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">(iii) For a good and valuable consideration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">(2) Recorded the deed first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl. VoL, 2006 SuppL), \u00a7 3-203 of the Real Property Article. A mortgage or deed of trust is considered a \u201cdeed\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order of priority set forth in this statute means that, if U.S. Bank is a bona fide lender for value as the majority holds, the Notice of Rescission filed by Julian on August 23, 2007 will have no impact on U.S. Bank\u2019s right to hold the Deed of Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>free and clear of Julian\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is why, unlike the majority, I believe U.S. Bank\u2019s knowledge at the time of the foreclosure sale of Julian\u2019s Notice of Rescission has no bearing on the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Application of the priorities in RP Section 3-203 will determine the nature of the title that U.S. Bank is able to convey to any purchaser at a foreclosure sale. Thus, applying the Majority\u2019s holding that it was a bona fide lender as of the time it paid value for the Note and Deed of Trust, U.S. Bank would have the right to foreclose on default by the borrower and convey \u201call the title which the borrower had in the property at the time of the recording of the mortgage or deed of trust.\u201d RP \u00a7 7-105(a). Accordingly, the majority\u2019s holding about U.S. Bank\u2019s bona fide lender status collides with its mandate that the judgments of the CSA and the Circuit Court be vacated. It makes no difference whether the bank was on notice of a potential defect in the chain of title at the time of the foreclosure sale\u2014Its rights as a bona fide lender or assignee were determined at the time the mortgage was executed. <em>See Wash. Mut. Bank v. Homan, </em>186 Md.App. 372, 397, 974 A.2d 376, 391 (2009) (holding that knowledge at time of taking mortgage is determinative). Thus, U.S. Bank or any third party purchaser acquires title free of any cloud from the Notice of Rescission filed by Julian after the Deed of Trust. <em>Cf. IA Constr. Corp. v. Carney, </em>104 Md.App. 378, 387-89, 656 A.2d 369, 374-75 (1995) (holding that a mechanic\u2019s lien does not take priority over rights acquired by bona fide mortgage lender for value when mortgage recorded before petition for mechanic\u2019s lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">I would vacate the judgment of the CSA, with direction to vacate that of the Circuit Court, but for different reasons. I do not agree that U.S. Bank necessarily acquired bona fide lender status, as a matter of law, based on what we have in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>this record. Hence, I advocate for a remand, but with different instructions to the Circuit Court as to what facts need be determined. My departure from the Majority is based on PHIFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Julian contends that PHIFA significantly restricts when and how a lender may claim bona fide status because the well-publicized statute broadcasted the basic elements of a foreclosure rescue scam and specifies that a lender or its assignee is bona fide only if it takes without knowledge, not of actual fraud in the transaction, but that \u201ca foreclosure consulting contract is in effect____\u201d RP \u00a7 7\u2014311(e). Section 7-311(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">A bona fide purchaser for value or bona fide lender for value who enters into a transaction with a homeowner or a foreclosure purchaser when a foreclosure consulting contract is in effect or during the period when a foreclosure reconveyance may be rescinded, without notice of these facts, receives good title to the property, free and clear of the right of the parties to the foreclosure consulting contract or the right of the homeowner to rescind the foreclosure reconveyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">This language in PHIFA means that if a bona fide lender for value has notice that a foreclosure consulting contract is in effect or that the reconveyance rescission period is in effect, the lender is subject to defenses against the note and mortgage based on PHIFA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In my view, PHIFA elevates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>level of inquiry that a mortgage lender should undertake when it makes a loan, or takes assignment of a note.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Here, we have a bank, Wells Fargo, which made a loan to Wilson in order to finance purchase of a property which had, less than four months earlier, been the subject of a foreclosure proceeding initiated by another bank, Ameriquest, against the then-property owner, Julian. The record reveals that Ameriquest\u2019s foreclosure proceeding was not completed, nor dismissed, at the time of Wells Fargo\u2019s loan and Julian\u2019s conveyance to Wilson. These facts are discernible from the county land records. There is no evidence in this case that Wells Fargo, when it made the mortgage loan, took any steps to verify that Wilson had any income to pay the loan. Indeed, the affidavit of indebtedness filed by the Trustees suggests that Wilson made, at most, one payment on the loan. The record does not reveal the date when U.S. Bank took assignment of the loan, or how much it paid for the loan. There is no evidence as to whether this loan was individually purchased, or assigned to U.S. Bank as part of a bulk transfer of mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In my view, given these facts, both Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank had the obligation, at the least, to make some limited inquiry about whether a loan foreclosure contract was in effect at the time of the Wells Fargo mortgage loan to Wilson. This inquiry might have been satisfied by an affidavit by a closing attorney, or even the new borrower that no foreclosure consultant was involved. Even verification that the new purchaser was living in the home, as the deed of trust required, and could afford the monthly loan payments may have been sufficient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank may have taken these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>steps, but the record does not produce any evidence of that. We do know that the loan went into default almost immediately. The affidavit of indebtedness filed by the substitute trustees in this foreclosure showed that interest was owing from March 1, 2007, 60 days after the date for which interest was pre-paid at settlement. We also know that Wilson reported a fraud to Wells Fargo in March 2007, indicating that the bank had told her that her mortgage loan payment was late, when in fact she had no mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">To prioritize the competing claims of the lenders and Julian, we should start with review of RP Section 7\u2014311(e), and its use of the familiar terms, \u201cbona fide purchaser\u201d and \u201cbona fide lender.\u201d The elements required to prove this status are: \u201c(a) That he [or she] must have given value for the property; (b) that he [or she] must have dealt in good faith with respect to the purchase; and (c) without notice or knowledge of any infirmity in the title of his [or her] vendor.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Banking Co. v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co., </em>165 Md. 657, 664, 170 A. 544, 547 (1934); <em>see also Homan, </em>186 Md.App. at 396, 974 A.2d at 390 (\u201cMaryland cases have treated lenders who secure their interests with a mortgage or deed of trust as entitled to the protections available to bona fide purchasers for value, where such lenders were without notice of the mortgagor\u2019s fraudulent conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">A party claiming the status of a bona fide purchaser or bona fide lender bears the burden of proving that she acted without notice and in good faith. <em>See Albee Tomato, Inc. v. A.B. Shalom Produce Corp., </em>155 F.3d 612, 615 (2d Cir.1998); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Cicero v. Lewco Sec. Corp., </em>860 F.2d 1407, 1411-12 (7th Cir.1988); <em>Gutekunst v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>486 F.2d 194, 195 (2d Cir.1973); <em>Ins. Co. of N. America v. United States, </em>561 F.Supp. 106 (E.D.Pa.1983); <em>Otten v. Marasco, </em>235 F.Supp. 794, 797 (S.D.N.Y.1964), <em>aff'd, </em>353 F.2d 563 (2d Cir.1965); <em>Strand v. Prince-Covey and Co., </em>534 P.2d 892, 894 (Utah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>1975). <em>But see Fid. &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. Key Biscayne Bank, </em>501 F.2d 1322, 1325 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Although sometimes it is said that the party alleging fraud bears the burden to prove it against a bona fide purchaser, this will depend on the circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More importantly, under PHIFA, one need not prove fraud to invoke the protections of the statute\u2014merely having notice of the mortgage consulting contract -will suffice. This Court has not decided the question of who shall bear the burden to show that a lender is a bona fide lender for value within the meaning of PHIFA. I would decide that issue by allocating that burden to the lender because the lender \u201chas readier access to knowledge about the fact in question.\u201d <em>See </em>Fleming James Jr., <em>Burdens of Proof, </em>47 Va. L.Rev. 51, 58-61 (1961). Surely U.S. Bank has readier access to how it acquired the Note and Deed of Trust, and what it knew about Wilson\u2019s transaction with Wells Fargo, than Julian does. Therefore, I conclude, U.S. Bank has the burden to show that it meets the standard for a bona fide lender for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In my view, nothing in the record shows that Wells Fargo made the loan or U.S. Bank took assignment of the deed of trust having made any inquiry, no matter how limited, into any of the following questions: who arranged for the loan, what was the income of the borrower (Ms. Wilson), could the borrower afford the loan payments, was Ms. Wilson living in the house (which the deed of trust requires her to do), why was she purchasing the house, why had the foreclosure action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>against Julian remained open? Without answers to any of these questions, I think we must assume that both Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank placed blinders on, the former in making the loan, and the latter in purchasing it. With the proliferation of mortgage lending scandals and the enactment of PHI-FA, this intentional blindness simply is no longer enough, if it ever was, to meet the good faith element of establishing bona fide lender status. We must bear in mind that foreclosure proceedings are equitable proceedings in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In conclusion, I would vacate the judgement of the CSA, and remand to it, with directions to remand to the Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing, at which U.S. Bank must establish that it stands as a bona fide lender for value, without knowledge of the mortgage consulting contract, any other violation of PHIFA, or any other fraud or irregularity. Either U.S. Bank, or Wells Fargo, who originated the loan, and now services it for U.S. Bank, will possess the best information about the questions that are unanswered on this record. The fact that Wells Fargo, who originated the loan, also now services the loan for U.S. Bank may be of significance in making the determinations on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Judge MURPHY authorizes me to state that he joins in the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">.

I assume that the assignment for value to U.S. Bank took place before Julian filed the Notice of Rescission.

Maj. op. at 648 n. 3, 997 A.2d at 108 n. 3.
