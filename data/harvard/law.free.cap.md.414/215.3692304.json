(Appellee), present us with two questions of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>whether a former employee is entitled to assert a wrongful discharge action under the Health Care Worker Whistleblower Protection Act (1) even if he or she never reported to an external board \u201can activity, policy, or practice of the [former] employer that is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;\u201d and/or (2) the \u201cunlawful acts\u201d that he or she threatened to report were errors committed by fellow employees who did not have the authority to establish the former employer\u2019s \u201cpolicy, or practice.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that (1) the report of unlawful acts to an external board is <em>not </em>a condition precedent to a civil action under the Act, and (2) when a fellow employee\u2019s repeated violation of a law, rule, or regulation is reported to a supervisor, the failure or refusal to correct the violation constitutes a prohibited act of the employer. We shall therefore vacate the summary judgment entered against Appellant and in favor of Appellee, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant filed a three count SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">2. This is an action for: (1) wrongful discharge contrary to and in violation of a clear mandate of public policy[, asserted in Count I], (2) breach of an employment undertaking as set forth in [the] Personnel Manual [of Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>gomery Hospice Inc., Appellee, asserted in Count II], and (3) the violation of the Health Care Worker Whistleblower Protection Act (Sec. 1-501 through 1-505 of the Health Occupation article of the Maryland Code)[, asserted in Count III]. This action is brought by a former employee of [Appellee]. [Appellant] contends that she was fired for actions, reports and disclosures she took in carrying out duties she had under the laws of the State of Maryland as a registered nurse, as well as legal duties she owed to third parties. [Appellant] also contends that she could have been held civilly liable for failure to carry out those duties and could also be subject to discipline by the State Board of Nursing for failure to so act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">12. Consistent with her obligations under [Appellee\u2019s] Personnel Manual, as well as the Maryland statutes and regulations, [Appellant] attempted to bring to her supervisor\u2019s attention, charting that was not consistent with the health and safety of [Appellee\u2019s] clients. In March of 2004, [Appellant] noted that an admission by one of [Appellee\u2019s] RN was not properly documented and was full of errors. [Appellant] made a complaint to [Appellee\u2019s] Director of Admissions. It became apparent that the Director of Admissions sought to defend the failures of the RN. No action was taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">15. More recently and directly leading to [Appellant\u2019s] discharge, on or about January 30, 2007, [Appellant] found that \u201cstarter packs\u201d of medications, including narcotics were being sent out. [Appellant] learned that these \u201cstarter packs\u201d were being entered into every patient\u2019s chart. So many such packs were being sent out that ... the Director of Week-End and Evening Services and [Appellant\u2019s] immediate supervisor, became overwhelmed. [The Director] gave her name and password to her secretary for the issuance of the \u201cstarter packs.\u201d [Appellant], subsequently learned that the \u201cstarter pack\u201d orders, which contained adult narcotic doses, were sent to [Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>lant\u2019s] pediatric patients. [The Director], when confronted by [Appellant], claimed that these \u201cstarter packs\u201d did not actually go out. However, a mother of a patient told [Appellant] the following week that they had received a starter pack at 10:00 p.m. a few nights earlier. [Appellant] learned that such \u201cstarter packs\u201d had been delivered to all pediatric patients, including ones where the family situation is unstable with many children and with little close supervision in the house. It took more than a week to get these \u201cstarter packs\u201d out of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">18. In addition, [Appellant] had during the period from September 2006 to April 2007, complained to management about acts that she understood were inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of registered nursing practice and threatened the health and safety of third parties. This included:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">a) Narcotic being sent out to individuals who were not hospice patients;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">b) Improper documentation of narcotic drugs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">c) Treatment with narcotics provided to patients without a physician\u2019s order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">d) Treatment of patients without signatures on initial \u201cstart of care\u201d orders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">e) Treatment of patients without current legal orders or with expired orders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">f) Failure of supervisors to follow-up on documentation deficits or on missing medical orders and documentations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">g) Failure to initiate safety precautions with a patient that had a high risk of hemorrhage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">19. E-mails concerning the above were sent by [Appellant] to Management, including [Appellee\u2019s] Vice-President of Clinical Services and [Appellant\u2019s] supervisor, in an attempt to comply with her legal and ethical responsibilities. All of these E-mails were on [Appellant\u2019s] assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>computer. On April 13, 2007, [Appellant\u2019s] immediate supervisor, requested that [Appellant] come in for her annual evaluation. On April 14, 2007, [Appellant] accompanied [Appellant\u2019s supervisor] to a conference room where [Appellee\u2019s] Vice-President of Clinical Services and [Appellee\u2019s] Vice-President of Medical services, were already present. [Appellee\u2019s Vice-President of Clinical Services] immediately handed [Appellant] a memo dated April 14, 2007 charging [Appellant] with alleged \u201cpractices [that] are frequently outside the acceptable and safe standards of nursing practice.\u201d The memo concluded with the statement: \u201cEffective Immediately: Sue EynonLark\u2019s employment with Montgomery Hospice is terminated.\u201d [Appellant] contends the statements were unfounded and was not the real reason for her discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">21. [Appellant] had a legal duty to disclose to her supervisors, (including those in management who had authority to take corrective action), the violation of the laws, including but not limited to the Health Occupations Article of the Maryland Code, state and federal narcotic laws, and violations of the rules and regulations of the state Board of Nursing, which require [Appellant] to safeguard clients and the public health and safety, when she had knowledge of [Appellee\u2019s] employees[\u2019] incompetent, unethical, or illegal practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">22. [Appellant\u2019s] termination, in fact, followed her recent complaints of several breaches in documentation, lack of clinical supervision and the delivery of medications, including narcotics, by others at Montgomery Hospice. These breaches, failures and acts had been brought to the attention of [Appellant\u2019s] supervisor and discussed with the Medical Director. These instances of errors increased within the last year. Many of these errors would, in fact, constitute \u201ccritical offenses\u201d of such \u201cseriousness that it justifies immediate discharge ...,\u201d yet no one at Montgomery Hospice, to [Appellant\u2019s] knowledge, had been even disciplined for such violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>26. [Appellant] claims that the reason given for her discharge is pretextual and was in fact the result of her complaints to management which were meant to safeguard patients under her care as a registered nurse and for the health and safety of patients which [Appellant] believed were endangered by incompetent, unethical, or illegal practices. [Appellant] claims that she had a duty to bring these matters to the attention of management under Maryland statutory and regulatory law as well as the [Appellee\u2019s] own personnel requirements. Failure of [Appellant] to bring violations to the attention of management could also subject [Appellant] to civil liability and subject her to a suspension of her nursing license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">29. [Appellee] violated a clear mandate of public policy set forth by Maryland statutes and duly adopted administrative regulations, as set forth above, when it terminated [Appellant\u2019s] employment. [Appellant] had the duty to report to her supervisor and to management, acts and practices, which: (1) violated accepted professional standards in the practice of registered nursing; (2) were inconsistent with the health and safety of a person under [Appellant\u2019s] care and/or were [Appellee\u2019s] clients; (3) or affected public health and safety because of [Appellee\u2019s] incompetent, unethical or illegal practices. [Appellant] also had potential personal liability and was subject to disciplinary action from the Board of Nursing had she failed to make such reports and disclosures. For this reason the discharge was wrongful and unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which was accompanied by a Memorandum that included the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">Specifically, Counts I and III of the Second Amended Complaint challenge [Appellant\u2019s] termination from [Appellee\u2019s] employ as a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and Maryland\u2019s Health Care Worker Whistleblower Protection Act, Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7 \u00a7 1-501-1-506 (the \u201cAct\u201d), respectively; however, [Appellant\u2019s] allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tions do not refer to, let alone rely upon any clear mandate of public policy violated by her termination. Moreover, her allegations confirm that she is not entitled to avail herself of the protections of the Act because (1) the wrongdoing she complains of was committed by her fellow employees and not [Appellee]; and (2) she never reported any perceived wrongdoing to the appropriate external board or other authority as required for the Act to apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">Significantly, [Appellant] cannot rely on the only Maryland statute and regulation that could possibly provide a public policy claim on facts such as she has alleged. Nurses do have a duty under both statute and regulation to report violations of certain statutes and regulations governing the conduct of other nurses and hospitals. Md. Health Occupations, \u00a7 8-505; COMAR 10.27.19.02(A)(7). Both Code section 8.505 and COMAR section 10.27.19.02 <em>require, </em>however, that the reports be submitted to the Board of Nursing. <em>Id. </em>[Appellant] does not (and cannot) allege that she made any report to the Board of Nursing, a step that is a necessary prerequisite for any claim of wrongful discharge under Maryland law. <em>See Thompson[ v. Memorial Hosp. at Easton, Maryland, Inc.], </em>925 F.Supp. [400] at 407-08 (holding a plaintiffs conduct must conform to the language of the statute on which he bases his claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy). For these reasons, [Appellant\u2019s] Count I claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy should be dismissed with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">Even if this Court were to determine that [Appellant] may have alleged the type of reporting of wrongdoing that is actionable under the Act, it still should dismiss Count III, because [Appellant] <em>never </em>reported the alleged misconduct at issue to the appropriate board. An employee only receives the protections of section 1-502 if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">(1) The employee has a reasonable, good faith belief that the employer has, or still is, engaged in an activity, policy, or practice that is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(2) The employer\u2019s activity, policy, or practice that is the subject of the employee\u2019s disclosure poses a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety; and (3) <em>Before reporting to the board: </em>(i) The employee has reported the activity, policy, or practice to a supervisor or administrator of the employer in writing and afforded the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct the activity, policy, or practice; or (ii) if the employer has a corporate compliance plan specifying who to notify of an alleged violation of a rule, law, or regulation, the employee has followed the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-503 (emphasis added). Hence, a prerequisite to coverage under the Act is the actual reporting of wrongdoing to the appropriate board, which is defined in the Act as \u201cany board established under [the Health Occupations] article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As written, the statute clearly sets forth what a claimant employee must do prior to reporting the wrongdoing at issue to the appropriate governing board if the employee is to receive the protections of section 1-502. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-503(3). This provision necessarily implies that reporting to the board is a mandatory prerequisite to coverage under the Act. If such external reporting were not necessary, then this particular clause would be stripped of all meaning and be rendered surplusage. \u201c[W]henever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone [Company of Maryland, et al. v. Director of Finance for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore], </em>343 Md. [567] at 579, 683 A.2d [512] at 517 [(1996)]. Since [Appellant] failed to report the activity at issue to a Board, she is not entitled to the protection of the Act and Count III should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">This analysis is entirely consistent with section 1-502 of the Act. As stated above, section 1-502 prevents an employer from taking or refusing \u201cto take any personnel action as reprisal against an employee\u201d because the employee \u201cdiscloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or board.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7 1-502. Section 1-502 clearly contemplates protection for employees who complain about misconduct, but are terminated prior to reporting the wrongdoing to the appropriate board. Section 1-502, however, cannot be read in isolation from the provisions of section 1-503, which acknowledge that an employee ultimately will have reported the wrongdoing to the appropriate board before receiving the protections of section 1-502. <em>Id. </em>Hence, an employer cannot evade the Act\u2019s mandate by terminating a complaining employee who has not yet been able to notify the appropriate board. Nevertheless, where \u201ca substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety\u201d is at stake, the legislature intended to require an employee to report the situation to the appropriate board prior to running to court to file suit. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-503(2). The fact is that the errors [Appellant] alleges she reported were simply not serious or systemic enough in nature for [Appellant] to bother to report to the nursing board. She should not now be heard to complain of them as having posed a serious threat to public safety, nor should she be permitted to maintain a multi-million dollar lawsuit as a \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">During a pre-trial motions hearing, the Circuit Court elected to treat Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, and delivered an on-the-record ruling that included the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">It\u2019s clear ... that [Appellant] at no time threatened [to report] or reported the alleged abuses or infractions to any external board, whether it be a Board of Nursing or whether it be a hospice board, or any governing board that she was employed by, or that would have had supervisory authority over her, or over the hospice, or over the nurses. And clearly, everything she did was internally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">And it\u2019s crystal clear that almost all of the abuses that she alleges were done by other employees, other nurses. And she does make reference to the fact of talking to a supervisor, and indicating something about that this is the policy, or this is the way it\u2019s done. I do draw a distinction here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that that is not the employer, the supervisor, and that\u2019s what I so find in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6W\">There is no allegation that there is a systemic or institutional conduct on the part of the hospice that violates any statute, the litany of abuses deal with things that are done by the employees, such as, narcotics being sent out to individuals who are not hospice patients; improper documents or ... treatment with narcotics provided to patients without physician\u2019s order; and a list of other complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">There\u2019s no indication before she filed her suit, which is really the key point. Did she ever complain to a governing board? She kept that internally, which I think is important, a very important distinction, especially when I look at [HO \u00a7 ]l-502, because it indicates and assume before reporting to the Board, number 3. And that seems to be, to this Court, it\u2019s something that\u2019s not manufactured, it\u2019s not something that I think should be there. It\u2019s something that is there in black and white, and assumes that there is going to be a reporting to another board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">... I find at common law that there\u2019s no ... public policy exception here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">Under the [whistleblower\u2019s] statute, I don\u2019t find that [Appellant] has ... complied with the statute in that there was no threat of reporting to an outside board, nor did she [complain to] an outside board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">I also find that there [were] no ... contractual rights bestowed upon [Appellant] by the manuals of the policies of the hospice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Although the Circuit Court entered summary judgment on all three causes of action asserted in the Complaint, Appellant has limited her appeal to the judgment entered against her on Count III. After Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but before the parties presented their arguments to a panel of that Court, this Court issued a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>certiorari on its own initiative. 403 Md. 612, 943 A.2d 1244 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Because the case at bar is one in which the Circuit Court granted summary judgment, we must determine whether that ruling was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 530-31, 697 A.2d 861, 864 (1997). To make that determination, we must interpret the Health Care Worker Whistle-blower Protection Act (the Act), a \u201cremedial statute\u201d that has been \u201con the books\u201d since 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 987 A.2d 18 (2010), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous.and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 274-76, 987 A.2d at 28-29 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">This Court has also stated that remedial statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of claimants \u201cto suppress the evil and advance the remedy.\u201d <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 495, 914 A.2d 735, 750-51 (2007); <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 544, 860 A.2d 909, 919 (2004); <em>Marsheck v.

Because the Act expressly protects an employee who \u201cthreatens to disclose\u201d as well as an employee who actually discloses, we reject the argument that a report to the Board of Nursing was an essential condition precedent to the action asserted in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">As one commentator has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">Although it would clearly seem to be in employers\u2019 interest to encourage employees to report violations internally before (or instead of) making reports to governmental authorities, a number of courts that have addressed the issue have held that the public policy tort doctrine does not protect a whistleblower from retaliation unless he or she has gone outside the company with reports of wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">The majority (and better) view, however, is that internal protests are enough, and that the viability of a public policy tort claim by a discharged whistleblower does not depend on whether or not the violations or illegal activities were reported to outside authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Paul H. Tobias, <em>Litigating Wrongful Discharge Claims </em>\u00a7 5.13 (1987 &amp; Supp.2009-10) (footnotes omitted). We agree with that observation, which is consistent with the following cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In <em>Appeal of Bio Energy Corp., </em>135 N.H. 517, 607 A.2d 606 (1992), an employee was fired for reporting a violation of state law to her supervisor. \u201cBio Energy[,] argue[d] on appeal that Ms. Baron was not entitled to protection under the Act because she did not report her employer\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct to a third party or governmental authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. While acknowledging that the whistleblower statute at issue \u201cfail[ed] to specify to whom a report of an alleged violation must be made\u201d and that \u201cParagraph II of [the whistleblower statute] contains the requirement ... that in most circumstances the employee must first bring the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>violation to the attention of the employer,\u201d the New Hampshire Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">Bio Energy argues that, when read together, paragraphs I and II of RSA 275-E:2 (Supp.1991) require an employee to report a violation of law to a third party before she is entitled to protection under the Act. We reject that construction as contrary to the manifest purpose of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Paragraph I of RSA 275-E:2 (Supp.1991) does not require that an employee report a potential violation of law to a third party. By its very terms, it covers reports made either to employers or to third parties. Paragraph II of RSA 275-E:2 (Supp.1991) sets forth the mode of compliance with the statute. Specifically, an employee must first notify the employer of any violation before reporting to a higher authority. The requirement that the employee first notify the employer is a significant benefit to employers and furthers the purpose of the Act. Giving the employer the first opportunity to correct a violation allows it to avoid harm to its reputation, the burden of undergoing an investigation, preparation for a hearing, etc. Informal resolution of infractions also saves the DOL both time and resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">We cannot accept Bio Energy\u2019s argument that the legislature intended that paragraph II of the Act require a further report to a third party. Under Bio Energy\u2019s interpretation of the Act, employers would be able to retain the benefit of notification, while avoiding the burdens imposed if the employee were discharged because of his or her notification to the employer. Such an interpretation would thwart the Act\u2019s primary purpose of encouraging employees to report their employers\u2019 violations of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Bio Energy argues that the \u201creport\u201d referred to in paragraph I must be made to someone other than the employer, because paragraph II requires the employee to \u201cfirst\u201d bring the violation to the employer\u2019s attention. Bio Energy contends that there would be no need for the requirement of a \u201cfirst\u201d report to the employer if the statute did not contemplate a further report to a third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>To require a report to a third party or governmental authority where, as here, the initial report results in corrective action is to require the doing of a useless act. Once Bio Energy paid Ms. Baron the disputed wages, she had nothing to report. Had Bio Energy not wrongfully discharged her, the Act would have resulted in the very result that the legislature contemplated, namely a report of a violation by an employee and corrective action by the employer. The interpretation argued by Bio Energy undermines the deterrent effect of the Act; a reading of the statute that required a second report would leave employees such as Ms. Baron unprotected, despite the statute\u2019s clear intent to protect such employees from wrongful discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">* # \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">We construe statutes so as to effectuate their evident purpose. <em>Quality Carpets v. Carter, </em>133 N.H. 887, 889, 587 A.2d 254, 255 (1991). The construction that Bio Energy advances is so inconsistent with the evident purpose of the Act as to render it impotent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">We wish to promote the dual purposes of the Act\u2014to encourage employees to come forward and report violations without fear of losing their jobs and to ensure that as many alleged violations as possible are resolved informally within the workplace. Therefore, we hold that whenever an employee begins the process of complying with the Act, as specified in RSA 275-E:2, II (Supp.1991), he or she is protected under it, whether the violation is cured after notification of the employer, or whether the employee further reports the violation to a higher authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Bio Energy, </em>607A.2d at 608-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In <em>Barker v. State Insurance Fund, </em>40 P.3d 463 (Okla.2001), the Oklahoma Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">First, one of the primary goals of protecting whistle-blowers from retaliatory discharge is to reduce wrongdoing in a speedy, efficacious manner. In that respect, it makes sense to recognize claims of whistle-blowers who report wrongdoing within the employing organization to a person in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>position to investigate and remedy the wrongdoing. Second, internal disclosures are much less disruptive to the company than external disclosures. \u201cLoyal employees, who do not go outside their organizations, should not have less protection than employees who could be considered more disruptive by complaining outside their organizations.\u201d Daniel P. Westman, Whistleblowing: The Law of Retaliatory Discharge, at 114 (1991). Oklahoma law protects both internal and external reporting of whistle-blowers who establish a sufficient public policy violation from retaliatory discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Shea v.

In an opinion released the day after the entry of the Appeals Court memorandum and order in this case, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts correctly anticipated that this court \u201cwould not require the employee to complain outside the organization to claim the public policy exception for whistleblowers in a case like this.\u201d <em>Smith v. Mitre Corp., </em>949 F.Supp. 943, 950 (D.Mass.1997). In that case, the employee had reported fraud and false statements in claims made by the employer as a Federal contractor. A policy that protects an at-will employee who, in good faith, reports criminal conduct in her place of employment to public authorities, but does not protect an at-will employee who in good faith reports such conduct to her superiors would be illogical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\"><em>Shea, </em>682 N.E.2d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">In <em>Sullivan v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>802 F.Supp. 716, 723 (D.Conn.1992), while applying Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>setts law to a plaintiffs claims \u201cthat he was fired because he discovered, disclosed, and complained of defendants\u2019 violations of state and federal law and governing ethical codes with respect to the insider trading of securities,\u201d the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">In view of the expansive and evolving nature of liability for discharge against public policy under Massachusetts law, and the widespread recognition of liability for discharging \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d in other jurisdictions, I conclude that plaintiff may state a claim upon which relief can be granted if he was fired because he \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on illegal practices at Mass. Mutual and Corporate Investors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u00ed\u00a1{ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">With respect to the contention that plaintiffs merely internal complaints were inadequate, I note that in <em>Norris v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty, </em>881 F.2d 1144, 1153 (1st Cir.1989), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, applying Massachusetts law, held that an employer could be liable for the discharge of an employee because of his purely internal complaints of violations of Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations. This rule makes sense. A rule that would permit the employer to fire a whistle-blower with impunity before the employee contacted the authorities would encourage employers promptly to discharge employees who bring complaints to their attention, and would give employees with complaints an incentive to bypass management and go directly to the authorities. This would deprive management of the opportunity to correct oversights straightaway, solve the problem by disciplining errant employees, or clear up a misunderstanding on the part of a whistleblower. The likely result of a contrary rule would be needless public investigations of matters best addressed internally in the first instance. Employers benefit from a system in which the employee reports suspected violations to the employer first; the employee should not, in any event, be penalized for bestowing that benefit on the employer. <em>See Appeal of Bio Energy Corp., </em>607 A.2d at 608-09 (despite language of New Hamp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>shire Whistleblower\u2019s Protection Act requiring employee to report suspected violation to the authorities, the employee is protected from discharge once he makes an internal complaint). I conclude that plaintiffs failure to contact the authorities concerning the alleged violations while he worked at Mass. Mutual does not by itself defeat his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_B\"><em>Id. </em>at 723-25 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The Court of Appeals of Arizona relied on the above-quoted language from <em>Sullivan </em>in rejecting an employer\u2019s argument that the employee\u2019s \u201cfailure to report the company\u2019s activities to outside authorities impairs his claim.\u201d <em>Murcott v. Best Western International, Inc., </em>198 Ariz. 349, 9 P.3d 1088, 1098 (Ct.App.2000). The <em>Murcott </em>Court held that internal complaints deserve the protection under the whistleblower exception to the at-will rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In <em>Collier v. Superior Court, </em>228 Cal.App.3d 1117, 279 Cal.Rptr. 453 (1991), the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (b), which prohibits employer retaliation against an employee who reports a reasonably suspected violation of the law to a government or law enforcement agency, reflects the broad public policy interest in encouraging workplace \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d who may without fear of retaliation report concerns regarding an employer\u2019s illegal conduct. This public policy is the modern day equivalent of the long-established duty of the citizenry to bring to public attention the doings of a lawbreaker. (See Comment, <em>Protecting the Private Sector at Will Employee Who \u201cBlows the Whistle\u201d: A Cause of Action Based Upon Determinants of Public Policy </em>(1977) 1977 Wis. L.Rev. 777.) Even though the statute addresses employee reports to public agencies rather than to the employer and thus does not provide direct protection to petitioner in this case, it does evince a strong public interest in encouraging employee reports of illegal activity in the workplace. (See <em>Verduzco v. General Dynamics, Convair Div. </em>(S.D.Cal.1990) 742 F.Supp. 559, 562.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>If public policy were strictly circumscribed by this statute to provide protection from retaliation only where employees report their reasonable suspicions directly to a public agency, a very practical interest in self preservation could deter employees from taking any action regarding reasonably founded suspicions of criminal conduct by coworkers. Under that circumstance, an employee who reports his or her suspicions to the employer would risk termination or other workplace retaliation. If this employee makes a report directly to a law enforcement agency, the employee would be protected from termination or other retaliation by the employer under Labor Code section 1102.5, but would face an obvious disruption of his or her relationship with the employer, who would be in the unfortunate position of responding to a public agency without first having had an opportunity to deal internally with the suspected problem. These discouraging options would leave the employee with only one truly safe course: do nothing at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">The situation is no better for the responsible employer, who would be deprived of information which may be vital to the lawful operation of the workplace unless and until the employee deems the problem serious enough to warrant a report directly to a law enforcement agency. Clearly, the fundamental public interest in a workplace free from illegal practices would not be served by this result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Collier, </em>279 Cal.Rptr. at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In <em>Marques v. Fitzgerald, </em>99 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1996), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">[W]e take from both <em>[Bechtel Construction Co. v. Labor Sec\u2019y, </em>50 F.3d 926 (11th Cir.1995)] and <em>Bio Energy </em>an important and applicable public policy consideration\u2014that employees should not be discouraged from reporting suspected violations initially to supervisors. We see no significant policy served by extending whistle-blower protection only to those who carry a complaint beyond the institutional wall, denying it to the employee who seeks to improve operations from within the organization. The latter course appears to us as more likely to lead to prompt resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>issues related to suspected violations of laws or regulations. We therefore conclude that a jury permissibly could find the Rhode Island Whistleblowers\u2019 Act applicable to statements made by an employee to a supervisor concerning known or suspected violations of the law. The terms of the statute specifically define a \u201cpublic body\u201d as including \u201c[a] city governing body or any employee thereof.\u201d We do not read this language as covering all municipal employees, such as a co-worker, but as including a superior charged with carrying out the policies and decisions of the city. While the Act does not explicitly address statements to supervisors, as do other states\u2019 whistleblowers\u2019 statutes, the public policy behind these statutes is surely similar: to encourage the prompt reporting and early, amicable resolution of potentially dangerous workplace situations, and to protect those employees who do report such violations from retaliatory action by employers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">We do not, of course, hold that a verdict for Marques is therefore mandated; the jury must decide whether the statements he made fall under a more expansive reading of the statute than that allowed by the district court, and then whether Marques was actually fired as a result of his statements to Barlow. However, we think that the question of whether Marques\u2019 statements bring him within the protection of the Rhode Island Whistleblowers\u2019 Act was one for the jury, and not a proper subject for a directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In <em>Carty v.

District of Columbia], </em>877 F.Supp. [6] at 7-8. We see no convincing reason why the employee\u2019s sticking to standard internal channels for raising an alarm should count against him in this calculus. One might hypothesize that if the whistleblowing is within internal channels, that very fact must mean that the agency has provided for whistleblowing, so that there is no need for judicial interference. But that argument supposes that responses to actual instances of whistleblowing can safely be presumed proper\u2014that an agency that has embraced a whistleblowing regime will rarely if ever try to punish and stifle any legitimate finger-pointing. But the possible reasons for selective permission of whistleblowing seem legion. Alternatively, it might be thought that the divide between internal and external communications may represent a rough cut between mere matters of employee grievance, which are unprotected under <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), and genuine issues of public concern. But that cut seems too rough\u2014many internal office communications, Fox\u2019s included, bear no apparent connection to employee grievances. Accordingly, we are not surprised that our search has yielded no case supporting the idea that a communication made within internal channels is on that account any less likely to be about a matter of public concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><em>Fox, </em>83 F.3d at 1494.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In <em>Babick v.

That was so because \u201c[t]here is no reason that an employe[e]\u2019s protection should depend on whether the employer acts before or after the employe[e] is able to file a complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 n. 5[, 684 P.2d at 23].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"><em>Love, </em>149 P.3d at 206-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Moreover, if an employer (1) corrects the activity that created a substantial danger, and (2) terminates the employment of the \u201cmeddlesome\u201d employee who reported the problem that has been corrected, it would make no sense to impose an external report requirement that would accomplish nothing other than a drain upon the scarce resources of the appropriate board. While Appellee is entitled to support its \u201cpretext\u201d argument with evidence that Appellant has never made a report of the alleged wrongdoing to the Nursing Board, that argument must be presented to the trier-of-fact. We therefore hold that Appellee was not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that Appellant\u2019s lawsuit was not preceded by a complaint to the Nursing Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">While Appellant has the burdens of production and persuasion on the issue of whether any of the violations that she reported to her supervisor actually did pose a <em>substantial and specific danger </em>to the public health or safety, a fact-intensive inquiry is necessary to resolve that issue. Taking the proffered evidence in a light most favorable to Appellant, her employment was terminated in retaliation for her complaint to a \u201csupervisor\u201d in Appellee\u2019s organization about conduct that constituted violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act\u2014a statute that establishes important public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>policy with respect to the dispensation of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">A Health Care Employer has a duty to correct violations that endanger the health and safety of patients to whom that employer owes a duty of care. When such violations are reported to one of its supervisors, a Health Care Employer cannot avoid liability under the Act on the ground that the violations it failed or refused to correct were committed by employees who had no authority to establish the employer\u2019s policy. For that reason, we also hold that Appellee was not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that Appellant\u2019s internal complaints involved conduct by fellow employees who had no authority to establish Appellee\u2019s policy or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">. Because no prior appellate decision has been rendered in the case at bar, the designation of the parties is controlled by Md. Rule 8-111(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\">. The parties do not agree on precisely what questions are presented for our review. According to Appellant, this case presents four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">1. Must a health care worker report or threaten to report unlawful acts to an external board, after first reporting it to the supervisor, in order to be protected by the Health Care Worker Whistleblower Protection Act (the \"Act\u201d)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">2. Does the Health Care Worker Whistleblower Protection Act, when referring to \"an activity, policy, or practice of the employer,\u201d include those acts engaged in by a supervisor or other employee, while carrying out their routine work, as an incident of the duties entrusted to them by the employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">3. Did the trial court err in dismissing [Appellant\u2019s] Complaint in light of the existing record, by finding that she had not complied with all of the requirements of the Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">4. In the alternative, does a health care worker have a viable claim for wrongful discharge, when the termination arises in retaliation for reporting internally to management a violation of state law and/or Board of Nursing regulation, if the employee had a legal duty to report actions which pose a serious health care and safety risk to patients and others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">According to Appellee, this case actually presents three questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">1) Did the trial court err in entering summary judgment against a hospice nurse seeking relief under the Health Care Worker [Whistleblower] Protection Act, because the nurse failed to report externally to an appropriate board her belief that her employer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>engaged in unlawful activity posing a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">2) Did the trial court err in entering summary judgment against a hospice nurse seeking relief under the Health Care Worker [Whistleblower] Protection Act, because the activity, policy, or practice of which the nurse complained consisted of errors committed by co-employees allegedly violating laws, rules, or regulations governing the conduct of those co-employees rather than the employer hospice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">3) Did the trial court err in declining to create a new public policy exception to Maryland's at-will employment doctrine allowing a nurse to sue her employer for wrongful discharge on the basis that she was terminated in retaliation for reporting alleged violations of professional standards, although she never reported or even threatened to report the violations to the Board of Nursing as required by the Maryland laws and regulations that she invokes?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
