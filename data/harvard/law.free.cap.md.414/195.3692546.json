Schlosser Co., should be liable to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee of a subcontractor or whether the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund has to pay the claim. The employee, Jehue Q. Johnson, suffered an accidental injury while working wholly outside of this State in the District of Columbia for Rose Industrial Services, the subcontractor of Schlosser, which had workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage in D.C. but not in Maryland, where Mr. Johnson resided. The gravamen of this case concerns <em>who </em>has the responsibility of paying benefits to Mr. Johnson\u2014Schlosser or the Fund\u2014not <em>whether </em>the compensation should be paid. The issue arises because Mr. Johnson filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Maryland for his accidental injury that occurred solely in the District of Columbia, where Rose only had workers\u2019 compensation coverage; Schlosser had workers\u2019 compensation coverage in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission found the situs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the claim to be the determining factor, when determining that Schlosser was a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Sections 9-101 to- 9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article, Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but not liable to Mr. Johnson, because there would not have been workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction over a claim in Maryland against Schlosser if it had been the direct employer of Mr. Johnson. The Circuit Court affirmed the Commission, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed, basing its decision on public policy concerns, rather than on a situs determination, without deference to the determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. We granted certiorari, <em>Schlosser v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>411 Md. 355, 983 A.2d 431 (2009), to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">1) Was the Circuit Court correct in affirming the Commission\u2019s decision based on Maryland Code, Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-508 and finding no Maryland jurisdiction over the Petitioners?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing the Circuit Court\u2019s granting of the Petitioners\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment by finding that since the Claimant is a covered employee of Rose, he is automatically a covered employee of the alleged statutory employer, Petitioner W.M. Schlosser (hereinafter \u201cSchlosser\u201d)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We shall answer both questions in the affirmative and uphold the Circuit Court\u2019s acceptance of the Commission\u2019s determination that the Fund, not Schlosser, was to pay Johnson his workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In doing so, we defer to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Section 9-508 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing the Circuit Court, because Mr. Johnson, who was injured while working wholly outside of this State in the District of Columbia, would not have been a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, had he been directly employed by Schlosser, rather than through a subcontractor. As a result, the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund is liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable to Mr. Johnson, because Mr. Johnson\u2019s direct employer, Rose, was uninsured in Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACv\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"Akb\">On May 8, 2004, Jehue Q. Johnson was an employee of Rose Industrial Services, a hazardous waste removal company, when he was injured while acting as a hazardous waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>removal technician, at the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant located at 5000 Overlook Avenue, SW, in the District of Columbia. Rose\u2019s work at Blue Plains was being performed pursuant to a subcontract with W.M. Schlosser Co., a Maryland based corporation, which had contracted with Rose to do work solely at the Blue Plains site.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Following his injury, Mr. Johnson filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Johnson\u2019s employer, Rose, carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the District of Columbia,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but not in Maryland, and was, therefore, considered to be an uninsured employer. The Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund defended the claim before the Commission and impleaded Schlosser and its insurer, the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund. Commissioner Lauren A. Sfekas presided over a hearing on November 22, 2005, to determine issues of liability and coverage and thereafter, issued an Award of Compensation, ordering that Mr. Johnson was to receive compensation for his temporary total disability. She also found that Rose had workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the District of Columbia but not Maryland, and was, therefore, a \u201cNon-Insured Employer\u201d in Maryland. She further ruled that Schlosser was Mr. Johnson\u2019s statutory employer, but that Schlosser, nonetheless, was not liable for Mr. Johnson\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">Hearing was held in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland on November 22, 2005 on the following issues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">1) Did the claimant sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">2) Was the claimant engaged in willful misconduct at the time of the alleged accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>3) Is the disability of the claimant the result of an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">4) Does Maryland have jurisdiction in the above claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">5) Is Rose Industrial Services uninsured in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">6) Is W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. the statutory employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">7) Average Weekly Wage?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The Commission finds on the first, second and third issues that the claimant was not engaged in willful misconduct at the time he sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment on May 8, 2004; and that the disability of the claimant is the result of the aforesaid accidental injury; and that the claimant was temporarily and totally disabled from May 8, 2004 to August 23, 2005 inclusive, and additional temporary total disability shall be reserved for future determination. The Commission finds on the fourth issue that Maryland has jurisdiction in the above entitled claim; and finds on the fifth issue that Joanne H. Rose, individually and trading as Rose Industrial Services is uninsured in the State of Maryland. The Commission finds on the sixth issue that W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. is a statutory employer; however it is not liable to the claimant. Section 9-508 of the Labor Article states it is only liable to pay compensation they would have been liable to pay if they were the direct employer. There would be no Maryland jurisdiction over a claim against W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. if it were the direct employer; therefore, W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. cannot be held liable as a statutory employer. Average Weekly Wage-$850.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">It is, therefore, this 18th day of JANUARY, 2006 by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that the above named Non-Insured Employer pay unto Jehue Q. Johnson, claimant, compensation for temporary total disability at the rate of $567.00, payable weekly, beginning May 8, 2004 and ending August 23, 2005 inclusive; and further</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">ORDERED that the Non-Insured Employer pay all casually connected medical expenses incurred by Jehue Q. Johnson, claimant, in accordance with the Medical Fee guide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>It is further ORDERED that the issue of additional temporary total disability, be and the same is hereby RESERVED for future determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">It is further ORDERED that from the final weeks of compensation due and owing the claimant, a counsel fee in the amount of $3815.91 is approved for payment to William J. Blondell, Jr., Chartered, for legal services rendered for the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">In accordance with Section 9-1005 of the Labor Article, the employer, as non-insurer, is assessed the sum of $500.00, plus an additional assessment of 15% of <em>this Award </em>and any subsequent awards of compensation made in this case, such additional assessments not to exceed, however, the sum of $2,500.00, check to be made payable to the Subsequent Injury Fund, 320. E. Towsontown Blvd., Cranston Bldg., Suite 110, Towson, MD 21286-5318. Please list claimant\u2019s name and claim number on check. The assessments of $500.00 shall be paid within 10 days from the date of <em>this Award </em>and any further assessments within 10 days of notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Lauren A.

The Fund sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and later filed a motion for summary judgment with a request for a hearing. Schlosser filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Before holding a hearing, Judge Thomas J. Bollinger denied the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Schlosser\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Upon consideration of the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and all subsequent motions and memoranda filed in opposition and in support of the same, it is on this 30th day of January, 2008, the Uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Employer\u2019s Fund\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">Upon consideration of the Alleged Employer/Alleged Insurer\u2019s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and all subsequent motions and memoranda filed in opposition and in support of the same, it is on this 30th day of January, 2008, the Alleged Employer/Alleged Insurer\u2019s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Accordingly, it is on this 30th day of January, 2008, the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission dated January 18, 2006 is hereby AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">(Emboldened in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On appeal pressed by the Fund, the Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc., </em>186 Md.App. 599, 975 A.2d 221 (2009), reversed, reasoning that the public policy and purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act supported its conclusion that Schlosser was liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because to hold otherwise, would \u201clead[] to the type of speculation and uncertainty the Act was designed to eliminate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 615, 975 A.2d at 230, and remanded the case to the Circuit Court with directions to grant the Fund\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, to deny Schlosser\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and to instruct the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to enter an order consistent with its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Agj\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In a recent case interpreting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Judge Harrell, writing on our behalf, reiterated our oft-cited principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">In interpreting a statute, the overarching objective is to ascertain the legislative intent. <em>Shah v. Howard County, </em>337 Md. 248, 254, 653 A.2d 425, 427 (1995). The primary source from which to determine legislative intent is the plain meaning of the statutory language. <em>Pelican Nat. Bank v. Provident Bank of Maryland, </em>381 Md. 327, 336, 849 A.2d 475, 480 (2004). \u201cWhen the plain meaning is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of the legislation and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry ordinarily is at an end.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998). If, after considering the plain language in its ordinary and common sense meaning, two or more equally plausible interpretations arise, however, then the general purpose, legislative history, and language of the act as a whole is examined in an effort to clarify the ambiguity. <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995). We will \u201cneither add nor delete words in order to give the statute a meaning____\u201d <em>Harris v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 31, 825 A.2d 365, 371 (2003) (citations omitted). Because this case involves the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we also endeavor to interpret its provisions liberally, where possible, in order to effectuate the broad remedial purpose of the statutory scheme. \u00a7 9-102; <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81, 84 (1996) (citing <em>Para v. Richards Group of Wash. Ltd.

Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978). <em>See Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990). A reviewing court \u2018 \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u2019 <em>CBS v. Comptroller, supra, </em>319 Md. at 698, 575 A.2d at 329, quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-835, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). <em>See Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, supra, </em>349 Md. at 569, 709 A.2d at 753 (final agency decisions \u2018are <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cDespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u2018substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u2019 <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, supra, </em>336 Md. at 576-577, 650 A.2d at 230, quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989) (\u2018The interpretation of a statute by those officials charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>administering the statute is ... entitled to weight\u2019). Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected. <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 455, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994) (legislative delegations of authority to administrative agencies will often include the authority to make \u2018significant discretionary policy determinations\u2019); <em>Bd. of Ed.

Section 9-203, titled \u201cSite of employment,\u201d provides geographical limitations for the covered employee definition, by incorporating the language of situs and states that an individual is not a covered employee if \u201cemployed wholly outside of this State\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual is a covered employee while working for the employer of the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(1) in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(2) outside of this State on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis if the employer regularly employs the individual within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(3) wholly outside the United States under a contract of employment made in this State for the work to be done wholly outside of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(b) <em>Incidental service in </em>State.\u2014(1) An individual is not a covered employee while working in this State for an employer only intermittently or temporarily if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(i) the individual and employer make a contract of hire in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">(ii) neither the individual nor the employer is a resident of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">(iii) the employer has provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of another state to cover the individual while working in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(iv) the other state recognizes the extraterritorial provisions of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">(v) the other state similarly exempts covered employees and their employers from its law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">(2) If an individual is exempted from coverage under this subsection and injured in this State while working for the employer of the individual, the sole remedy of the individual is the workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of the state on which the exemption is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">(3) A certificate from an authorized officer of the workers\u2019 compensation commission or similar unit of another state certifying that the employer is insured in that state and has provided extraterritorial insurance coverage for the employees of the employer while working within this State is prima facie evidence that the employer carries that compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">(c) <em>Outside </em>State.\u2014-Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual who is employed wholly outside of this State is not a covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The determination of a \u201ccovered employee\u201d precedes that of a \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d upon which the Fund\u2019s argument relies. The term \u201cstatutory employer\u201d is one used by the Court as early as 1928 in <em>State, to Use of Hubert v. Benjamin F. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 162, 140 A. 52, 53 (1928), to describe the relationship of a principal contractor to an injured employee of its subcontractor, which may expose it to liability under the workers\u2019 compensation statute but insulate it from tort liability. <em>See Rodrigues-Novo v. Recchi America, Inc., </em>381 Md. 49, 58, 846 A.2d 1048, 1053 (2004). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Section 9-508 of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act states that, under certain conditions, a principal contractor is liable to pay a covered employee any compensation the principal contractor would have had to pay had the covered employee been employed directly by the principal contractor and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A principal contractor is liable to pay to a covered employee or the dependents of the covered employee any compensation that the principal contractor would have been liable to pay had the covered employee been employed directly by the principal contractor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">(1) the principal contractor undertakes to perform any work that is part of the business, occupation, or trade of the principal contractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">(2) the principal contractor contracts with a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of all or part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">(3) the covered employee is employed in the execution of that work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In the present case, that Mr. Johnson is a covered employee of Rose is not disputed. Rather, whether Mr. Johnson is a covered employee of Schlosser is the disputed issue. Schlosser, of course, argues that Mr. Johnson could not have been its \u201ccovered employee,\u201d because he was employed wholly outside of the State in the District of Columbia and thus, did not meet the requirement of Section 9-203. The Fund asserts that once Mr. Johnson was determined to be a covered employee of Rose, he was always a covered employee, and thus, Schlosser, as a statutory employer, was liable to the same extent as Rose, pursuant to Section 9-508 of the Act. The Fund contends that Section 9-508 defines the <em>extent </em>of a statutory employer\u2019s liability, rather than including a \u201ccondition precedent to the very <em>existence </em>of the statutory employer\u2019s liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">What is dispositive in the present case is that, \u201cto be a \u2018covered employee\u2019 and therefore eligible to bring, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>maintain, a worker\u2019s compensation claim in this State, a worker must be an employee, \u00a7 9-202(a), and ... \u2018the site of one\u2019s employment is the critical element for\u2019 making that determination.\u201d <em>McElroy Truck Lines, Inc. v. Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 581, 826 A.2d 474, 478 (2003). In <em>Gatton v. Sline Co., Inc., </em>199 Md. 578, 87 A.2d 524 (1952), Gatton was working for Sline, a Maryland company, in West Virginia after having been hired in West Virginia. We held under the precursor to Sections 9-202 and 9-203, where the definition of a covered employee was the same, that an employee who was hired in West Virginia by a Maryland company, but worked exclusively in West Virginia, was not a covered employee, and his widow could not claim benefits under the Act. <em>See also Hodgson v. Flippo Constr. Co., Inc., </em>164 Md.App. 263, 883 A.2d 211 (2005); <em>L.R. Willson &amp; Sons v. Garrett, </em>76 Md.App. 120, 543 A.2d 875 (1988). Thus, the determination of whether an injured employee is covered depends on both the employment relationship and the situs of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">There is no dispute that Rose and Mr. Johnson were engaged in an employer-employee relationship and that Mr. Johnson performed work for Rose in several job sites throughout Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia. The Fund would like us to hold that it does not matter that as to Schlosser, Mr. Johnson worked and was injured wholly outside of Maryland. The Fund, thus, desires to \u201cskip over\u201d the first step in determining coverage, ignore situs restrictions, and determine that Schlosser, as statutory employer, is statutorily liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for one of the subcontractor\u2019s employees, regardless of the fact that as to Schlosser, Mr. Johnson was not a covered employee under the statute. Had Mr. Johnson worked directly for Schlosser, his work would have been \u201cwholly outside of this State\u201d under Section 9-2Q3(c); therefore, he was not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d of Schlosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Fund cites numerous cases for the proposition that a covered employee of a subcontractor is a covered employee of the principal contractor, regardless of situs, but all of its cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>depend upon extant employment relationships in Maryland. <em>See Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 882 A.2d 271 (2005); <em>Rodrigues-Novo v. Recchi America, Inc., </em>381 Md. 49, 846 A.2d 1048 (2004); <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc. v. Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. 573, 697 A.2d 885 (1997); <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Lutter, </em>342 Md. 334, 676 A.2d 51 (1996); <em>Para v. Richards Group of Washington Ltd.

Power Co., </em>309 Md. 445, 524 A.2d 1228 (1987); <em>Honaker v. W.C. and A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>278 Md. 453, 365 A.2d 287 (1976), <em>reaff'd </em>285 Md. 216, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979); <em>Roland v. Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc., </em>221 Md. 11, 155 A.2d 691 (1959); <em>State, to Use of Hubert v. Benjamin F. Bennett Bldg. Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 140 A. 52 (1928); <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v.

Schnaper &amp; Koren Construction Co., </em>14 Md.App. 322, 286 A.2d 819 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Fund also cites <em>Kacur v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co., </em>253 Md. 500, 254 A.2d 156 (1969), as supportive of its contention. In <em>Kacur, </em>an employee was injured in Maryland while employed by a business located in Pennsylvania. The employer\u2019s insurance company denied the claim because its policy limited its coverage to claims in Pennsylvania. We denied the employer\u2019s claim of insulation, because jurisdiction was proper in Maryland where the employee worked and was injured. In the present case, jurisdiction as to Rose was asserted as proper in Maryland and in the District of Columbia, because Mr. Johnson was employed by Rose in Maryland and the District of Columbia where he also was injured. As to Schlosser, Mr. Johnson was not a covered employee, because his employment was wholly outside Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Fund further argues that we should ignore the situs requirements of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in order to further the Act\u2019s benevolent concept and remedial purpose. This argument, however, ignores the fact that the Fund\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>purpose, pursuant to Section 9-1002 of the Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is also benevolent and remedial, that being \u201cto protect injured workers whose employers failed, either willfully or negligently, to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance for them.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Lutter, </em>342 Md. 334, 345, 676 A.2d 51, 56 (1996). Here, again, the issue is not <em>whether </em>Mr. Johnson gets paid, but <em>who </em>is to pay. The Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund cannot deny its own remedial purpose in order to trumpet the remedial purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The Fund contends that our holding in favor of Schlosser would allow statutory employers to evade liability under the Act \u201cwhile also enjoying complete exemption from all tort liability to the injured claimant,\u201d and suggests the application of <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Lutter, </em>342 Md. 334, 676 A.2d 51 (1996), dictates Schlosser\u2019s liability. In <em>Lutter, </em>we held that an owner of a close corporation, who had been injured at a Maryland job site but who had knowingly and deliberately decided to operate the corporation without workers\u2019 compensation insurance, was not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d entitled to collect benefits from the Fund. In the present case, the Fund argues that Schlosser, like Lutter, should not be allowed \u201cto benefit from its own failure to ensure adequate coverage by its subcontractors, and to obtain free workers\u2019 compensation from the Fund....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Lutter, </em>though, is distinguishable from the present case, because Schlosser did <em>attempt to </em>ensure adequate coverage by its subcontractor, by requiring Rose to secure workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>pensation coverage for Mr. Johnson at the job site in the District of Columbia. The Fund asserts that Schlosser had the additional responsibility of requiring Rose to have Maryland workers\u2019 compensation insurance because Mr. Johnson was a Maryland resident. To accept the Fund\u2019s argument would require us to accept that Schlosser was somehow shirking its responsibility in order \u201cto obtain free workers\u2019 compensation from the Fund,\u201d which the Commission did not find. We agree with Schlosser that to hold out-of-state principal contractors liable when they subcontract work with Maryland subcontractors for work to be done wholly outside of this State, would place a heavy burden on principal contractors to verify that its subcontractors have workers\u2019 compensation coverage in every possible jurisdiction in which a direct employee lived, was a resident, was connected, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We also find disingenuous the Fund\u2019s argument that to hold in favor of Schlosser would impose an undue burden on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to decipher \u201ccomplex facts of who is doing what, where, and when.\u201d It was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that interpreted its own statute and it is its burden to find out the facts of \u201cwho is doing what, where, and when\u201d; obviously, the Commission determined it was capable of complying with its own statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Further, we repeatedly have recognized that, under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, a decision regarding situs of employment is dependent on case-specific facts and circumstances, <em>see McElroy Truck Lines, </em>375 Md. at 586, 826 A.2d at 481, and the present situation is no less fact intensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In conclusion, the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund is liable to pay Mr. Johnson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because Rose was uninsured in Maryland. We give deference to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for its interpretation of its own statute and affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT.
