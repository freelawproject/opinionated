Vol.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">This appeal arises from a judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County by which Martin A. Magill, appellee, became entitled to damages based upon a determination of the value of 60,000 conditionally granted unvested incentive stock options, awarded under grant agreements by his former employer, Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc. (Catalyst), formerly known as HealthExtras,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant. Mr. Magill had agreed to remain employed for a specific period of time for the options to vest and become exercisable, but he did not meet that condition before leaving his employment with Catalyst. Catalyst appealed the decision of the Circuit Court, and we granted certiorari, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">1. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that unvested stock options constitute \u201cwages\u201d \u201cpromised for service\u201d under the [Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law] when they were conditionally granted pursuant to an unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>written agreement and the service conditions were not fulfilled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">2. Did the Circuit Court err by rewriting the terms of the parties\u2019 grant agreements in formulating a damages award?[ <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We shall hold that the conditionally granted unvested incentive stock options were not wages under the Wage Act, because Mr. Magill did not fulfill the continued employment service condition, as set forth in the grant agreements to which he had assented.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Martin A. Magill accepted the position of Vice President of Sales for Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc., in February of 2004. The terms of his compensation package included, among other things,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a yearly salary and the right to acquire stock options pursuant to the company\u2019s plan. The terms of Mr. Magill\u2019s recompense were set forth in a letter dated February 11, 2004, from Catalyst\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, David T. Blair, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">3. Compensation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">a. Salary: You shall receive an initial base salary of $135,000 per year and a monthly car allowance of $800.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">b. Stock Options: You will be granted 40,000 options to acquire HealthExtras common stock. The terms of the options are described in the HealthExtras Stock Option Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Mr. Magill executed an \u201cIncentive Stock Option Award Agreement,\u201d dated March 1, 2004, which specified that the award of options was for 40,000 shares of Catalyst\u2019s common stock<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>with an exercise price of $10.47 per share, and provided a vesting schedule setting forth the continued service condition of the grant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">Vesting Schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Subject to the limitations of this Award Agreement, the Incentive Stock Option Award shall vest or become exercisable in installments according to the following schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">(a) 25% of this Option Award shall vest 12 months after the Date of Grant (\u201cInitial Vesting Date\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">(b) 75% of this Option Award shall vest in three (3) equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the Initial Vesting Date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">Except as provided below, an installment shall not become exercisable on the otherwise applicable vesting date if the Optionee terminates employment or service prior to such vesting date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Once vesting had been met, the Grant Agreement provided that \u201c[t]he Exercise Price may be paid in cash or Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the total Exercise Price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The Grant Agreement stated that it was subject to the terms and conditions of the governing \u201c1999 Stock Option Plan,\u201d which was adopted by a committee of Catalyst\u2019s Board of Directors and approved by its shareholders. The 1999 Stock Option Plan stated that its purpose was to provide incentives to its employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">HealthExtras, Inc., a Delaware corporation, intends for the HealthExtras, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) to provide additional incentive to certain valued and trusted officers, employees, and other individuals ... by encouraging them to acquire shares of common stock of the Company (the \u201cStock\u201d) through options to purchase Stock granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>pursuant to the Plan (\u201cOptions\u201d), thereby increasing each individual\u2019s proprietary interest in the business of the Company and providing them with an increased personal interest in the continued success and progress of the Company, the result of which will promote both the interests of the Company and its shareholders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The 1999 Stock Option Plan echoed the terms of the Grant Agreement by noting that upon termination of employment or service, only options that were immediately exercisable or vested at the date of termination could be exercised, and only within three months following the date of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">After several weeks on the job, Mr. Magill\u2019s compensation package was revised to provide a $200,000 loan to Mr. Magill to facilitate his relocation, as well as an additional grant of 35,000 incentive stock options, subject to the company\u2019s stock option plan. These changes were memorialized in a letter dated April 16, 2004, from Mr. Blair, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">This letter shall confirm our discussion in which we agreed to review your relocation assistance package and employee stock option incentives after 45 days of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">1. <em>Relocation Assistance. </em>To facilitate your relocation to the Washington D.C. area, HealthExtras shall provide you a loan in the amount of $200,000....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">2. <em>Stock Option Incentives. </em>You shall receive an additional 35,000 stock options to purchase HealthExtras common stock____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">In conjunction with this letter, the parties executed a second \u201cIncentive Stock Option Award Agreement\u201d under the same terms as the first, and subject to the same \u201c1999 Stock Option Incentive Plan,\u201d except for the grant date of April 16, 2004, the exercise price of $11.03, and the number of shares, 35,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Approximately five months later, Mr. Blair confirmed in a letter to Mr. Magill that Mr. Magill\u2019s terms of employment again were being revised to include a salary increase, a larger loan for relocation assistance, and an opportunity to receive additional stock options, referred to as a \u201cStretch Goal,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>granting 40,000 stock options, should the company reach its sales objectives. This letter provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">3. <em>Stretch Goal. </em>Should HealthExtras implement 200,000 new fully funded PBM [Pharmacy Benefit Management] lives from August 1, 2004 through January 1, 2005 you shall be granted 40,000 stock options to purchase HealthExtras common stock. Should HealthExtras implement 400,000 new fully funded PBM lives from August 1, 2004 through April 1, 2005 you shall be granted an additional 40,000 stock options. The terms of the stock options are described in the HealthExtras 2002 Equity Incentive Plan[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and the exercise price of such options shall be the closing price of HealthExtras stock on the day in which HealthExtras receives confirmation that such Stretch Goal has been achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Shortly thereafter, Mr. Blair confirmed in a memorandum that Mr. Magill had reached his initial stretch goal and would \u201cbe granted 40,000 stock options to purchase HealthExtras stock.\u201d On the same day, Mr. Magill executed a third \u201cStock Option Award Agreement,\u201d which was virtually identical to the previous two agreements, except for the grant date of October 26, 2004, the exercise price of $13.30, and the number of shares, 40,000. It provided that Mr. Magill was granted an option to purchase 40,000 shares of HealthExtras, Inc. common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement and the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Approximately one year later, Mr. Magill agreed to revise the vesting schedule of his 115,000 stock options so that he would be \u201celigible to exercise [his] HealthExtras stock options and pay-off [his] loan due to HealthExtras.\u201d At the time of the agreement, Mr. Magill had not exercised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>28,750 stock options, which had vested. The agreement was memorialized in a letter signed by Mr. Magill on November 14, 2005, and provided that Catalyst would accelerate an additional 26,250 options that Mr. Magill would exercise to repay the loan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">1. Through HealthExtras equity incentive plans you have been granted 115,000 options (\u201cOptions\u201d) to acquire HealthExtras stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">2. HealthExtras shall accelerate the vesting of your Options prior to November 15, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">3. You shall exercise 55,000 Options on or before December 28, 2005. The proceeds from the exercise and sale of such Options shall be used to pay-off your loan to HealthExtras (current balance is approximately $266,000). HealthExtras will withhold applicable State and Federal taxes. All remaining proceeds shall promptly be forwarded to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">After exercising 55,000 stock options, some at the price of $10.47 and some at the price of $11.03, Mr. Magill paid the outstanding balance of $266,000 on his relocation loan, netted approximately $100,000 in proceeds after tax withholding, and retained 60,000 stock options under a new vesting schedule delineated in the letter agreement, the first to occur April 16, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In February of 2006, Mr. Magill accepted employment with a competitor of Catalyst and tendered his resignation, but continued to work at Catalyst while engaging in severance negotiations. After several attempts failed, Catalyst provided Mr. Magill with an \u201cEmployment Separation and Release Agreement,\u201d terminating his employment as of April 5, 2006, eleven days before 8,750 stock options were scheduled to vest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Approximately two weeks after his termination, Mr. Magill attempted to exercise his 60,000 unvested stock options to no avail, because Catalyst had placed a block on his brokerage account.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A few weeks after Mr. Magill\u2019s termination, Catalyst filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Damages in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to request a determination \u201cas to whether Magill has any claim for alleged unpaid commissions and any rights with respect to stock options that were cancelled when his employment ended.\u201d Through a series of amended complaints, Catalyst asserted various claims, although only Count I remains in issue<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>COUNT I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>DECLARATORY JUDGMENT: NO LEGAL CLAIM BY MAGILL</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">41. HealthExtras repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-35 as if fully set forth here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">42. This cause of action arises under the Maryland Declaratory Judgment Act, \u00a7\u00a7 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">43. An actual controversy exists between HealthExtras and Magill as to whether Magill has any claim for alleged unpaid commissions and any rights with respect to stock options that were cancelled when his employment ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">44. HealthExtras is entitled to a declaration that Magill has no legal claim to receive any further commission pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ments, or to exercise any stock options, or to otherwise receive any other monies or benefits from HealthExtras.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Mr. Magill filed an Answer as well as a Counterclaim alleging three claims, only one of which formed the basis for the result that Catalyst contests<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">COUNT II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>(Violation of Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law)</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">35. Magill restates and incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 34 herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>36. Pursuant to the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, Maryland Labor and Employment, Sec. 3-501 <em>et seq., </em>HealthExtras was required to pay Magill all wages owed to him for work performed before termination at or before the date that Magill would have been paid had he not been terminated, or not later than two weeks thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">37. Magill\u2019s commissions and stock options were compensation for work performed by him and, therefore, were \u201cwages\u201d under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">38. HealthExtras\u2019 failure and refusal to pay the commissions to Magill and its refusal to allow him to exercise his stock options as aforesaid were violations of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, as was any failure to pay him for his accrued leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">A flurry of cross motions for partial summary judgment occurred, but relying on <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 811 A.2d 297 (2002), the Circuit Court judge entered a written order on June 18, 2008, reflecting his March of 2007 oral rulings, that granted Mr. Magill\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count II of his Counterclaim regarding his claim for 60,000 stock options and ordered, in the same document, that Mr. Magill was entitled to exercise the 60,000 remaining stock options, regardless of his termination of employment, and regardless of any contractual requirement that he remain employed for the options to vest, because the stock options \u201cconstitute[d] both \u2018wages\u2019 and \u201cwages due for work performed\u2019 under the Act,\u201d and were \u201cdeemed to have vested.\u201d Thereafter, the parties stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of Counts II and III of Catalyst\u2019s Complaint and Counts I and III of Mr. Magill\u2019s Counterclaim. The Circuit Court judge had previously granted Mr. Magill\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Catalyst\u2019s Count IV. As a result, the Circuit Court judge entered a final judgment on October 30, 2008, in favor of Mr. Magill, and against Catalyst, in the amount of $849,262.50, treating the options as if exercised and establishing the stock value as the measure of damages. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>court also responded, in the same final judgment order, to Catalyst\u2019s request for Declaratory Judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">ORDERED, that in response to Plaintiff Catalyst\u2019s request for a Declaratory Judgment under Count I of its First Amended Complaint asking the Court to find that it owed no additional compensation to Defendant Magill as a result of the termination of the parties employment relationship on April 5, 2006, the Court finds and declares that Plaintiff Catalyst owed Defendant Magill additional compensation upon his termination, specifically, the value of the unvested stock options granted him during his employment in accordance with the reasons stated in the Court\u2019s May 20, 2008 Order,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] and related oral rulings, granting partial summary judgment in favor of Defendant Magill; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Catalyst, thereafter, appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The entry of summary judgment is governed by Rule 2-501, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(f) Entry of judgment.

Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 304-05, 783 A.2d 667, 672 (2001), we explained that Section 3-501(c)(iv) serves two functions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">[Section 3-501(c)(iv)] makes clear both that the listed forms of remuneration are simply examples, by the use of the phrase \u201cany other remuneration,\u201d and that the \u201cother remuneration\u201d that may be included in\u2014in order to be considered\u2014wages must have been \u201cpromised for service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We also remarked that reading Sections 3\u2014501(c)(1) and (c)(2) together, \u201cthe wages which an employee is due, and which must be paid on termination of employment, consist of all compensation, and any other remuneration, that the employee was promised in exchange for his work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 783 A.2d at 671-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Importantly, for our determination regarding the unvested stock options in the instant case, we turn to our bright-line test, as devised in <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>which provides that only when wages have been promised as part of the compensation for the employment arrangement and <em>all conditions agreed to in advance </em>for earning those wages have been satisfied, will Section 3-505 requiring payment of wages due apply. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 783 A.2d at 672-73. Because the Wage Act does not list \u201cstock options\u201d under the definition of \u201cwage,\u201d we must determine whether Mr. Magill\u2019s stock options were merely exchanged as remuneration for his work, or whether they were exchanged as remuneration for his work and subject to any additional unfulfilled promises or conditions, which would place them outside of the definition of \u201cwage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 305, 783 A.2d at 671-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We have defined the term \u201cwage\u201d in <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 303, 783 A.2d at 671 and <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 41, 811 A.2d 297, 305 (2002), and that definition is relied upon by both of the parties before us. In <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>we considered whether a profit-sharing bonus constituted a <em>\u201cwage\u201d </em>under Section 3-501 (c). When Joe Fitzpatrick was hired as a full-time employee, his compensation agreement consisted of a weekly salary and a potential profit-sharing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>bonus; profit-sharing was conditioned upon Fitzpatrick achieving two years of employment and depended upon the profitability of the company. Before reaching two years with the company, Fitzpatrick learned that other employees in his group had received bonus checks. Instead of accepting the company\u2019s offer to stay and receive a bonus check, Fitzpatrick decided to quit and sue to collect the bonus pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In holding that the profit-sharing bonus was not a \u201cwage\u201d under the Wage Act, we reasoned that although the parties agreed, at the time Fitzpatrick was hired, that profit-sharing would be part of his compensation, Fitzpatrick had failed to meet the agreed upon service condition of two years of employment, and therefore, his bonus had not been earned before termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Had [Fitzpatrick] been with [Whiting-Turner] for two years when the decision was made to offer him a bonus and had the financial condition of [Whiting-Turner] justified it, there would be no doubt of [Fitzpatrick\u2019s] entitlement, that he would have earned the distribution in this case. That is so because sharing in the profits of the company after two years was promised as part of [his] compensation package. Here, however, [Whiting-Turner] decided to give [Fitzpatrick] a bonus before he had been employed for two years. Where such remuneration is not a part of the compensation package promised, it is merely a gift, a gratuity, revocable at any time before delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Whiting-Turner, </em>366 Md. at 305-06, 783 A.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In <em>Medex, </em>we relied on <em>Whiting-Turner </em>and examined whether \u201cincentive fees\u201d qualified as wages under Section 3-501(c). Timothy J. McCabe was employed as a sales representative for Medex, a medical supplies manufacturer, and received a $49,000 salary plus incentive fees that were paid out under a series of incentive compensation plans. The Medex employee manual stated three conditions for receiving incentive compensation, (1) meeting specified targets, (2) being an employee at the end of the incentive plan (generally the fiscal year), and (3) being employed at the time of actual payment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>McCabe satisfied the first two conditions by meeting his sales targets and resigning four days after the end of the fiscal year, but left Medex before payments were made under the plan. When Medex refused to pay, citing McCabe\u2019s failure to meet the third condition, McCabe sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We held that earned incentive fees were earned commissions under the Wage Act and emphasized that \u201cit is the exchange of remuneration for the employee\u2019s work that is crucial to the determination that compensation constitutes a wage.\u201d <em>Medex, </em>372 Md. at 36, 811 A.2d at 302. In distinguishing <em>Whiting-Tmner, </em>we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">In this case, the incentive fees were related directly to sales made by the employees during a defined fiscal year. McCabe had performed all the work necessary to earn the fees, and Medex had registered the sales. In the terminology of the incentive plan itself, some of the incentive fees \u201cbegin to earn\u201d at meeting 80% of a target goal, while another \u201c[ijncentive begins\u201d upon the sale of certain goods. The work of the employee may have preceded the payment date of the fees, but the fees were compensation for work performed, and, thus, wages under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 37, 811 A.2d at 302-03. We concluded that the company was free \u201cto implement its own hierarchy of entitlement,\u201d but that McCabe\u2019s right to compensation vested when he did everything required to earn the wages, rather than when Medex determined to pay the commissions; to hold otherwise would place McCabe\u2019s wages at the whim of his employer to determine when to pay him. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 811 A.2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In the present case, Catalyst argues that the Circuit Court judge erred in determining that Mr. Magfil\u2019s conditionally granted unvested stock options were wages under the Wage Act and could be exercised after termination, despite Mr. Magill\u2019s failure to reach specific vesting dates set forth in the Grant Agreements. Catalyst contends that the Circuit Court judge\u2019s decision contravened \u201cwell-established law and business practice in Maryland and throughout the United States,\u201d and confused the Wage Act\u2019s language regarding \u201cremunera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>tion promised for service\u201d as tantamount to an irrevocable grant of stock, rather than a grant of the option to purchase stock conditioned upon continued employment, which was not met. Catalyst maintains that the grant of stock options, rather than wages, were a promise of conditional incentive equity compensation in exchange for continued service.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Mr. Magill counters that the Circuit Court judge was correct in holding that his stock options were wages \u201cpromised and earned as compensation\u201d under the Wage Act. Mr. Magill contends that because the first two stock option grants were part of his compensation package, and the third grant of options was awarded for meeting a specific performance sales goal, all of the options were wages earned during his employment and payable upon termination. He argues that continuing employment until the exercise dates was not required, because the stock options vested when the parties agreed to a revised compensation package in November of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In a March of 2007 hearing on Catalyst\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the denial of its motion for partial summary judgment, the Circuit Court judge in the instant case stated his belief that Mr. Magill\u2019s stock options were wages, pursuant to our reasoning in <em>Medex:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">In my opinion on the motion for reconsideration by HealthExtras, this case is more like <em>Medex </em>rather than <em>Whiting-Turner. </em>On the <em>Medex, </em>once the options were earned as wages, Magill\u2019s interest in them vested and he was entitled to payment of the options. The Court of Appeals found that the incentive payment were wages so that the former employee could collect them. Payment of the incentive fees was conditioned upon meeting targets and being an employee at the end of the incentive plan as well as at the time of payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">In this case, HealthExtras refers to the stock options programs as an incentive program. Magill met the goal of reaching 200,000 PBM lives by the target date, and he was rewarded with the options. In my opinion, this makes them wages, remuneration in exchange for work. The other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>75,000 options were part of Magill\u2019s compensation package, which, under the law, also makes them wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">The <em>Medex </em>stated, and we\u2019ve all talked about this, it is the exchange of remuneration for the employee\u2019s work that is crucial to the determination that the compensation constitutes a wage. An employee\u2019s right to compensation vests when the employee does everything required to earn the wages. Magill did everything required to earn the wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">Despite the arguments to the contrary and the language to the contrary, the stock option award agreements, in the Court\u2019s opinion, are void under the rationale of <em>Medex.[</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX3\">In concluding that the stock options were wages, the Circuit Court judge determined that they were granted for goals already achieved, premising his decision on Section 3-501(c)(2)(iv) which defines wages as \u201cany other remuneration promised for service.\u201d In so concluding, the judge erred as a matter of law because the options were granted for services, but their exercise was conditioned upon Mr. Magill\u2019s employment for a specific time period, which he did not meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The letter agreements between Catalyst and Mr. Magill did not promise an unconditional grant of stock to Mr. Magill; rather, the agreements explicitly conditioned the right to exercise the grant of stock options on continued employment until a date that was expressly defined. In this regard, Mr. Magill is in a similar posture to the employee in <em>Whiting-Turner; </em>had Mr. Magill continued employment with Catalyst on the next vesting date, he would have been entitled to exercise his vested stock options. Unlike the employee in <em>Medex, </em>Mr. Magill did not meet all of the agreed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>conditions to exercise his stock options. <em>Medex, </em>372 Md. at 37, 811 A.2d at 302-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Mr. Magill also cites <em>Tuttle v. Geo. McQuesten Company, Inc., </em>227 A.D.2d 754, 642 N.Y.S.2d 356 (1996) and <em>Scully v. US WATS, Inc., </em>238 F.3d 497 (3rd Cir.2001), for the proposition that \u201cincentive compensation\u201d and \u201cstock options,\u201d respectively, are wages. In <em>Tuttle, </em>cited by us in <em>Medex, </em>our sister state court held that \u201cincentive compensation\u201d was considered a \u201cwage\u201d under New York\u2019s labor law, and the former employee in that case had a vested right to the money when he was terminated. <em>Tuttle </em>is distinguishable, however, because the \u201cincentive compensation\u201d at issue in that case was a commission earned by the employee prior to his termination, unlike the incentive stock options in this case, which were not vested at the time Mr. Magill left employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>Scully, </em>the Third Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted whether the employee\u2019s stock options, which were promised compensation under a two-year employment contract, fell within the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law\u2019s (WPCL) definition of \u201cwage.\u201d The WPCL defines \u201cwage\u201d as including \u201cfringe benefits or wage supplements,\u201d which, in turn, is defined as including \u201cany other amount to be paid pursuant to an agreement to the employee.\u201d <em>Scully, </em>238 F.3d at 517. The Court reasoned that the stock options fell within the definition of wage, because the employer agreed to deliver the stock options as part of a two-year oral employment contract. As such, the Court held that because there was an unlawful breach of the employment contract, and the employee had rendered all services necessary for the options to vest, the Company could not be allowed to breach the two-year employment contract in an effort to disallow the employee from exercising his options. The Court also held that the employee could exercise his unvested options, because he would have exercised those options after they vested had he not been wrongfully terminated. The facts at issue in <em>Scully </em>are distinctly different from the facts in the present case. Unlike in <em>Scully, </em>Mr. Magill was an at will employee who left his employment before meeting all service conditions of his com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pensation agreement and before the stock options at issue had vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Mr. Magill also cites to other federal cases interpreting the Wage Act, including <em>Varghese v. Honeywell Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>424 F.3d 411 (4th Cir.2005), <em>Mazer v. Safeway, Inc., </em>398 F.Supp.2d 412 (D.Md.2005), and <em>Rogers v. Savings First Mortgage, LLC, </em>362 F.Supp.2d 624 (D.Md.2005). In <em>Varghese, </em>Thomas Varghese filed a lawsuit claiming that his former employer, Honeywell, violated the Maryland Wage Act when the Company terminated his right to exercise previously granted, and vested, stock options. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the stock options at issue, despite having fully vested by the time Varghese was terminated from employment, were not \u201cwages\u201d under the Wage Act, because there was no evidence that the stock option grants had been <em>promised </em>to him as remuneration for his efforts in his employment agreement. The Court distinguished its facts from the conditional grants of stock options in both <em>Whiting-Turner </em>and <em>Medex, </em>noting that Varghese never could claim that he was entitled to \u201cwages,\u201d because Honeywell always retained discretion in awarding him stock options and \u201cno document or testimony set[ ] forth any conditions [or measurable benchmarks] that, once satisfied, would convert mere eligibility to entitlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20 &amp; n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In <em>Mazer, </em>Timothy Mazer sued his former employer, Safeway, alleging, among other things, that Safeway failed to pay him compensation and benefits in violation of Maryland law. Judge Alexander Williams, Jr., relied on <em>Varghese, </em>and held that although Mazer received stock options, which could have been considered \u201cwages,\u201d he did not provide any evidence that he had received the stock options in exchange for his continued employment, and \u201c[t]he grant of the options itself, however, does not show that the options were promised.\u201d <em>Mazer, </em>398 F.Supp.2d at 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Mr. Magill suggests that <em>Varghese </em>and <em>Mazer </em>support his argument that the definition of \u201cwages\u201d can include stock options if they are promised as compensation, but disregards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>their holdings because the stock options at issue were found to be discretionary awards rather than promised compensation. The present case is distinguishable, however, because even though the stock options were promised compensation, Mr. Magill failed to achieve the agreed upon service condition of being employed on a certain date, a fact that was conspicuously absent as an issue in <em>Varghese </em>and <em>Mazer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>Rogers, </em>Judge William M. Nickerson of the U.S. District Court for Maryland relied upon <em>Whiting-Turner </em>and <em>Medex, </em>in holding that unpaid year-end <em>bonuses </em>were due to former employees of Savings First Mortgage, LLC, under the Wage Act. Mr. Magill ignores the fact that \u201ca bonus\u201d is explicitly included in the definition of \u201cwage\u201d in the Wage Act. Section 3-501(c)(2)(i). Because we hold that Mr. Magill\u2019s unvested stock options were not \u201cwages,\u201d pursuant to the Wage Act, <em>Rogers </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGR\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Circuit Court judge, in the instant case, granted partial summary judgment in favor of Mr. Magill, but did not enter a separate, written declaratory judgment defining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>rights and obligations of the parties. This Court, in its discretion, \u201cmay \u2018review the merits of the controversy and remand for entry of an appropriate declaratory judgment by the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lovell Land, Inc. v.

HealthExtras\u2019 failure and refusal to pay the commissions to Magill and to allow him to exercise his stock options as aforesaid were material breaches of his contract with HealthExtras.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">COUNT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-17\">\n<em>(Violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-18\">39. Magill restates and incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 38 herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-19\">40. The Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2601 <em>et seq., </em>requires a covered employer to grant an eligible employee up to 12 weeks of leave in a 12-month period when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-20\">41. HealthExtras is a covered \"employer\u201d under the terms of the FMLA and its implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-21\">42. Magill is an \"eligible\u201d employee as that term is defined in the FMLA and its implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-22\">43. In March 2006 Magill, as a result of an automobile accident, suffered a \"serious health condition\u201d as that term is defined in the FMLA and its implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-23\">44. Magill was entitled to take leave under the FMLA as a result of his serious health condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-24\">45. HealthExtras' termination of Magill on April 5, 2006, while he was on leave was in violation of the FMLA.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\">. The Circuit Court judge\u2019s reference to the \"May 20, 2008 Order,\u201d is a reference to the June 18, 2008 Order, as May 20, 2008 is the date on which the judge signed the Order, and June 18, 2008, is the date on which the Order was entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\">. The Circuit Court judge ordered, \"that pursuant to the agreement of the parties, enforcement of the judgment in this action is stayed pending appeal without the Plaintiff Catalyst being required to post a supersedeas bond or other security.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. In a June of 2007 hearing on the partial summary judgment motions, counsel for Catalyst queried the judge as to whether he viewed the Grant Agreements as unconditional entitlements to shares of stock, irrespective of the vesting provisions in the agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">[CATALYST'S COUNSEL]: Is it the Court\u2019s current view that once he walked in the door, he became entitled to those 40,000 shares of stock, notwithstanding the vesting provisions in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">THE COURT: You bet, little beaver.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">. Our conclusion is consistent with other courts which have gone further than we do herein and have held that under their respective wage statutes, stock options are not \"wages.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Weems v. Citigroup, Inc., </em>453 Mass. 147, 900 N.E.2d 89, 93-95 (2009) (holding that stock options awarded under a voluntary payroll program, which included a forfeiture provision upon termination, did not constitute \"wages\u201d subject to the Massachusetts Weekly Wage Act); <em>Paolini v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>143 Idaho 547, 149 P.3d 822, 824-25 (2006) (holding that stock options do not constitute wages under Idaho\u2019s wage laws); <em>See also IBM v. Bajorek, </em>191 F.3d 1033, 1039 (9th Cir.1999) (interpreting California law and holding that stock options are not wages under the California Labor Code; rather, stock options are \"contractual rights to buy shares of stock\u201d); <em>Weir v. Anaconda Co., </em>773 F.2d 1073, 1086 (10th Cir.1985) (interpreting Kansas law and holding that stock options are not wages under the Kansas Wage Payment Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Mr. Magill cites various decisions of the Court of Special Appeals, those being <em>Aronson v. Fetridge, </em>181 Md.App. 650, 957 A.2d 125 (2008), <em>Himes v. Anderson, </em>178 Md.App. 504, 943 A.2d 30 (2008), and <em>Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>159 Md.App. 620, 861 A.2d 735 (2004). We need not address these cases, because vesting of stock options was not an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b507-8\">MURPHY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3L\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">I agree that Appellee was not entitled to summary judgment in his favor.
