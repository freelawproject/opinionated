Montgomery County, however, has an ordinance (\u201cthe Fortunetelling Ordinance\u201d) that prohibits the acceptance of remuneration for fortunetelling. Nefedro has asked us to determine whether the Fortunetelling Ordinance violates his right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Montgomery County argues that the Ordinance does not implicate those constitutional provisions or, in the alternative, that it is consistent with the federal and state constitutions. After reviewing the facts of the case and the relevant sources of law, we shall agree with Nefedro.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">This case arose in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On May 28, 2008, Nefedro filed suit against the County and Isiah Leggett, the County Executive for Montgomery County (collectively, \u201cthe County\u201d). In his complaint, Nefedro challenged the Fortunetelling Ordinance on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, as well as oppositions and replies to those motions. On December 11, 2008, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the County, concluding that the Fortunetelling Ordinance is constitutional. Nefedro noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the intermediate appellate court had an opportunity to hear arguments in the case, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion. <em>Nefedro v. Montgomery County, </em>410 Md. 165, 978 A.2d 245 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The following facts are not in dispute. Nefedro is engaged in the fortunetelling business in several locations across the country. In this business, he charges customers a fee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>exchange for fortunetelling, palm reading, and other related services. Nefedro has stated that he intends to open a location for his fortunetelling business in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">There is some dispute about what Nefedro has done in furtherance of his expressed intent to open a business in Montgomery County. Nefedro claims that he leased property in Montgomery County, paid rent on the property, purchased furnishings for the property, placed a sign in the storefront announcing that the fortunetelling business would soon open, and attempted to acquire a business license from the Montgomery County Licensing Department. Nefedro says that the supervisor of the Licensing Department denied his request for a license, citing the Fortunetelling Ordinance. The County argues that these claims are unsupported by the record, and, indeed, there is nothing in the record to support Nefedro\u2019s claims other than his own assertions. In addition, the County argues that, if anything, Nefedro\u2019s assertions suggest that he requested a license from the Montgomery County Circuit Court, not the County itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">There is no dispute that the Fortunetelling Ordinance prohibits the acceptance of remuneration for the performance of fortunetelling. The Ordinance states:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Fortunetelling.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Every person who shall demand or accept any remuneration or gratuity for forecasting or foretelling or for pretending to forecast or foretell the future by cards, palm reading or any other scheme, practice or device shall be subject to punishment for a class B violation as set forth in section 1-19 of chapter 1 of the County Code; and in any warrant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>a violation of the above provisions, it shall be sufficient to allege that the defendant forecast or foretold or pretended to forecast or foretell the future by a certain scheme, practice or device without setting forth the particular scheme, practice or device employed; provided, that this section shall not apply to any benefit performance or part thereof conducted pursuant to section 30-4 of this Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1a\">Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 32-7 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Nefedro filed suit against the County. In his suit, Nefedro asked the court for a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 3-406 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, stating that the Fortunetelling Ordinance violates his First Amendment right to freedom of speech and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties subsequently filed various motions, including cross-motions for summary judgment, and the trial court held a hearing on the summary judgment motions. At the hearing, the court concluded that the Fortunetelling Ordinance was constitutional, denied Nefedro\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">All right. Well, I think this is essentially a police power being exercised by Montgomery County. And, certainly, under its police power it has the right to regulate this type of activity. It\u2019s a commercial transaction and even the intermediary [sic] test of this ordinance meets the standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">So, it certainly has a substantial interest. It\u2019s been demonstrated that the regulation directly and materially advances the substantial interests and it is narrowly drawn. It is not prohibiting the speech. It is simply regulating it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In its written order granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>[T]he County fortunetelling law ... is constitutional. The County law regulates speech, not conduct. And, insofar as the County law does regulate speech, it is narrowly drawn to serve the County\u2019s compelling governmental interest in protecting its citizenry from fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Nefedro appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling. While the case was before the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari on our motion to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Did the trial court err in finding that Montgomery County Code \u00a7 32-7, criminalizing the demand or receipt of payment for fortunetelling, does not violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 40 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">After receiving briefs and hearing arguments from both parties, we answer this question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">As an initial matter, the County argues that Nefedro lacks standing to challenge the Fortunetelling Ordinance. In \u201ca multitude of cases,\u201d this Court has \u201crecognize[d] the availability of actions for declaratory judgments or injunctions challenging the validity of statutes or regulations which may, in the future, be applied to or adversely affect the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 588-90, 801 A.2d 1034, 1042-43 (2002) (citing many cases).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our decision in <em>State v. Lundquist, </em>262 Md. 534, 278 A.2d 263 (1971), demonstrates this principle in regard to a freedom of speech challenge. In <em>Lundquist, </em>we concluded that there was standing to challenge a statute requiring participation in a flag salute based entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>on one plaintiffs statement that he and his son objected to and would not participate in the ceremony. 262 Md. at 539-40, 278 A.2d at 266-67. In reaching that conclusion, we noted \u201cthe obvious chilling effect on [the plaintiffs\u2019] First Amendment rights\u201d and that the Attorney General had stated, in its answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, that \u201ca program of enforcement [was] in preparation and await[ed] only the outcome of this case.\u201d <em>Lundquist, </em>262 Md. at 540, 278 A.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The record shows that, at the very least, the Fortunetelling Ordinance will adversely affect Nefedro.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The County does not dispute that Nefedro operates fortunetelling businesses, and Nefedro has expressed an intent to open a fortunetelling business in Montgomery County if he is allowed to do so. The parties also agree that the Fortunetelling Ordinance would prohibit Nefedro from receiving remuneration for fortunetelling. Indeed, the County\u2019s argument is founded on its assertion that Nefedro should not be allowed to receive remuneration for fortunetelling because it is, and should be, illegal in Montgomery County. The undisputed facts therefore demonstrate that Nefedro intends to open a fortunetelling business in Montgomery County but that he would be subject to penalties under the Fortunetelling Ordinance if he did so. These facts are sufficient to establish standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We now address Nefedro\u2019s First Amendment challenge to the Fortunetelling Ordinance. Nefedro argues that the Ordinance violates his right to freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\n<em>The Fortunetelling Ordinance Regulates Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">There seems to be no dispute between the parties in this case that fortunetelling is speech.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the issues before us are whether the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates speech and, if so, whether that regulation violates the First Amendment. Nefedro argues that the Ordinance regulates speech and that, accordingly, the law must pass First Amendment scrutiny. The County responds that because the Ordinance regulates only the payment of money for fortunetelling services, it regulates only conduct. As a result, the County asserts, the Ordinance does not implicate the First Amendment. In our view, the Fortunetelling Ordinance does regulate speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The First Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the states from passing laws \u201cabridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. I. The United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">This provision embodies \u201c[o]ur profound national commitment to the free exchange of ideas.\u201d <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, </em>491 U.S. 657, 686, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989). \u201c[A]s a general matter, \u2018the First Amendment means that government has no power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., </em>463 U.S. 60, 65, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983) (quoting <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Chicago v. Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). However, this principle, like other First Amendment principles, is not absolute. <em>Cf. Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, </em>485 U.S. 46, 56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>Ashcroft v. ACLU, </em>535 U.S. 564, 573, 122 S.Ct. 1700, 1707, 152 L.Ed.2d 771, 780 (2002) <em>(Ashcroft I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Assuming, as we do, that fortunetelling is speech, the question before us is whether the Fortunetelling Ordinance violates the First Amendment by improperly restricting that speech. The County argues that the Ordinance does not implicate the First Amendment at all because it prohibits not fortunetelling itself, but the receipt of remuneration for fortunetelling. This is not a meaningful distinction. The Supreme Court has held that a restriction on compensation for speech implicates the First Amendment. In <em>United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, </em>the Court found unconstitutional the application of a federal law that banned honoraria for federal employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 513 U.S. 454, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (1995). The Court explained that such an outright ban on remuneration for speech implicates the First Amendment even though it \u201cneither prohibits any speech nor discriminates among speakers based on the content or viewpoint of their messages.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury, </em>513 U.S. at 468, 115 S.Ct. at 1014, 130 L.Ed.2d at 981. Such a restriction implicates the First Amendment because \u201cits prohibition on compensation unquestionably imposes a significant burden on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>expressive activity.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Nat'l Treasury, </em>513 U.S. at 468, 115 S.Ct. at 1014, 130 L.Ed.2d at 981. As a result, the Court concluded that \u201c[b]y denying respondents that [financial] incentive, the honoraria ban induces them to curtail their expression. ...\u201d <em>Nat'l Treasury, </em>513 U.S. at 469, 115 S.Ct. at 1014, 130 L.Ed.2d at 981.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Cases involving \u201cSon of Sam\u201d laws further illustrate the principle that restrictions on the receipt of remuneration for speech implicate the First Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crime Victims Board, </em>the Supreme Court addressed such a law, which required any entity contracting with an accused or convicted person for the depiction of a crime to turn over to the state any income from that contract. 502 U.S. 105, 109, 112 S.Ct. 501, 504-05, 116 L.Ed.2d 476, 482-83 (1991). If a victim of the crime recovered a money judgment against the accused or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>convicted person within five years, the victim would be paid from the fund; otherwise, the money would be returned to the entity. <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>502 U.S. at 109, 112 S.Ct. at 505, 116 L.Ed.2d at 483. The Court explained that \u201c[a] statute is presumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech.\u201d <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>502 U.S. at 115, 112 S.Ct. at 508, 116 L.Ed.2d at 486-87. The Court then determined that this law, in particular, implicated the First Amendment because it \u201csingled out speech on a particular subject for a financial burden that it place[d] on no other speech and no other income.\u201d <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>502 U.S. at 123, 112 S.Ct. at 512, 116 L.Ed.2d at 491-92. For this reason, the Court concluded that the statute did not pass First Amendment scrutiny. <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>502 U.S. at 123, 112 S.Ct. at 512, 116 L.Ed.2d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Other jurisdictions, including this one, have explicitly followed <em>Simon &amp; Schuster </em>in concluding that restrictions on remuneration for speech implicate the First Amendment. In <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 638 A.2d 93 (1994), we concluded that the Maryland \u201cSon of Sam\u201d statute implicates the First Amendment. The statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol., 1993 Cum. Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 764, had been modeled after the invalidated New York statute. <em>Curran, </em>334 Md. at 159-60, 638 A.2d at 98. It required parties to submit to the State certain crimes-related speech contracts and compensation arising from those contracts. <em>Curran, </em>334 Md. at 154-56, 638 A.2d at 96-97. Although the Legislature had amended the statute to address some of the concerns raised in <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>we concluded that the statute still placed a burden on speech. <em>Curran, </em>334 Md. at 161, 638 A.2d at 99. As we explained, \u201cto deny compensation for certain speech will chill such speech.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>334 Md. at 162, 638 A.2d at 99. The state supreme courts in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Rhode Island have each reached the same conclusion. <em>See State ex rel. Napolitano v. Gravano, </em>204 Ariz. 106, 60 P.3d 246, 250-52 (App.2002) (concluding that the First Amendment applied to a law that called for the forfeiture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>royalties from books based on racketeering activities); <em>Keenan v. Superior Court, </em>27 Cal.4th 413, 117 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 40 P.3d 718, 722 (2002) (concluding that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s analogous provision [to the statute at issue in <em>Simon &amp; Schuster </em>] similarly imposes a content-based financial penalty on protected speech\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, </em>436 Mass. 1201, 764 N.E.2d 343, 347 (2002) (\u201cConsistent with other courts, we conclude that [a pending bill proposing a \u2018Son of Sam\u2019 law] is a content-based regulation of speech.\u201d); <em>Seres v. Lerner, </em>120 Nev. 928, 102 P.3d 91, 97 (2004) (\u201cBecause [the \u2018Son of Sam\u2019 law] is a content-based restriction on speech, the statute must pass a strict scrutiny level of review, in line with relevant case authority.\u201d); <em>Bouchard v. Price, </em>694 A.2d 670, 676 (R.I.1997) (\u201c[W]e are persuaded that the criminal royalties act is a content-based statute.\u201d). Like the Fortunetelling Ordinance, \u201cSon of Sam\u201d laws restrict the ability of an individual to receive remuneration for his or her speech.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>As these cases demonstrate, a restriction on remuneration for protected speech is a restriction on the speaker\u2019s First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Fortunetelling Ordinance is such a restriction. By punishing protected speech when that speech is made in exchange for payment, the County is imposing a burden on that speech. Like the government employees in <em>National Treasury, </em>or the authors and publishers in the cases involving \u201cSon of Sam\u201d statutes, an individual who wishes to engage in protected speech for a profit will be discouraged from doing so because there is no promise of a financial benefit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This type of burden on speech is something the First Amendment generally forbids, especially when, as in this case, the burden is directed at speech specifically because of the content of that speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The above notwithstanding, the County repeatedly asserts, and the dissent agrees, that fortunetelling is \u201cinherently fraudulent\u201d and, as a result, should not receive any First Amendment protection. Indeed, the First Amendment does not protect fraudulent statements. <em>Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Assocs., </em>538 U.S. 600, 612, 123 S.Ct. 1829, 1836, 155 L.Ed.2d 793, 804 (2003) (\u201c[T]he First Amendment does not shield fraud.\u201d). We are not, however, persuaded that all fortunetelling is fraudulent. While we recognize that some fortunetellers may make fraudulent statements, just as some lawyers or journalists may, we see nothing in the record to suggest that fortunetelling always involves fraudulent statements. Indeed, fortunetellers, like magicians or horoscope writers, are able to provide entertainment to their customers or some other benefit that does not deceive those who receive their speech. Just as many other courts have concluded, we view this non-fraudulent speech as receiving protection under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the First Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Argello v. City of Lincoln, </em>148 F.3d 1152, 1153 (8th Cir.1998) (rejecting the argument that a fortunetelling ordinance could \u201cbe upheld as a prohibition against fraud\u201d because it did \u201cnot require that fortunetellers <em>know </em>that they are conveying false information, or that they have no power of seeing into the future\u201d); <em>Rushman v. City of Milwaukee, </em>959 F.Supp. 1040, 1044 (E.D.Wis.1997) (explaining that an ordinance that banned fortunetelling was invalid because \u201c[e]ven if the City is trying to prevent fraud, the Ordinance encompasses much more than fraud\u201d); <em>Spiritual Psychic Sci. Church v. City of Azusa, </em>39 Cal.3d 501, 217 Cal.Rptr. 225, 703 P.2d 1119, 1126 (1985) (explaining that when people who \u201cbelieve they possess the power to predict what has not yet come to pass ... impart their beliefs to others, they are not acting fraudulently; they are communicating opinions which, however dubious, are unquestionably protected by the Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In response, the County and the dissent have cited a number of cases in which courts have referred to fortunetelling as fraudulent. We are unpersuaded by these cases. In most of them, the courts were not asked to consider whether fortunetelling was protected speech. <em>See Mitchell v. City of Birmingham, </em>222 Ala. 389, 133 So. 13 (1931) (addressing the authority of a municipality to pass an ordinance inconsistent with state law); <em>Bridewell v. City of Bessemer, </em>35 Ala.App. 337, 46 So.2d 568 (1950) (addressing the authority of a municipality to levy a prohibitory licensing fee outside its city limits); <em>White v. Adams, </em>233 Ark. 241, 343 S.W.2d 793 (1961) (addressing whether the vocation of fortunetelling is a common right or a privilege upon which the state may impose a prohibitory tax); <em>Fay v. Lambourne, </em>124 A.D. 245, 108 N.Y.S. 874 (1908) (addressing a suit by fortunetellers asking for an injunction prohibiting other fortunetellers from using a particular trade name). In another case, there was no freedom of speech argument before the court and the fortunetelling remuneration ban at issue included an explicit exemption for fortunetelling performed \u201cfor the purpose of entertainment or amusement.\u201d <em>Ballard v. Walker, </em>772 F.Supp. 1335 (E.D.N.Y.1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(addressing N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 165.35 (McKinney 1988)). Yet another case, <em>In re Bartha, </em>63 Cal.App.3d 584, 134 Cal.Rptr. 39 (1976), has been explicitly disavowed by that state\u2019s supreme court. <em>Spiritual Psychic, </em>217 Cal.Rptr. 225, 703 P.2d at 1122 (\u201cWe are unable to subscribe to <em>Bartha\u2019s </em>broad characterization of fortunetelling as an exclusively commercial activity, and to the theory that it therefore can be indiscriminately regulated, or, in this instance, wholly prohibited.\u201d). These cases do not affect our conclusion that some fortunetelling is simply not fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The only two cases that the County and the dissent have cited that might have any persuasive effect are a 1928 decision from the Supreme Court of Ohio, <em>Davis v. State, </em>118 Ohio St. 25, 160 N.E. 473 (1928), and an unreported opinion from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, <em>Mitchell v. Hartford County, </em>No. L-01-3998 (D.Md. Sept. 5, 2002). In regard to <em>Davis, </em>we agree with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which rejected <em>Davis </em>when striking down a fortunetelling ban, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">In the case at bar, ... this Court ... concludes that <em>Davis v. State </em>does not stand today as a controlling authority that fortune telling is inherently a fraudulent occupation____ The unspoken premise of the Rule in the case at bar, that fortune telling, phrenology, horoscope and the other practices prohibited by the Rule are inherently fraudulent, is not supported by any factual record or factual statement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\"><em>Angeline v. Mahoning County Agric. Soc\u2019y, </em>993 F.Supp. 627, 633 (N.D.Ohio 1998) (citations and quotations omitted). As for <em>Mitchell, </em>we decline to do as that court did and \u201cdefer to the legislative finding ... that fortunetelling is inherently deceptive and, therefore, is unprotected speech.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>No. L-01-3998 at 3. Such deference would allow legislatures to ban any manner of protected speech by simply declaring it \u201cinherently deceptive.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates speech that the First Amendment protects.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\n<em>Fortunetelling Is Not Commercial Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The County argues that if we conclude that the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates speech, as we have, then it is still constitutional because, according to the County, the law regulates only commercial speech. While we acknowledge that laws restricting commercial speech receive less scrutiny than laws restricting noncommercial speech, we disagree that the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Supreme Court has explained that laws regulating commercial speech do not receive the same level of heightened scrutiny as laws regulating other types of speech. In <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>the Court explained that although the First Amendment \u201cprotects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation,\u201d there is a \u201c \u2018commonsense\u2019 distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.\u201d 447 U.S. 557, 561-62, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341, 348 (1980) (quoting <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 U.S. 447, 455-56, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1918, 56 L.Ed.2d 444, 453 (1978)). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he Constitution ... accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression.\u201d <em>Cent.

The general rule is that commercial speech is speech that \u201cpropose[s] a commercial transaction.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 473-74, 109 S.Ct. 3028, 3031, 106 L.Ed.2d 388, 399 (1989) (quoting <em>Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va.

Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 561, 100 S.Ct. at 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d at 348)). The line between commercial and noncommercial speech can sometimes be difficult to discern, <em>see Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>471 U.S. 626, 637, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 2274, 85 L.Ed.2d 652, 663 (1985) (\u201cMore subject to doubt, perhaps, are the precise bounds of the category of expression that may be termed commercial speech .... \u201d), but the Court has foreclosed the idea that speech is commercial simply because it is made for an economic benefit, <em>see Bolger, </em>463 U.S. at 66-67, 103 S.Ct. at 2880, 77 L.Ed.2d at 477 (explaining that speech is not commercial just because it is an advertisement, refers to a specific product, or has an \u201ceconomic motivation\u201d); <em>New York Times Co. v.

The purpose of fortunetelling is not to propose a commercial transaction, nor is it solely related to the economic interests of the speaker. <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 473-74, 109 S.Ct. at 3031, 106 L.Ed.2d at 399; <em>Jakanna, </em>344 Md. at 595, 689 A.2d at 70. The purpose of fortunetelling is instead to provide some other benefit to the individuals involved, whether entertainment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>information that sheds light on future events. This is true even though the fortuneteller may receive money in exchange for his or her services; the fact that there is an economic motivation for speech does not transform non-commercial speech into commercial speech. <em>Bolger, </em>463 U.S. at 66-67, 103 S.Ct. at 2880, 77 L.Ed.2d at 477; <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 265-66, 84 S.Ct. at 718, 11 L.Ed.2d at 698. The fact that some aspect of fortunetelling may involve commerce also does not transform it into commercial speech.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Fox, </em>492 U.S. at 473-75, 109 S.Ct. at 3031-32, 106 L.Ed.2d at 399-400 (identifying commercial speech by looking at \u201cthe principle type of expression at issue\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates speech that receives full protection under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\n<em>The Fortunetelling Ordinance Is Not Narrowly Tailored</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Having determined that the Fortunetelling Ordinance regulates fully protected speech based on its content, we now determine whether the Ordinance nonetheless passes muster under the First Amendment. A statute that regulates speech based on its content is \u201c \u2018presumptively invalid,\u2019 ... and the government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.\u201d <em>United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Group, </em>529 U.S. 803, 817, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 1888, 146 L.Ed.2d 865, 882 (2000) (quoting <em>R.A.V. v.

The Supreme Court has explained that a statute that regulates speech based on its content may still comply with the First Amendment if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cnarrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest.\u201d <em>Playboy Entm\u2019t, </em>529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. at 1886, 146 L.Ed.2d at 879.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nefedro argues that the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> while the County argues that it is.

This requirement \u201censure[s] that speech is restricted no further than necessary to achieve the [intended] goal, for it is important to ensure that legitimate speech is not chilled or punished.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. ACLU, </em>542 U.S. 656, 666, 124 S.Ct. 2783, 2791, 159 L.Ed.2d 690, 701 (2004) <em>(Ashcroft </em>II). To that end, a court\u2019s question in determining whether a statute is narrowly tailored is \u201cwhether the challenged regulation is the least restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.\u201d <em>Ashcroft II, </em>542 U.S. at 666, 124 S.Ct. at 2791, 159 L.Ed.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Cases involving freedom of speech demonstrate the narrow-tailoring requirement. In <em>Ashcroft II, </em>the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a federal statute that was intended to protect minors from sexually explicit materials on the Internet. 542 U.S. at 659-60, 124 S.Ct. at 2788, 159 L.Ed.2d at 697. To achieve that goal, the statute imposed a fine and prison time for the knowing posting on the Internet of content that was \u201charmful to minors,\u201d as defined by the statute, unless the defendant could prove that he or she took reasonable measures to make the harmful content accessible only by adults. <em>Ashcroft II, </em>542 U.S. at 661-62, 124 S.Ct. at 2789, 159 L.Ed.2d at 698-99. The Court concluded that the statute was not narrowly tailored because the plaintiffs had suggested a less restrictive alternative that would be at least as effective, if not more so, than what the statute required: blocking and filtering software employed by the Internet user, as opposed to the content creator. <em>Ashcroft II, </em>542 U.S. at 666-70, 124 S.Ct. at 2791-94, 159 L.Ed.2d at 701-04. Similarly, in <em>Playboy Entertainment, </em>the Court considered a statute that required cable television operators to fully block sexually-oriented channels during hours when children might be viewing. 529 U.S. at 806, 120 S.Ct. at 1882, 146 L.Ed.2d at 875. The Court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional because an effective, less restrictive alternative was available: an already-existing statute that required cable operators to block certain channels at a cable subscriber\u2019s request. <em>Playboy Entm\u2019t, </em>529 U.S. at 816-27, 120 S.Ct. at 1887-93, 146 L.Ed.2d at 881-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The Fortunetelling Ordinance is not narrowly tailored. According to the County, the purpose of the Fortunetelling Statute is to combat the fraud that apparently ensues from fortunetelling. There is at least one less restrictive, effective means for combating fraud: laws making fraud illegal without respect to protected speech.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In fact, Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>already has such an ordinance. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 11-4 (2009) (prohibiting fraud in regard to deceptive trade practices, including \u201cany deception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation, or concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that consumers rely on the concealment, suppression, or omission, in connection with any consumer goods or services\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The State of Maryland also has fraud laws that do not restrict protected speech. <em>See generally </em>Md.Code (2002, 2009 Supp.), Title 8 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cFraud and Related Crimes\u201d); Md.Code (1975, 2005 Repl. VoL, 2009 Supp.), Title 13 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cConsumer Protection Act\u201d). Indeed, fraud laws without respect to protected speech date back at least as far as the Code of Hammurabi. <em>See </em>The Avalon Project: Code of Hammurabi (L.W. King trans., 1910) (2008), http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp (last accessed June 8, 2010) (\u201c264. If a herdsman, to whose care cattle or sheep have been entrusted, be guilty of fraud and make false returns of the natural increase, or sell them for money, then shall he be convicted and pay the owner ten times the loss.\u201d). For its part, the County has advanced absolutely no legitimate reason why an ordinance directed at speech is necessary to combat fraud when there are speech-neutral fraud laws that are already in effect and an uninterrupted history of such laws dating back to the beginning of recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with Nefedro that the Fortunetelling Ordinance is not narrowly tailored and conclude that the Fortunetelling Ordinance violates the First Amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Fortunetelling may be pure entertainment, it may give individuals some insight into the future, or it may be hokum. People who purchase fortunetelling services may or may not believe in its value. Fortunetellers may sometimes deceive their customers. We need not, however, pass judgment on the validity or value of the speech that fortunetelling entails. If Montgomery County is concerned that fortunetellers will engage in fraudulent conduct, the County can enforce fraud laws in the event that fraud occurs. The County need not, and must not, enforce a law that unduly burdens protected speech to accomplish its goal. Such a law will curtail and have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Nefedro later amended his complaint to also allege a claim, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006), that Leggett, individually, had deprived Nefedro of his First Amendment rights.

What is ultimately being restricted here is pure <em>speech\u2014i.e., </em>the telling of fortunes\u2014not conduct involving \u201cspeech\u201d and \"nonspeech elements,\u201d like the burning of draft cards that was at issue in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 376-77, 88 S.Ct. at 1678-79, 20 L.Ed.2d at 679-80. The cases we discuss above support that conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Treasury, </em>513 U.S. 454, 115 S.Ct. 1003, 130 L.Ed.2d 964 (considering a restriction on honoraria for speech to be a restriction on speech, not expressive conduct); <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, </em>502 U.S. 105, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (considering a restriction on payment for speech to be a restriction on speech, not expressive conduct).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">.

The Ordinance specifically prohibits only the receipt of remuneration or gratuity for fortunetelling by \"cards, palm reading or any other scheme, practice or device.\u201d The County asserts that the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201cscheme\u201d and \u201cdevice\u201d refer only to deceptive practices, and, accordingly, the Ordinance is narrowly tailored. We disagree. Regardless of whether the County has correctly interpreted these two words, the County has ignored the word \u201cpractice.\u201d The common meaning of \"practice\u201d is certainly not limited to deceptive practices. <em>See </em>Webster's II New College Dictionary 887-88 (3rd Ed. 2005) (defining \"practice,\u201d in relevant part, as \"the act or process of doing something: performance\u201d or \u201c[ejxercise of an occupation or profession &lt;the <em>practice </em>of dentistry &gt;\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">. The County argues that its deceptive trade practices ordinance may not be effective for combating the fortunetelling-related fraud it seeks to prevent. That does not save the Fortunetelling Ordinance. If the County is correct that more is needed to address fraud, it may certainly pass an appropriate ordinance that does not infringe on protected speech.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">. The County argues that the Fortunetelling Ordinance is necessary because \"[a]ttempting to address the consequence of ... fraud, after the fact, is hardly as effective as the prophylactic measure that the County has enacted\u201d and because it is \"more efficient to simply ban the fraudulent practice.\u201d This is a grave misunderstanding of the First Amendment, which forbids this sort of unfettered infringement on speech in the pursuit of governmental goals, even legitimate ones. <em>See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 245, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 1399, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, 417 (2002) (\"The prospect of crime ... by itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">.

Eli, </em>20 Md.App. 269, 315 A.2d 136 (1974). The County argues that in neither case did we nor the Court of Special Appeals \"address, <em>sua sponte, </em>the constitutionality of fortunetelling laws.\u201d This argument has no weight because, of course, neither we nor the intermediate appellate court must address issues that are not before us. Similarly irrelevant are other statutes, including those from other counties in Maryland, that prohibit fortunetelling businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b635-6\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">I dissent from the reasoning and conclusion reached in the Majority Opinion, namely, that Montgomery County Code \u00a7 32-7<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the \u201cFortunetelling Ordinance\u201d), which prohibits generally persons from demanding or accepting any remuneration or gratuity for forecasting or foretelling, or pretending to forecast or foretell, the future by cards, palm reading, or any other scheme, practice, or device, represents an unconstitutional restriction upon the Appellant\u2019s, Nick Nefedro\u2019s, right to freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Majority Opinion observes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APR\">the County repeatedly asserts ... that fortunetelling is \u201cinherently fraudulent\u201d and, as a result, should not receive any First Amendment protection. Indeed, the First Amendment does not protect fraudulent statements. <em>Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Assocs., </em>538 U.S. 600, 612, 123 S.Ct. 1829, 1836, 155 L.Ed.2d 793, 804 (2003) (\u201c[T]he First Amendment does not shield fraud.\u201d). We are not, however, persuaded that all fortunetelling is fraudulent. While we recognize that some fortunetellers may make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fraudulent statements, just as some lawyers or journalists may, we see nothing in the record to suggest that fortunetelling always involves fraudulent statements. Indeed, fortunetellers, like magicians or horoscope writers, are able to provide entertainment to their customers or some benefit that does not deceive those who receive their speech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Maj. Op. at 599, 996 A.2d at 858. The Majority Opinion, in the face of a tide of judicial decisions from other jurisdictions expressing the view that the <em>business </em>of commercial fortunetelling is \u201cinherently fraudulent\u201d and, as such, is not entitled to protection against government restriction, offers a handful of contrary opinions (Maj. op. at 599-600, 996 A.2d at 858-59), endeavors to distinguish the greater body of cases on point (Maj. op. at 599-602, 996 A.2d at 858-60), and hazards an inapt analogy to lawyers and journalists (Maj. op. at 599-600, 996 A.2d at 858-59), the latter of which fails to recognize that, although some lawyers or journalists may make fraudulent statements, the practice of such professions without fraud is attainable. I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and hold that Montgomery County\u2019s election to protect its citizens (and their money and other assets) from for-profit fortunetellers, palmists, card readers, and the like, does not violate Appellant\u2019s constitutional right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Long-standing Supreme Court precedent establishes that the guarantees of the First Amendment do not provide insulation from government restriction of speech that is fraudulent. <em>See Illinois ex rel.

Harford County, </em>No. L-01-3998 (D.Md. Sept. 5, 2002), upheld, on summary judgment, the constitutionality of anti-fortunetelling statutes passed by the City of Aberdeen and Harford County that are nearly identical to \u00a7 32-7 of the Montgomery County Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Mitchell, </em>the plaintiff, claiming that she was \u201ca psychic capable of divining the future through the use of Tarot readings, palm readings, and dream analysis,\u201d sought to open a fortunetelling business in Aberdeen. Slip op. at 2. Both the City and the County, however, had ordinances prohibiting persons from engaging in fortunetelling for consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Specifically, the City\u2019s statute, which was adopted in 1979, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person in the Incorporated Town of Aberdeen to ask, demand, charge or accept any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>remuneration, gratuity or anything of value for forecasting, foretelling or pretending to forecast or foretell the future of another by cards, palm reading or any other scheme, practice or device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1. Similarly, the Harford County Code provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Any person in the county who shall ask, demand, charge or accept any remuneration, gratuity or anything of value for forecasting or foretelling or for pretending to forecast or foretell the future of another, by cards, palmreading or any other scheme, practice of [sic] device, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1-2. The plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the respective statutes, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that they \u201cviolate[d] the guarantees of free speech contained in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In rejecting the plaintiffs contentions and granting summary judgment in favor of the governmental defendants, Judge Legg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">As a general rule, the government may not abridge the public\u2019s right to free speech. The Supreme Court has held, however, that \u201c[u]ntruthful speech, commercial or otherwise\u201d is not protected. <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizen\u2019s [Citizens </em>] <em>Consumer Council, </em>425 U.S. 748, 771 [96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 846] (1976). In keeping with this principle, courts have deferred to the determinations of municipalities and legislatures that \u201cthe business of fortunetelling is inherently deceptive....\u201d <em>In re Bartha, </em>63 Cal.App.3d 584, 591 [134 Cal.Rptr. 39] (1976). This Court will defer to the legislative finding of the City and Harford County that fortunetelling is inherently deceptive and, therefore, is unprotected speech. Accordingly, Mitchell\u2019s First Amendment claim must fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 3. The District Court observed further that, \u201c[e]ven if fortunetelling were protected speech, the statutes would withstand constitutional scrutiny,\u201d opining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The statutes do not target the speech itself, but instead the noncommunicative act of selling the speech. Thus, <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367 [88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672] (1968), provides the applicable legal test for determining the constitutionality of the statutes.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><em>O\u2019Brien </em>establishes a four part test for evaluating the constitutionality of regulations that target noncommunicative acts, but have the incidental effect of suppressing speech. <em>Id. </em>at 377 [88 S.Ct. 1673]. Specifically a statute must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">(i) be within the constitutional power of the government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">(ii) be unrelated to the suppression of free expression;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">(iii) further an important or substantial government interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">(iv) restrict speech no greater than is necessary to achieve the government interest at stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">The statutes clearly satisfy the first three requirements. First, it is within the constitutional power of the government to regulate fortunetelling. Second, the purpose of the statutes is to prevent fraud, not to suppress fortunetelling altogether. Preventing fraud is an important government interest. <em>See Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 306 [60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213] (1940). Thus, the crucial question is whether the statutes restrict more speech than is necessary to prevent fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">Anti-fortunetelling statutes are designed to prevent <em>\u201c </em>\u2018a prevailing species of fraud whereby its practitioners, professing occult powers of prognostication, annually bilk a gullible public of many millions of dollars! \u201d <em>Ballard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>Walker, </em>772 F.Supp. 1335, 1341 (E.D.N.Y.1991) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 165.35 (McKinney 1988) (practice commentary at p. 254)). Courts have held that it is within the police power of the state to enact such regulations, and court should defer to legislative determinations that the \u201cregulation or prohibition [of fortune-telling] is required in order to protect the gullible, superstitious, and unwary.\u201d <em>In re Bartha, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at 591 [134 Cal.Rptr. 39].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">[The plaintiff] argues that the statutes could be amended to prohibit <em>fraudulent </em>fortunetelling for consideration, as opposed to prohibiting all fortunetelling for consideration. Presumably such a statute would make it illegal for any fortuneteller to represent an ability to see the future if they did not genuinely believe that they did, indeed, possess such an ability. [The plaintiff] has submitted an affidavit attesting to the sincerity of her belief in her ability to divine the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">The sincerity of [the plaintiffs] beliefs is immaterial. Neither she nor anyone else can foretell the future. The law does not permit the sale of a bogus cancer remedy, for example, simply because the seller wholeheartedly believes in the efficacy of the product. The sincerity of the seller\u2019s belief does not turn a worthless product or service into a valuable one. The state is empowered to protect the public, especially the most gullible and unsophisticated members of the public, by banning the sale of valueless products and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">It must be remembered that the statutes do not ban fortunetellers from telling fortunes. The practitioner may claim to have occult powers so long as she does not charge for her services. Moreover, the fortuneteller may charge a fee so long as she does not claim to have occult powers she lacks. Fortunetelling as entertainment is entirely legal and not banned by the statutes. Accordingly, the statutes do not violate the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Although the District Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mitchell </em>is not binding upon this Court for at least a couple of reasons, it is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in my view, sufficiently persuasive as to move me to conclude that affirmance of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County is the correct outcome in the present case. The Fortunetelling Ordinance contained in the Montgomery County Code is, in essence, identical to the provisions upheld against First Amendment challenge by the District Court in its decision in <em>Mitchell. </em>By limiting its application to what many jurisdictions have concluded to be the inherently fraudulent business of fortunetelling for remuneration, rather than preventing all fortunetelling, the ordinance restricts no more speech than is necessary to further the County\u2019s expressed and significant interest in preventing fraud from being perpetrated upon its citizens. The Majority opinion, deeming itself more insightful about the nature of commercial fortunetelling than the largely factual assessment of the Montgomery County government, substitutes its judgment for that of the legislative body. I, on the other hand, would hold that \u00a7 32-7 of the Montgomery County Code does not restrict impermissibly Appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">.
