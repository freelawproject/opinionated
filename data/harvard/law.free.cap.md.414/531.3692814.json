The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge\u2019s silence amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>acquittals on the six counts. This Court granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari which challenged that holding by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The facts pertinent to the issue before us are as follows. The respondent Andre Lynn Prue and his girlfriend, Barbara Kidd, were riding on a motorcycle on Smallwood Drive in Waldorf, Maryland. The trial judge, at the conclusion of Prue\u2019s nonjury trial, found as a fact that Prue and Kidd were jointly operating the motorcycle when it careened into the guardrail and curb of a bridge on Smallwood Drive. Kidd was killed and Prue was severely injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Prue was charged, in the Circuit Court for Charles County, with the following nine offenses: vehicular manslaughter (count 1), vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se </em>(count 2), vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol (count 3), vehicular homicide while impaired by alcohol (count 4), driving while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se </em>(count 5), driving while under the influence of alcohol (count 6), driving while impaired by alcohol (count 7), reckless driving (count 8), and possession of marijuana (count 9). Prue waived his right to a jury trial, and his nonjury trial in the Circuit Court for Charles County took place over several days in March 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On the last day of the trial, prior to closing arguments, the prosecuting attorney raised with the trial judge an issue concerning the possible merger of certain charges, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEz\">\u201cYour Honor, I think when all is said and done, out of the nine counts you have on the indictment, there are only two counts the court needs ... to decide. That would be count one, the manslaughter count, and count nine, the possession of marijuana L jcount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The prosecuting attorney then proceeded to review the evidence relating to the marijuana charge. While the attorney for the State was concluding his review of this evidence, the court interrupted him and asked whether count 2, vehicular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>homicide while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se, </em>would merge into count 1, the manslaughter charge. The record reflects the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: [A]ll this has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, [that] Mr. Prue was, in fact, in possession of that marijuana, that was found by Officer St. Germain. Of the other eight counts, counts two through eight, we\u2019re going\u2014are going to merge into count one, manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201cEverything else is (unintelligible) defense. So let\u2019s talk about\u2014let\u2019s talk about that. Lastly before\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Does two merge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Yes, because it is going to be\u2014all count two is, is a homicide under the influence. A lesser included of manslaughter. Manslaughter requires gross negligence. Well, okay, I guess we could take\u2014we could say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s a different element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsX\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY:\u2014count two\u2014count two requires the BAC, plus negligence, plus death. Where manslaughter requires gross negligence plus death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, so, I would agree with you on the other ones though. I think the other ones pretty well merge into two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: So absolutely. Absolutely-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-17\">\u201cPROSECUTING ATTORNEY: But I think in terms of sentencing, should the court find him guilty in both counts one and two, I think the court (unintelligible) sentences. So all right, we\u2019re fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cReally the issue though comes down to\u2014to gross negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The attorney for the State then continued his review of the evidence, pointing out that the defendant had admitted to drinking alcohol on the night of the accident. Defense counsel made no comment regarding the possible merger of charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Following closing arguments by both the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, the trial judge rendered findings of fact on the contested factual issues. The judge ultimately concluded that Prue\u2019s \u201cconduct evidence[d] a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The trial judge then announced the verdicts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cSo we will enter verdicts of guilty on count one [vehicular manslaughter], two [vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se </em>] and nine [possession of marijuana]. Sufficient to say the evidence is uncontradicted as to count nine, possession of marijuana. Okay. When do you want sentencing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">There were no verdicts announced with respect to counts 3 through 8. Although the transcript does not reflect any mention of counts 3 through 8 by the trial judge during his rendition of the verdicts or thereafter during the final day of the trial, the docket entry for that day of the trial reads (corrected for typographical errors):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201cOpinion given by Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">Court finds Deft guilty of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">Count 1\u2014Negligent Manslaughter\u2014Auto/Boat/Other Vehicle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">Count 2\u2014Negligent Homicide\u2014Other Vehicle Under Influence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">Count 9\u2014Possession\u2014Marijuana</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfW\">Count 3 thru 8 to merge with Count 2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">On May 11, 2007, Prue was sentenced on count 1 to ten years in prison with all but four years suspended. On count 2, charging vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se, </em>Prue was sentenced to serve two years incarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tion, concurrent with the sentence on count 1. Finally, he received a suspended sentence on count 9, the possession of marijuana charge. Prue was also ordered to serve four years of supervised probation upon his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Prue noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that, because the trial court did not render verdicts on counts 3 through 8, the docket entries should be corrected to reflect an acquittal on those charges. Prue also argued that the trial court erred by imposing separate sentences for vehicular manslaughter (count 1), and vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se </em>(count 2). He further contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals rejected Prue\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, but agreed with Prue\u2019s two other allegations of error. The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge\u2019s silence on counts 3 through 8 amounted to acquittals on those counts and ordered that the docket entries be corrected to reflect this. The intermediate appellate court also held that the two-year sentence on count 2 should have merged into the ten-year sentence for vehicular manslaughter. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentence on count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The State petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the trial court\u2019s silence on counts 3 through 8 constituted an acquittal on each of those counts. The State did not challenge the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision with regard to count 2, and Prue did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. This Court granted the State\u2019s petition. <em>State v. Andre Lynn Prue, </em>407 Md. 529, 967 A.2d 182 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The Court of Special Appeals and both parties in this Court correctly viewed this case as one where the trier of facts failed to render verdicts on counts 3 through 8. Where the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>facts in a criminal case fails to render verdicts on certain counts, Maryland law is firmly settled. Unless one of a few well-established exceptions apply, when rendering verdicts in a multicount charging document, silence by a trial judge or jury on one count is equivalent to an acquittal on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Initially under Maryland law, when the trier of facts rendered a guilty verdict on one or more counts of a multicount indictment but failed to render a verdict on one or more other counts in the same indictment, the action by the trier of facts was treated as a complete nullity as to all of the counts, and the defendant could be tried again on all of the counts in the indictment. Thus, in <em>The State v. Sutton, 4 </em>Gill. 494 (1846), involving a two-count indictment, the jury found the defendant guilty on one count but omitted to render a verdict on the other count. This Court, in deciding that the action of the jury was a nullity but that the defendant could be retried on both counts, held as follows (4 Gill, at 497-498):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cThe law seems to be well settled upon authority, that if a jury find but a part of the matters put in issue, and say nothing as to the rest, it is ill. <em>King v. Hayes, 2 Ld. Raymond [1518,] 1521 [ (1727) ]....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201cIf the law requires all the matters involved in a single issue, to be found by the jury, unquestionably, it requires, where there are two or more issues submitted to the finding of the jury, that they should find upon each, and all, of the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cThis verdict, therefore, in the language of the books, was ill, and should have been set aside by the [trial] Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALe\"><em>See also State v. Flannigan, </em>6 Md. 167, 171-172 (1854).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The holding in <em>The State v. Sutton, supra, </em>remained the law of Maryland for more than 50 years. In <em>Hechter v. State, </em>94 Md. 429, 442, 50 A. 1041, 1043 (1902), however, this Court overruled <em>Sutton </em>and held that silence by the trier of facts on some counts, when the formal verdicts are rendered, ordinarily constitutes an acquittal as to those counts. Judge Fowler for the Court in <em>Hechter, </em>94 Md. at 440, 50 A. at 1042, initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>observed that the English decision upon which the <em>Sutton </em>case relied, <em>King v. Hayes, supra, </em>\u201chas been discredited even in England.\u201d Judge Fowler went on to discuss or cite numerous cases in other states, a leading English opinion, and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Selvester v. United States, </em>170 U.S. 262, 18 S.Ct. 580, 42 L.Ed. 1029 (1898), all of which were inconsistent with the rule applied in the <em>Sutton </em>case. The Court in <em>Hechter </em>then stated (94 Md. at 442, 50 A. at 1043):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cWe conclude, therefore, that the weight of modern authority is opposed to the rule laid down in <em>State v. Sutton, supra, </em>and that we ought not any longer be bound by it ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQs\">In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Selvester </em>opinion and the other cases discussed or cited, this Court in <em>Hechter </em>held as follows (94 Md. at 443, 50 A. at 1043, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">\u201c[A]s we have held, the ... verdict, although it found only on the first and second counts and was silent as to the third and fourth, must be regarded, <em>as a matter of law, </em>as a verdict of not guilty on them....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">This Court has consistently adhered to the holding in <em>Hechter. </em>Thus, in <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 523, 60 A.2d 216, 219 (1948), the Court reiterated (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cSince the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Hechter v. State, </em>94 Md. 429, 50 A. 1041, 56 L.R.A. 457, there has been no question that a verdict, finding a traverser guilty under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>one count of an indictment containing several counts and being silent as to the remaining counts, is a valid verdict and <em>is equivalent to a verdict of not guilty as to the remaining counts. </em>This case expressly overruled the case of <em>State v. Sutton, </em>4 Gill. 494, which held to the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK8\">Furthermore, the legal principle set forth in <em>Hechter </em>is fully applicable in a nonjury criminal case. In <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 306, 146 A.2d 424, 428 (1958), Judge Hammond for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cThe trial judge explicitly and specifically found Bafford and Felkner guilty on the first count and not guilty on the fifth count, but made no mention whatever of the second, third and fourth counts. This amounted to a finding of not guilty on the second, third and fourth counts. <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 523 [60 A.2d 216].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Similarly, <em>Reed v. State, </em>225 Md. 566, 171 A.2d 464 (1961), was a nonjury case in which Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e for the Court held as follows (225 Md. at 570, 171 A.2d at 466):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cThe absence of any docket entry recording the court\u2019s finding on count 14 has no effect upon the findings of guilt on counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 or 13 nor upon the validity of the sentence imposed under those counts; but the absence of any finding on that count is equivalent to a finding of not guilty thereunder. Cf. <em>Hechter v. State, </em>94 Md. 429, 50 A. 1041; <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 60 A.2d 216; <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 306, 146 A.2d 424.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\"><em>See Jackson v. State, </em>231 Md. 591, 595-596, 191 A.2d 432, 434 (1963) (\u201cThe trial court made no finding as to the fourth count, and we have held that this is equivalent to an acquittal thereunder\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 190, 486 A.2d 200, 203 (1985); <em>Sweetwine v.

United States, supra, </em>170 U.S. at 270, 18 S.Ct. at 583, 42 L.Ed. at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 190-191, 78 S.Ct. 221, 225, 2 L.Ed.2d 199, 206 (1957), where the defendant was convicted on a count charging second degree murder but the jury failed to return a verdict on a count charging first degree murder, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Black, held that the absence of a verdict on the count was \u201can implicit acquittal on the charge of first degree murder\u201d and that, \u201cunder established principles of former jeopardy,\u201d the defendant \u201ccould not be retried for that offense.\u201d Later in the opinion, 355 U.S. at 194 n. 14, 78 S.Ct. at 227 n. 14, 2 L.Ed.2d at 208 n. 14, Justice Black noted that the bar \u201cof former jeopardy does not rest on [the defendant\u2019s] conviction for second degree murder but instead on\u201d the jury\u2019s failure to render a verdict on the first degree murder count.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">This Court in several cases has discussed the principle that, under <em>Green, </em>a verdict\u2019s silence with regard to a count is ordinarily an implicit acquittal and bars further prosecution on that count. <em>See, e.g., Huffington v. State, supra, </em>302 Md. at 190-191, 486 A.2d at 203-204 (\u201cThe Supreme Court ... treat[ed] the jury\u2019s silence as an implicit acquittal of first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>degree murder and [held] that the retrial of the charge of first degree murder violated Green\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to be placed twice in jeopardy\u201d); <em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 678, 441 A.2d 699, 705 (1982); <em>Sweetwine v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 208-209, 421 A.2d at 65-66. <em>See also Price v. Georgia, </em>398 U.S. 323, 328-329, 90 S.Ct. 1757, 1761, 26 L.Ed.2d 300, 305 (1970) (reaffirming the \u201c \u2018implicit acquittal\u2019 \u201d holding of the <em>Green </em>case); <em>Brazzel v. State of Washington, </em>491 F.3d 976, 978-979, 981-982 (9th Cir.2007) (Discussing and applying the rule that the verdict\u2019s silence on a charge is an implied acquittal which bars further prosecution on the charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Under double jeopardy principles, when action taken on a particular charge is, or legally amounts to, an acquittal, not only is a subsequent separate prosecution prohibited on that charge, but further prosecution on that charge in the same case is prohibited. <em>Smith v. Massachusetts, </em>543 U.S. 462, 125 S.Ct. 1129, 160 L.Ed.2d 914 (2005), and cases there cited; <em>In re Kevin E., </em>402 Md. 624, 632-636, 938 A.2d 826, 830-833 (2008); <em>Giddins v.

Such post verdict action, <em>e.g., </em>making entries on the docket or directing that they be made, certainly can not change what in law is a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict into a \u201cguilty\u201d verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">There are certain well-established exceptions to the principle that the absence of a verdict on a count amounts to an acquittal, and we shall discuss those exceptions later in this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if none of the exceptions were applicable to the present case, when the trial judge as the trier of facts rendered the verdicts in this case without rendering any verdicts on counts 3 through 8, the defendant at that time would have been acquitted on counts 3 through 8. Such acquittals must be accorded finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the view of Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion, the absence of verdicts on counts 3 through 8 is an \u201cambiguous\u201d or \u201cuncertain! ]\u201d factual matter to be clarified by \u201csurrounding circumstances,\u201d namely (1) remarks made prior to closing arguments relating to post-verdict sentencing, and (2) the later clerical event of making entries on the docket. The absence of verdicts on certain counts in a criminal case is not, however, a factual matter to be clarified by earlier remarks of the trial judge or later acts by the clerk. Instead, as held in the leading Maryland case, <em>Hechter v. State, supra, </em>94 Md. at 443, 50 A. at 1043, \u201csilen[ce] as to the third and fourth [counts], <em>must </em>be regarded, as a <em>matter of law, </em>as a verdict of not guilty on them____\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The concurring and dissenting opinion also treats this case as one where the trial judge intended to deliver guilty verdicts on counts 3 through 8 and merge them for sentencing, but the judge simply overlooked those counts when rendering the verdicts. The Supreme Court in <em>Dealy v. United States, </em>152 U.S. 539, 542, 14 S.Ct. 680, 681, 38 L.Ed. 545, 546 (1894), also with regard to a count which was not referred to when the verdicts were rendered, pointed out that \u201c[i]t may have been simply overlooked by the [trier of facts].\u201d Nonetheless, the Supreme Court in <em>Dealy </em>went on to hold that the absence of a verdict on that count \u201cwas doubtless equivalent to a verdict of not guilty as to that count.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Dealy, </em>the legal principle that silence on a count constitutes an acquittal was fully applicable even if the reason for the silence was that the matter was \u201coverlooked.\u201d It is noteworthy that <em>Dealy </em>was relied upon by both the Supreme Court in <em>Selvester v. United States, supra, </em>and by this Court in <em>Hechter v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The theory set forth in the concurring and dissenting opinion, that \u201ca reviewing court may look to the relevant surrounding circumstances to determine the intent of the trier of fact[s]\u201d when the trier of facts fails to render verdicts on some counts of the charging document, is not supported by any opinion of this Court. The only opinion of this Court cited in support of this theory is <em>Simmons v. State, </em>165 Md. 155, 167 A. 60 (1933). Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion relies upon the first part of the following sentence from <em>Simmons, </em>165 Md. at 169, 167 A. at 66 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW-\">\u201cWhere the meaning of the verdict is so unmistakable, mere inartificiality <em>in its form </em>will not be sufficient to defeat justice by a nullification of a verdict which plainly declared the intent of the jury to convict on all the counts charging the crime of false pretenses and to acquit on all the counts charging the crime of larceny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The above sentence relates to the <em>form </em>of a verdict and not the <em>absence </em>of a verdict on a particular count. Also, it is stated in the above-quoted sentence that the source of the plain \u201cintent\u201d is the verdict itself; there is no reference to \u201csurrounding circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Moreover, when the language of <em>Simmons </em>is viewed in context, it is clear that <em>Simmons </em>furnishes no support for Judge Harrell\u2019s theory. The indictment in <em>Simmons </em>contained eighteen counts which \u201ccharged alternately the crimes of larceny and false pretenses.\u201d 165 Md. at 169, 167 A. at 66. Instead of separate verdicts on each of the eighteen counts, the jury\u2019s verdicts were embodied in a single sentence stating: \u201cNot guilty of larceny, but guilty of false pretenses on all counts of the indictment, with recommendation of mercy by the court.\u201d 165 Md. at 169, 167 A. at 66. The issue raised by the defendant Simmons in this Court was that \u201cthe <em>form </em>of the verdict\u201d was erroneous. <em>(Ibid., </em>emphasis added). No argument was made that the verdict was ambiguous. The Court\u2019s statement, that the jury\u2019s intent to convict on certain counts and acquit on certain counts was plain, simply pointed out that the jury\u2019s intent was clearly set forth in the verdict despite the challenged <em>form </em>of the verdict. Nothing was said in the <em>Simmons </em>opinion suggesting that \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d could be examined to determine the intent of the trier of facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Furthermore, neither of the two cases from other jurisdictions, relied on by Judge Harrell, supports his view. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>16 Neb.App. 257, 743 N.W.2d 655 (2007), did not involve the absence of a verdict on a count or anything remotely similar to such absence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The other out-of-state case cited by Judge Harrell, <em>State of Missouri ex rel. Beaird, Prosecuting Attorney v. Del Muro, </em>98 S.W.3d 902 (Mo.App.2003), likewise did not involve the absence of a verdict on a count or counts in a criminal case. In fact, there were no verdicts or counts, and <em>Del Muro </em>was not a criminal case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In addition to being unsupported by any case law, the approach suggested by Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion is flawed and carries with it the danger of serious miscarriages of justice in criminal cases. The \u201csurrounding circumstance\u201d upon which Judge Harrell primarily relies is the colloquy between the trial judge and the prosecuting attorney, prior to closing arguments, concerning possible mergers for purposes of sentencing if guilty verdicts were later rendered. The reasoning seems to be that the trial judge disclosed his intent to merge counts 3 through 8 into count 2 if there was a guilty verdict on count 2, and this in turn, according to Judge Harrell\u2019s opinion, revealed \u201cthat the trial judge\u2019s crystal clear intent was to ... render guilty verdicts also on Counts 3 through 8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this was the judge\u2019s intent at the time, a trial judge\u2019s intent prior to closing arguments may be entirely different from his or her intent at the time verdicts are rendered. The apparent reasoning in the concurring and dissenting opinion makes closing argument entirely superfluous. Moreover, trial judges often change their minds during trial proceedings. A detailed discussion of a judge\u2019s ability in this regard is contained in <em>Doering v. Fader, </em>316 Md. 351, 558 A.2d 733 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The concurring and dissenting opinion also relies on the clerk\u2019s docket entries stating that counts 3 through 8 are to merge. This is a \u201cbootstrap\u201d argument, as the whole point of the present appellate proceeding is to correct the erroneous docket entries.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record in the present case shows that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>when the verdicts were rendered, there was a failure to render verdicts on counts 3 through 8. The record prevails over the erroneous docket entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The importance of certain and accurate criminal verdicts, in order to insure fairness and justice in criminal cases, has been emphasized by this Court on numerous occasions. More than 100 years ago, our predecessors recognized that the legal requirements applicable to the rendition of verdicts in criminal cases \u201care supported by reasons of justice and propriety\u201d and are \u201cto secure certainty and accuracy____\u201d <em>Givens v. State, </em>76 Md. 485, 486-488, 25 A. 689, 689 (1893). Consequently, our opinions have consistently held that the legal requirements applicable to the rendition of verdicts be strictly complied with. <em>See, e.g., State v. Santiago, </em>412 Md. 28, 985 A.2d 556 (2009); <em>Jones v. State, </em>384 Md. 669, 866 A.2d 151 (2005); <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 165, 472 A.2d 988, 990 (1984); <em>Pugh v. State, supra, </em>271 Md. 701, 319 A.2d 542; <em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 42 A.2d 128 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Although most of the above-cited cases involve requirements applicable to jury verdicts, it is just as important that there be certainty, accuracy, and fairness in the rendition of nonjury verdicts. The rule that absence of a verdict on a particular count is, as a matter of law, a verdict of not guilty fulfills these objectives. The concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s speculation concerning the trial judge\u2019s intent when he failed to render verdicts on certain counts, based on the judge\u2019s comments at other times during the trial, does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">We now turn to the exceptions to the rule that the absence of a verdict on a count constitutes an acquittal. It was earlier noted, <em>supra </em>n. 1, that a \u201chung jury\u201d on a count is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>exception. <em>See Selvester v. United States, supra, </em>170 U.S. at 269-270, 18 S.Ct. at 582-583, 42 L.Ed. at 1032 (\u201c[I]f, on the other hand, after the case had been submitted to the jury, they reported their inability to agree, and the court ... discharged them, such discharge would not be equivalent to an acquittal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Another exception is where the absence of a verdict on a count is pursuant to the court\u2019s instructions or the directions on a verdict sheet. <em>See Cichos v. Indiana, </em>385 U.S. 76, 79-80, 87 S.Ct. 271, 273, 17 L.Ed.2d 175, 178 (1966)(The defendant was charged with two offenses, and the trial court, in accordance with state practice with regard to the particular charges, told \u201c \u2018the jury to return a verdict on only one of the charges\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Moulden, supra, </em>292 Md. at 678-679, 441 A.2d at 705-706 (\u201cBecause of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it need not consider\u201d one count if it found the defendant guilty on another count, and since it did find the defendant guilty on the latter count, \u201cin a real sense the [former] count was not submitted to the jury for its consideration. * * * Consequently, in the present case we believe that the jury\u2019s silence regarding the [former] count did not amount to an acquittal under the principles set forth in <em>Green v. United States </em>\u201d). <em>Cf. State v. Frye, </em>283 Md. 709, 723-724, 393 A.2d 1372, 1379-1380 (1978)(This Court referred to the \u201cnormal\u201d practice with regard to certain charges of instructing the jurors that, if the verdict on one count is guilty, they should not consider the other count).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">A third exception to the rule may be applicable to some of the counts in the present case. The exception is where there is a guilty verdict on a count charging a greater offense, and silence on a count charging an offense which is lesser included under the so-called required evidence test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This exception was recognized in Maryland when <em>State v. Sutton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>supra, </em>4 Gill. 494, was the prevailing precedent, and it has continued to be recognized after <em>Hechter v. State, supra, </em>94 Md. 429, 50 A. 1041. As our cases have pointed out, the exception is based on simple logic. If the greater offense contains all of the elements of the lesser included offense, a guilty verdict on the count charging the greater offense necessarily means that the defendant was also guilty of the lesser included offense. <em>See, e.g., Manly v. State, </em>7 Md. 135, 150-151 (1854) (\u201cSo on an indictment containing counts for robbery, and an assault with intent to rob, ... [and if] the accused be convicted of the actual robbery, how could the jury with any consistency say that he was not guilty of the intent to rob? * * * The higher crime necessarily merges the inferior of-fence\u201d); <em>Stevens v. State, </em>66 Md. 202, 204, 7 A. 254, 255 (1886)(The defendant was charged in the first count with rape and in the second count with assault with intent to rape, and the jury found him guilty of rape but delivered no verdict on the second count. The Court, saying that \u201c[i]t is manifest that the first count includes the offence set forth in the second,\u201d held that \u201cwhen there is a verdict of guilty on the first count there is a merger of the minor offense\u201d); <em>Murphy v. State, </em>184 Md. 70, 81-82, 40 A.2d 239, 244 (1944). <em>See also State v. Moulden, supra, </em>292 Md. at 678-679, 441 A.2d at 705-706.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals erroneously held that the rule treating silence on a count as an acquittal \u201capplies even where the court renders a verdict on greater inclusive counts and is silent as to the lesser included counts.\u201d Consequently, the Court of Special Appeals did not analyze the elements of the offenses charged in counts 3 through 8 to determine whether they, or some of them, were lesser included offenses under the required evidence test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Furthermore, neither the trial court nor the parties have done so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment which directs the Circuit Court to correct the docket entries regarding counts 3 through 8. We remand the case to the Court of Special Appeals for that court to determine whether the offenses charged in counts 3 through 8, or any of them, are lesser included offenses under the required evidence test. The docket entries should be corrected only with respect to those offenses which are not included within the crimes charged in counts 1 or 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.

The Supreme Court in <em>Selvester </em>indicated, however, that further prosecution on a count where there was silence would violate the double jeopardy prohibition. <em>See also Dealy v.

In <em>Pugh v.

Any attempt to do so by the prosecutor is barred by what at common law was the plea of autrefois acquit. Thus, in <em>State v. Shields, </em>49 Md. 301, 303 (1878), our predecessors declined to construe a statute as permitting the State to appeal a verdict of acquittal, saying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">'It has always been a settled rule of the common law that after an acquittal of a party upon a regular trial on an indictment for either a felony or a misdemeanor, the verdict of acquittal can never afterward, on the application of the prosecutor ... be set aside.... \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The Court in Shields went on to point out that it made no difference whether the acquittal was based on a mistake of law or a mistake of fact.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The language from Shields has been reiterated time after time by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. As discussed later, one of the exceptions may well be applicable in this case, at least in part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\">. To the contrary, the Court in <em>Simmons </em>examined only the language of the verdict itself. After stating that the jury\u2019s finding \"was responsive, certain and complete, within the comprehension of laymen, and, so, of the court,\u201d 165 Md. at 170, 167 A. at 66, this Court continued <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeK\">\"As said in <em>Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Procedure, </em>sec. 1005 a(l): \u2018The language of the verdict, being that of \"lay people,\u201d need not follow the strict rules of pleading, or be otherwise technical. Whatever conveys the idea to the common understanding will suffice. And all fair intendment will be made to support it.\u2019 Therefore, if the counts are numbered, the verdict may be guilty on specified numbers, and not guilty on others; or the acquittal or conviction may be by naming the offense, as if there are counts for larceny and for embezzlement the verdict of 'guilty of embezzlement and not guilty of larceny\u2019 will be as good as giving the number of the embezzlement count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Pettiford and Berry v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 560, 569, 261 A.2d 216, 221 (1970), also cited in Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion, similarly misinterpreted the <em>Simmons </em>case. In addition, the intermediate appellate court in <em>Pettiford </em>erroneously called the <em>Simmons </em>verdict \"indefinite.\u201d This Court in <em>Simmons, </em>however, characterized the verdict as \"unmistakable\u201d and one \"which plainly declared the intent of the jury.\u201d 165 Md. at 169, 167 A. at 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\">. Instead, <em>Braider </em>concerned an argument that a conviction was ambiguous because the word \"or\u201d was used in connection with two related crimes involving alcohol and driving. The Nebraska Court of Appeals held that Brauer\u2019s argument lacked merit and that it was clear that the defendant was convicted of both offenses. The Nebraska Court of Appeals, in its review of the applicable law, stated (16 Neb.App. at 261, 743 N.W.2d at 658-659, internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cResolution of this issue requires us to ascertain the meaning of the county court\u2019s judgment.

Moreover, the concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s reliance upon so-called \"surrounding circumstances\u201d is inconsistent with the Nebraska court\u2019s statement that the meaning of a judgment is determined, as a matter of law, by its contents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. <em>Del Muro </em>was an original certiorari action in an intermediate appellate court, authorized under Missouri law, to review the order in a habeas corpus case granting a writ of habeas corpus.

In its opinion upholding the issuance of the writ, the Missouri Court of Appeals indicated that the language of the judgment in the probation revocation case was ambiguous with regard to the grounds for revocation.

The colloquy between the trial judge and the prosecuting attorney prior to closing arguments, discussing possible merger, did not involve any discussion of the elements of the offenses charged in counts 3 through 8. In addition, the discussion did not mention the required evidence test. There are, under Maryland law, grounds for merger other than the required evidence test, such as the rule of lenity, the fact that historically certain offenses merged into others, or considerations of fairness in a particular case. <em>See, e.g., Williams v.

The Majority Opinion opines that further proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals are required in order to determine whether any or all of the offenses charged in Counts 3 through 8 constitute lesser included offenses of the flagship charges, and that, to the extent Counts 3 through 8 are not lesser included offenses, the docket entries should be changed to reflect acquittals on those counts. In my view, such a remand is unnecessary because the record, including the trial judge\u2019s comments immediately prior to closing arguments regarding the potential merger of Counts 3 through 8 with Count 2 if a guilty verdict on Count 2 were to be rendered, and the consistent docket entries reflecting that result, demonstrate clearly the trial judge\u2019s unambiguous intent to convict Respondent on Counts 3 through 8. As such, I would hold that the trial judge, in fact, was not silent as to verdicts on Counts 3 through 8 when the record as a whole is considered, and that the docket entries should not be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In reaching its conclusion that the trial judge was silent as to Counts 3 through 8, the Majority Opinion asserts that, because the rendition of a formal verdict in a bench trial is confined ordinarily to a specific portion of the trial, recourse to relevant comments made by the trial judge immediately prior to closing arguments or relevant matters occurring immediately following formal announcement of the verdict is not permitted in resolving what was the intended disposition of the charges. In this regard, I disagree with the Majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Where there is uncertainty regarding a verdict, a reviewing court may look to the relevant surrounding circumstances to determine the intent of the trier of fact. <em>See Pettiford v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>State, </em>8 Md.App. 560, 569, 261 A.2d 216, 221 (1970) (citing <em>Simmons v.

As part of the \u201csurrounding circumstances,\u201d a reviewing court may consider relevant statements and exchanges appearing in the record outside the formal recitation of the verdict, as well as the docket entries purporting to reflect the verdict. <em>Barber v.

The record of the discussion between the trial judge and the State prior to closing argument demonstrates that the trial judge agreed (and the defense apparently did not disagree) that any convictions on Counts 3 through 8 would merge with Count 2 upon a finding of guilt on Count 2, due to the former being lesser included offenses of the flagship Count 2. In addition, the clerk\u2019s docket entry regarding the trial judge\u2019s verdict, stating that Counts 3 through 8 merged with Count 2, provides a clear indication and understanding of that intent on the part of the trial judge with regards to those counts. Despite his omission in the formal oral rendition of the verdict of specific guilty verdicts for each count of the indictment, the trial judge intended to find Respondent guilty of Counts 3 through 8 by virtue of finding him guilty of Count 2. Thus, I would hold that the trial judge in fact did render verdicts as to Counts 3 through 8 and that, therefore, the docket entries should not be amended. As such, remand to the Court of Special Appeals for further consideration regarding whether Counts 3 through 8 constitute lesser included offenses is unnecessary, although I am confident that court will conclude that they are lesser included offenses, whereupon this case will be in the same posture as I propose to leave it now, affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgments.
