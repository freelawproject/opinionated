After his motion for new trial was denied, and sentence imposed, he appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgments in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Yearby then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. We granted his petition to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">Did the State commit a <em>Brady[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>violation by failing to disclose the facts that the police had developed other suspects with respect to a series of robberies that happened in the same area and during the same time frame as the robbery of which Petitioner was accused, and that at least one of those suspects resembled Petitioner?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\"><em>Yearby v. State, </em>411 Md. 355, 983 A.2d 431 (2009). We shall answer \u201cNo\u201d to the question, and consequently, shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">On the night of November 8, 2004, Camille Zongo, a student at Morgan State University in Baltimore, was robbed at gunpoint on campus. After surrendering money to the robber, she began walking toward her dormitory. The gunman ordered her to turn around and walk in the opposite direction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>As she turned around toward him, Ms. Zongo could see her assailant because the area was well-lit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She later described him as a black male, with a \u201clow haircut\u201d and a caramel complexion, about 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall, and wearing a white shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In late 2004, there had been a series of other armed robberies in and around the Morgan State campus\u2014at least fourteen had been reported to police. Detective James B. Harrison of the Morgan State University Police Department was assigned the duty to investigate; in the course of his investigation, Yearby, who also was a student at Morgan State, filed a complaint with campus police claiming he had been assaulted. Harrison\u2019s suspicions heightened when, shortly afterward, Yearby\u2019s roommate, Daryl Gates, was the victim of a more serious assault. There were rumors about campus that Yearby and Gates had been responsible for the robbery spree and that those suspicions had fueled the assaults against Yearby and Gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Detective Harrison came to suspect Yearby in the robbery against Ms. Zongo and decided to prepare a photo array that included Yearby\u2019s college photo ID. Ms. Zongo selected Year-by\u2019s photo from the array, telling Harrison she was \u201cpositive\u201d he was the robber. After obtaining an arrest warrant, Detective Harrison, while interviewing Yearby, ostensibly concerning the assault against him, instead, arrested Yearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Yearby was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon; robbery; first degree assault; second degree assault; theft of goods with value less than $500; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; and use of a handgun during the commission of a felony or crime of violence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Yearby filed a motion to suppress Ms. Zongo\u2019s pretrial identification. Detective Harrison testified at the hearing on that motion, setting forth the background surrounding the case, and the reasons his investigation focused on Yearby as the perpetrator of the armed robbery. Defense counsel questioned him about whether there were other suspects in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, these\u2014when you put together this photo array, did you ever consult with Baltimore City Police Department for possible persons of interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZv\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did you come up with any information from Baltimore City as to possible suspects?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: No. Not at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQx\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did you have other possible suspects during the investigation before you did the photo array?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Like I said, there was\u2014there was\u2014I believe they had within that time, during that time, they\u2019ve had, like, fourteen armed robberies at that time, so it was just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My question is, did you have other suspects?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did you put any of those other suspects in the photo array?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. And can you identify which of these photos were the other suspects?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Not at that time, there wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: I didn\u2019t put any of them in that photo array.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, what photo array did you put them in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Another photo array [that I did not show to Ms. Zongo].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">[DETECTIVE HARRISON]: Okay. What happened was, there were fourteen armed robberies in the area at that time. So quite naturally I have a number of different suspects, but what I did is, they were subsequently identified by other students and I did put a photo array involving Mr. Yearby\u2019s picture. The one that I showed her, since it did state that he was a light-skinned male, I showed her his picture and that [was] the only photo array that I showed her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The court denied Yearby\u2019s motion to suppress, and Ms. Zongo\u2019s pretrial identification subsequently was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Voir dire and jury selection took place the following day, and trial began on May 9, 2007. Ms. Zongo testified that Yearby was her assailant, and later authenticated her extrajudicial identification in front of the jury. Detective Harrison also testified, corroborating Ms. Zongo\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">During re-cross examination of Harrison, the defense pressed him about \u201cthe other suspects that [he] developed not matching ... Yearby\u2019s description.\u201d Counsel then asked whether Harrison had provided any of his reports concerning the other robberies that had been under investigation at the same time he was investigating this case. Harrison answered \u201cNo,\u201d and when defense counsel persisted in this line of questioning, the prosecutor objected. A bench conference then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: [The defense] does have some of that information. (Inaudible) second case, has the information. Defense has it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Inaudible) fourteen armed robberies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There\u2019s fourteen armed robberies. He hasn\u2019t said how many other people there are. I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: And [defense counsel] did her own investigation and put another suspect, who was also one of those suspects, and showed it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>And looks just like my guy. </em>If she wants to go down that road, we can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s just end it here ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The jury convicted Yearby of robbery, second degree assault, and theft of goods with value less than $500, and acquitted him of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Yearby filed a timely motion for new trial, asserting that the State had violated <em>Brady </em>by failing to disclose that Detective Harrison \u201chad developed additional suspects at the time he administered the photographic line-up to Ms. Zongo,\u201d that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument had been \u201cloaded with improper remarks,\u201d that the trial court erroneously had denied a defense motion for mistrial and further had refused to give a curative instruction to correct repeated attempts by the prosecutor to introduce hearsay, and that the evidence was insufficient. After a hearing, the court denied Yearby\u2019s motion. Yearby was sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended to time already served, with three years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">Yearby appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, claiming that the trial court had erred in denying his motion for new trial because the State had violated <em>Brady. </em>He also contended in the intermediate appellate court that the trial judge had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>committed plain error by failing to take any curative action in response to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmultiple improper comments\u201d during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgments of the trial court in an unreported opinion. Yearby filed a petition for certiorari, limited to the <em>Brady </em>issue, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218 (1963), that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d The Court subsequently has refined and elaborated on this holding, extending the categories of evidence that must be disclosed, <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104, 108 (1972) (impeachment evidence), and, when evidence is \u201chighly probative of innocence,\u201d relieving the accused of the burden of making a request. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 353 (1976); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 346, 768 A.2d 675, 682 (2001); <em>see also Diallo v. State, </em>413 Md. 678, 706-08, 994 A.2d 820, 837-38 (2010) (discussing a prosecutor\u2019s duty to discover and disclose exculpatory evidence known to other state actors).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">There are, however, limits to the prosecutor\u2019s automatic duty of disclosure. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 675 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380 n. 7, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 489 n. 7 (1985) (\u201cAn interpretation of <em>Brady </em>to create a broad, constitutionally required right of discovery \u2018would entirely alter the character and balance of our present systems of criminal justice.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Giles v. Maryland, </em>386 U.S. 66, 117, 87 S.Ct. 793, 819, 17 L.Ed.2d 737, 769 (1967)) (Harlan, J., dissenting). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201ca rule that the prosecutor commits error by any failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused, no matter how insignificant, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>impose an impossible burden on the prosecutor and would undermine the interest in the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 675 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. at 3380 n. 7, 87 L.Ed.2d at 489 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The results of these refinements can be distilled into the following formulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">There are three components of a true <em>Brady </em>violation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANI4\"><em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d 286, 302 (1999); <em>see also Harris v. State, </em>407 Md. 503, 521, 966 A.2d 925, 935 (2009) (noting that, in the context of a <em>Brady </em>claim, evidence \u201cfavorable to the defense\u201d includes mitigation evidence); <em>accord State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 199, 896 A.2d 973, 975-76 (2006); <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 38, 702 A.2d 699, 708 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The prejudice prong is closely related to the question of materiality. <em>Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 698-99, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 1276, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166, 1194-95 (2004). The standard is whether there is a <em>\u201creasonable probability \u201d </em>that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have led to a different result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>S.Ct. 1555, 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, 506 (1995) (emphasis added). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result is ... shown when the government\u2019s evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. at 3381, 87 L.Ed.2d at 491. <em>Accord Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 281, 119 S.Ct. at 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d at 302 (\u201c[Sjtrictly speaking, there is never a real <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Supreme Court has further explicated the materiality standard, explaining that it is essentially the same test as set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in determining whether a defendant has been prejudiced by a constitutional violation affecting his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>3383, 87 L.Ed.2d at 494 (Blackmun, J., plurality). <em>See also </em>6 Wayne R.

He insists that the State was required to disclose information he requested,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concerning these \u201cother suspects\u201d in other robberies, apparently under the theory that the same perpetrator in at least some of the other robberies may also have committed the robbery of Ms. Zongo.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Yearby contends that he has satisfied all three prongs of the <em>Brady </em>analysis: that the prosecutor withheld evidence, which in turn was favorable to him, and that the withheld evidence was material. Consequently, he maintains that the State\u2019s \u201crefus[al]\u201d to disclose the requested information denied him due process of law, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial, and that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The State counters that Yearby failed to satisfy any of the <em>Brady </em>requirements, and that we must therefore affirm the judgment. According to the State, the information it allegedly failed to disclose did not fall within the scope of its <em>Brady </em>obligation, and that, in any event, the information was irrelevant to <em>this </em>case and therefore was immaterial. The State further argues that \u201cthe information Yearby claims was withheld was actually known to the defense during trial, if not before, or readily accessible to [him] through reasonable investigation.\u201d We agree with the State as to the latter argument, and therefore do not reach the issues of materiality, or whether the disputed evidence was exculpatory to Yearby.</p>\n<p id=\"Ale\">Whether the Prosecution Withheld Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Prosecutorial suppression of evidence is a predicate to a <em>Brady </em>claim. Indeed, as the intermediate appellate court explained in its unreported opinion in the present case, \u201c[w]ith regard to suppression of evidence, <em>Brady </em>deals with the issue of withholding the knowledge from the jury, right through to the close of trial.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d at 349 (\u201cThe rule of <em>Brady ... </em>arguably applies in three quite different situations. Each involves the <em>discovery, after trial, of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Conyers v. State, </em>367 Md. 571, 601, 790 A.2d 15, 33 (2002) (explaining that evidence is \u201csuppressed within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>if it is \u2018information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense\u2019\u201d), quoting <em>Spicer v. Roxbury Corr. Inst., </em>194 F.3d 547, 557 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, suppression is inextricably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>intertwined with the timing of disclosure<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s independent duty to investigate, especially in a situation where the defense \u201cwas aware of the potentially exculpatory nature of the evidence as well as its existence.\u201d 6 LaFave, \u00a7 24.3(b), at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We previously have explained that, under <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, the defense is not relieved of its \u201cobligation to investigate the case and prepare for trial.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 39, 702 A.2d at 708. <em>See Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 675, 105 S.Ct. at 3379-80, 87 L.Ed.2d at 489 (noting that <em>Brady\u2019s </em>\u201cpurpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered, ... [and] [t]hus, the prosecutor is not required to deliver his entire file to defense counsel[.]\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[t]he prosecution cannot be said to have suppressed evidence for <em>Brady </em>purposes when the information allegedly suppressed was available to the defendant through reasonable and diligent investigation.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 39, 702 A.2d at 708.

The defendant\u2019s constructive knowledge is assessed under a reasonable person standard. <em>Id. </em>(noting that State is not relieved of its <em>Brady </em>obligation \u201cunless a reasonable defendant would have looked to that public record in the exercise of due diligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We also recently have explained that \u201c[n]either the prosecutor\u2019s negligence, willfulness, [n]or lack of bad faith in failing to produce exculpatory or impeachment information bears on our consideration of whether the defendant\u2019s right to due process was violated under <em>Brady.\u201d Diallo v. State, </em>413 Md. at 705, 994 A.2d at 836. In <em>Diallo, </em>we addressed a <em>Brady </em>claim by the son of a United Nations official. The petitioner in <em>Diallo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>asserted that the U.S. State Department, an alleged \u201cagent\u201d of the prosecutor in Maryland, \u201chad actual knowledge that [Dial-lo] was entitled to diplomatic immunity and that it chose not to convey this information to the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704, 994 A.2d at 835. In determining there had been no <em>Brady </em>violation, we explained that all the evidence allegedly suppressed either \u201cwas know to [Diallo] or he was in a unique position to obtain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 994 A.2d at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we hold that \u201c[t]he rule of <em>Brady </em>\u201d is inapplicable. Defense counsel cross-examined Detective Harrison about other possible suspects, both during the pre-trial suppression hearing and at trial. From the suppression hearing transcript, we can glean that Yearby knew, prior to trial, that Detective Harrison had been investigating fourteen robberies that had taken place in late 2004 in or near the Morgan State campus, and that he had \u201ca number of different suspects.\u201d From the trial transcript, in particular the bench conference that took place during recross examination of Detective Harrison, it is clear that Year-by further knew of at least one alleged suspect who \u201clook[ed] just like\u201d him. Later, during the hearing on the motion for new trial, Yearby admitted that \u201cduring and after trial,\u201d he found out \u201con [his] own\u201d that Detective Harrison \u201cwas aware one or two days before he ever showed these photo arrays to Ms. Zongo, that there was another male who is similar in appearance to ... Yearby who was caught red handed in the act robbing people with [Campbell].\u201d From this premise, Yearby speculated that Detective Harrison \u201chad to be\u201d considering this other, unnamed suspect in the robbery of Ms. Zongo. Detective Harrison testified, however, that Yearby was the only suspect he ever considered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Yearby had information before, during, and after trial regarding the other suspects identified in connection with the series of robberies at Morgan State in 2004 and was able to cross-examine Detective Harrison, the lead investigator, about whether there could be or were other subjects. He further knew of at least one other subject who \u201clook[ed] just like\u201d him. As in <em>Diallo, \u201c </em>\u2018[t]here can be no Brady violation where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>is no suppression of evidence.\u2019 \u201d 413 Md. at 706, 994 A.2d at 836, quoting <em>Diallo v.

We hold that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Around the same time, Yearby was charged, in two different cases, with armed robbery and related charges involving separate crimes that occurred on November 16, 2004, against a different victim.

Yearby also contends, in support of his <em>Brady </em>violation assertion, that the co-defendant in those cases, Michael Camp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>bell, had been implicated, along with another subject who 'Took[ed] just like\u201d Yearby, in yet another robbery that took place around the same time, that did not involve Yearby.

In <em>Strickland, </em>the constitutional right at issue was the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. In that context, the Court explicitly tied prejudice to materiality, and cited <em>Agurs, </em>a case addressing materiality of <em>Brady </em>evidence. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 698 (1984) (\"Accordingly, the appropriate test for prejudice finds its roots in the test for materiality of exculpatory information not disclosed to the defense by the prosecution, <em>United States v.

The Court defined \"reasonable probability\u201d as \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \"reasonable probability\u201d standard is the same as that applied in <em>Kyles v.

In <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. at 203 n. 4, 229 n. 12, 896 A.2d at 978 n. 4, 993 n. 12, we used language suggesting that the correct standard in assessing <em>Brady </em>materiality was whether there was a \"reasonable <em>possibility </em>\u201d that, if the suppressed evidence had been disclosed, the verdict would have been different, citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). <em>Dorsey </em>concerned the application of the harmless error standard of <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967), in a criminal case. We thus applied a harmless error standard in <em>Williams, </em>because we analogized the facts of that case to <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104, in which the Supreme Court applied the same standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>a State witness arguably had perjured himself, even though the prosecutor trying the case was unaware of the falsity of the testimony. 392 Md. at 199-201, 896 A.2d at 976-77. Thus, that case fell under the stricter rule of <em>Giglio, Napue, </em>and <em>Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935), rather than the general rule of \"reasonable probability.\u201d <em>See </em>6 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>et al., Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 24.3(b), at 350-53 (3d ed. 2007); <em>id, </em>\u00a7 24.3(d), at 376-81; <em>see also </em>2 Nancy Hollander, <em>et al., Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 12:41, at 12-329-330 &amp; n. 5 (14th ed. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Not surprisingly, Yearby in his brief latches onto the \"reasonable possibility\u201d language we used in <em>Williams, </em>but his reliance on that language is misplaced. The present case does not involve perjured testimony or the prosecution\u2019s failure to notify the court when it should have been aware of the presentation of false evidence, and, consequently, the strict materiality standard of <em>Williams {i.e., </em>the harmless error standard) does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">. We note that, in Maryland, discovery in criminal trials is governed by Maryland Rule 4-263, but that the Rule's disclosure obligations, to the extent they exceed due process requirements, are not of a constitutional nature. <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 846, 51 L.Ed.2d 30, 42 (1977). At the time of Yearby\u2019s trial, Rule 4-263(a)(l) (2007) required the State to disclose <em>Brady </em>material without a defense request (\u201cWithout the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall furnish to the defendant ... [a]ny material or information tending to negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the defendant as to the offense charged[.]\u201d), whereas disclosure of other information was predicated on a defense request, Rule 4-263(b), or was not subject to discovery by the defendant. Rule 4-263(c). Rule 4-263 thus governed (and in its present version, still governs) all disclosure of evidence by the State to a criminal defendant in the circuit courts, including that mandated by <em>Brady, </em>as well as that mandated only by rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\">. The extent of Yearby\u2019s requests is unclear. On March 4, 2005, more than two years before trial, he filed a Request for Discovery and Inspection, wishing \"to obtain disclosure of material and information to the fullest extent authorized and directed by Maryland Rule 4-263.\u201d During the suppression hearing, and later during trial, he expressed apparent dissatisfaction with the State\u2019s disclosures, but never filed a motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In his motion for new trial, Yearby asserted that \"Detective Harrison initially testified [at the suppression hearing] that he did not have any other suspects for this particular crime at the time he conducted the photo line-up,\u201d but \u201cthen changed his testimony and said he did have other suspects before the photo line-up was administered, but that he did not include photographs of any suspects\u201d in the line-up shown to Ms. Zongo. According to Yearby, \u201cthe State never produced any material or information ... of any other possible suspects in this case.\u201d At trial, according to Yearby, Detective Harrison \"testified that he had developed additional suspects for this crime\u201d prior to administering the photo line-up, but that \"he did not include any photographs of these suspects in the photo line-up shown to Ms. Zongo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Detective Harrison\u2019s actual testimony at the suppression hearing was that the \"other suspects\u201d had been implicated in other crimes that had occurred in late 2004, but not in the robbery of Ms. Zongo. At trial, under re-direct examination, he testified that the other suspects did not match the description given by Ms. Zongo. We note that the trial Iranscript was not yet available when Yearby filed the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">During the hearing on the motion for new trial, Yearby proffered that \"I did ask the State to still provide [information regarding the other suspects] after the trial was over.\u201d The record is devoid of any documents reflecting such a request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">. Although as a general rule, <em>Brady </em>issues crystalize after the conclusion of trial, and indeed, often in the context of collateral attacks on criminal verdicts, <em>see, e.g., Harris v. State, </em>407 Md. 503, 506, 966 A.2d 925, 926-27 (2009) (post conviction proceeding); <em>Williams, </em>392 Md. at 202, 896 A.2d at 977 (same); <em>Grandison, </em>390 Md. 412, 889 A.2d 366 <em>(fifth </em>appeal from conviction); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 599 A.2d 1171 (1992) (post conviction proceeding); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 578 A.2d 734 (1990) (same), we hasten to add that this is not a hard- and-fast requirement. <em>See, e.g., Diallo v. State, </em>413 Md. 678, 994 A.2d 820 (2010) (issue raised by pre-trial motion, and addressed in direct appeal); <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 702 A.2d 699 (1997) (direct appeal in capital case). Even in <em>Ware, </em>however, a case in which we determined there was a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant was unaware of the exculpatory evidence until two months after his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 702 A.2d at 706. The critical point is that the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose arises prior to trial, whereas the defendant\u2019s knowledge of a violation, should there be any, usually does not become clear until after the conclusion of trial. The timing of <em>Brady </em>disclosure is not an issue in the present case, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
