The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed that offense by inflicting life threatening injuries upon his son Gavin, who was born on September 16, 2005, and rushed to Shady Grove Hospital on September 28, 2005. The State\u2019s evidence, however, included the testimony of one Nicholas Watson, Petitioner\u2019s former cell-mate at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On January 8, 2007, Watson placed a telephone call to the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and offered to testify about several inculpatory statements that Petitioner had allegedly made to him. When he placed that phone call, Watson was (1) awaiting trial on charges of second degree assault and reckless endangerment, (2) facing a violation of probation charge as a result of a guilty plea that he had entered on January 4, 2007, and (3) unable to post a $10,000 cash bail that had been established as a condition of his pretrial release. Between January 8, 2007, and the date on which Watson testified in the case at bar, the State (1) requested that he be released on a \u201cpersonal bond,\u201d (2) \u201cnolle prossed\u201d the assault and reckless endangerment charges, and (3) filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>in which it requested that the Circuit Court prohibit Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel from cross-examining Watson about whether he had volunteered to testify for the State in the hope that he would receive some benefit in the cases that were pending against him when he contacted the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The Circuit Court granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>in an unreported opinion filed on June 30, 2009. <em>Leon Steven Calloway v. State, </em>No. 2808, September Term, 2007. Petitioner then filed a petition for <em>writ of certiorari </em>in which he presented this Court with a single question: \u201cDid the lower courts err in limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the State\u2019s key witness regarding his expectation of leniency from the State?\u201d We granted that petition. <em>Calloway v. State, </em>410 Md. 701, 980 A.2d 482 (2009). For the reasons that follow, our answer to this question is \u201cyes.\u201d We shall therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and direct that the case be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following factual summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">The detectives who interrogated [Petitioner] testified that [Petitioner] admitted he may have \u201cdropped\u201d the baby and that he \u201cmay have swaddled him too tightly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Nicholas Watson, [Petitioner\u2019s] cellmate at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility, testified that [Petitioner] admitted to him that he had harmed Gavin. Prior to trial, Watson, who was awaiting trial on assault and reckless endangerment charges at the time he was housed with [Petitioner], contacted the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and offered to testify against [Petitioner]. At trial, Watson testified at length about conversations he had with [Petitioner] in which [Petitioner] implicated himself. Watson\u2019s testimony portrayed [Petitioner] as a \u201chorrible person,\u201d who not only acknowledged harming Gavin, but also showed no remorse for doing so. Watson further testified that [Petitioner] believed that [Gavin\u2019s mother] was cheating on him and that the baby was not his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">The prosecutor\u2019s theory, argued to the jury, was that [Petitioner] inflicted Gavin\u2019s injuries and admitted to having done so, both to the detective and to Watson. [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel argued to the jury that he was never alone with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Gavin, that he never had an opportunity to inflict the injuries and that [Petitioner] only made the confession to the police because he wanted to \u201ctake the rap\u201d for [Gavin\u2019s mother] in order to keep his family together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">[T]he jury convicted [Petitioner] of one count of second-degree assault. As a consequence of the jury\u2019s inability to reach a unanimous verdict on charges of first-degree child abuse, second-degree child abuse and first-degree assault, a mistrial was declared as to these counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Leon Steven Calloway v. State, </em>No. 2808, September Term, 2007, slip opinion at pp. 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">3. Mr. Watson had pending charges of Second Degree Assault and Reckless Endangerment which were entered nolle prosequi on April 23, 2007 due to insufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">5. The State did not make any deals with Mr. Watson with respect to the previously pending matter in return for his testimony at trial in this matter, nor has the State made any promise, reward to inducement with respect to that charge in order to secure his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">6. To the contrary, in every conversation the State has had with Mr. Watson regarding his testimony, he has adamantly insisted that he did not want anything from the State in exchange for his truthful testimony; instead, he has always stated that he was willing to testify because it was the right thing to do for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">7. However, based on conversations with defense counsel and based on counsel\u2019s request for detailed information on the criminal history of the State\u2019s witness, the State believes that the defense nevertheless will seek to use information regarding the above-described criminal matter\u2014a matter not involving an impeachable conviction\u2014to impeach Mr. Watson at trial. The State be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>lieves this would be wholly improper and seeks a motion precluding any such cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">8. As the Court of Appeals has made clear, the fact that a witness has a pending criminal matter is not the relevant factor in deciding whether a witness has a possible bias that would be the proper subject of cross-examination. <em>Ebb v. State, </em>841 Md. 578[, 671 A.2d 974] (1996). Rather, the \u201ccrux of the inquiry insofar as its relevance is concerned, is the witness\u2019s state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585[, 671 A.2d at 977]. In order words, it is irrelevant that a witness has or had a pending charge. The issue is whether the witness believes they will get some benefit from the government with respect to that charge in return for their testimony at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">10. When the witnesses in <em>Ebb </em>denied under examination by defense counsel that they expected anything in return for their testimony, the trial court ruled that the defendant \u201ccould not inquire in the jury\u2019s presence about pending charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585[, 671 A.2d at 977]. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the trial judge \u201cdid not abuse his discretion in precluding the cross-examination of the witnesses about their pending charges.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">11. The <em>Ebb </em>case reaffirmed a principle articulated previously by the Court in <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 100-103[, 613 A.2d 379, 381-383] (1992). In <em>Watkins, </em>the Court of Appeals, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to restrict cross-examination and to preclude defense counsel from inquiring about a witness\u2019s pending theft charge\u2014a charge the -witness was set to go on trial for after his testimony at trial\u2014based on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that there was no deal with the witness regarding that charge. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">12. In the instant case, the State believes that Mr. Watson would testify that he had no deal with the State in connection with his previously pending charge. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>addition, the State anticipates that he would testify that he had no expectation of leniency from the State as to those matters based on his testimony at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">14. Because the State\u2019s witness had no expectation of leniency and has had none in the past with regard to his previously pending matters, and because pending criminal matters are not otherwise a proper subject of impeachment pursuant to established precedent of the Court of Appeals, the defense should be precluded from making any inquiry about these matters in the jury\u2019s presence. <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 585[, 671 A.2d 974, 978] (1996); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 100\u2014103[, 613 A.2d 379, 381-383] (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel argued that evidence of Mr. Watson\u2019s \u201cpreviously pending matters\u201d was admissible under <em>Leeks v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 543, 678 A.2d 80 (1996), in which the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">[A]n on the record evidentiary hearing, with the jurors out of the courtroom, is necessary when the trial judge is asked to rule <em>in limine </em>that a witness cannot be asked questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a)(4). Rules 5-401 and 5-403 apply at this hearing, interrogation should be limited to the matters listed in Rule 5-616(a)(4), and counsel are not entitled to turn the hearing into a discovery deposition. At this hearing, however, the trial judge must afford counsel an adequate opportunity to question the witness about every fact that would reasonably suggest the existence of bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">When the trier of fact is a jury, questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a)(4) should be prohibited only if (1) there is no factual foundation for such an inquiry in the presence of the jury, or (2) the probative value of such an inquiry is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice or confusion. If the trial court decides to exclude circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>stantial evidence of bias, it must state why it is prohibiting counsel from presenting such evidence to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 678 A.2d at 87 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">At the <em>in limine </em>hearing, Mr. Watson testified for the State. The record shows that the following transpired during his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">Q When you made that call to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, were you expecting to get anything from the State, any kind of benefit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">A Not at all. Absolutely not. Nothing at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">Q And did you have pending charges at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">Q Prior to the detectives getting to MCCF, did you have an opportunity to speak with an attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-13\">A Well, I spoke with my attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office who informed me at the time that they will be switching attorneys, because he was also representing Mr. Calloway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-15\">Q Okay. So, after speaking with the attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office, did you still wish to speak to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-17\">Q Okay. At that time in your mind, asking you what you were thinking, did you think that you were going to get some benefit from the State by talking to us about Mr. Calloway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-18\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Q Okay. Now, you were being held at MCCF with pending charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Q Were you prosecuted for that case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">A The case was dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">Q Mr. Watson, at any point did you tell anyone in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office that unless the case against you was dropped you would not cooperate in the Calloway case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">A Absolutely not. In fact, it was just the opposite. I made it quite clear to everyone in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office that I wanted nothing in exchange for my testimony in the Calloway case. I made it quite, quite clear that I didn\u2019t want any help with my other case or anything in exchange for my testimony on the Calloway case, because I wanted no motive, wanted to show that the only motive I have was from the heart. That was the only motive I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">Q At any point, Mr. Watson, did you expect any benefit to be given to you from the State in exchange for your cooperation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">A Never expect it, never want it, never asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The record shows that the following transpired during Mr. Watson\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-14\">Q Mr. Watson, on January 8th, you met with two detectives at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility after you talked to an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-15\">A Yes, ma\u2019am. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-16\">Q What details did you tell her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-17\">A How Leon told me about the lie he told to the police about tripping over an extension cord, and all kind of things. It was numerous details that Leon went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>case about, about fractures, old fractures on the baby, and how he thought the baby\u2019s mom was cheating on him, and how he continuously called the baby, [expletive] that little [expletive]. I mean numerous statements. And the way his attitude was towards the case and the baby, you know, his, his, his arrogance towards the case, his, his, you know, the way he talked about his baby as if it was some inanimate object, and the way he bragged about he was going to beat this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Q Now, when you met with the police detectives on January 8, 2007, they tape recorded the interview with you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">A Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">Q And you told them, you said to them, \u201cI\u2019m going to be completely honest with you. My intentions are all good,\u201d right? Do you remember saying that to the detectives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">A Yea, my intentions were all good. I mean I had all good intentions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">Q All right. And the reason you were talking about that is because the police detective, Detective Wilshire, said to you early on, \u201cUsually when inmates call us and they say they want to talk to us and provide us some information, they want to do it in return for something else.\u201d That\u2019s what Detective Wilshire told you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">A I remember him saying that, but I also made it clear to him also when we sat down that I want you guys to know that I\u2019m not doing this for any other reason. You know, I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m doing this because I want to do this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">Q All right. All right. Now, you did, though, then say that, you said, \u201cNow, I will say this, as a result of my testimony from speaking to the Public Defender\u2019s Office a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>couple minutes ago, that if something could be worked out as a result of my testify\u201d or the word says \u201ctestify\u201d in the transcript, but I\u2019m sure you said testifying, \u201cin the case, then, of course, so be it.\u201d You said that to the detectives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">A No, why would I speak to the, talk, while speaking to the Public Defender\u2019s Office making something work out. That makes no sense. I don\u2019t understand it, that, that reading of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">Q So, I\u2019m going to show you a copy of the certified transcript of your testimony, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">A Okay. If that\u2019s what that says, then, yes, I said it, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">Q All right. (Unintelligible.) I\u2019m sorry. Now, when you said to the detectives, \u201cif something could be worked out as a result of my testimony,\u201d what you were referring to is that you had pending charges in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County at the time that you were talking to the detectives on January 8th, 2007, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">Q All right. And those pending charges were second degree assault, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">Q And reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-13\">A Reckless endangerment, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-14\">Q Okay. And you\u2019d been incarcerated and held on a bond, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-15\">A Uh-huh. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-16\">Q That you hadn\u2019t paid, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-18\">Q And do you remember what your bond was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-19\">A $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-20\">Q $10,000. So, when you said, \u201cif something could be worked out as a result of me testifying in the case,\u201d what you were saying to the detectives was if they were to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>something good for you on your case, second degree assault and reckless endangerment charges, then so be it. And that\u2019s what you said, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">A I will make clear that if I\u2019d said that, if I made a statement, which apparently I did make that statement, I was trying to say if something was, you know, then so be, then, okay, you know what I mean? But I\u2019m not\u2014doing this for that reason, okay? Which was cleared up in the next statement, which I said, but I\u2019m doing this completely with no promise or nothing like that. I\u2019m not doing that for that reason. I wanted to make that absolutely clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">Q Mr. Watson, I want to talk to you a little bit about what was going on in your life on January 8th, 2007, okay, when you called the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">Q Okay. Now you were on probation on that day for a theft charge that you had pled guilty to on August 14, 2006, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">A Yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">Q You were on 18 months probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">Q All right. While you incarcerated in the Montgomery County Detention Center between October and January of 2007, you were involved in a fight with another inmate, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-15\">Q And, as a result of that fight, you were charged with second degree assault\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Q \u2014a crime, right? Okay. Now, on January 4th, 2007, you appeared in the District Court for Montgomery County on your assault charges, second degree assault charges, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">Q Well, when you pled guilty on January 4th, 2007, you were in violation of your probation, because you picked up a new charge while on probation, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">A To the extent, I guess, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">Q Okay. Now, I want to ask you some questions about how it was that you were released from the detection center, okay? You had a disposition conference on January 11th in front of Judge Saunder, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">Q And you said to the judge, \u201cJudge, I waive my right to a lawyer. I need to have a bond review today.\u201d That\u2019s what you said. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">Q All right. Exactly. That was your whole purpose of waiving your lawyer to expedite your bond review, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">Q All right. Now, at that disposition hearing, there was a State\u2019s Attorney, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-15\">A Ms. Lynch, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-16\">Q Ms. Lynch. And Ms. Lynch told the court that there was a plea offer for time served, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-18\">Q All right. And she expressly told the judge that she was asking for a bond review so that your bond could be changed to a personal bond, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>A No. The judge asked her is that okay. The judge said would you be willing to go forward with the bond review today because Mr. Watson has waived his right to an attorney. She said, she was kind of hesitant, but she, she, she said, yeah. And, actually, that was my first time hearing of the charges being dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">She told, that\u2019s what I first was explaining that my attorney, it was, it was already discussed with my attorney that, not the charges being dropped, excuse me, but me taking a plea to time served. Had my attorney would have discussed that with me, I would, I would have told my attorney no. And if it meant for me to sit in jail some more, that\u2019s what it would have meant, because I was not pleading to anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">Q Now, Mr. Watson, well, let me ask you this. From the time that you were released or pled guilty on January 4th, 2007 to the assault charge involving the jail until today, isn\u2019t it true that you\u2019ve never been charged with a violation of probation for the case that you were put on probation on August 14, 2006?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">A And that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s because there\u2019s facts behind that explaining why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">Q Did the State say on the record they were not opposing your bond review?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">A With some hesitation at first, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Maura Lynch, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to Mr. Watson\u2019s reckless endangerment case, also testified at the <em>in limine </em>hearing. The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following summary of her testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS1\">Lynch, the prosecutor assigned to Watson\u2019s case, testified that her decision to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>for Watson\u2019s charges was \u201cbased on the fact that my case had insufficient evidence at the time of the trial date to proceed.\u201d She denied the existence of any deal or bargain with Watson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>regarding his charges and his testimony in appellant\u2019s case. Lynch also explained that the decision to have Watson\u2019s bond reduced from $10,000 to personal bond was because \u201c[she] did not feel it was appropriate that Watson be incarcerated due to the fact that he was supposed to have been released six weeks ago\u201d and not due to his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><em>Leon Steven Calloway v. State, supra, </em>slip opinion at pp. 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Circuit Court ultimately granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">Well, the issue that is before the court is whether Mr. Watson believed that he was going to get a benefit from the government with respect to the pending assault and reckless endangerment charges that he was facing, in return for his testimony at Mr. Calloway\u2019s trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">You know. I did find Mr. Watson to be credible. I thought he was very adamant in his testimony that, as he said, that he made it quite clear that he didn\u2019t want any help with his cases, that his only motive was from the heart. I thought he was very articulate when he talked about his concern about the defendant speaking about the baby as if it was an inanimate object and that he was upset about what he perceived to be Mr. Calloway\u2019s arrogance towards the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">Now, the Court notes that it was Detective Wilshire that apparently brought up the issue of the expectation of some benefit and that was when Mr. Watson said that it was his heart and conscience that were telling him to give information, that he wasn\u2019t doing it for any benefit. The language that the defense, I think, has emphasized, I really don\u2019t think that him saying, \u201cWell so be it[,]\u201d if I get something else but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">I don\u2019t think that that was done in exchange, I think, I find clearly that he really had no hope or expectation. He\u2019s basically saying, you know, I\u2019m just doing this because I think this is the right thing to do, and if you\u2019re telling me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that maybe there might be something else, well then, so be it but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it. That\u2019s how I perceive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">I have reviewed the <em>Ebb </em>case, the <em>Leeks </em>case, the <em>Watkins </em>case. Mr. Watson testified, I think there had been some testimony last Monday that this wasn\u2019t the only case, that there was other charges, other cases. The other cases where he was a victim, as he testified, he really had nothing to gain by testifying here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">It was clear from Ms. Lynch\u2019s testimony that the State\u2019s decision to enter [a] nolle pros had nothing to do with this case whatsoever. Also, I think defense counsel asked a question of Ms. Lynch about, let me go back to her testimony. About her not asking about getting the case continued to be able to find the victim, but that was back on the April date and there had been a prior question about whether or not that was the first trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">And we all know, if it wasn\u2019t the first trial date, if it had come up once before and then had been continued and then, most likely, I mean nobody really asked a question about that, but Ms. Lynch was consistent in her testimony saying that she couldn\u2019t find the victim, that she has been trying to find the victim and that she had given the detective like a date by which he had to find the victim. So the fact that there was no continuance that was asked for in April, I mean, clearly that was not the first trial date. Clearly there had been a prior continuance and she still hasn\u2019t been able to locate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">You know, I\u2019ve looked at these cases, I\u2019ve done a balancing test. I really don\u2019t think that defense really has presented a case that would be sufficient for me to deny the State\u2019s motion. I\u2019ve done the balancing test that <em>Ebb </em>talks about, balancing the probative value against the prejudicial effect and I\u2019m going to grant the State\u2019s motion to preclude the defense from questioning Mr. Watson from any expectation of leniency because I don\u2019t think he had any. I think he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was very clear where he said nothing was ever expected, nothing was ever wanted, nothing was ever asked for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">While it is clear that the trial judge is not obligated to allow cross-examination about every charge pending against a State\u2019s witness, Md. Rule 5-616(a)(4) grants the criminal defendant the right to question a State\u2019s witness about facts that are of consequence to the issue of whether \u201cthe witness is biased, prejudiced, interested in the outcome of the proceeding, or has a motive to testify falsely.\u201d Circumstantial evidence of a witness\u2019s self interest is admissible because, as the Supreme Court of North Dakota has stated, \u201ceven an untruthful man will not usually lie without a motive.\u201d <em>Gates v. Kelley, </em>15 N.D. 639, 110 N.W. 770, 773 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 568 A.2d 1 (1990) <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1032, 110 S.Ct. 3296, 111 L.Ed.2d 805 (1990), while affirming a first degree murder conviction, this Court held that the Circuit Court had committed \u201charmless error\u201d when it prohibited the defense from cross-examining an admitted accomplice about drug possession charges pending against that witness at the time of his testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 568 A.2d at 7. The Circuit Court prohibited the cross-examination for two reasons: (1) the accomplice had not been convicted of the possession charge and (2) there were other persons in proximity to the drugs at the time the drugs were found. <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 568 A.2d at 7. This Court ultimately concluded that, because there was sufficient evidence of the accomplice\u2019s drug involvement to allow the jury to assess his credibility, and because the accomplice had outlined his plea agreement with the State during his direct examination, the trial judge\u2019s restriction was harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 613 A.2d 379 (1992), while affirming \u201cunlawful shooting with intent to disable\u201d convictions, this Court held that defense counsel was not entitled to ask one of the victims and one of the victims\u2019 friends whether they were currently on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 613 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>382-83. Watkins defended the charges against him by claiming that he acted out of self-defense at a meeting with the victims that involved the sale of some \u201cbad\u201d drugs. Although Watkins\u2019 trial counsel did not suggest that either of these witnesses had received probation as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for their favorable testimony in this case, he did argue that the probationary status of these witnesses gave them an additional reason to deny any involvement with drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 613 A.2d at 382. Although this Court stated that there was \u201csome merit in that contention,\u201d and that the Circuit Court did have discretion to admit the \u201cprobation\u201d evidence, we ultimately concluded that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded that evidence on the ground \u201cthat under the circumstances of this case the limited probative value of the evidence was outweighed by other appropriate considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 613 A.2d at 382-383.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 671 A.2d 974 (1996), while affirming murder convictions, a majority of this Court held that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the cross-examination of two State\u2019s witnesses about pending criminal and/or violation of probation charges pending against them at the time of their testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 590-91, 671 A.2d at 980. In that case, the Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether three State\u2019s witnesses could be cross-examined about pending charges. At the conclusion of this hearing, the Circuit Court ruled that cross-examination about pending charges would be (1) permitted with respect to the one witness who had acknowledged his hope of future consideration, but (2) prohibited with respect to Lawrence Allen and Todd Timmons, because those two witnesses had denied expecting anything in return for their testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In a dissenting opinion joined by Judge Eldridge, Chief Judge Bell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">In this State, in a jury trial, it is well settled that it is the function of the jury, rather than the trial judge, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh their testimony, and to resolve contested facts. <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 278-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>79, 539 A.2d 657, 663 (1988); <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 210, 214, 522 A.2d 1338, 1341, 1343 (1987); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d 214, 221 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722, 723 (1965). <em>See also Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">The petitioner does not claim that the State promised Timmons and Allen anything. For this reason, the petitioner has never challenged the accuracy of the State\u2019s representation that it made no promises. The petitioner\u2019s position, rather, is that whether or not Timmons and Allen subjectively expected to obtain some benefit for their testimony, the jury conceivably could have so found. The jury was not, therefore, obliged to accept the witnesses\u2019 disclaimer. Accordingly, cognizant that the jury, as the trier of fact, is charged with responsibility for resolving credibility issues, the petitioner sought to cross-examine the witnesses as to their bias, interest, motivation, or the like, all of which are proper subjects of cross-examination. As discussed supra, the focus of the petitioner\u2019s inquiry was for the purpose of putting before the jury information on the basis of which it could infer that the witnesses\u2019 testimony lacked credibility and, thus, should be discounted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented the jury from ever considering whether the witnesses were biased or otherwise interested in the case. The court did so by determining that the petitioner did not lay a proper foundation to entitle him to cross-examine the witnesses. This result, in turn, was reached in two ways. First, the court made a credibility determination, assessing whether witnesses testified truthfully when they denied expecting a reward or favorable treatment in connection with their pending charges for their testimony. Second, the court placed on the petitioner the impossible burden of proving by direct evidence from the witnesses themselves, the witnesses\u2019 state of mind. On both counts, the trial court erred. Certainly, there is no legal requirement that a witness\u2019 state of mind be proven by direct evidence. And, as discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>supra, credibility issues in a jury trial are matters reserved for resolution by the jury. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s right to limit cross-examination does not extend to the point of preventing cross-examination altogether in an area that is a traditional focus of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 596-597, 602-03, 71 A.2d at 983, 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Neither <em>Watkins </em>nor <em>Ebb </em>involved a witness who had volunteered to testify for the State, or who had already received any benefit prior to testifying at trial. Moreover, the falsity of a prosecution witness\u2019s denial of hope for leniency in a pending matter can usually be established beyond any doubt by the witness\u2019s post-testimony actions. For example, if\u2014after testifying against Ebb\u2014Mr. Timmons or Mr. Allen requested that he receive a lenient sentence (or a reduction of a previously imposed sentence) because of his testimony in the Ebb case, such a request would appear \u201con the record\u201d of the sentencing proceeding (or in the motion for reduction filed with the court).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the case at bar, however, the <em>in limine </em>ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>excluded circumstantial evidence of Mr. Watson\u2019s self interest that was based upon what actually occurred before he was called to testify against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The record clearly shows that, after he made his phone call to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, (1) Mr. Watson was released from the Montgomery County Correctional Facility, and (2) the charges pending against him were nolle prossed. Moreover, as of the date on which Mr. Watson testified in the case at bar, even though it is clear that he had entered a guilty plea that constituted a \u201cRule 4\u201d violation of probation, no violation of probation charge had been filed against him. Under these circumstances, we hold that the issues of whether Watson placed the January 8, 2007 phone call in the hope of being released from detention, and whether he was testifying at trial in the hope of avoiding a violation of probation charge, should have been decided by the jury rather than by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Because the issue is whether Watson had a hope that he would benefit from volunteering to testify against Petitioner, it is of no consequence that the State had not offered to make \u201cany deal or bargain with Watson regarding his charges and his testimony in [Petitioner\u2019s] case.\u201d It is also of no consequence that Watson\u2019s testimony before the jury would be consistent with his testimony at the <em>in limine </em>hearing. As this Court stated in <em>Elmer v. State, </em>353 Md. 1, 724 A.2d 625 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">It would be folly to suggest that questions alone cannot impeach. This notion was well-stated by then Chief Judge Wilner, now a member of this Court, writing for the intermediate appellate court in <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 292, 544 A.2d 784, 805 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 (1989), <em>jdgmt. vacated on other grounds, </em>497 U.S. 836, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Questions alone <em>can </em>impeach. Apart from their mere wording, through voice inflections and other mannerisms of the examiner\u2014things that cannot be discerned from the printed record\u2014they can insinuate; they can suggest; they can accuse; they can create an aura in the courtroom that the trial judge can sense but about which we could not speculate. The most persistent denials, even from articulate adult witnesses, may not suffice to overcome the suspicion they can engender____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 724 A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">As the Court of Special Appeals stated in <em>Leeks, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">The issue of bias is often generated by circumstantial evidence, and does not disappear merely because the -witness denies any reason to be biased. If such circumstantial evidence exists, <em>the trier of fact is entitled to observe the witness\u2019s demeanor as he or she responds to questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a) (I).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">When the trier of fact is a jury, questions permitted by Rule 5\u2014616(a)(4) should be prohibited only if (1) there is no factual foundation for such an inquiry in the presence of the jury, or (2) the probative value of such an inquiry is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice or confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">110 Md.App. at 557-58, 678 A.2d at 87. (Emphasis supplied). We agree with and adopt those statements. To the extent that our analysis is inconsistent with <em>Watkins, supra, </em>and/or <em>Ebb, supra, </em>those cases are hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">When determining whether a particular item of circumstantial \u201cbias\u201d evidence should be excluded on the ground that it is unfairly prejudicial and/or confusing, the trial court is entitled to consider whether the -witness\u2019s self interest can be established by other items of evidence. For example, in <em>Ebb, </em>ballistics evidence established that the murder weapon was the handgun that investigating officers seized from the person of Todd Timmons. Because it is so obvious that Mr. Timmons had the strongest of motives to testify that he was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>possession of the murder weapon when the murders occurred, it is impossible to hypothesize a juror who would have (1) believed Mr. Timmons\u2019 testimony in the absence of evidence that there were unrelated criminal charges pending against him at that time, but (2) rejected his testimony upon learning about those charges. The <em>in limine </em>ruling in the case at bar, however, prohibited Petitioner from countering the State\u2019s argument that (in the words of the prosecutor) \u201cNicholas Watson was genuine, heartfelt, full of emotion [and] wanted to say what [Petitioner] said to make sure that Gavin\u2019s voice was heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In the case at bar, there was a solid factual foundation for an inquiry into Watson\u2019s self interest, and the circumstantial evidence of Watson\u2019s self interest was not <em>outweighed\u2014substantially </em>or otherwise\u2014by the danger of confusion and/or <em>unfair </em>prejudice to the State. Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>on the ground that it found Watson to be a credible witness. Because we are unable to declare that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, Petitioner is entitled to a new trial at which the issue of Watson\u2019s motive to testify falsely will be decided by the trier of fact on the basis of a complete factual predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND TO REMAND CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">HARRELL, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">.
