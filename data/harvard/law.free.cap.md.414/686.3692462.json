Having been tried in connection with the shooting and robbery of David Knowlin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Jamile Thomas, the petitioner was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>first degree assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Despite the petitioner\u2019s arguments in mitigation, that: he was the least culpable of those involved in the crime, he had family support and he had no prior contact with the judicial system, the petitioner was sentenced to sixty-five (65) years in prison. The actual shooter received seventy (70) years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The petitioner noted an appeal, challenging that sentence, to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued in that court that the trial court erred in refusing to merge the first-degree assault count with the armed robbery count, as it pertained to one of the victims. Agreeing with that argument, the intermediate appellate court, in order to remedy the illegal sentence, remanded the case, in an unreported opinion, to the Circuit Court. Its mandate provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cSentence imposed under Count 3 of indictment No. 103149031 for first-degree assault and sentence imposed under Count 1 of indictment No. 103149033 (robbery with a deadly weapon) vacated; case remanded to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for imposition of a new sentence in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion; judgments otherwise affirmed; costs to be divided equally between appellant and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">At a resentencing hearing, the trial court reduced the petitioner\u2019s sentence from sixty-five years (65) to sixty years (60);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> however, although the petitioner indicated his desire to offer such evidence, the trial court refused to consider any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>mitigating evidence. The basis of this refusal may be found in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor I wanted to argue for mitigation before you imposed sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t believe there is anything to mitigate on. I think this was sent back for merger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Thus, the trial court seemed to believe, improperly so, we think, that it was constrained by the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 remand only to merge the first-degree assault count with the armed robbery count, and that it was precluded from considering, for purposes of sentencing, any factors that could mitigate the petitioner\u2019s \u201cnew sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The petitioner again appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, this time arguing based on <em>Sanders v. State, </em>105 Md. App. 247, 659 A.2d 356 (1995), that the sentencing court should have permitted him to offer mitigating evidence before resentencing him. The State, in response, maintained that the issue of mitigation was not properly preserved or, if it were, was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">\u201cAssuming without deciding\u201d the validity of the petitioner\u2019s preservation argument, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that there was \u201cno error.\u201d Addressing <em>Sanders, </em>it determined the case to be inapplicable because the petitioner \u201chas failed to provide evidence of \u2018events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant\u2019s life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 723, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2079, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 668 (1969)). The intermediate appellate court held, therefore, that the petitioner did not meet his burden to show that the trial judge misconstrued or misapplied the law and observed that, unlike the trial judge in <em>Sanders, </em>the trial judge here was not \u201c \u2018stuck with a handicap\u2019 \u201d from the previous trial judge\u2019s ruling. The intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s statement here that T don\u2019t believe there is anything to mitigate on\u2019 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>indicate, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, that it felt it was precluded from considering argument in mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This Court granted certiorari, <em>Jones v. State, </em>410 Md. 701, 980 A.2d 482 (2009), to determine two issues. The first, whether \u201cthe trial court err[ed] in failing to allow [the] petitioner to offer argument in mitigation before imposing sentence.\u201d The second, briefly stated, is whether the \u201cpetitioner fail[ed] to preserve his claim that the trial court failed to allow him to offer argument in mitigation.\u201d We disagree with the determination of the Court of Special Appeals, and hold, to the contrary, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow mitigating evidence to be adduced prior to the resentencing was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The mandate of the intermediate appellate court was clear: the trial court was to issue \u201ca new sentence in accordance with the views expressed in [its] opinion.\u201d The court certainly did not expressly foreclose the trial court from considering mitigating evidence. It is also significant that the \u201cviews expressed\u201d did not include a directive that the trial court impose a term of years, or any particular sentence. The court simply held that a merger of two of the sentences was required. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s concluding remarks on the merger issue are instructive in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201cTherefore, appellant\u2019s first-degree assault conviction must merge into the robbery-with-a-deadly-weapon conviction. If the jury believed, as it may have done pursuant to the court\u2019s instructions, that the shooting was part of the robbery, then the first-degree-assault conviction merges into the greater offense (robbery with a dangerous weapon). Because we have no way of knowing whether the jury believed that the shooting was separate from the armed robbery, we hold that, for sentencing purposes, the first-degree-assault charges merged into the crime of robbery with a dangerous weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Thus, the Court of Special Appeals only instructed the trial court to merge the two convictions, for sentencing purposes, without any additional express or implied limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>I. <em>The Right of Allocution is Required in Resentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">We begin our analysis with the acknowledgment that a trial judge has \u201cvery broad discretion in sentencing.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 199, 772 A.2d 273, 277 (2001); <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 516, 671 A.2d 495, 496 (1996); <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 531, 671 A.2d 501, 505 (1996); <em>Jennings v. State, </em>339 Md. 675, 683, 664 A.2d 903, 907 (1995); <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 265, 647 A.2d 1204, 1209 (1994); <em>State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 679, 602 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1992); <em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 480, 425 A.2d 632, 642 (1981). Nonetheless, we have made clear that the trial judge should tailor the criminal sentence to fit the \u201c \u2018facts and circumstances of the crime committed and the background of the defendant, including his or her reputation, prior offenses, health, habits, mental and moral propensities, and social background.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 199, 772 A.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Poe, </em>341 Md. at 532, 671 A.2d at 505).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">It is well established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201c \u2018only three grounds for appellate review of sentences are recognized in this State: (1) whether the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment or violates other constitutional requirements; (2) whether the sentencing judge was motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; and (3) whether the sentence is within statutory limits.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 200, 772 A.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Gary, </em>341 Md. at 516, 671 A.2d at 496); citing <em>Teasley v. State, </em>298 Md. 364, 370, 470 A.2d 337, 340 (1984); <em>see generally Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d 632 (1981); <em>Kaylor v. State, </em>285 Md. 66, 400 A.2d 419 (1979); <em>Clark v. State, </em>284 Md. 260, 396 A.2d 243 (1979). This case does not involve a contention that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment or that it was not within statutory limits. It does, however, demand a discussion under (2), particularly as it pertains to whether the trial court during sentencing was \u201cmotivated by ... impermissible considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>To be sure, the trial court correctly noted that the case was remanded \u201cfor merger.\u201d This does not mean, however, that the hearing was confined simply and solely to the implementation of that mandate. To accomplish merger a new resentencing was required, and because mitigating evidence may be offered at a sentencing, the petitioner was within his right to raise the issue and the trial court should have considered such evidence as may have been offered by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The first question that must be asked and answered is whether a \u201cresentencing\u201d or a \u201cnew sentence\u201d is a \u201csentencing.\u201d The answer is yes. <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972) is clear on this point. In <em>Bartholomey, </em>the decision in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), prompted this Court \u201csummarily [to] vacate[ ] death sentences imposed in 120 other cases then pending on its docket ... and remand[ ] all the cases \u2018for further proceedings.\u2019 \u201d 267 Md. at 183, 297 A.2d at 700. In one of the eases on review in <em>Bartholomey, Sterling v. State, </em>248 Md. 240, 235 A.2d 711 (1967), in which the defendant was sentenced to death for rape, <em>Bartholomey, </em>267 Md. at 191, 297 A.2d at 704, the sentencing court, in error, despite the vacating of that sentence pursuant to <em>Furman, </em>\u201cautomatically mandate[d] imposition of the next most severe penalty.\u201d <em>Bartholomey, </em>267 Md. at 191, 297 A.2d at 704. We reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 297 A.2d at 705. We stated: \u201c[o]n the contrary, in resentencing ... the sentencing court must approach its task [of sentencing] as if no sentence had ever been imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 297 A.2d at 706. The trial court is charged, therefore, with \u201cexercising its sentencing discretion\u201d as if the sentence was occurring for the first time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">During resentencing, therefore, especially one where the mandate specifies, for \u201ca new sentence\u201d the Maryland courts must rely on the standard rules of sentencing. This comports with Maryland Rule 4-342(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides: \u201cAp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>plicability. This Rule applies to all cases except those governed by Rule 4-343.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d \u201c[A]ll cases\u201d include resentencings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Before a sentence is imposed, a defendant\u2019s long-recognized right of allocution is triggered. In <em>Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. 344, 509 A.2d 120 (1986), a case which concerned the right of allocution for a defendant sentenced to death, this Court confirmed the deep roots allocution has within this State\u2019s jurisprudence. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cThe right of allocution existed in 1776 in essentially the form above outlined: it was a formal, narrowly defined right viewed as an essential part of the criminal sentencing procedure. This, therefore, was the nature of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>law right originally secured for the citizens of Maryland by Article 5 of the Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">\u201cAs sentencing statutes prescribing ranges of penalties rather than fixed penalties became more common, judicial discretion assumed a significant role in the sentencing process. Presumably in response to the trial courts\u2019 newly vested discretion, the scope of allocution was broadened, permitting a criminal defendant to inform the court of any mitigating factors relevant to sentencing, or simply to plead for leniency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 354-55, 509 A.2d at 125 (footnote omitted). \u201cAllocution \u2018provides a unique opportunity for the defendant himself to face the sentencing body ... and to explain in his own words the circumstances of the crime\u2019 \u201d as well as \u201c \u2018his feelings regarding his conduct, culpability, and sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>315 Md. 382, 386, 554 A.2d 814, 816 (1989) (quoting <em>Harris, </em>306 Md. at 358, 509 A.2d at 127). Section (f) of Rule 4-342 controls how a trial court should treat allocution. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201c(f) Allocution and information in mitigation. Before imposing sentence, the court shall afford the defendant the opportunity, personally and through counsel, to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Rule 4\u2014342(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Case law speaks in terms of the type of information the court \u201cmay\u201d consider. <em>See Bartholomey, </em>267 Md. at 193, 297 A.2d at 706 (\u201c[T]he sentencing judge may inquire into the past criminal record of the defendant and hear evidence and receive reports in aggravation or mitigation of punishment; the inquiry of the judge is not limited by the strict rules of evidence and he is invested with wide discretion in determining the sentence to be imposed within the authorized statutory limits.\u201d); <em>Purnell v. State, </em>241 Md. 582, 585, 217 A.2d 298, 300 (1966)(\u201cIt is almost, if not universally, held that opprobrious or kindly and commendable action on the part of a convict may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>be considered in sentencing as a matter either of aggravation or mitigation of possible punishment.\u201d); <em>Farrell v. State, </em>213 Md. 348, 131 A.2d 863 (1957). This Court has made clear, however, that the Rule itself is not permissive. <em>See Kent v. State, </em>287 Md. 389, 393, 412 A.2d 1236, 1238 (1980). In <em>Kent, </em>the issue was the validity of a sentence imposed in violation of Rule 772 d, the predecessor of Rule 4-342. That Rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201c \u2018Allocution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u2018Before imposing sentence the court shall inform the defendant that he has the right, personally and through counsel, to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment, and the court shall afford an opportunity to exercise this right.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\"><em>Kent, </em>287 Md. at 393, 412 A.2d at 1238. As to the effect of the Rule, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">\u201cConsidering the language of the rule, its requirements are clearly mandatory. <em>Brown v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 27, 272 A.2d 659, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 722 (1971). <em>See also In re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 410 A.2d 586 (1980); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 384 A.2d 709 (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 393, 412 A.2d at 1238. In a footnote the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\u201cThe history of Rule 772 d, which was previously numbered Rule 761 a, confirms that it was intended to be mandatory. An excellent discussion of the rule and the right to allocution generally, including the history of the right and cases in other jurisdictions, is contained in Judge Thompson\u2019s opinion for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Brown v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 27, 272 A.2d 659, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 722 (1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7N\"><em>Id. </em>at 393 n. 3, 412 A.2d at 1238 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">To be sure, in the evolution of this Rule, the trial court\u2019s responsibility has diminished\u2014no longer is a trial court required to inform the defendant of his or her right of allocution. Under Rule 4-342, the court is required only to afford the defendant the chance to \u201cmake a statement and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>present information.\u201d On this point, this Court, in <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. 129, 133, 517 A.2d 761, 763 (1986), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN8\">\u201cIn our view there is simply no requirement that the court inform the accused of his right to ailocute under the present rule. Rule 4-342 is somewhat different than former Rule 772(c). The former rule, by its terms, required the court to inform an accused that he has the right, personally and through counsel, to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment before sentence was imposed. The rule also required the court to afford the defendant an opportunity to exercise this right. The requirement that the court inform the accused of this right was eliminated in the present version of the rule leaving only the requirement that an opportunity to make a statement be afforded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The \u201crequirement\u201d that the petitioner have \u201can opportunity\u201d to offer mitigating evidence was not complied with here. <em>See Shifflett, </em>315 Md. at 388, 554 A.2d at 817(footnote omitted)(\u201cThat rule requires that the court afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement and present information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d). Indeed, the opportunity was denied even though, in the instant case, the petitioner requested the opportunity to present mitigating evidence; he was told, in effect and in fact, that he was not entitled to such an opportunity. That ruling directly violated Md. Rule 4-342(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Affirming that the requirement that there be an opportunity to present mitigating evidence is mandated is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Addressing the perimeters of the trial court\u2019s authority on resentencing, the Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cA trial judge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant\u2019s \u2018life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\u2019 <em>Williams v. New York, </em>387 U.S. 241, 245 [69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337, 1341 (1949) ]. Such information may come to the judge\u2019s attention from evidence adduced at the second trial itself, from a new presentence investigation, from the defendant\u2019s prison record, or possibly from other sources. The freedom of a sentencing judge to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the first conviction in imposing a new sentence is no more than consonant with the principle, fully approved in <em>Williams v. New York, supra, </em>that a State may adopt the \u2018prevalent modern philosophy of penology that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 247[, 69 S.Ct. at 1083, 93 L.Ed. at 1342].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 723, 89 S.Ct. at 2079-80, 23 L.Ed.2d at 668. Although, in <em>Pearce, </em>a conviction, rather than a sentence, had been vacated, the underlying rationale is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, relying heavily on this passage from <em>Pearce, </em>stresses that the petitioner did not meet his burden to prove that he had new \u201clife, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities\u201d since the first trial and sentencing. Whether any burden of proof is imposed on a defendant, the petitioner, in this case, was never given the opportunity, prescribed by Rule 4-342(f), to meet it. In response to the petitioner\u2019s indication that he wanted to present mitigating evidence, the trial court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is anything to mitigate on. I think this was sent back for merger.\u201d Even if the petitioner had new information or evidence, the opportunity for him to have introduced it was foreclosed. The trial court thus treated the proceeding as being one for the limited purpose of merging two counts. It was unwilling to hear what the petitioner\u2019s defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>had to say, and, unfortunately, the petitioner neither pursued nor pushed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The remand hearing was for the purpose of \u201cresentencing\u201d the petitioner. Therefore, the trial court was required, as with any sentencing proceeding, to listen to the evidence and to decide whether to accept, or refuse, it as mitigation. This Court does not share the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 confidence that there was no new, and possibly pertinent, information to be adduced, as the opportunity to present it was precluded by the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider the matter of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">It is this Court\u2019s position that the trial judge has to consider mitigating evidence when it is offered; it may, but need not, accept it. Nor is this Court to be understood as holding that the petitioner\u2019s right to allocate is unbridled. In <em>Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. at 359, 509 A.2d at 127, we made this point with clarity. There, commenting on the trial court\u2019s authority to control allocation, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201c[W]e do not suggest that the exercise of this right [of allocution] may be unlimited as to either duration or content. Although a sentencing court may not deny a defendant who elects to allocute a fair opportunity to exercise his right, the court may in its discretion curtail allocution that is irrelevant or unreasonably protracted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\"><em>Id. A </em>related issue is the extent to which the trial court\u2019s sentencing role in this case was limited by the decision of the Court of Special Appeals. Albeit involving a different judicial relationship than at issue here\u2014rather than the appellate court to trial court (law of the case), it involved judges of the same bench, one the original sentencing judge and the other, his successor\u2014the decision of the intermediate appellate court, in <em>Sanders v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 247, 659 A.2d 356, is instructive on the issue. When, at his resentencing for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, <em>id. </em>at 249, 659 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>357, the defendant, Sanders, attempted to introduce mitigating evidence, the trial court stifled the effort, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c \u2018I\u2019m certainly impressed by your eloquence and the fact that you\u2019ve made so much of your life. I\u2019m also though, stuck with a handicap that because I was appointed to take Judge Pines\u2019s place and tried to stand in his shoes ... it\u2019s hard for me to sort of second guess what he would or would not do.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 251, 659 A.2d at 358. Not satisfied with the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue, the Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>Danna v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 443, 605 A.2d 150 (1992), pointed out that \u201ca resentencing judge could consider matters subsequent to the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>105 Md.App. at 254, 659 A.2d at 360. Given the trial judge\u2019s discretion and the importance of allocution, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cIt is apparent from the record that the resentencing judge felt bound by the n,ature of the sentence imposed by the original trial judge. Prior to hearing the evidence by Sanders\u2019s and his counsel, the judge checked with defense counsel to be \\ sure that the earlier sentence had been imposed consecutively. Prior to announcing the sentence, the judge noted Sanders\u2019s accomplishments but then he said that he was \u2018stuck with a handicap\u2019 and had to \u2018stand in [Judge Pines\u2019s] shoes.\u2019 He indicated that it was hard to \u2018second guess what [Judge Pines] would or would not do,\u2019 and then he imposed virtually the same sentence as Judge Pines had, simply reducing it to the maximum that was legally allowed. The law requires the judge to conduct his own inquiry and to reach his own sentence based upon the evidence before him. Because it appears that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>erroneously felt constrained to follow his predecessor\u2019s decision and was therefore motivated by impermissible considerations, Sanders is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alc\"><em>Id. </em>at 256-57, 659 A.2d at 361. We agree with the reasoning of <em>Sanders. </em>In this case, under these circumstances, the trial judge\u2019s role was not as limited as the trial court portrayed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">From the trial judge\u2019s statement, \u201cI think this was sent back for merger,\u201d it can be inferred that he believed that his instructions from the Court of Special Appeals were to merge two charges, and nothing more, and for that reason, he was not permitted to consider mitigating evidence. Significantly, the mandate of the intermediate appellate court, by its express language, called for the \u201cimposition of a new sentence in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.\u201d That the Court of Special Appeals indicated that the new sentence be consistent with the views it expressed required that certain enumerated charges be merged, to be sure, but that directive did not limit the proceedings to that action alone. Neither its opinion nor its mandate precluded the trial court from hearing mitigating evidence. As we have seen, while what the trial court makes of evidence offered in mitigation is a matter entrusted to its discretion, its application of Rule 4-342(f), however, is mandatory. The trial court was required to \u201cafford the defendant the opportunity ... to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 4-342(f). \u201cWhere there is a violation of th[is] rule, the remedy is resentencing.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>287 Md. at 393-94, 412 A.2d at 1238; <em>see Rome v. State, </em>236 Md. 583, 589, 204 A.2d 674, 677-78 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">II. <em>The Matter is Properly Preserved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The State argues that this Court need not reach the merits of the mitigation argument because, by acquiescing in the trial court\u2019s ruling, the petitioner waived the issue, thus failing to preserve it for appellate review. The petitioner rejoins that the matter clearly is preserved, maintaining that \u201c[cjounsel\u2019s acknowledgment and respectful deference to the ruling of the court simply is not indicative of acquiescence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>agreement with the court\u2019s decision.\u201d Even though defense counsel\u2019s response of \u201cOkay\u201d to the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the petitioner the right to present mitigation evidence is not an objection, whether the petitioner objected is not the dispositive inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. at 134, 517 A.2d at 764, we noted the right to allocute was not a fundamental, constitutional right and accordingly \u201cmay be waived if not asserted at trial.\u201d <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. at 357, 509 A.2d at 126 (\u201c[T]he right of allocution ... is waived if not asserted by the defendant before sentencing.\u201d). Waiver consists of \u201cfailing to request an opportunity to address the court personally.\u201d <em>Lyles, </em>308 Md. at 134, 517 A.2d at 764. This makes sense inasmuch as Rule 4-342 places the onus on the court to \u201cafford the defendant the opportunity ... to make a statement and to present information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d When a defendant requests, or otherwise makes clear that he or she wants the opportunity to introduce mitigating evidence, Rule 4-342 requires that he or she be permitted to present such evidence as he or she may have.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d 632, is inapposite. There, the trial court offered the defendant a chance to speak, which the defendant declined. During the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201ctime for allocution [the trial judge asked the defendant if he] \u2018care[d] to be heard from[.]\u2019 The reply was made by defense counsel in the presence of his client: \u2018No Your Honor.\u2019 To this answer no objection or other register of disagreement was made by the defendant; nor, after the imposition of sentence, was there any objection noted. ... Thus, [the defendant] forfeited his right to appellate review of the allocution issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 487, 425 A.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">To be sure, the U.S. Supreme Court also has addressed the effect of a violation of a rule similar to Rule 4-342, Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>under the circumstances there presented, the violation was not reversible error. <em>See Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417, 421 (1962). It was the posture of the case, and not the fact of the rule violation, that proved dispositive, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In <em>Hill, </em>the defendant was convicted in a Federal District Court of transporting a kidnapped person and a stolen vehicle in interstate commerce. 368 U.S. at 424-25, 82 S.Ct. at 469, 7 L.Ed.2d at 419. At sentencing, the trial judge made no inquiry as to whether the defendant had mitigating evidence to present to the court. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 82 S.Ct. at 469-70, 7 L.Ed.2d at 419. That failure on the part of the trial judge was not objected to, nor was it raised as an issue on appeal. Four years later, the defendant collaterally attacked his sentence by filing a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 [Federal custody; remedies on motion attacking sentence], to vacate his sentence. He argued, among other things, that, \u201cat the time of sentencing [he] had been \u2018denied the right under Rule 32(a) of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ... to have the opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 82 S.Ct. at 470, 7 L.Ed.2d at 419. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the limited issue of whether a Rule 32 violation could be used to collaterally attack a sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Court acknowledged that there was \u201cno doubt as to what the Rule commands,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 426, 82 S.Ct. at 470, 7 L.Ed.2d at 420, and it was equally clear that the defendant \u201cwas not given an express opportunity\u201d to make such a statement, nor did the defendant raise the issue. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court, however, was not convinced that an error of that nature constituted a successful collateral attack. <em>Id. </em>The Rule, it held, was not automatic, more must be present, for instance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cIt is to be noted that we are not dealing here with a case where the defendant was affirmatively denied an opportunity to speak during the hearing at which his sentence was imposed. Nor is it suggested that in imposing the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>the District Judge was either misinformed or uninformed as to any relevant circumstances. Indeed, there is no claim that the defendant would have had anything at all to say if he had been formally invited to speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 429, 82 S.Ct. at 472, 7 L.Ed.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Although we need not address whether violating Md. Rule 4-342 is a viable basis for a collateral attack, the aggravated circumstances referenced by the Court in <em>Hill </em>is precisely what is present in this case: a defendant desiring to present mitigating evidence, a defense counsel ready to present that information, and a trial court under the mis-impression that it is bound by a ruling of the appellate court. It was not. When the petitioner, through his counsel, expressed an interest in allocution, in accordance with Md. Rule 4-342, the trial court was permitted to hear and consider the information before imposing the sentence. That the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 mandate contained particular instructions to merge two of the charges did not preclude the trial court from complying with its primary task\u2014the resentencing of the petitioner, which required it to take steps to ensure that the petitioner had a fair sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
