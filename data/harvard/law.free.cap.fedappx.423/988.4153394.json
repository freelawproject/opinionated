Buchert (\u201cBuchert\u201d) appeals from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d). The Veterans Court affirmed a decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d), which denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 11, 1997, for disability compensation for a tender and painful scar in the right rib area. <em>Buchert v. Shinseki, </em>No. 08-3271, 2010 WL 3230678 (Vet.App. Aug.17, 2010). We <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">Buchert served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1953 to July 1956 and from May 1958 to May 1962. In May 1967, the regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) awarded Buchert disability benefits, with a 10% disability rating, for residuals of resection of the tenth rib with peripheral nerve damage. Buchert later sought an increased disability rating for that condition, which the VA denied. Buchert appealed the VA\u2019s decision to the Board, which awarded a separate 10% disability rating for a tender and painful scar and remanded the matter to the VA to determine an appropriate effective date. Under the applicable statute and regulation, the effective date of an award of compensation is the \u201cdate of receipt of the claim.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400; <em>see also </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a). The veteran may, however, be entitled to an earlier effective date where there is evidence that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of a claim for increased rating. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(o)(2). The date of a VA medical examination which demonstrates service connected disability is considered the date of an informal claim 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.157. Here, the VA assigned an effective date of June 11,1997, because a VA medical examination on that date showed that Buchert experienced pain and tenderness related to his scar. Buchert appealed, contending that he was entitled to an earlier effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>On appeal, the Board denied Buchert\u2019s claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date because it found that \u201cno treatment records dated prior to June 11, 1997, showed the presence of a tender and painful scar ...; therefore, none of these records amount[ed] to an informal claim.\u201d <em>In re Buchert, </em>No. 05-30027, slip op. at 5 (Bd.Vet.App. Jan. 15, 2008). Buchert appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court. The Veterans Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, finding that Buchert had not established the existence of an earlier informal claim or evidence of an increase in disability within the year preceding the 1997 VA examination. The court also concluded that the Board\u2019s finding regarding the VA\u2019s satisfaction of its duty to assist was not clearly erroneous, noting that the VA made reasonable efforts to obtain relevant medical records, and where it was unable to do so, it was due to Buchert\u2019s failure to provide the VA with information necessary to obtain the records (e.g., a signed medical record release). Additionally, the court concluded that the Board did not err in failing to give weight to Buehert\u2019s lay testimony because it contained no reference to pain related to the scar and was thus insufficient to serve as evidence of an increase in disability in the year preceding the informal claim. Finally, the Veterans Court also concluded that the Board provided an adequate statement of reasons for its decision that an earlier effective date was not warranted because the \u201cBoard identified ... medical records and lay statements\u201d that were evaluated in reaching its decision and found that \u201call prior medical evidence in the record\u201d failed to reference pain related to the scar.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">This court has jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans Court only with respect to a \u201cchallenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). We may not review factual determinations or the application of law to fact \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that an appeal ... presents a constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>see also Conway v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Buchert does not contest the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation. Instead, he argues that the VA (1) failed to satisfy its duty to assist, (2) failed to adequately consider his lay testimony, and (3) failed to provide a sufficient statement of the reasons and bases for the denial of an earlier effective date. The question of whether the VA satisfied its duty to assist involves a factual question. Whether the Board properly found that Buchert\u2019s testimony failed to demonstrate an increase in disability in the year preceding the claim is also a factual determination. And determining whether the Board provided a sufficient statement of the reasons for its decision involves the application of law to facts. As previously stated, we lack jurisdiction to review factual determinations or the application of law to fact As a result, we must dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
