Wooten now appeals, claiming that the district court erred in precluding him from impeaching Government witness Mark Bradley with evidence of Bradley\u2019s two prior convictions, both of which occurred over twenty years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Benkahla, </em>530 F.3d 300, 309 (4th Cir.2008). Federal Rule of Evidence 609 allows a party to impeach a witness with prior felony convictions under certain circumstances. Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1). However, \u201c[e]vidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction ... substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">We have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
