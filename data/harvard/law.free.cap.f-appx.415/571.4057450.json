Appellants originally filed this suit in state probate court, purportedly seeking a clarification on the marital status of Appellee Jackie Doss-Elmore and James Hugh Elmore, deceased. Appellees removed the case to federal court based on ERISA preemption. The district court held that the suit was governed by ERISA and that Defendant Appellee Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\u2019s determination of a common-law marriage between Doss-Elmore and James Hugh Elmore was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. We review the district court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo, Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir.2008), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">1. Plaintiffs-Appellants first argue that the district court erred when it determined that ERISA preemption applied. They contend that the determination of marital status was strictly a state law claim not subject to ERISA. Moreover, they argue that pursuant to an unpublished Tenth Circuit case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MetLife may not disregard conflicting information about marital status. The district court found that Appellants\u2019 state law cause of action was preempted under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it could have been brought under ERISA\u2019s enforcement provision and no other legal duty supported the claim. <em>See Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, </em>542 U.S. 200, 210-14, 124 S.Ct. 2488, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>2496-98, 159 L.Ed.2d 812 (2004). The district court distinguished the Tenth Circuit case because under those facts, the plan administrator knew of the pending state court suit and disregarded it in violation of the plan, whereas here MetLife had already made a final determination and distributed the funds before Appellants filed their suit. For the reasons articulated by the district court, we agree. Appellants\u2019 state law cause of action was preempted because the declaration of marital status arose from no separate duty and could have been brought under \u00a7 502(a) \u201cto recover benefits due\u201d Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">2. Appellants next argue that the district court erred when it stated that Appellants had bypassed the administrative process in favor of litigation. Appellants also contend that the district court erred in its recitation of the facts when it stated that MetLife had notified Elmore that his claim was denied and provided both Blake and Elmore with the reasons for the denial. Appellants appear to imply that these lapses in procedure violated the procedural requirements of ERISA, providing for notice of adverse decisions and an opportunity to an administrative appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even assuming that MetLife failed to follow ERISA\u2019s procedures, no remedy Appellants seek would result in a reversal of the district court\u2019s ruling. By pursuing their claim in federal court, including arguing that MetLife\u2019s procedural irregularities prejudiced them, Appellants have already received any remedy due to them on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"AzGQ\">3. For their third issue, Appellants argue that the district court erred when it reviewed MetLife\u2019s determination of benefits for an abuse of discretion. First, Appellants contend that MetLife is not the plan fiduciary as required to receive an abuse of discretion review. And second, Appellants argue that MetLife\u2019s determination is entitled to no deference because of a conflict of interest. Both arguments fail. Because of the functions MetLife performed with respect to the plan, under Fifth Circuit law, MetLife is an ERISA fiduciary. <em>See Reich v. Lancaster, </em>55 F.3d 1034, 1047 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe authority to grant, deny, or review denied claims can ... make one a fiduciary.\u201d). Therefore, MetLife\u2019s factual determination that Doss-Elmore and James Hugh Elmore were married at the time of his death is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Appellants\u2019 conflict of interest argument is immaterial here because Met-Life did in fact pay the benefits\u2014just not to Appellants. A conflict may be significant when an administrator refused benefits. The district court properly applied the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"AMa\">4. Lastly, the Appellants argue that the district court erred when it held that MetLife\u2019s benefits determination was based on substantial evidence. \u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard, \u2018[i]f the plan fiduciary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary and capricious, it must prevail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corry v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>499 F.3d 389, 397 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Ellis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 273 (5th Cir.2004)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398 (quotation omitted). Appellants argue that the letter denying benefits does not contain a sufficient rationale to support the denial. However, we review MetLife\u2019s determination based on the facts in the administrative record, which contains all information made available to the administrator. <em>Id. </em>at 398 n. 12. And, we agree with the district court that the evidence in the administrative record as a whole supports MetLife\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
