Woodard, </em>531 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>F.3d 1352, 1362 (11th Cir.2008). To be \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the drug trafficking offense, the firearm must have \u201chelped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We consider several factors to determine whether a firearm was possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">The type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1362 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">There was sufficient evidence to show Perez possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Perez possessed a loaded 9mm Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson handgun, which was readily accessible on his bedroom night stand. Further, a drug ledger and between $20,000 and $40,000 in drug proceeds were found in Perez\u2019s bedroom closet. Lastly, in a barn located 25-50 yards from the house were 52 kilograms of cocaine and $119,940 in drug proceeds. Because Perez\u2019s role in the drug trafficking organization was to protect the drugs and drug profits, a reasonable trier of fact could have determined this evidence showed he possessed the firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See Williams, </em>527 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-16\">. Perez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five or more kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), and possession with the intent to distribute five or more kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-17\">. We need not address Perez\u2019s judgment of acquittal argument based on our finding the evidence presented at trial was sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-25\">.We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1244 (11th Cir.2008). We view \"the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,\u201d resolving \"any conflicts in favor of the government and accepting] all reasonable inferences that tend to support the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will affirm \"a conviction if a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
