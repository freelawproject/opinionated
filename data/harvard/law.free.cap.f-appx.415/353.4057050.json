On August 10, 2010, the Magistrate Judge issued an Order notifying Rohn of the requirement to either pay the filing fee or file the required motion and submit a signed inmate account statement. Rohn was given a deadline of August 31, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On August 30, 2010, Rohn mailed from prison the following items: (a) a signed certif\u00edcate of inmate account activity indicating an account balance of $0.00; and (b) a trust account statement of activity from March 11, 2010 through August 20, 2010. <em>See </em>Docket Entry Nos. 3-4. These items were received and filed in the district court beginning on September 1, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 7, 2010, the Magistrate Judge issued an Order for Rohn to show cause why his case should not be dismissed for failure to comply with the August 10, 2010 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Rohn did not respond to the show cause order, the District Court, in an order entered on October 7, 2010, dismissed his civil action without prejudice for failure to pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Rohn appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Remick v. Manfredy, </em>238 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir.2001) (if plaintiff cannot cure defects or declares his intention to stand on motion, order dismissing without prejudice is appeal-able); <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">Our Clerk granted Rohn leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and advised him that the appeal was subject to summary dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) or summary affirmance under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. He was invited to submit argument in writing, and he has done so. In his response, Rohn states that he mailed a signed certificate of inmate account activity and a six-month account statement from the prison by the court\u2019s deadline, <em>see Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). He thus complied with the court\u2019s order and is entitled to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">We will summarily affirm under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, because it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal. In addition to requiring \u201ca certified copy of the trust fund account statement (or institutional equivalent) for the prisoner for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(2), the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute also provides that \u201ca person ... submit[ ] an affidavit that includes a statement of all assets such prisoner possesses [and declare] that the person is unable to pay such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>fees or give security therefor.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1915(a)(1). \u201cSuch affidavit shall state the nature of the action, defense or appeal and affiant\u2019s belief that the person is entitled to redress.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Although Rohn submitted a signed certificate of his account activity indicating an account balance of $0.00 and a six-month trust account statement, <em>see </em>Docket Entry Nos. 3^4, and mailed these items from the prison by the court\u2019s deadline, <em>cf. Houston, </em>487 U.S. at 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379 (notice of appeal filed at time petitioner delivered it to prison authorities for mailing to court clerk), he did not submit the required affidavit of poverty. Rohn\u2019s submissions, even if construed as a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>did not contain the required affidavit of poverty identifying all of his assets and a declaration that he was unable to pay the required fees. There thus was no way for the District Court to properly determine his current eligibility to proceed without prepayment of the fees, <em>see Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 n. 14 (3d Cir.1976) (district court must pass on sufficiency of affidavit of poverty). Rohn stated in his Notice of Appeal that a different Magistrate Judge granted his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in a prior civil rights action, <em>Rohn v. Beard, </em>D.C. Civ. 08-cv-00185, but in that case he appears to have submitted the required \u201cMotion and Declaration In Support of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis,\u201d <em>see </em>Docket Entry No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court dismissing the complaint without prejudice for failure to either pay the filing fee or submit a <em>complete </em>motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. It appears that the items were filed twice on the docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-15\">. The show cause order did not specify what was missing from Rohn's attempt to establish his indigency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
