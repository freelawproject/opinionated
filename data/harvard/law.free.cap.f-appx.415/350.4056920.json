Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, appeals from an order of the District Court dismissing as legally frivolous his pro se civil rights complaint. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">In 2001, Hartmann pleaded guilty to various sex offenses and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, followed by nine years of decreasing levels of supervision. He is currently on monitored supervision until June 2012. In August 2010, he filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He named as defendants three Delaware Supreme Court justices, two Delaware Superior Court judges, a deputy attorney general, and the commissioner and the bureau chief of the Delaware Department of Corrections. He made the following allegations: (1) an error in a family law case that resulted in a \u201cfraudulently brought criminal case;\u201d (2) the denial of a writ of prohibition; (3) the denial of \u201cconstitutional rights through <em>libraries and the Internet </em>when there was no conviction of their use\u201d (emphasis in original); (4) failure to train regarding Hartmann\u2019s rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and (5) racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"AQb\">The District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and found that amendment would be futile. Hartmann appealed. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s \u00a7 1915(e) dismissal without leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). To the extent that the District Court engaged in the choice, application, and interpretation of the law, our review is plenary. <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995). Summary action is warranted if an appeal presents no substantial question. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"AL-\">Hartmann\u2019s first and second claims cannot be brought in a \u00a7 1983 action. Since he is on supervised release, he is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of habeas corpus. <em>Leyva v. Williams, </em>504 F.3d 357, 363 (3d Cir.2007). Consequently, his remedy, if he has one at all, lies with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, not with \u00a7 1983. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\u201c[Wjhen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical confinement [ ... ] his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Atg\">Hartmann next claims that he was denied his rights \u201cthrough libraries and the Internet.\u201d First, he brings this claim against Delaware judges. Judges have \u201cabsolute immunity from suit [and] will not be liable for [their] judicial acts.\u201d <em>Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006). It is clear from the complaint that Hartmann is complaining about actions taken by the judges in their judicial capacities. Thus, the judges have judicial immunity against these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A77\">Hartmann also brings his claim about libraries and the Internet against Delaware prison officials. Inmates have a right to meaningful access to the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 822, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). An inmate making an access-to-the-courts claim is required to show that the denial of access caused actual injury. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 352-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Actual injury occurs when a prisoner demonstrates that a \u201cnonfrivolous\u201d and \u201carguable\u201d claim was lost because of the denial of access to the courts. <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). Here, Hartmann does not indicate how the defendants impeded his access to the courts, nor does he mention any non-frivolous claims that he lost as a result. In fact, Hartmann has been the plaintiff in two other civil rights cases and one habeas corpus petition, as well as several state-court challenges to his conviction. Thus, it appears that Hartmann was able to bring his legal claims while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">Hartmann\u2019s remaining claims warrant little discussion. He alleges that the defendants violated the ADA by failing to train state employees with regard to his disability. He does not explain what the state employees, whom he did not name as defendants in his complaint, improperly did or did not do, nor does he even state the nature of his disability. Moreover, a civil rights claim cannot proceed exclusively on a theory of respondeat superior. <em>Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). He vaguely accuses the defendants of racketeering, but he does not allege any predicate racketeering acts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>an injury to business or property, as required for a civil RICO claim. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Hartmann\u2019s complaint, and that this appeal presents no substantial question. Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the District Court. Hartmann\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A6fi\">. We note that Hartmann has already sought habeas relief for his 2001 guilty plea, and we rejected his claim. <em>See Hartmann v. Carroll, </em>492 F.3d 478, 484 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
