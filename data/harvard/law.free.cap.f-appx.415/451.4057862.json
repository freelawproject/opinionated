On appeal, Green argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress a gun and ammunition seized by police officers because they did not have reasonable articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity; and (2) the district court clearly erred during sentencing when it applied the second-degree attempted murder cross-reference. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">We review the factual findings underlying a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress for clear error and the court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Perry, </em>560 F.3d 246, 251 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 177, 175 L.Ed.2d 112 (2009). When evaluating the denial of a suppression motion, we construe evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Black, </em>525 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 182, 172 L.Ed.2d 129 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-26\">Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may stop a person for investigative purposes when the officer has reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that criminal activity is afoot. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify the stop depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the information known to the officer and any reasonable inferences to be drawn at the time of the stop. <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581; <em>Black, </em>525 F.3d at 364-65. The reasonable suspicion determination is a \u201ccommonsensical proposition,\u201d and deference should be accorded to police officers\u2019 determinations based on their practical experience and training. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>States v. Foreman, </em>369 F.3d 776, 782 (4th Cir.2004). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court correctly found that reasonable suspicion justified the stop of Green.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court thus properly denied Green\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We also affirm Green\u2019s sentence. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 427 (4th Cir.2002). Given the testimony presented at Green\u2019s sentencing hearing, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that a preponderance of the evidence suggested that Green intended to kill and its subsequent decision to calculate Green\u2019s total offense level using the second-degree attempted murder cross-reference. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 (2006); <em>US. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2A2.1(a)(2), 2X1.1 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> We also note that the firearm in question was not subject to suppression as it was abandoned prior to Green\u2019s seizure and was thus not the fruit of the seizure. <em>See California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991); <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
