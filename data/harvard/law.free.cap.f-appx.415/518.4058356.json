In his initial brief, Jeffery argued as his sole issue on appeal that he was denied the right to counsel during a hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In response, the Government filed a motion to dismiss Jeffery\u2019s appeal, which this court granted. Jeffery\u2019s appeal was subsequently reinstated. He has not reasserted that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-21\">Jeffery argues that the district court erred by denying a motion to suppress the fruits of a wiretap the Government conducted on his co-defendant Louis Johnson\u2019s cellular telephone. To the extent that Jeffery adopted Johnson\u2019s appellate challenges to the denial of the motion to suppress, this court\u2019s decision rejecting those arguments applies equally to Jeffery. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>393 Fed.Appx. 240, 241-42 (5th Cir.2010). By failing to raise the issue in the district court, Jeffery has waived his remaining contention that the district court should have suppressed the fruits of the wiretap because the Government failed to make a showing of necessity for the wiretap specifically as to him. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>467 F.3d 912, 918-19 (5th Cir.2006). In any event, Jeffery, having cited no binding Fifth Circuit authority in support of his argument, has not shown plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 920 n. 20; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-24\">Jeffery also argues that his sentences for conspiracy should be vacated and his case remanded to the district court for re-sentencing under the provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) of 2010. The FSA amended the Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Export Act by resetting the drug quantities required to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. FSA, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220, \u00a7 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. 2372 (Aug. 3, 2010). The Act became effective after Jeffery was sentenced. He has not shown that the FSA is retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
