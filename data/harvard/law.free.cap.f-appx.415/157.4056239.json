On appeal, Lopez argues that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party who challenges the sentence must establish that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">In this case, Lopez has not met his burden to show that his sentence, which fell in the middle of the guideline range, was unreasonable. The record belies his argument that the district court failed to consider his arguments in mitigation. Nor does the record support his argument that the court failed to provide a sentencing rationale. Indeed, the district court emphasized Lopez\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included numerous drug convictions and placed him in the highest criminal history category. Although the district court relied primarily on this factor, such reliance was not unreasonable given the severity of Lopez\u2019s criminal history. The record further belies Lopez\u2019s argument that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory, rather than advisory. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
