Darouiche was informed, however, that an individual purporting to be him had already received and cashed the proceeds due under the policy. Daro-uiche then sued Fidelity, among others, for negligence. The district court, concluding that Darouiche had not met the prerequisites for bringing suit under the flood policy, granted Fidelity\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">Darouiche purchased the residential property at issue, located in Metairie, Louisiana, in 1999. Three years later, he entered a bond for deed to the property with Santos G. Zelaya, and moved out.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the terms of his agreement with Zelaya, Darouiche agreed to transfer title to the property upon Zelaya\u2019s completion of specified payments. The property\u2019s flood insurance policy was purchased from Fidelity by Darouiche\u2019s mortgage lender, Teche Federal Bank (\u201cTeche\u201d). This policy, a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the National Flood Insurance Program, was in effect when Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Darouiche, being away, was unaware for months that Hurricane Katrina had caused flood damage to the property. During Darouiche\u2019s absence, and unbeknownst to him, Fidelity opened an automatic claim under the property\u2019s flood policy. The flood claim was assigned to an independent adjuster who determined that the amount due was $91,087.21. In March 2006, Fidelity issued a check for that amount, made out to Darouiche and Teche, and mailed it to the Metairie address it had on file for the property. Fidelity then closed the claim, having received no other documentation or claim for further benefits under the property\u2019s flood policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Approximately five weeks later, an individual purporting to be Darouiche or Da-rouiche\u2019s agent contacted Fidelity and complained that he had not yet received payment for the flood claim. The impersonator, whom Darouiche alleges was Ze-laya, requested that Fidelity stop payment on the check, issue a duplicate, and mail the new check to an address in New Jersey. Fidelity promptly complied with these requests. Around the same time, in May 2006, Teche sent a letter to Fidelity asking that Fidelity take certain precautions in paying the flood claim. Teche informed Fidelity that Darouiche\u2019s mortgage account was presently in arrears, and that a bond for deed existed between Da-rouiche and Zelaya. The bank requested that, for these reasons, Fidelity notify Teche and verify the endorsements on the check before it released funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">In June 2006, Fidelity\u2019s reissued check was endorsed by forgery and presented to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., where it was cashed. JP Morgan Chase Bank in turn presented the check to Wachovia Bank, N.A., where Fidelity kept an account. Wachovia, too, accepted the check. By the time Darouiche returned to Louisiana and discovered the flood damage to his property, Fidelity had already paid out the insurance proceeds on his flood claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The underlying suit followed. Daro-uiche sued Fidelity, among others, alleging that the insurer had negligently handled the payment of his flood claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Darouiche alleged that Fidelity was negligent when it reissued the flood claim check without first verifying that Daro-uiche had made the request. Darouiche also alleged that Fidelity was negligent for not verifying the check\u2019s endorsements before releasing funds, as Teche had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Fidelity moved for summary judgment. It argued that because Darouiche had failed to comply with certain prerequisites to filing suit under the flood policy, the suit was barred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted the motion, and then entered judgment in favor of Fidelity. Darouiche moved for a new trial, arguing that the district court incorrectly determined that he was precluded from suing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Fidelity under the flood policy. The district court summarily denied the motion, citing the reasons stated in its grant of summary judgment for Fidelity. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">As an initial matter, we consider whether Darouiche\u2019s notice of appeal in the district court was timely filed. \u201cThe filing of a timely notice of appeal, within thirty days after entry of the court\u2019s judgment, is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Kinsley v. Lakeview Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr. LLC, </em>570 F.3d 586, 588 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007)). Given the mandatory nature of this inquiry, we directed the parties to brief this question as a special issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Darouiche had 30 days \u201cafter the judgment or order appealed from [wa]s entered\u201d to file his notice of appeal in the district court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). The district court entered judgment for Fidelity on January 13, 2010,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and entered the order denying Darouiche\u2019s motion for new trial on May 14, 2010. When a party timely files a Rule 59 motion for new trial under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the time to file an appeal is tolled until the district court\u2019s disposition of that motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(v). Thus, if Darouiche\u2019s motion for new trial was timely filed, he had 30 days from May 14, 2010, to file his notice of appeal. He filed his notice of appeal within those 30 days, on June 11, 2010. But if Darouiche\u2019s motion for new trial was untimely, it \u201cd[id] not toll the running of the thirty-day clock to appeal to this Court.\u201d <em>Vincent v. Consol. Operating Co., </em>17 F.3d 782, 785 (5th Cir.1994). Whether the notice of appeal was timely \u2014 and whether we have appellate jurisdiction \u2014 therefore depends on whether Darouiche\u2019s motion for new trial was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Under the amended version of Rule 59, Darouiche had \u201cno later than 28 days after the entry of judgment\u201d to file his motion for new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court having entered judgment for Fidelity on January 13, 2010, Darouiche had until February 10, 2010 \u2014 28 days later \u2014 to file his motion. He electronically filed the motion on February 10, 2010, the last permissible day. The district clerk docketed the motion, but deemed it \u201cdeficient\u201d because the proposed order that accompanied the motion \u2014 required by the local rules for certain motions \u2014 appeared in the motion document itself and not as a separate attachment. On February 12, 2010, Darouiche filed a corrected motion that was identical in all respects to the earlier version except for the placement of the proposed order, which was filed as a separate attachment. This corrected motion was filed out-of-time under Rule 59(b). The district court, denying Darouiche\u2019s motion \u201cfor the reasons enumerated in\u201d its prior order granting summary judgment for Fidelity, did not address whether Da-rouiche\u2019s motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>We conclude that Darouiche\u2019s Rule 59 motion for new trial was timely filed. Although the February 10 motion was deemed \u201cdeficient,\u201d the complained-of error was based solely on a local rule that requires a proposed order to be electronically filed as a separate attachment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This local rule applies only to ex parte and consent motions, which Darouiche\u2019s motion for new trial was not. Under these circumstances, a conclusion that the minor formatting error in Darouiche\u2019s February 10 motion rendered that motion too insufficient to be considered would unjustifiably elevate form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Moreover, such a conclusion would run afoul of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83. Local rules generally have the force of law \u201cas long as they do not conflict with a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, Congress, or the Constitution.\u201d <em>Kinsley, </em>570 F.3d at 589 (quoting <em>Contino v. United States, </em>535 F.3d 124, 126 (2d Cir.2008)). Rule 83 states: \u201cA local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a)(2). The local rule implicated here is a requirement of form only. There is no indication that Darouiche\u2019s failure to file his proposed order as a separate attachment was willful, and if the local rule is strictly enforced, Darouiche will lose his right to appeal. In accordance with Rule 83, we therefore conclude that Darouiche\u2019s February 10 motion was a sufficient and timely motion for a new trial under Rule 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Having confirmed our jurisdiction to consider this case, we now turn to the merits of Darouiche\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Nunez v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>604 F.3d 840, 844 (5th Cir.2010). Summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Nunez, </em>604 F.3d at 844. We may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any legal ground raised in the district court, even if that ground was not the basis for the decision below. <em>Bayle v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>615 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Darouiche\u2019s flood policy was issued by Fidelity as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (\u201cthe Program\u201d). Congress created the Program to provide flood insurance at rates that were uneconomical for private companies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Dwyer v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>565 F.3d 284, 285 (5th Cir.2009). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) administers the Program, and that agency has established, by regulation, a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (\u201cSFIP\u201d) under the Program. <em>See </em>44 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.13. Although the terms and conditions of SFIPs are fixed by FEMA regulations, the policies may be issued by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>private insurers known as Write Your Own (\u201cWYO\u201d) companies. <em>Dwyer, </em>565 F.3d at 285. Fidelity issued the flood policy to Darouiche in its capacity as a WYO company.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Darouiche\u2019s flood policy is a Dwelling Form SFIP, and its terms and conditions are codified in 44 C.F.R. pt. 61, app. A(l) (\u201cDwelling SFIP\u201d). No provision in the policy may be changed or waived \u201cwithout the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator.\u201d Dwelling SFIP, art. VII.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In relevant part, the SFIP states that a policyholder may not sue his insurer \u201cto recover money under this policy unless [he] ha[s] complied with all the requirements of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>art. VII.R. The same provision continues: \u201cThis requirement applies to ... any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded that Darouiche\u2019s allegations against Fidelity arose out of Fidelity\u2019s handling of the flood claim, and that Darouiche was therefore subject to the pre-suit prerequisites in Article VII.R. We agree. We must thus consider whether Darouiche complied with all of the requirements in the flood policy. If he did not, then he is barred as a matter of law from suing Fidelity to recover money under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The SFIP, in a section titled \u201cRequirements in Case of Loss,\u201d lists a policyholder\u2019s duties in instances of flood damage to the insured property. Dwelling SFIP, art. VII.J. Where a policyholder has incurred such flood damage, for instance, he is required to \u201cgive prompt written notice\u201d to the insurer. <em>Id. </em>art. VTI.J(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The SFIP also states that a policyholder must send \u201cproof of loss\u201d within 60 days after the loss. <em>Id. </em>art. VII.J(4). The proof of loss requirement was altered shortly after Hurricane Katrina, however. On August 31, 2005, the Acting Federal Insurance Administrator, David Maurstad, issued a memorandum (\u201cMaurstad memorandum\u201d) that waived the proof of loss requirement for uncontested claims. <em>Monistere v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>559 F.3d 390, 395 (5th Cir.2009). The memorandum stated that a policyholder no longer needed to file a proof of loss before receiving insurance proceeds. <em>Id. </em>If, however, the policyholder \u201cdisagree[d] with the insurer\u2019s adjustment, settlement, or payment of the claim,\u201d the policyholder was required to \u201csubmit to the insurer a proof of loss within one year from the date of loss.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">The district court determined that Darouiche\u2019s suit against Fidelity was barred because Darouiche had failed to comply with the notice requirement in Article VII.J(1). Although it agreed with Darouiche that the Maurstad memorandum had waived the proof of loss requirement, it concluded that the waiver did not extend to the requirement for \u201cprompt written notice.\u201d Dwelling SFIP, art. VII. J(l). Finding that Darouiche failed to provide <em>any </em>notice of his claim to Fidelity, the district court concluded that Darouiche was precluded as a matter of law from suing Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">On appeal, Darouiche raises two arguments that he presented in his motion for new trial. First, he contends that he complied with Article VII.J(l)\u2019s requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cprompt written notice\u201d because Teche, an additional insured under the flood policy, provided Fidelity with written notice of the loss. Specifically, Darouiche asserts that Teche\u2019s May 2006 letter to Fidelity \u2014 requesting certain precautions in the payment of the flood claim \u2014 fulfilled the notice requirement. In essence, Darouiche argues that because <em>Teche </em>fulfilled the notice requirement, <em>he </em>has complied with all of the policy\u2019s requirements for purposes of Article VII.R. Notably, Darouiche does not argue that he himself provided written notice of the loss to Fidelity. Second, Darouiche argues in the alternative that the Maurstad memorandum effectively waived the requirement of \u201cprompt written notice\u201d in Article VII.J(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We find Darouiche\u2019s extra-textual arguments to lack merit. As we explained in <em>Gowland v. Aetna, </em>\u201cthe provisions of an insurance policy issued pursuant to a federal program must be strictly construed and enforced.\u201d 148 F.3d 951, 954 (5th Cir.1998). <em>See also Marseilles Homeowners Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Fidelity Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>542 F.3d 1053, 1057 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cUnder FEMA regulations, strict adherence is required to all terms of the SFIP.\u201d). We must therefore, where possible, resolve this appeal on the plain text of the Dwelling SFIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The text of Article VII.R reads: <em>\u201cYou </em>may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless <em>you </em>have complied with all the requirements of the policy.\u201d The most sensible reading of this provision is that the <em>plaintiff </em>is required to comply with the SFIP provisions as a prerequisite to suit. Teche, having never been a party to this suit, cannot furnish the requisite compliance. The proper inquiry is whether <em>Darouiche </em>provided Fidelity with prompt written notice of his loss. It is undisputed that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Additionally, Article VII.D states that the Dwelling SFIP \u201ccannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be waived without the <em>express written consent </em>of the Federal Insurance Administrator.\u201d The Maurstad memorandum explicitly waived only the proof of loss requirement; it did not purport to waive any other requirement in the Dwelling SFIP. Article VII.D thus mandates the conclusion that the Maurstad memorandum neither changed nor waived the policy\u2019s requirement for \u201cprompt written notice.\u201d Darouiche was therefore required to show that, prior to suit, he had fulfilled this requirement, and his inability to do so warranted summary judgment for Fidelity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Darouiche appeals only the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Fidelity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">. Fidelity later sought to amend its summary judgment motion to include a federal preemption argument. The district court, however, denied Fidelity leave to file the amended motion. Because the issue was not properly raised in the district court, we do not consider whether Darouiche\u2019s tort claims against Fidelity are federally preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">. The district court granted Fidelity's motion in an order that was entered on the docket on January 12, 2010. The district court's judgment in favor of Fidelity, however, though signed on January 12, 2010, was not entered on the docket until January 13, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">. Although Darouiche did not specifically invoke Rule 59 in his motion for new trial, we conclude that Rule 59 was the appropriate vehicle for his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-14\">. The 2009 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure became effective on December 1, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-15\">.

The Maurstad memorandum also stated that where the insurer rejects the policyholder's proof of loss, \u201cthe policyholder may file a lawsuit against the insurer within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim as provided in VII.R.\u201d <em>Monistere, </em>559 F.3d at 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. We note that Darouiche's failure to send Fidelity a proof of loss may also support affir-mance in this case. The Maurstad memorandum waived the proof of loss requirement for uncontested claims only. We have previously held that a policyholder cannot file a lawsuit seeking <em>further </em>federal benefits under a SFIP unless he can show that he sent the insurer proof of loss within the specified one-year period. <em>See Marseilles Homeowners Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>542 F.3d at 1055-56 (citing <em>Richardson v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>279 Fed.Appx. 295 (5th Cir.2008)). Unlike the policyholders in those cases, Darouiche does not seek additional insurance payments under his policy\u2014 instead, he seeks to hold his insurer liable for its handling of his insurance claim. We have not previously addressed whether the proof of loss requirement applies to a plaintiff like Darouiche. But we have stated that a sworn proof of loss is a \"condition precedent\u201d to any suit against an insurer under a SFIP. <em>Marseilles Homeowners Condo. Ass'n, </em>542 F.3d at 1055. The application of this broad statement to Darouiche would have required him to file a proof of loss prior to filing this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
