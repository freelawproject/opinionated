Dodge brought this breach of contract action against CDW-Government, Inc. (\u201cCDW-G\u201d) for unpaid commission. After a bench trial, the district court awarded judgment on one claim to Dodge. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The parties do not dispute the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In February 2003, Dodge began work as an at-will technology sales account manager for CDW-G. When Dodge joined CDW-G, she received a document entitled \u201cWelcome to the CDW-G Account Management Team\u201d (hereinafter \u201cWelcome Document\u201d), which specified that Dodge\u2019s commission level \u201cadjusts based on ongoing adjusted average gross profit dollars.\u201d In the Welcome Document, CDW-G described the salary and commission it intended to pay Dodge but expressly cautioned that the Welcome Document did \u201cnot constitute or represent any contractual commitments.\u201d The Welcome Document explained that the \u201c[f]ull details of all CDW-G information\u201d were set forth in the \u201cCDW Sales Guidelines and Procedures\u201d (hereinafter \u201cHandbook\u201d), a copy of which Dodge received at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Like the Welcome Document, the Handbook disclaimed any intention by CDW-G to enter into a contract. Indeed, at the very outset, the preface of the Handbook stated that its \u201ccontents ... are presented as a matter of information only and do not create a contract.\u201d The Handbook further declared that \u201c[njone of the ... benefits described in this or any other handbook are intended to ... confer any rights or privileges,\u201d including any right to \u201cremain employed by CDW ... at any level of compensation.\u201d The main text of the Handbook went on to state that \u201cAccount Managers are paid on the Account Manager Commission Matrix.\u201d That matrix, in turn, set forth various commission levels corresponding to levels of experience and gross profit figures. Additionally, the Handbook explained that CDW-G tracked sales on a monthly basis and paid commissions each month based on the previous month\u2019s sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In July 2004, Dodge participated in a meeting in which Max Petersen, CDW-G\u2019s Senior Vice President of Sales, gave a Powerpoint presentation entitled \u201c2004 Federal Comp Plan Update.\u201d At that meeting, Petersen presented a \u201cnew federal matrix\u201d designed to \u201csimplify\u201d the old matrix and \u201cmotivate\u201d CDW-G\u2019s sales-force. This new matrix, like the old matrix set forth in the Handbook, consisted of a table of commission rates pegged to various experience levels and gross profit figures. Petersen did not expressly reference the Handbook\u2019s previous disclaimers, nor did the Powerpoint presentation contain any disclaimers of its own. Following the Powerpoint presentation, Dodge received a copy of the new federal matrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">On or about September 30, 2004, Dodge secured two purchase orders from the Defense Contract Management Agency. The first order involved the Agency\u2019s agreement to purchase $1.6 million of BlackBerry devices (\u201cBlackBerry Sale\u201d) from CDW-G, and the second involved the Agency\u2019s agreement to purchase $2.56 million of computer monitors (\u201cMonitor Sale\u201d) from CDW-G. Very soon thereafter, on November 24, 2004, CDW-G shipped and invoiced the BlaekBerries; the next month it paid Dodge a 19% commission on that sale. Before doing so, CDW-G reduced by $60,000 the \u201cadjusted gross profit\u201d figure used to calculate Dodge\u2019s commission; the reduction assertedly reflected the contributions of another CDW-G employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>CDW-G did not begin to ship the Monitors until at least late April 2005. According to the matrix distributed at the 2004 presentation, Dodge should have received a 19% commission on the Monitor Sale. Instead, CDW-G paid her only a 10% commission (in three monthly installments) totaling $81,727. Had CDW-G paid her at the 19% rate, Dodge would have received an additional $76,689.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On May 16, 2008, Dodge sued CDW-G for breach of contract, seeking unpaid commissions on both the BlaekBerry Sale and the Monitor Sale. After a bench trial, the district court held that the 2004 PowerPoint presentation qualified as a binding contract offer to pay Dodge a 19% commission on future sales. Accordingly, the district court found for Dodge with respect to the Monitor Sale and awarded her $76,689 in damages. The district court concluded that Dodge\u2019s claim pertaining to the BlackBerry sale was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Only CDW-G appeals. Thus, only the Monitor Sale is at issue before us. We review the district court\u2019s factual conclusions for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Roanoke Cement Co. v. Falk Corp., </em>418 F.3d 431, 433 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">CDW-G maintains that its representations to Dodge regarding her commission do not set forth an offer giving rise to a binding contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to CDW-G, it had no contractual obligation to pay Dodge any commission at all, including the 10% commission that it ultimately did provide her in connection with the Monitor Sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Under Virginia law, which the parties agree governs this dispute, a promise to pay commissions can form a unilateral contract even when made to at-will employees. <em>See Hercules Powder Co. v. Brookfield, </em>189 Va. 531, 53 S.E.2d 804, 808 (1949). But not every statement professing an employer\u2019s future intention to pay benefits commits that employer to a binding contract. <em>See Jensen v. IBM Corp., </em>454 F.3d 382 (4th Cir.2006). To the contrary, a statement constitutes a contract offer only if it \u201cmanifest[s] a willingness to enter into a bargain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, we held in <em>Jensen </em>that IBM\u2019s \u201cSoftware Sales Incentive Plan,\u201d which pegged employees\u2019 commissions to their ability to meet sales quotas, did not set forth an offer providing the basis for a binding contract but instead \u201cannounced a policy of payment in which [IBM] reserved discretion to itself to make the payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 388. In doing so, we observed that IBM\u2019s disclaimer \u2014 stating in part that \u201cthis program does not constitute a promise by IBM to make any distributions under it\u201d \u2014 \u201cmanifested [IBM\u2019s] clear intent to preclude the formation of a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Here, the district court acknowledged that CDW-G\u2019s Handbook contained similar disclaimers and so did not establish the basis for a contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>less found for Dodge, holding that the Handbook\u2019s disclaimers \u201cdid not insulate CDW-G from the contractual consequences\u201d of the \u201cunqualified federal matrix\u201d later presented to Dodge the 2004 Powerpoint presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We disagree. At the time of the 2004 presentation, the Handbook\u2019s disclaimers governed CDW-G\u2019s payment of commissions, and nothing said at the 2004 presentation eroded the force of those disclaimers. The Powerpoint presentation on which Dodge relies \u2014 articulating CDW-G\u2019s \u201cnew federal matrix\u201d \u2014 merely set forth a numerical table of commission rates beside bulleted explanations of those rates. This new matrix altered only the old matrix contained in the Handbook; it evinced no intent to transform CDW-G\u2019s commission policy from a non-binding informational statement into a contract offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">To be sure, the 2004 Powerpoint presentation never expressly repeated the Handbook\u2019s disclaimers. Such repetition was unnecessary, however, because the 2004 presentation functioned not as an independent offer but as a modification of the Handbook. Indeed, CDW-G called its new commission matrix a \u201csales plan <em>update,\u201d </em>and the Powerpoint presentation made explicit that the \u201cnew federal matrix\u201d on which Dodge relies simply replaced the \u201cold\u201d matrix contained in the Handbook. The \u201csales plan <em>changes </em>\u201d that resulted in the new matrix were just that \u2014 \u201cchanges\u201d to the sales plan articulated by the Handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The district court\u2019s statute of limitations analysis provides additional support for this conclusion. In rejecting Dodge\u2019s BlackBerry claim as untimely, the court found that the 2004 presentation formed an oral, rather than written, contract subject to a stricter three-year statute of limitations, because \u201cto understand the parties\u2019 rights and obligations ... one needs to rely on <em>agreements and understandings other than those set forth in the written federal matrix </em>\u201d (emphasis added). In fact, these necessary written \u201cagreements and understandings\u201d reside largely in the Handbook and the Welcome Document, which explain CDW-G\u2019s basic commission policy and outline crucial details such as the timing of payments and the mechanics of gross profit calculation. As such, interpretation of the 2004 Powerpoint presentation necessitates reference to the Handbook; only when combined with the Handbook does that presentation form a complete policy. The 2004 presentation thus functions as a <em>modification </em>to the Handbook\u2019s terms rather than a freestanding contract offer. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Southern Farm Agency, </em>122 Va. 264, 94 S.E. 761, 762 (1918) (noting that a company\u2019s change to its broker\u2019s commission was \u201cnot a new contract, but a modification of the original agreement\u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Because the 2004 presentation only modified the terms of the Handbook, the Handbook \u2014 as modified by the presentation \u2014 continued to govern CDW-G\u2019s commission payments. <em>See Warren v. Goodrich, </em>133 Va. 366, 112 S.E. 687, 694 (1922); <em>Carnes Co. v. Stone Creek Mech., Inc., </em>412 F.3d 845, 853 (7th Cir.2005). And nothing in the 2004 presentation purported to alter the Handbook\u2019s disclaimers or the nonbinding nature of CDW-G\u2019s projected commission rates. The 2004 presentation therefore \u201cdid not amount to an offer to enter into a contract, but the announcement of a nonbinding intention.\u201d <em>Jensen, </em>454 F.3d at 390. Although CDW-G\u2019s failure to make good on that professed intention may hamper its efforts to attract and motivate sales managers like Dodge, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>may even give rise to a claim based on quantum meruit, <em>see, e.g., Mongold v. Woods, </em>278 Va. 196, 677 S.E.2d 288, 292 (2009), it does not constitute a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. CDW-G alternatively contends that it modified the terms of any contract prior to Dodge's performance, and that Dodge\u2019s claim regarding the Monitor Sale is time-barred. Because we hold that CDW-G had no contractual obligation to pay Dodge any commission, we do not reach these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">. In her appellate brief, Dodge made a passing attempt to characterize the Handbook\u2019s disclaimers as insufficient. She also contended at oral argument that the Handbook's statement that account managers are \"guaranteed\u201d a certain \"minimum commission level\u201d overrides those disclaimers. We reject these arguments. The Handbook contains numerous explicit disclaimers making clear that its description of CDW-G\u2019s commission policy \u2014 including use of the term \"guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>teed\u201d \u2014 qualified as \"information only\u201d and did \"not create a contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
