Valadez\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in imposing a four-level leader/organizer role enhancement. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by four levels if \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). For the four-level enhancement to apply, the government must show that: (1) the defendant\u2019s role rose to the level of being an organizer or leader; and (2) the conspiracy involved five or more people or was otherwise extensive. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">On appeal, Valadez does not dispute that she was a leader or organizer in the migrant-worker conspiracy. Valadez contends that the conspiracy lacked the requisite five or more participants and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>the government failed to prove that the conspiracy was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d Because we conclude that the government presented sufficient evidence that at least five people were involved in the conspiracy, we do not address whether the conspiracy was otherwise extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">For purposes of counting the number of participants in the conspiracy, a \u201c \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.l; <em>see also United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.2004) (concluding that the manner of certain individuals\u2019 assistance in distributing counterfeit social security cards evidenced their knowledge of the scheme and made them \u201cparticipants\u201d for sentencing purposes). The defendant is included among the five participants. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Here, the trial record and the undisputed facts in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) demonstrated that Vala-dez\u2019s conspiracy involved at least five participants who knowingly engaged in illegal activities such that they could be held criminally responsible. In addition to Va-ladez herself, there was Jose Mendez, who assisted Valadez with multiple tasks, including meeting with illegal migrant workers, placing them in homes, driving them to work and collecting money; Freddy Ramos, who transported the illegal migrant workers; and Oscar Lopez-Cruz, who procured counterfeit identification documents for the illegal migrant workers. The PSI identified a fifth individual, named \u201cRigo,\u201d who also helped procure counterfeit documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Valadez argues that she never met one of the participants, Lopez-Cruz, the man to whom she sent migrant workers for fraudulent documents. The fact that some conspirators may not have known each other or Valadez directly is immaterial. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>17 F.3d 333, 337 (11th Cir.1994) (explaining that \u201c[i]n finding a single conspiracy, there is no requirement that each conspirator participated in every transaction, knew the other conspirators, or knew the details of each venture making up the conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\"><em>United States v. Martinez, </em>upon which Valadez relies, is distinguishable. In <em>Martinez, </em>the defendant pled guilty and disputed facts in the PSI for which the government did not present any evidence at the sentencing hearing. 584 F.3d at 1024-25. Valadez, unlike the defendant in <em>Martinez, </em>proceeded to trial, where the government presented evidence of her role in the offense, and she testified on her own behalf. Valadez\u2019s PSI, in turn, relied upon the trial evidence, and additional witness interviews, to support the leader/organizer enhancement. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining that sentencing court may rely upon evidence heard at trial, facts admitted in defendant\u2019s guilty plea, undisputed statements in PSI or evidence presented at sentencing hearing). Further, Valadez did not object to the PSI\u2019s factual statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">We find no merit to Valadez\u2019s argument that the district court had a duty to make explicit findings as to the identity of the five participants. This Court has concluded that \u201c[i]n making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings. So long as the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any disputed factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en bane) </em>(citations and emphasis omitted) (involving mitigating-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the four-level leader/organizer role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role as an organizer or leader. <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir.2003). We will not find clear error unless \"we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Given that, at sentencing, Valadez objected to the application of the four-level leader/organizer enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(a), we reject the government\u2019s argument that Valadez invited the alleged error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">. Although on appeal Valadez challenges the inclusion of Rigo, she did not object to any of the facts in the PSI that support his inclusion. Thus, Valadez admitted, for sentencing purposes, that Rigo was a co-conspirator. <em>See United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.), <em>cert,. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 272, 175 L.Ed.2d 183 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
