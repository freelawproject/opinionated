For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Muza was convicted by a jury of various drug-related crimes in the Southern District of Alabama. On September 8, 2000, he was sentenced to 292 months of imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, Muza filed a motion to vacate, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by the sentencing court. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit did not issue a certificate of appealability and later denied Muza\u2019s application to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. During the next several years, Muza filed several items in the sentencing court, including a petition for a writ of audita querela and an \u201cEmergency Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3),\u201d both of which the District Court denied as second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Muza v. United States, </em>Civ. No. 10-659, 2011 WL 98522 (S.D.Ala. Jan. 10, 2011), <em>adopting, </em>2010 WL 5572812 (S.D.Ala. Dec.17, 2010); <em>United States v. Muza, </em>Crim. No. 99-74, 2009 WL 2905569 (S.DAla. Sept.4, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">His prior attempts at relief having been unsuccessful, Muza filed a habeas petition in the Western District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In that petition, Muza asserted that his \u201ccontinuing confinement\u201d was \u201cunlawful\u201d because (1) one of the officers who testified against him at trial, John Stuckey, was subsequently indicted for various federal crimes in connection with corrupt police practices; (2) the sentencing court determined the quantity of drugs involved in Muza\u2019s crimes without forensic evidence; and (3) the sentencing court\u2019s determination of drug quantity and application of certain sentencing enhancements violated <em>Appren-di v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Muza also claimed to be actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">The District Court summarily denied Muza\u2019s petition, holding that Muza failed to establish that \u00a7 2255 was an ineffective or inadequate remedy such that relief under \u00a7 2241 would be available to him. It further concluded that the petition was barred by the abuse of the writ doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>trine. Muza timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and \u00a7 2253(a). \u201cWe exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings.\u201d <em>Manna v. Schultz, </em>591 F.3d 664, 665 (3d Cir.2010) (per cu-riam). We may summarily affirm if no substantial question is presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Accordingly, \u201cunless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u2018inadequate or ineffective,\u2019 a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 [attacking a prisoner\u2019s conviction or sentence] cannot be entertained by the court.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). That standard is met \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim,\u201d and is not met simply because a \u00a7 2255 motion has been or would be unsuccessful. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538-39; <em>see also In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Section 2255 clearly provides Muza with a sufficient and adequate means of pursuing his collateral attack on his convictions and sentence. Furthermore, the facts underlying Muza\u2019s claims were known to him at the time he was sentenced such that he could have pursued all of his claims in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, it appears that Muza raised the issue of Stuckey\u2019s misconduct in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion and challenged the sentencing court\u2019s determination of drug quantity on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Muza, </em>232 Fed.Appx. 934, 935 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe affirmed Muza\u2019s convictions and sentence and found no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity.\u201d). That Muza\u2019s claims were previously unsuccessful does not entitle him to an opportunity to relitigate those claims through \u00a7 2241. <em>See Manna, </em>591 F.3d at 665 (\u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 merely because the sentencing court has denied relief or because the petitioner cannot meet the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255.\u201d) (citations omitted). Muza\u2019s allegations of actual innocence, which are based solely on the constitutional claims alleged in his petition, do not change that conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(summarily affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>dismissal of \u00a7 2241 petition despite petitioner\u2019s allegations of actual innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Since Muza\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm. Given our conclusion that the District Court correctly held \u00a7 2241 to be unavailable to Muza, we need not address the abuse of the writ doctrine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. Muza filed a motion for a certificate of appealability in the District Court, which has been treated as a timely notice of appeal. Federal prisoners seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 do not require a certificate of appealability to proceed with an appeal. <em>See United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\">. Muza was sentenced on September 8, 2000, after the Supreme Court issued <em>Apprendi. </em>Furthermore, Stuckey\u2019s corrupt police practices were publicized in August 2000, and their potential impact on Muza\u2019s sentence was raised before the sentencing court prior to sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\">.Muza\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>in which we held that a prisoner \"who claims that s/he is factually or legally innocent as a result of a previously unavailable statutory interpretation\u201d could seek review under \u00a7 2241. 119 F.3d at 248. The petitioner in that case established exceptional circumstances, namely, he had been convicted for conduct subsequently deemed not to be criminal. No such circumstances exist in Muza's case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
