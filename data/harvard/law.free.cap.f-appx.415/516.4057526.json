We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-25\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-28\">The district court\u2019s order denying Liberte\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was entered on the docket on October 22, 2010. The no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tice of appeal was filed on November 28, 2010.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Liberte failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-5\"> Because Liberte is incarcerated, he is deemed to have filed the notice of appeal on the date he deposited it in the prison mail system. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1). Liberte signed and dated his notice of appeal November 23, 2010. Because this date is the earliest date on which Liberte could have deposited his notice of appeal in the prison mail system, we have afforded Liberte the presumption that he filed his notice of appeal on November 23, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
