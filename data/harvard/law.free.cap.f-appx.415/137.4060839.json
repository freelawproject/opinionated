No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">A person who applies for Social Security disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The ALJ must evaluate (1) whether the claimant engaged in substantial gainful work; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether, in the light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">On appeal, David-O\u2019Brien argues that the ALJ erred by concluding implicitly that Dr. Ernesto Lamadrid \u2014 one of the doctors who treated her at the Alachua County Health Department and completed a physical capacity evaluation and mental assessment questionnaire of Davis-O\u2019Brien \u2014 was not her treating physician. She also contends that no good cause existed for not according Lamadrid\u2019s opinion substantial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Absent \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, the ALJ must give substantial weight to the opinion, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Good cause exists under these circumstances: (1) the treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) the treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 </em>F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ clearly must articulate reasons for giving less weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Even assuming that Lamadrid was Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s treating physician as she asserts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, the ALJ correctly discounted Lamadrid\u2019s opinion because his assessment of Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s mental and physical limitations was inconsistent with other medical evidence in the record. For instance, La-madrid concluded that Davis-O\u2019Brien could walk only one hour in an eight-hour workday; but other doctors who examined her concluded that Davis-O\u2019Brien was capable of performing most work-related activities that did not require heavy lifting and could walk normally. Another doctor who conducted an RFC assessment of Davis-O\u2019Brien concluded that she could walk for about six hours in an eight-hour workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Lamadrid also concluded that Davis-O\u2019Brien had marked restrictions in activities of daily living and only a fair ability to complete a normal workday without interruptions from psychologically-based symptoms. But other examining doctors concluded that she had only mild restrictions in activities of daily living and that she could meet the general demands of light duty work. In addition, as the ALJ noted, the single assessment by Lamadrid did not indicate the length or frequency of his treating relationship with Davis-O\u2019Brien. Thus, substantial record evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Lamadrid\u2019s opinion about Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s physical and mental limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">We turn to Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred in concluding, at step five, that she could perform other jobs in the national economy because the ALJ did not pose hypothetical questions to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) that accurately reflected all of Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s work limitations. At the fifth step, the \u201cpreferred method\u201d of demonstrating that a claimant can perform other jobs is through the testimony of a VE. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>For a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question that comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>Id. </em>But the ALJ is not required to include in the question claims of impairments that are unsupported. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Davis-O\u2019Brien argues that the ALJ should have included in the hypothetical question to the VE the limitations articulated by Lamadrid, including that she had marked restrictions in activities of daily living and had a fair ability to function in other areas. But, as noted above, the ALJ had good cause to discount Lamadrid\u2019s opinion of Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s abilities based on contradictory medical evidence; so, the ALJ was not required to include Lama-drid\u2019s findings in the hypothetical questions to the VE. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Davis-O\u2019Brien also argues that the ALJ should have included limitations articulated by two other doctors in the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But Davis-O\u2019Brien never raised this claim about these certain doctors and limitations before the administrative agency or the district court. Thus, she has waived the issue; and we need not consider it now. <em>See Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that arguments not raised before the administrative agency or the district court will not be considered on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Therefore, Davis-O\u2019Brien\u2019s arguments do not evidence error on the part of the ALJ in its hypothetical questions to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. Disability is the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-20\">. Here, the ALJ concluded that Davis-O'Brien had severe impairments of chronic bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, degenerative disc disease of the spine, and affective mood disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">. A treating physician is the medical professional \u201cmost able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture\u201d of the claimant\u2019s medical impairments and \"may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations.\" <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-15\">. Davis-O\u2019Brien testified that she thought La-madrid treated her twice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. These doctors' assessments included that Davis-O'Brien had a \"moderate inability\u201d to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, perform at a consistent pace, and accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors and a \u201cmoderate inability\u201d to understand and remember detailed instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
