In this appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion by rejecting his argument concerning the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l) to his case. Specifically, he contends that \u00a7 2X1.1 applies because his offense conduct involved an attempt and \u00a7 2S1.3 is excluded from the application note for \u00a7 2X1.1 listing guidelines that expressly cover attempts. Additionally, he argues that he was entitled to application of three-level reduction of \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(l) because the record does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that he would have completed the offense but for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2005). Our review of the record shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s denial of the requested reduction. The plain language of both \u00a7 2X1.1 and \u00a7 2S1.3 supports the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations. Further, the facts contained in the record show that Avila-Ortiz had taken many significant steps towards completion of the offense and had made substantial progress towards achieving his illicit goal. <em>See United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 283 (5th Cir.2010). Indeed, when he was arrested the only step left was for him to take his unreported cash across the border, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that anything save for arrest would have prevented him from completing this task. Avila-Ortiz\u2019s arguments are unavailing, and he has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
