He raises two issues on appeal. First, Kellam argues that the district court erred in imposing the two-year consecutive sentence mandated by the aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, because its application created an unwarranted sentence disparity in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Second, Kellam argues that the district court erred in counting certain parent companies and their subsidiaries as separate \u201cvictims\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 633, 178 L.Ed.2d 509 (2010). \u201cWe review findings of fact for clear error and application of the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ing guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 887 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1302, 175 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2010). \u201c \u2018Although review for clear error is deferential, a finding of fact must be supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007)). And at sentencing, \u201c \u2018[w]hen a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence,\u2019 \u201d the government must, \u201c \u2018with rehable and specific evidence,\u2019 \u201d establish that fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 F.3d 882, 890 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201c \u2018Whether a person is a victim\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018is a legal conclusion we review <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1275 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">To address Kellam\u2019s first argument, we must begin with \u00a7 1028A\u2019s plain language. <em>See Segarra, </em>582 F.3d at 1271. \u201cIf the statute\u2019s meaning is plain and unambiguous, there is no need for further inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>289 F.3d 1329, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation and citation omitted)). In pertinent part, \u00a7 1028A states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\">(b) Consecutive <em>sentence. </em>\u2014 Notwith<em>standing any other provision of </em>law\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(3) in determining any term of imprisonment to be imposed for the [underlying felony], a court shall not in any way reduce the term to be imposed for such crime so as to compensate for, or otherwise take into account, any separate term of imprisonment imposed or to be imposed for a violation of [\u00a7 1028A]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">We interpreted a similar statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), in <em>United States v. McLy-mont, </em>45 F.3d 400 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). In <em>McLymont, </em>we concluded that \u201cCongress\u2019 use of the phrase \u2018notwithstanding any other provision of law\u2019 makes it clear that Congress intended the penalty provisions of \u00a7 924(c) to take precedence over any preexisting or subsequently-enacted sentencing legislation, including the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d 45 F.3d at 401. Section 1028A plainly prohibits a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence for his or her underlying offense in order to compensate for the statute\u2019s mandatory two-year sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(b)(3). And this mandate \u201ctake[s] precedence over any preexisting or subsequently-enacted sentencing legislation,\u201d including \u00a7 3553\u2019s sentencing factors. <em>See McLymont, </em>45 F.3d at 401. Consequently, the district court did not err either in sentencing Kellam to an additional two years pursuant to \u00a7 1028A, or in disregarding that additional two-year term in imposing sentences for Kellam\u2019s underlying offenses, regardless of the disparity between his total sentence and those of his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">As to Kellam\u2019s second argument, the government introduced testimony at the sentencing hearing establishing that the following financial institutions were in some way involved in parent-subsidiary relationships at the time of the offense conduct: (1) GE Money Bank and GE Capital Finance; (2) Chase Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank; (3) Wells Fargo and Wachovia; and (4) Bank of America and FIA Card Services. Taking these relationships into account, the district court found that there were 52 separate victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The Sentencing Guidelines impose a four-level enhancement when an offense involves 50 or more victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B). \u201cVictim\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under\u201d \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. And \u201cindividuals, corporations, [and] companies ...\u201d are included, among other en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tities, in the definition of <em>\u201c[p]ersonId. </em>The commentary does not explain whether a parent company and its subsidiary should be treated as one or multiple victims. But generally a parent company and its subsidiary are separate entities unless \u201cthe corporate veil can be pierced.\u201d <em>See Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. UGI Utils., Inc., </em>463 F.3d 1201, 1204 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Based on the testimony presented at the sentencing hearing, the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the nature of the business relationships among the entities in question were not clearly erroneous. And because nothing suggested that the corporate veil had been or should be pierced, the district court correctly determined that these parent companies and their subsidiaries were separate victims. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
