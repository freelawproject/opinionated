He argues that he should not be held accountable under \u00a7 1B1.8 for the acts of his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">According to the undisputed facts as set forth in the presentence investigation report, Brantley\u2019s Marine and Gun, a federally licensed firearms dealer in Georgia, was burglarized in the early morning hours of December 11, 2009. Police officers responded to an alarm at Brantley\u2019s, saw that a concrete block had been thrown through the window, and later determined that eight firearms had been stolen. Four days after the burglary, law enforcement used a confidential informant to purchase a pistol from Wrice at his home. After the transaction, officers searched Wrice\u2019s home, found cocaine base, and arrested Wrice. Two days after that, Wrice told two officers during an interview that just before the burglary he dropped off Nicholas Carwell and Justin Mosely at Wal-Mart, a few blocks from Brantley\u2019s, and that Carwell and Mosely broke into Brant-ley\u2019s and stole some firearms. Wrice picked them up after the burglary at a Holiday Inn Express near Brantley\u2019s. When the three men arrived at Wrice\u2019s residence, Carwell and Mosely gave him one of the pistols, which he later sold to the informant, and they took the rest of the firearms. Wrice later admitted that he knew Mosely and Carwell were planning to steal guns before the burglary occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). Section 2K2.1 of the guidelines applies to the \u201cUnlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. It includes a four-level enhancement based on a specific offense characteristic \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The application notes for subsection (b)(6) explain that if burglary is the other felony offense connected with the firearm use or possession, \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) applies to \u201ca defendant who, during the course of [the] burglary, finds and takes a firearm, even if the defendant did not engage in any other conduct with that firearm during the course of the burglary.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(B). That application note goes on to explain that \u201capplication of subsection! ](b)(6) ... is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Wrice argues that the application note about burglary is fact specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>and \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) cannot be extended to him based on it because there is no evidence that he was the \u201cdefendant\u201d who found or took a firearm during the course of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Relevant conduct plays a role in the application of a specific offense characteristic enhancement like the one in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A)-(B). Section 1B1.3 of the guidelines is titled \u201cRelevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range).\u201d It provides that \u201c[u]nless otherwise specified ... specific offense characteristics ... shall be determined on the basis of ... all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). For \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d like the burglary in the present case, a specific offense characteristic enhancement is based on \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance\u201d of that activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). In the context of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), a \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d is \u201ca criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Nothing in \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) suggests that the relevant conduct rules under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) do not apply. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). While application note 14(B) to \u00a7 2K2.1 clarifies that subsection (b)(6) applies when a defendant, during the course of a burglary, \u201cfinds and takes a firearm,\u201d nothing in that note requires the conclusion that \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) applies only when the defendant himself finds and takes a firearm during the burglary. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(B). Where the Sentencing Commission has intended to limit the relevant conduct that applies to a defendant, it has expressly done that. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 13(B) (explaining that in applying subsection (b)(5) of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 \u201c[t]he term \u2018defendant,\u2019 consistent with \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct), limits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant\u2019s own conduct and conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.6 cmt. n. 1(A) (explaining that in applying subsection (b)(1) of \u00a7 2K2.6 \u201c[cjonsistent with \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the term \u2018defendant\u2019 ... limits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant\u2019s own conduct and conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d). If the Sentencing Commission had intended to limit the relevant conduct that applies to a defendant for purposes of a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement, it would have expressly included a limitation. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2003) (interpreting a sentencing guideline in light of the rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The relevant conduct rules in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(1)(B) apply to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) under the facts of this case. It was reasonably foreseeable that Wrice\u2019s codefen-dants, in the course of burglarizing a gun store with the intention of stealing guns, would find and take a firearm. Because Wrice is accountable for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance\u201d of their jointly undertaken criminal activity, he was properly held accountable for the finding and taking of a firearm in connection with the burglary of the gun store. The district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>err by applying the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">. That provision makes it a crime: \"to steal or unlawfully take or carry away from the person or the premises of a person who is licensed to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, any firearm in the licensee\u2019s business inventory that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(u).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\">. \"[W]e must interpret the text of the Guidelines in light of the corresponding Commentary and Application Notes, which are binding on the courts unless they contradict the plain meaning of the text of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v.
