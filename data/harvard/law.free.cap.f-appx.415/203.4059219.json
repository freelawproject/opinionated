The IJ\u2019s decision denied asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">On appeal, Petitioner argues that he demonstrated extraordinary circumstances sufficient to overcome his failure to file his asylum application within one year of arriving in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, as the government notes correctly, we lack jurisdiction over this claim. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), to review an IJ\u2019s untimeliness ruling). So, we dismiss the petition for review on asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Petitioner also challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. But in his notice of appeal to the BIA, Petitioner did not mention the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination; and Petitioner filed no brief before the BIA. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (to raise properly a claim before the BIA, petitioner must mention the issue in his brief and must discuss its merits, or at least contest the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision). Even though the BIA addressed the adverse credibility determination <em>sua sponte, </em>we lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s present challenge because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies on it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim that an applicant did not raise before the BIA\u2014 even if the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>addressed the claim \u2014 because the applicant did not exhaust administrative remedies). We dismiss the petition for review on the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">We have jurisdiction only over the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner otherwise had not met his burden of proof for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner sought relief from removal based on his political opinion. He alleged that Pablo Escobar Mendez, the mayor of his hometown of Aguacatan, was corrupt and elected through fraud. Many of the townspeople, including Petitioner, protested Mendez\u2019s election in a public park; and people who worked for Mendez began attacking people in the crowd. Petitioner alleged that he was beaten at the protest and had to miss one month of work. He also alleged that people who worked for Mendez threatened him and his sister at his mother\u2019s house and later threatened his mother after Petitioner had come to the United States. On appeal, Petitioner argues that he and his family were persecuted because of their political beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[i]nsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>And we review fact determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test\u201d whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation and internal quotation omitted). We \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [BIA\u2019s] decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision\u201d; and we may reverse the BIA\u2019s fact determinations \u201conly when the record compels a reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The burden of proof is on the alien to show his eligibility for withholding of removal by demonstrating past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. An alien may meet this burden based on his testimony alone, without corroboration or documentation, if he refers to sufficient specific facts to satisfy the trier of fact that he is credible and persuasive. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>D-Mu-humed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004). Because the IJ and BIA determined that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not credible and we lack jurisdiction to review this determination, we may reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if corroborating evidence compels a finding that Petitioner was entitled to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">And Petitioner\u2019s corroborating evidence, including newspaper articles and country reports, provided only general background information about human rights conditions in Guatemala and about protests to Mendez\u2019s election. Nothing demonstrated that Petitioner himself was harmed or likely is to be harmed in the future because of his involvement with the protest of Mendez\u2019s election. The affidavit from Petitioner\u2019s aunt offered only conelusory statements without specific allegations of harm. So, Petitioner\u2019s non-credible testimony did not suffice to meet his burden without corroborating evidence; and Petitioner\u2019s corroborating evidence does not compel the conclusion that he is entitled to withholding of removal. We deny the petition for review on withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">. Petitioner raises no challenge to the portion of IJ\u2019s decision denying relief under the Convention Against Torture; so, that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-16\">. Petitioner arrived in the United States in March 2004 but did not file his asylum application until July 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">. Before the BIA, Petitioner stated that he was beaten and threatened by a political figure and his followers and that the IJ decided incorrectly because he was persecuted for his political beliefs. Thus, Petitioner exhausted challenges to the denial of withholding of removal on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
