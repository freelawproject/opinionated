For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Millard, a federal prisoner, was charged with a disciplinary violation of possession of a weapon. According to the officer who wrote the incident report, he found a 9.5 inch shank (a homemade knife) made of copper pipe in Millard\u2019s cell inside a pair of socks in a mesh laundry bag sitting on top of Millard\u2019s bed. After a hearing, Millard was found guilty and sanctioned to sixty days of disciplinary segregation, a fifty-four-day disallowance of good conduct time, a 270-day forfeiture of non-vested good conduct time, a loss of telephone and visiting privileges for eighteen months, and a loss of commissary privileges for one year. After challenging the sanction through the Bureau of Prison\u2019s administrative process, Millard filed a \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the loss of good conduct time. The District Court denied the petition, and Millard filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">In his habeas petition, Millard argued that his disciplinary proceedings violated his due process rights because he did not have access to video footage of his cell that he wished to utilize to prepare for his hearing. Millard, however, explicitly conceded in his reply brief that he had no viable due process claim. To the extent that a due process claim may have survived Millard\u2019s concession, the claim fails. For substantially the reasons outlined by the District Court, the process provided to Millard in the disciplinary proceedings satisfied the requirements of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-67, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">The claims that Millard continues to pursue assert that Millard\u2019s loss of good conduct time was unfair and unreasonable. Millard argued that his punishment violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and also seems to argue a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The District Court did not frame the claims in terms of specific constitutional violations. Instead, the District Court found that the sanctions \u201cfall within the severity level set forth for the prohibited act,\u201d and accordingly denied the habeas petition. Because Millard\u2019s claims lack merit, the District Court properly denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly situated be treated alike. <em>See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). To make out a successful claim, the petitioner must show purposeful discrimination that had a discriminatory effect on the petitioner. <em>See McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987). Millard cited various cases in which inmates received less severe punishment for the same violation committed by Millard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>(possession of a weapon), arguing that because he received harsher punishment than other inmates for the same offense, the punishment must have been the result of discrimination. Beyond such an inference, however, Millard put forward no evidence that his punishment was the result of purposeful discrimination. Millard\u2019s argument falls well short of establishing the purposeful discrimination necessary to make out an equal protection claim. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that purposeful discrimination means \u201cthat the decisionmakers in [the claimant\u2019s] ease acted with discriminatory purpose\u201d). Accordingly, Millard\u2019s equal protection claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Millard\u2019s argument that the punishment imposed was unreasonable could also be construed as an Eighth Amendment claim challenging a punishment as \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.\u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 271, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). To the extent that a loss of good conduct time could constitute an Eighth Amendment violation, Millard\u2019s punishment does not reach that level of severity. Although the fifty-four-day disallowance of good conduct time and 270-day forfeiture of non-vested good conduct time in Millard\u2019s case was harsh punishment, it fell within the range of acceptable punishments outlined by the applicable regulations. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the punishment did not violate the Eighth Amendment and was reasonable in light of the regulations guiding Discipline Hearing Officer punishment decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Based on the above, the District Court properly denied Millard\u2019s habeas petition. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">. Although the regulations state that the Discipline Hearing Officer (\"DHO\u201d) will \"ordinarily\u201d disallow between 27-41 days of good conduct time, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3 (Greatest Category) (B.l), the regulations also permit the DHO \"to go above the guideline range ... for a greatly aggravated offense,\u201d as long as the departure from the guideline range is \"documented and justified in the DHO report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Table 4(l)(b.l). The DHO explained in his report that the sanctions were imposed because \"[pjossession of a weapon can lead to serious injury ... and may escalate into a major confrontation between inmates and staff....\u201d These are adequate reasons for imposing a harsher punishment than that recommended by the regulations\u2019 guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-19\">. To the extent that Millard challenges the constitutionally of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13 in his brief in support of appeal, the claim was never raised below and is accordingly waived on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
