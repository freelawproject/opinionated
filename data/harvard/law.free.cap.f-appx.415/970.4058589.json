Capital Financial, Inc., Jeffrey R. Deering, Richard Guarino, and John F. Buschel, Jr. appeal the grant of summary judgment entered in favor of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and against defendants, jointly and severally, for permanent injunctive relief and for equitable monetary relief in the amount of $17,800,509.00. In a three-count complaint, the FTC alleged that the defendants violated the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a), and Telemarketing Sales Rule (\u201cTSR\u201d), 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3(a)(2)(iii), by making false and misleading representations in connection with the marketing of advance-fee credit cards. The FTC also alleged that the defendants violated the TSR, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.4(a)(4), by requesting and receiving payment of a $200 fee before obtaining or arranging an extension of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">The defendants argue on appeal that the district court erred by: (1) granting summary judgment for the FTC; (2) finding individual liability; (3) granting the FTC\u2019s request for a permanent injunction against American Financial; (4) freezing their assets; and (5) awarding consumer redress. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">Between November 2004 and late 2007, the defendants marketed and sold advance fee credit cards to consumers through telephone solicitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the calls, consumers were told that they had been approved for a credit card with a credit limit of $2,000, cash advance capabilities, and a fixed interest rate of 8.9%. Consumers were also told that to open an account they had to pay a one-time fee of $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">Once consumers agreed to open an account and provided their bank information for payment of the one-time fee, they listened to a recorded \u201cverification script.\u201d The recording set out the credit card\u2019s terms and conditions. It informed callers that the card being offered was \u201cnot affiliated with [Vjisa or [Mjastercard\u201d and was a \u201cmerchant finance account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">Consumers received a thin-plastic card usable only for purchasing products from an online catalog. The FTC learned that the Better Business Bureau of West Florida had received 766 complaints against American Financial and 52 complaints against USA Financial. In the complaints, consumers stated that they paid the $200 fee believing that they were obtaining a credit card that could be used to make purchases anywhere \u2014 not a catalog card that could only be used at the defendants\u2019 online store.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">The FTC filed this action, alleging violations of the FTCA and the TSR. The district court granted the FTC\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>summary judgment, concluding that no reasonable trier of fact could find in the defendants\u2019 favor. The defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Rine v. Imagitas, Inc., </em>590 F.3d 1215, 1222 (11th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>see also Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe basic issue before the court on a motion for summary judgment is \u2018whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. at 2512)).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Section 5 of the FTCA makes \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\u201d unlawful. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1). \u201cTo establish liability under section 5 of the FTCA, the FTC must establish that (1) there was a representation; (2) the representation was likely to mislead customers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and (3) the representation was material.\u201d <em>FTC v. Tashman, </em>318 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">The defendants made material representations in their telemarketing calls that created the deceptive impression that they were offering consumers a general purpose credit card. <em>See FTC v. Cyberspace.Com, LLC, </em>453 F.3d 1196, 1200-01 (9th Cir.2006) (finding a mailing extending an offer for services at a monthly fee unlawful because it created the deceptive impression that it was simply a refund or rebate). The defendants represented that the offered card had the features of a general purpose card. Consumers were told that it had a fixed interest rate, a $2,000 credit limit, and cash advance capabilities. The verification scripts that informed consumers that the credit card being offered was not affiliated with Visa or Mastercard and was a \u201cmerchant finance account\u201d failed to dispel the confusion that the defendants\u2019 representations created among reasonable consumers. The overall impression created by the calls was that consumers were receiving a card that could be used to make purchases anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the Receiver\u2019s finding that less than 3 percent of USA Financial\u2019s 2007 revenues were derived from merchandise sales. The fact that consumers did not purchase the defendant\u2019s products after obtaining their credit cards, which they could use to buy only defendant\u2019s products, suggests that they were actually deceived. While \u201c[pjroof of actual deception is unnecessary to establish a violation of Section 5, such proof is highly probative to show that a practice is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1201 (alteration in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the FTC on the FTCA \u00a7 5 violation because, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the defendants, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the telemarketing calls were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>not likely to mislead customers acting reasonably under the circumstances in a way that is material. <em>See Tashman, </em>318 F.3d at 1277.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">We also conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the FTC on the TSR violations. Under 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3(a)(2)(iii), \u201c[i]t is a deceptive telemarketing act or practice ... for any seller or telemarketer\u201d in the sale of goods or services to misrepresent, directly or by implication, \u201c[a]ny material aspect of the performance, efficacy, nature, or central characteristics of goods or services that are the subject of a sales offer.\u201d The defendants violated \u00a7 310.3(a)(2)(iii) by creating the impression in their solicitations that the credit card being offered could be used to make purchases anywhere. Likewise, \u00a7 310.4(a)(4) criminalizes \u201c[rjequesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration in advance of obtaining a loan or other extension of credit when the seller or telemarketer has guaranteed or represented a high likelihood of success in obtaining or arranging a loan or other extension of credit for a person.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.4(a)(4). Based on the undisputed facts, the defendants violated \u00a7 310.4(a)(4) by representing to consumers that they would be approved for a credit card upon paying a $200 ad-vanee fee for the card. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Defendants Deering, Guarino, and Buschel, Jr. also contend that the district court erred by finding, as a matter of law, that they were liable in their individual capacities. An individual may be held liable under the FTCA for corporate practices if the FTC shows \u201cthat the individual defendants participated directly in the practices or acts or had authority to control them.... The FTC must then demonstrate that the individual had some knowledge of the practices.\u201d <em>FTC v. Gem Merch. Corp., </em>87 F.3d 466, 470 (11th Cir.1996) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Defendants Deering and Buschel, Jr. argue that the district court erred in concluding that they participated in or \u201chad authority to control\u201d the corporate entities\u2019 illegal acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence shows that Deering was a manager of USA Financial. In that capacity, he signed checks and an application for telephone service on behalf of the corporation. The evidence also shows that Buschel was listed as the vice president of American Financial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>bank documents. Buschel also signed bank applications and resolutions on the corporation\u2019s behalf. In their capacity as manager and vice president, and as demonstrated by their conduct, Deering and Buschel had the \u201cauthority to control\u201d the corporate entities\u2019 acts. For that reason, the district court did not err in imposing individual liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"A4V\">American Financial contends that the district court lacked authority under section 18(b) to issue a permanent injunction against it. Section 13(b) of the FTCA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53(b), provides that \u201cin proper cases the [FTC] may seek, and after proper proof, the court may issue, a permanent injunction.\u201d <em>See Amy Travel Serv., Inc., </em>875 F.2d at 571 (explaining that \u201cSection 13(b) is often used by the FTC to pursue violations of section 5 of the FTCA or other violations of statutes\u201d). In this case, the district court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in conduct that would violate section 5 of the FTCA or any provision of the TSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">American Financial argues that the district court erred by granting a permanent injunction under \u00a7 13(b) based on past violations of the FTCA or TSR that ceased before the FTC brought suit and have not been shown likely to recur. <em>See FTC. v. Evans Products Co., </em>775 F.2d 1084, 1087-88 (9th Cir.1985) (holding that a district court may not issue a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 13(b) to remedy past violations that have not been shown likely to recur). According to the undisputed facts, American Financial ceased its deceptive practices in late 2007. The FTC\u2019s complaint was filed on May 12, 2008. American Financial asserts that the district court failed to make a finding that there was a reasonable likelihood that its violations would recur. Accordingly, American Financial argues that the district court\u2019s issuance of a permanent injunction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">In this case, the district court enjoined American Financial from engaging in future violations of the FTCA and TSR even though its unlawful conduct had ceased. Under those circumstances, permanent in-junctive relief is appropriate if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s past conduct indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood of further violations in the future.\u201d <em>SEC v. Caterinicchia, </em>613 F.2d 102, 105 (5th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>SEC v. Blatt, </em>583 F.2d 1325, 1334 (5th Cir.1978)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court concluded that permanent injunctive relief was necessary to prevent future violations. The court found that \u201cthe transformation of Capital Financial into American Financial, and American Financial\u2019s transformation into USA Financial\u201d indicated a reasonable likelihood of future violations. We agree. The defendants\u2019 formation of new corporate entities to facilitate their violations of the FTCA and TSR demonstrates an unwillingness to comply with the law. The district court therefore did not err in issuing a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">In July 2008, the defendants agreed to, and the district court entered, a \u201cStipulated Preliminary Injunction with Asset Freeze and Appointment of Receiver.\u201d After granting summary judgment in favor of the FTC, the district court entered an order keeping the asset freeze \u201cin effect until the Defendants have made full payment of the monetary judgment.\u201d The defendants contend that was error because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>the FTC failed to show a likelihood of asset dissipation if the asset freeze was not maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">As an incident to its express statutory authority under section 13(b) of the FTCA, a \u201cdistrict court has the inherent power of a court of equity to grant ancillary relief, including freezing assets and appointing a Receiver.\u201d <em>FTC v. U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Corp., </em>748 F.2d 1431, 1432 (11th Cir.1984). Congress intended to give district courts \u201cauthority to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomplish complete justice,\u201d including freezing assets. <em>Id. </em>at 1434 (quoting <em>FTC v. H.N. Singer, Inc., </em>668 F.2d 1107, 1113 (9th Cir.1982)). In this case, the frozen assets were profits from the defendants\u2019 illegal activities. Maintaining the asset freeze until the monetary judgment was satisfied was necessary to \u201caccomplish complete justice.\u201d <em>See CSC Holdings, Inc. v. Redisi, </em>309 F.3d 988, 996 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201cSince the [frozen] assets in question here were profits the [defendants] made by unlawfully stealing [the plaintiffs] services, the freeze was appropriate and may remain in place pending final disposition of the case.\u201d). The district court\u2019s imposition of the asset freeze was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Finally, the defendants assert in their brief that the district court erred in awarding consumer redress in the amount of $17,300,509.00. However, the defendants fail to explain why the district court\u2019s award was erroneous. \u201cWe routinely decline to address such cursory arguments, and this case presents no exception.\u201d <em>United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 821 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (\u2018We may decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue in its initial or reply brief. Without such argument the issue is deemed waived.\u201d). We therefore decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">For all of these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AMe\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-11\">. Because this case is before us after the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the FTC, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the defendants, the non-moving party. <em>See Bankston v. Then, </em>615 F.3d 1364, 1367 n. 3 (11th Cir.2010) (\"We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b996-5\">. We note that the defendants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the FTC because they had a \"good faith\u201d defense and were operating under a consumer finance license issued by the state of Florida. However, a defendant cannot avoid liability under section 5 of the FTCA by showing that he acted in good faith because the statute does not require an intent to deceive. <em>See Orkin Exterminating Co. v. FTC, </em>849 F.2d 1354, 1368 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Curtis Lumber Co. v. Louisiana Pacific Corp., </em>618 F.3d 762, 779 (8th Cir.2010) (collecting cases). In any event, the fact that a defendant operated under a state issued license has no bearing on whether the defendant engaged in \u201cdeceptive acts.\u201d Neither contention gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the FTC on those grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b996-12\">. Defendants Deering, Guarino, and Buschel, Jr. also argue that the FTC failed to establish a FTCA \u00a7 5 violation and therefore individual liability was improper. <em>See FTC v. Amy Travel Serv., Inc., </em>875 F.2d 564, 573 (7th Cir.1989) (explaining that an individual may be held liable under the FTCA for corporate practices only after corporate liability is established). We have already determined that the defendants' conduct violated FTCA \u00a7 5. This derivative argument is therefore no longer viable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
