After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">A. False Claim of U.S. Citizenship</p>\n<p id=\"b987-20\">On May 17, 2002, Jaen-Chavez, a citizen of Peru, entered the United States with authorization to remain until November 17, 2002. After his visa expired, Jaen-Chavez stayed in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-21\">In April 2003, Jaen-Chavez applied for a job at Mountain Fresh Young Chicken in North Carolina. On his employment application, Jaen-Chavez listed a social security number. Jaen-Chavez completed and signed an Employment Eligibility Verification Form 1-9. On the Form 1-9, Jaen-Chavez checked the box indicating that he attested under penalty of perjury that he was \u201c[a] citizen or national of the United States.\u201d As one of his two forms of identification, Jaen-Chavez submitted a U.S. social security card with the number listed on his employment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-22\">In June 2005, Jaen-Chavez married Melissa Jones, a U.S. citizen. On February 5, 2006, Jaen-Chavez filed an application to adjust his immigration status, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, based on his recent marriage. Jaen-Cha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>vez\u2019s wife filed an 1-130 visa petition on his behalf, which was approved on January 8, 2007. On January 24, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) denied Jaen-Chavez\u2019s application for adjustment of status because he had falsely represented himself to be a U.S. citizen in order to gain employment and thus was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">B. Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The same day, the DHS served Jaen-Chavez with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability for: (1) having remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B); (2) failing to comply with the conditions of the non-immigrant status under which he was admitted, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(l)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(C)(i); and (3) being an alien who falsely represented himself as a U.S. citizen for a purpose or benefit under federal or state law, . pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(3)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Jaen-Chavez conceded removability, but denied he had falsely claimed to be a U.S. citizen. Jaen-Chavez noted that he was requesting an adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">At his removal hearing, Jaen-Chavez admitted that the social security number he provided on his employment application was false, that he signed the employment application, and that he wrote his name beside a statement certifying that all of the responses provided on the application were correct and truthful. Jaen-Chavez explained that he obtained the false social security card from someone he met while waiting in line for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Jaen-Chavez further admitted that he checked the box on the Form 1-9 indicating he was a \u201ccitizen or national of the United States.\u201d Jaen-Chavez explained that he did not know the difference between a \u201cnational\u201d and a \u201ccitizen,\u201d and that he thought that \u201cnational\u201d meant \u201c[sjome-one that is here.\u201d Jaen-Chavez further stated that he did not understand what \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d meant and that he signed the Form 1-9 without first reading it.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">The IJ pretermitted Jaen-Chavez\u2019s application for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility, finding Jaen-Chavez removable from the United States pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C)\u00ae, and (a)(3)(D). The IJ found that Jaen-Chavez provided what he knew to be a false social security card in conjunction with the Form 1-9. The IJ found \u201csomewhat feeble\u201d Jaen-Chavez\u2019s explanation for marking \u201ccitizen or national\u201d on the Form 1-9 given that he knew the social security card was false and he had one year of college education. Accordingly, the IJ found that Jaen-Chavez \u201cknew what he was doing\u201d when he checked the \u201ccitizen or national\u201d box on the Form 1-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">The IJ concluded that: (1) Jaen-Cha-vez\u2019s false claim to citizenship rendered him inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(n); and (2) making a false claim of citizenship was not waivable under INA \u00a7 212\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\u00ae. Although Jaen-Chavez had not submitted an application for voluntary departure, the IJ concluded that he would deny voluntary departure because Jaen-Chavez used false identification documents and did not provide a current valid document.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">C. Appeal to the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">The BIA dismissed Jaen-Chavez\u2019s appeal, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Jaen-Chavez was both removable and inadmissible for having made a false claim of citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>zenship for any purpose or benefit under the INA; (2) Jaen-Chavez knowingly submitted a false social security card along with his Form 1-9; (3) because Jaen-Cha-vez did not know the meaning of the word \u201cnational,\u201d \u201che could not have intended to represent himself as a national\u201d on the Form 1-9; (4) filling out the Form 1-9 to obtain private employment \u201cis to obtain a benefit under the Act\u201d; (5) \u201c[t]here is no available waiver\u201d; (6) Jaen-Chavez was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status; and (7) because Jaen-Chavez did not request voluntary departure before the IJ and had not filed a motion to remand with the BIA to seek voluntary departure, that issue was not before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Jaen-Chavez filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">As a threshold matter, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review a number of Jaen-Chavez\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary decisions to deny Jaen-Chavez\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility, filed pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i)(l), and to deny his application for an adjustment of status, filed pursuant to INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i)(2); INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Thus, to the extent Jaen-Chavez\u2019s petition seeks review of the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary denial of either form of relief, we dismiss his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"Azv\">In addition, we lack jurisdiction to review the following unexhausted claims, which were not argued before the BIA: (1) whether the IJ misallocated the burden of proof; (2) whether the IJ was biased; and (3) whether the government failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to intent to defraud the government. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction to review claims raised in the petition for review that were not raised with the BIA). Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to review Jaen-Chavez\u2019s request for voluntary departure because Jaen-Chavez did not request voluntary departure in proceedings before the IJ. <em>See Galindo-Del Valle v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>213 F.3d 594, 599 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Although we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of discretionary relief, we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law, such as statutory eligibility for discretionary relief, and constitutional claims. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that we retain jurisdiction to address the legal question of statutory eligibility for discretionary relief). However, we do not review abuse-of discretion claims \u201cmerely couched in constitutional language\u201d or constitutional claims that are not colorable. <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cFor a constitutional claim to be colorable, the alleged violation need not be substantial, but the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 n. 2 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">Jaen-Chavez raises two constitutional claims, neither of which is colorable. First, Jaen-Chavez argues that he was singled out for removal because he is an Hispanic male married to a U.S. citizen, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Jaen-Chavez produced no evidence whatsoever indicating that DHS instituted removal proceedings against him or any other Hispanic male based on a discriminatory motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Second, Jaen-Chavez contends that he was deprived of employment in violation of the Due Process Clause. Even assuming arguendo that Jaen-Chavez had a constitutional right to employment, he identified no specific due process violation or how proceedings under the immigration statutes deprived him of that right. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition with respect to Jaen-Chavez\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">B. Applicable Standard of Proof in Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Jaen-Chavez argues that the standard of proof applicable in criminal cases should apply in removal proceedings. This claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Congress explicitly provided that the government must prove that an alien is removable \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, the Supreme Court has concluded that \u201c[a] deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish an unlawful entry,\u201d and, thus, \u201c[consistent with the civil nature of the proceeding, various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial do not apply in a deportation hearing.\u201d <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 3483, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). This Court also has refused to incorporate the protections afforded to criminal defendants into removal proceedings, which are inherently civil in nature. <em>See De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357, 1364-65 (11th Cir.2003) (refusing to apply the Double Jeopardy Clause to deportation hearing because double jeopardy attaches only to proceedings that are essentially criminal in nature). We find no reversible error in the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s application of the clear and convincing evidence standard in Jaen-Chavez\u2019s removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">C. Eligibility for Adjustment of Status</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Jaen-Chavez challenges the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was ineligible for adjustment of status because he was inadmissible for having made a false claim of U.S. citizenship on his Form I-9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">An inadmissible alien is not eligible for an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>that the alien be \u201cadmissible to the United States for permanent residence\u201d). Under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), an alien \u201cwho falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter <em>(including section 1321a of this title) </em>or any other Federal or State law is inadmissible.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(D, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) (emphasis added). Section 1324a, referenced in parentheses, prohibits an employer from hiring, recruiting or retaining unauthorized aliens and establishes a verification system to ensure that employees are authorized to work in the United States. INA \u00a7 274A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a. As part of the verification system, the prospective employer must attest on a form (i.e., the Form 1-9), provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>the Attorney General, that it has verified that the prospective employee is not an unauthorized alien by examining certain documents, such as a social security card. INA \u00a7 274A(b)(l)(A), (b)(l)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b)(l)(A), (b)(l)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Jaen-Chavez argues that he did not make a false claim of U.S. citizenship within the meaning of \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). Specifically, he contends that his checking the box marked \u201ccitizen or national of the United States\u201d on the Form 1-9 to procure employment from a private employer was not \u201cfor any purpose or benefit under\u201d the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">This argument is contradicted by the plain language of \u00a7 212(a)(6) (C) (ii), which explicitly refers to \u201csection 1324a\u201d as an example of \u201cany purpose or benefit\u201d under the INA. The reference to \u00a7 1324a clearly indicates Congress\u2019s intent for \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) to apply to an alien who provides to a prospective employer false information about his immigration status and authorization to work in the United States in order to obtain work. Therefore, we join every other circuit that has addressed this question and conclude that an alien who falsely represents himself to be a \u201ccitizen or national of the United States\u201d on a Form 1-9 to obtain private employment makes a false claim of U.S. citizenship \u201cfor any purpose or benefit under\u201d the INA. <em>See Ferrans v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 528, 532-33 (6th Cir.2010); <em>Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 773, 776-77 (8th Cir.2008); <em>Kechkar v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 1080, 1085 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Theodros v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 396, 402 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Jaen-Chavez is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">D. Eligibility for \u00a7 212(i) Waiver of In-admissibilty</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Jaen-Chavez alternatively contends that his inadmissibility for making a false claim of U.S. citizenship was waivable. Jaen-Chavez cites INA \u00a7 212(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Section 212(i) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 U82(i), gives the Attorney General discretion to waive \u201cthe application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C) of this section\u201d if the alien is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and meets certain other requirements. INA \u00a7 212\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\u00ae. The problem for Jaen-Chavez is that he was not found inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(\u00fc). There is no similar waiver provision for \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). <em>See generally </em>INA \u00a7 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. Thus, the BIA did not err in concluding Jaen-Chavez was ineligible for a \u00a7 212\u00ae waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-10\">. \"We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\" Alvarado v.
