Martini argues that: (1) the IJ erred in denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal because he showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that he had suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and likely would suffer future persecution if he returned to Albania; and (2) the BIA erred in denying his application for CAT relief because he established that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by agents of the Albanian government if he returned to Albania. The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Martini\u2019s asylum application was time-barred. After careful review, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>821 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). When considering a petition for review, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Id. </em>Under this test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the [IJ], [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with the government that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that'Martini\u2019s asylum application was time-barred. An alien may apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the [one-year] period____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We lack jurisdiction to review decisions of the Attorney General regarding whether an alien timely filed an asylum application or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Martini\u2019s application for asylum was time-barred. As for Martini\u2019s claim that the IJ and BIA committed a constitutional or legal error by failing to defer to the asylum officer\u2019s findings regarding the timeliness of his asylum application, he cites no constitutional or legal provisions that would require such deference. Thus, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) does not restore jurisdiction over this claim. And in any event, the asylum officer\u2019s referral notice does not address the timeliness of Martini\u2019s asylum application and specifically says that its determinations are not binding on the IJ. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over Martini\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum, and dismiss this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Turning to the remainder of the <em>petition, </em>we are unpersuaded by Martini\u2019s claim that the IJ erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>show that, upon removal, \u201chis life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not [that he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). An alien may establish eligibility for withholding of removal by demonstrating that he has suffered past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). If the alien makes such a showing, the burden shifts to the government to show that (1) the conditions in the country have changed, or (2) the alien could avoid a future threat of persecution through relocation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn alien who has not shown past persecution ... may still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal in this case was supported by substantial evidence because, among other things, Martini failed to show that he more likely than not would be persecuted on a protected ground if he returned to Albania. As the record shows, Martini testified that the harassment he experienced at school was due to his family\u2019s affiliation with the Democratic Party. According to the 2008 Country Report, however, Albania\u2019s government is a parliamentary democracy and political parties operate without restriction or outside interference. Although the Country Report indicates that some police corruption remains, there is no indication that the police would target Martini based upon his political opinion if he were to return to the country, especially in light of the fact that the Democratic Party is now in power.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Nor do we find merit in Martini\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying his application for CAT relief. An alien is entitled to CAT protection if he shows that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is an \u201cextreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment\u201d that causes \u201csevere pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1), (2). The pain or suffering must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The BIA properly denied CAT relief because, among other things, Martini failed to show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Albania. As we noted above, the Country Report indicates that conditions in Albania have improved such that the Democratic Party that Martini\u2019s family supported is now in power. Therefore, we deny the petition for review to the extent that Martini seeks to challenge the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief, and dismiss the petition for review to the extent that Martini challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
