The IJ found that Martinez failed to establish that his marriage was entered into for any reason other than to procure an immigration benefit, namely status as a lawful permanent resident under \u00a7 216 of the INA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(a). After thorough review, we dismiss Martinez\u2019s petition to the extent that it raises claims that he failed to exhaust before the BIA and deny the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A9m\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AEQ\">\u201cWhere the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only that opinion, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006)). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230. \u201cWe review administrative fact findings, including credibility determinations, under the \u2018highly deferential\u2019 substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Todorovic, </em>621 F.3d at 1323. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324 (quotation marks omitted). Factual findings \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">Martinez raises several arguments before this Court that he failed to exhaust before the BIA. Martinez first argues that the initial decision to terminate his conditional residency status was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(3)(A) and therefore an improper basis for removal. He next asserts that he was eligible for a hardship waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(e)(4)(B), INA \u00a7 216(c)(4), because he entered into his first marriage to a citizen spouse in good faith. Martinez did not raise these claims before the BIA, and we lack jurisdiction over claims that a petitioner failed to exhaust in administrative proceedings. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1))). We therefore dismiss Martinez\u2019s petition to the extent that it relies on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"Al7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8-\">Martinez next argues that his notice to appear \u201cwas unlawfully issued in violation of [his] procedural due process rights.\u201d Martinez has failed to explain how the notice to appear was unlawful and does not cite any authority to bolster his claim. \u201cWe routinely decline to address such cursory arguments, and this case presents no exception.\u201d <em>United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 821 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe may decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue in its initial or reply brief. Without such argument the issue is deemed waived.\u201d). We therefore decline to consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AqC-\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AE0\">Martinez asks us to remand because the IJ and BIA failed to render a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>reasoned decision that would allow for meaningful appellate review. We lack jurisdiction over Martinez\u2019s claim with respect to the IJ\u2019s decision because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. We conclude that the BIA gave reasoned consideration to Martinez\u2019s application and made adequate findings. The BIA acknowledged Martinez\u2019s arguments and set forth a thorough analysis explaining why his arguments failed in light of governing immigration law and BIA precedent. We therefore reject Martinez\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to render a reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Martinez next argues that the agency should have charged him with marriage fraud, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(G), INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(G), so that he would have been eligible for a waiver of admissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H), INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(H). Martinez\u2019s argument lacks merit. The INA provides that \u201c[a]n alien placed in proceedings under [the INA removal provisions] may be charged with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under section 1182(a) of this title or any applicable ground of deportability under section 1227(a) of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a)(2). The agency clearly had the authority and discretion to charge Martinez under \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(D)(i) of the INA instead of \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(G) as long as the former was \u201capplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Chapter 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(D)\u00ae provides that \u201c[a]ny alien with permanent resident status on a conditional basis under section 1186a ... who has had such status terminated under such respective section is deportable.\u201d Martinez acknowledges that he obtained conditional status as a permanent resident by marrying a citizen. The agency terminated that status upon finding that Martinez failed to establish that his marriage was entered into for any reason other than to procure an immigration benefit. Thus, the provision under which the agency charged Martinez clearly was applicable. The agency therefore had the authority and discretion to charge Martinez under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Finally, Martinez appears to argue that he was deprived of an opportunity to present evidence to prove the validity of his first marriage. This argument lacks merit. \u201c[P]roeedural due process in the deportation context requires a meaningful and fair hearing with a reasonable opportunity to be heard.... \u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.1999). Martinez had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at his hearing before the IJ, at which Martinez, through counsel, conceded the charge of removal. At that hearing, Martinez did not present any evidence to rebut the allegation that he entered into his first marriage solely to obtain an immigration benefit. The record therefore undercuts Martinez\u2019s argument that he had no opportunity to prove the validity of his marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">For these reasons, we DENY Martinez\u2019s petition and DISMISS the claims that Martinez failed to exhaust in his administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
