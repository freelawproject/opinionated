Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Zander argues on appeal, as he did below, that the actions of prison officials rendered those remedies \u201cunavailable\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u201c[A]n administrative remedy is not considered to have been available if a prisoner, through no fault of his own, was prevented from availing himself of it.\u201d <em>Moore v. Bennette, </em>517 F.3d 717, 725 (4th Cir.2008). Thus, \u201cwhen prison officials prevent inmates from using the administrative process ..., the process that exists on paper becomes unavailable in reality.\u201d <em>Kaba v. Stepp, </em>458 F.3d 678, 684 (7th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court is \u201cobligated to ensure that any defects in exhaustion were not procured from the action or inaction of prison officials.\u201d <em>Aquilar-Avellaveda v. Terrell, </em>478 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">In this case, the district court did not address Zander\u2019s allegations that prison officials hindered his ability to exhaust his administrative remedies. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendants and remand for a determination of whether the grievance procedure was \u201cavailable\u201d to Zander within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2006) so that he could administratively exhaust his claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
