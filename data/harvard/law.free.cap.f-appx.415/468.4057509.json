We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Truesdale\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Truesdale, </em>No. 3:92-cr00034-MR-1, 2010 WL 3522266 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 7, 2010) &amp; (Sept. 27, 2010). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
