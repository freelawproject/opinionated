Robles-Pantoja argues that he was incorrectly assessed three criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) for his 1989 Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance because the conviction was too old to be counted. He correctly concedes that because he did not raise this argument below, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The issue presents a factual question regarding the expiration of RoblesPantoja\u2019s sentence in the relevant offense. This question was capable of resolution upon proper objection in the district court and, therefore, cannot amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Robles-Pantoja\u2019s second argument, which he raised in the district court, is that the 84-month sentence imposed is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The district court listened to Robles-Pantoja\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated that it was considering those arguments as well as the \u00a7 3353(a) factors and the guidelines. Robles-Pantoja\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations should have been balanced differently does not suffice to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405 (5th Cir.2008). Furthermore, he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness because he has not shown that the district court failed to account for a sentencing factor that should have been accorded substantial weight, gave substantial weight to an \u201cirrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Finally, Robles-Pantoja argues for the first time on appeal that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply in this case because the Guideline that was the basis for his sentence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not based upon empirical data. He concedes that this court has rejected his empirical data argument, and he states that he is raising the argument to preserve it for Supreme Court review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364-65 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
