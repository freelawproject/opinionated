California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Brizuela-Ramos has filed a response. He contends that the Government breached its plea agreement with him. Specifically, Brizuela-Ramos contends that the Government failed to argue for the maximum acceptance of responsibility points. However, the plea agreement provided that the Government was not bound to that promise \u201cshould it be judged by the Government [that] the Defendant has committed ... any additional crime.\u201d The Government presented unrebutted evidence that Brizuela-Ramos participated in an assault on a fellow inmate while in prison awaiting sentencing. This evidence was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Government was released from its promise. The plea agreement did not require a conviction, as Brizuela-Ramos appears to argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-23\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Brizuela-Ramos\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
