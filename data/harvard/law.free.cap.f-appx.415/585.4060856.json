He says he learned that his injuries were possible side effects of the drug from various websites and that, had he known of these possible side effects in advance, he would not have taken the drug. He has not pointed to any medical evidence confirming his alleged injuries or connecting them to his use of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Even if Thurston could show he was injured by Zocor, the district court correctly dismissed Thurston\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The FDA-approved warning label for Zo-cor lists both \u201cmyopathy\u201d (muscle damage) and \u201crhabdomyolysis\u201d (a form of myopathy affecting skeletal muscle tissue) as known side effects. Thurston\u2019s failure-to-warn claim fails because Texas law provides that an FDA-approved warning label is presumed to be an adequate warning, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 82.007(a), unless the plaintiff can satisfy one of five enumerated exceptions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 82.007(b). Thur-ston\u2019s complaint does not plead facts sufficient to meet any of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
