The district court concluded that the insurer could avoid coverage under the policy because of material misrepresentations in the insurance application and, alternatively, because the fraudulent actor\u2019s knowledge of her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>fraud could be imputed to the insured for purposes of determining when the fraud was \u201cdiscovered\u201d under the policy. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Martinez Inc. (\u201cMBS\u201d) is a building-maintenance company servicing commercial properties. Greg Martinez has been the company\u2019s president since its inception. The majority of his time was spent obtaining and servicing clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Before 2004, MBS utilized the accounting firm of Ben Bowen &amp; Associates for nearly all of its bookkeeping, accounting, and tax services. In 2004, Ben Bowen recommended that MBS hire an internal accountant to handle its day-to-day finances. In August 2004, MBS hired Brenda Walters, who later became the Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d). Walters\u2019s job duties included handling the company\u2019s financial accounting. In that capacity, she had authority to make withdrawals from and deposits into MBS\u2019s bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Walters was fired in August 2011 after Martinez discovered that Walters had been embezzling funds from MBS since at least 2006. An investigation into her fraudulent activities at MBS revealed that Walters wrote checks to herself and others from MBS accounts and otherwise used company funds, such as the petty-cash account, and company credit cards for personal benefit. In total, Walters stole more than $2 million from MBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">At the time that MBS learned of Walters\u2019s fraud, MBS was insured by Scottsdale Indemnity Company (\u201cScottsdale\u201d) under a Business and Management Indemnity Insurance policy, which ran from September 15, 2010, to September 15, 2011. The policy had a \u201cCrime Coverage Section,\u201d which provided coverage for losses caused by employee theft or fraud. In January 2012, MBS submitted a claim for losses of over $2 million based on Walters\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">' In June 2012, Scottsdale denied coverage on two grounds. First, Scottsdale asserted that MBS had made material misrepresentations in the insurance renewal application \u2014 which was filled out and submitted by Walters \u2014 relating to its financial accounting practices. According to Scottsdale, the misrepresentations materially affected the risk of loss it assumed in insuring MBS. The pertinent provision from the insurance policy excludes coverage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">In the event the Application ... contains any misrepresentation or omission made with the intent to deceive, or contains any misrepresentation or omission which materially affects either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by Insurer under this Policy, this Policy, including each and all Coverage Sections, shall not afford coverage ... ' for any Claim alleging, based upon, arising out of, attributable to, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving, any untruthful or inaccurate statements, representations or information])]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">This provision applies to specified insureds only, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-17\">any Company ... that is an Insured, if any past or present chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, risk manager or human resources director (or equivalent positions) of the Parent Company knew the facts misrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>resented or the omissions, whether or not such individual knew of the Application, such materials, or this Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A50\">Second, Scottsdale alternatively denied coverage on the ground that Walters\u2019s knowledge of her own fraudulent conduct is imputed to the company for purposes of determining when the loss was \u201cdiscovered.\u201d In support, Scottsdale cited two provisions from the policy. One states that knowledge of an officer is imputed to the company as a whole: \u201cIf any Insured, or any partner, officer or director of that Insured, has knowledge of any information relevant to this Crime Coverage Section, that knowledge is considered knowledge of every Insured.\u201d The other relates to \u201cDiscovery\u201d of the loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">The Insurer will pay for loss sustained by the Insured through acts committed or events occurring at any time and discovered by the Insured during the Policy Period. Discovery of loss occurs when an officer, director, Insurance Manager or Risk Manager first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss covered by this Crime Coverage Section has been or will be incurred....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Based on these provisions, Scottsdale asserted, the loss was not discovered during the policy period because Walters\u2019s knowledge of her own embezzlement, before any policy had been issued by Scottsdale, is imputed to MBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Shortly after denying coverage, Scottsdale filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, seeking a declaratory judgment that no coverage exists under the policy in question. Scottsdale moved for summary judgment. Finding no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that Scottsdale was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the district court granted summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment. <em>Travelers Props. Cas. Co. of Am. v. Moore, </em>763 F.3d 1265, 1268 (11th Cir.2014). In reviewing summary judgment, we resolve all factual ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). We also review <em>de novo </em>the interpretation of provisions in an insurance contract. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. ERA Oxford Realty Co. Greystone, LLC, </em>572 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Under Alabama law, courts must enforce insurance contracts as written unless an insurance provision is ambiguous. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>572 F.3d at 898. If a provision is ambiguous as to whether coverage is afforded, the provision must be construed for the benefit of the insured. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Regarding Scottsdale\u2019s first ground for denying coverage, the policy places the following limits on when coverage may be denied. As relevant to this case, there must be (1) a misrepresentation or omission of facts, (2)(a) that was made with the intent to deceive or (b) which materially affects the risk of loss accepted by the insurer, (3) that resulted in or in any way involved the claim of loss, and (4) that was known by a past or present chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sured company. We address each requirement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">MBS first contends that the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that Walters\u2019s responses on the insurance application were misrepresentations. In the application, Walters answered \u201cyes\u201d to the following two questions: \u201cIs there an annual audit or review performance by an independent CPA on the books and accounts, including a complete verification of all securities and bank balances?\u201d (\u201cQuestion 3\u201d); and \u201cAre bank accounts reconciled by someone not authorized to deposit or withdraw from those accounts?\u201d (\u201cQuestion 4\u201d). Scottsdale contended, and the district court agreed, that these responses were untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">With regard to Question 3, MBS asserts that its accounts were reviewed every year by Bowen, an independent Certified Public Accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d). Although Bowen testified that he did not audit the accounts, he \u201creviewed data and accounts ... to verify them for the tax return preparation.\u201d This review included some steps to ensure the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the financial information. Based on Bowen\u2019s testimony, MBS contends that a genuine dispute exists as to whether Bowen conducted a \u201creview\u201d or \u201cverification\u201d as contemplated by the policy, particularly when those terms are not defined by the policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">But we need not labor over defining the policy terms \u201creview\u201d or \u201cverification.\u201d <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>572 F.3d at 897 (\u201cIf a word or phrase is not defined in the policy, then the court should construe the word or phrase according to the meaning a person of ordinary intelligence would reasonably give it.\u201d) (quotation omitted). In the district court, MBS acknowledged in its response to Scottsdale\u2019s motion for summary judgment that Bowen\u2019s review did not include such a \u201ccomplete verification.\u201d <em>See </em>Doc. 46 at 17 (\u201cAdmittedly, MARTINEZ did not have a complete verification of all securities and bank balances performed[.]\u201d). MBS cannot now argue the opposite for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">In any case, no genuine factual dispute exists regarding whether Bowen conducted an \u201cannual audit or review\u201d that \u201cin-clud[ed] a complete verification of all securities and bank balances.\u201d Bowen testified that he did not verify the accuracy of MBS\u2019s bank balances at any time after 2004, and that he never conducted an audit or a \u201cformal report-generating review.\u201d Although he reviewed the accounts for \u201creasonableness\u201d for tax-preparation purposes, he verified the accuracy of the information he received from MBS in only a \u201cvery cursory way.\u201d In sum, no reasonable jury could conclude that an \u201cannual audit or review performance by an independent CPA on the books and accounts, including a complete verification of all securities and bank balances\u201d occurred. Consequently, the district court properly . found that Walters\u2019s response to Question 3 was a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">With regard to Question 4, MBS points to evidence that Walters\u2019s assistant, Jennifer Smith, reconciled the accounts at the time of the policy application. Smith was not authorized to deposit into or withdrawal from MBS\u2019s accounts. Therefore, according to MBS, the response to Question 4 was not false because the accounts were in fact \u201creconciled by someone not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>authorized to deposit or withdraw from those accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Even if we found plausible MBS\u2019s contention that the response was not technically false, we would nonetheless agree with the district court that the answer to Question 4 was a misrepresentation. The answer that Walters provided on the application represented to Scottsdale that reconciliation functions at MBS were separated from deposit and withdrawal authority, when, in fact, no such separation of authority existed, as Walters would have been well aware. Other undisputed evidence\u2014 which MBS claims is irrelevant \u2014 showed that Walters, who was authorized to deposit or withdraw from the accounts, also performed reconciliation functions. For example, Walters had access to Smith\u2019s password and computer and used them to alter Smith\u2019s reconciliations of the accounts. Thus, MBS\u2019s accounts were reconciled, at least in part, by someone who had withdrawal and deposit authority. Accordingly, the district court properly found that there was no genuine dispute about whether Walters\u2019s answer to Question 4 was a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">MBS next contends that the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that Walters\u2019s misrepresentations were made with the intent to deceive or that they were material to the risk of loss assumed by Scottsdale in insuring MBS. Because we conclude that the misrepresentations were material, we do not address whether they were made with the intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\u201cUnder Alabama law, the materiality of a misrepresentation on an application for an insurance policy is generally a jury question.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Pabon, </em>903 So.2d 759, 767 (Ala.2004). Nonetheless, \u201csome misrepresentations, whether made intentionally or innocently, increase the risk of loss as a matter of law and are therefore material to the issuance of the policy.\u201d <em>Id.; see Richerzhagen v. Nat\u2019l Home Life Assurance Co. of New York, </em>523 So.2d 344, 347 (Ala.1988) (\u201cIf the facts as to materiality are undisputed, then the question need not be submitted to the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In general, a fact is material if it would have increased the risk of loss to the insurer and would have induced a rational underwriter to reject the risk or accept it only at an increased premium. <em>Clark v. Ala. Farm Bureau Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>465 So.2d 1135, 1139 (Ala.Civ.App.1984). Ala. Code \u00a7 27-14-7 likewise provides that an insurer may avoid a policy where a misrepresentation is material \u201cto the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the insurer,\u201d or where it would have caused the insurer in good faith not to issue the policy or not to issue the policy at the premium rate as applied for. <em>See Pa-bon, </em>903 So.2d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">We conclude that undisputed evidence establishes that the misrepresentations were material to the issuance of the policy. Paul Tomasi, the President of E-Risk, Scottsdale\u2019s underwriter, executed a declaration stating that Scottsdale\u2019s underwriting policies assigned a higher rating factor and higher total premium where an insured answers \u201cno\u201d to Questions 3 and 4. He explained that the answers to those questions are \u201cextremely important in assessing the- crime risk to be assumed because many, if not most, employee theft losses involve employees who handle money and who have access to the insured\u2019s receipts, checkbook or deposits.\u201d Further, Tomasi noted, \u201cinternal accounting controls\u201d and independent oversight to ensure the controls are working and to increase the likelihood of early detection \u201cdirectly bear[] on the potential exposure to loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>faced by the insurer.\u201d Such oversight and early detection were particularly important, Tomasi stated, for policies like MBS\u2019s, which covered losses sustained at any time but discovered during the policy period. Thus, Tomasi attested' that E-Risk as general agent for Scottsdale would normally have charged an increased premium for the policy in question had Walters provided correct answers about MBS\u2019s accounting practices. <em>See Clark, </em>465 So.2d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">MBS contends that the deposition testimony of Michael Kinsley, the individual underwriter at E-Risk who handled MBS\u2019s account, contradicts Tomasi\u2019s declaration and shows that the responses to Questions 3 and 4 were not in fact taken into account in assessing the risk of loss in this case. On that basis, MBS asserts that genuine issues of fact remain about whether the misrepresentations were material. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Kinsley\u2019s testimony reflects that E-Risk\u2019s software program, which normally generates a baseline quotation based on the answers provided in the insurance application, could not automatically generate a quotation for MBS for the \u201cCrime Coverage Section\u201d due to its \u201cnature of operations.\u201d The software program adjusted the baseline rate based on how an applicant\u2019s business operations were categorized. Thus, the nature of MBS\u2019s business operations did not fit into one of the software\u2019s categories, so a quotation could not automatically be generated. But the fact that a quotation was not automatically generated does not suggest or imply that Kinsley or Scottsdale did not take into account the responses to Questions 3 and 4 in determining the premium, or that the misrepresentations did not affect the risk of loss or the hazard assumed by Scottsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">MBS also asserts that Kinsley did not or could not have taken into account the responses to Questions 3 and 4 because he did not understand what was involved in an audit or review of financial records. But this does not contradict Tomasi\u2019s testimony that \u201cNo\u201d responses to these questions would normally have resulted in a . higher premium. Kinsley did not need to personally understand the reasons behind Scottsdale\u2019s and E-Risk\u2019s policies in order to apply them. Nor was Kinsley\u2019s discretion to adjust the premium rate sufficient evidence -to create a material issue of fact regarding whether the lack of accounting controls and oversight materially affected the risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">MBS also argues that summary judgment cannot be granted based solely on the testimony of the underwriter. This Court has recognized that \u201cunder Alabama law, the uncontradicted testimony of an insurance company\u2019s underwriter that a misrepresentation was material and that the company in good faith would not have issued the policy as written, is not necessarily dispositive.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>976 F.2d 659, 661 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guster Law Firm, LLC, </em>944 F.Supp.2d 1116, 1128 (N.D.Ala.2013) (same). On on at least one occasion since our decision in <em>Bennett, </em>however, the Alabama Supreme Court has relied solely on the testimony of an insurer\u2019s underwriter to conclude that a misrepresentation was material to the insurer\u2019s risk of loss as a matter of law. <em>See Pabon, </em>903 So.2d at 767-68 (relying on an underwriter\u2019s testimony about underwriting standings to conclude that an insured\u2019s misrepresentation as to whether a family member recently .had filed for bankruptcy was material as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Here, while not necessarily dispositive, Tomasi\u2019s testimony was supported by oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>er uncontradicted evidence in the record. For example, Scottsdale submitted evidence of its underwriting guidelines, which provided that an upward \u201crating modifier\u201d applied where \u201cno\u201d responses are given to Questions 3 and 4. In addition, the fact that the questions were asked on the insurance application and that the application warned that all responses were considered material further supports the materiality of the responses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Alfa Life Ins. Corp. v. Lewis, </em>910 So.2d 757, 762 (Ala.2005) (finding an answer material because the question was asked in the insurance application and the application warned that the answer would have made her ineligible for coverage). Finally, that Walters\u2019s criminal conduct itself was allowed to continue over a lengthy period of five to seven years, when it likely would have been found had the controls inquired about in Questions 3 and 4 been in place, indirectly exemplifies the materiality of the misrepresentations. As the district court stated, \u201cIndeed, if MBS had in place a complete independent audit and bank reconciliation independent of Walters, her scheme would not have been successful for as long as it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in concluding as a matter of law that the misrepresentations were material to the risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">MBS does not contest that the misrepresentations and the claim of loss based on Walters\u2019s conduct were related to one another. For reasons already stated, we likewise find the evidence undisputed that the third requirement is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Finally, there is no genuine dispute of fact that Walters, who was the CEO/ CFO of MBS, knew the facts misrepresented, even assuming that she did not intend to deceive Scottsdale. With regard to Question 4, Walters knew that someone with withdrawal and deposit authority was performing reconciliation functions, namely, Walters. Regarding Question 3, as CFO, Walters handled all of MBS\u2019s financial accounting, including supplying financial information to Bowen for purposes of preparing tax returns. It is also undisputed that Walters was embezzling funds from MBS for many years and that she altered MBS\u2019s financial records to cover up her theft. Based on this evidence, and for the reasons explained above, the district court did not err in finding that no reasonable jury could conclude that Walters did not know of the facts misrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Alternatively, the district court determined that coverage could be avoided under the policy because the losses suffered by MBS were not \u201cdiscovered\u201d during the policy period. According to the court, Walters\u2019s knowledge of her own fraudulent activity is imputed to MBS, so MBS knew of the loss (through Walters) before the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"pAG9\">On appeal, MBS argues that Walters\u2019s knowledge cannot be imputed to MBS be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>cause Walters was acting adverse to MBS\u2019s interests. If the discovery provision in the policy could be construed to exclude coverage in these circumstances, MBS contends, it would effectively \u201cexclude from coverage all claims for misdeeds of officers and directors \u2014 the very people in a position to cause a loss to an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">We decline to address this alternative ground because the district court properly granted summary judgment on the first ground for the reasons explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">In sum, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Scottsdale. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. The insurance policy also provided that the insurance application was incorporated into and constituted a part of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. The policy contained a provision deeming all statements in the insurance application material to the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by Scottsdale. We do not rely on this provision exclusively to find materiality, <em>see State Farm. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Oliver, </em>854 F.2d 416, 419-20 (11th Cir.1988) rating that the insurance contract cannot make the requirements for voiding an insurance policy more stringent on the insured than those provided by Ala.Code \u00a7 24-14-7), but the provision is, nonetheless, evidence that Scottsdale considered the responses to be material.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
