On appeal, Ramon contends that the district court committed significant procedural error by sua sponte applying the enhancement set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12), without providing him notice as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. Because Ramon did not raise this claim of error in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Esparza-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 272, 274 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Rule 32 sets forth various requirements pertinent to sentencing, including the requirement that the presentence report \u201cidentify all applicable guidelines and policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Fed.R.Grim.P. 32(d)(1)(A). Nonetheless, while \u201c[t]he PSR is often conclusive, ... final decision-making power must ... reside with the district court, and the court must have sufficient flexibility to deal with factors not covered in the PSR or arising after its writing.\u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>76 F.3d 86, 89 (5th Cir.1996). Thus, in a case such as the instant one, where Ramon had actual knowledge of the facts upon which the district court based the enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12), \u201cthe Guidelines themselves put defense counsel on notice that all possible grounds for enhancement ... are on the table at a sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88. Ramon therefore has not demonstrated any plain error with respect to his challenge to his sentence under Rule 32. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
