He was first charged with a notice of excludability in 1991, shortly after he sought admission to the United States using someone else\u2019s passport. After a series of proceedings not relevant to this appeal, an IJ ordered Zheng\u2019s deportation in 2013. The IJ\u2019s decision was b\u00e1sed on two separate provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). First, Zheng conceded that he was excludable under former INA \u00a7 212(a)(20), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(20) (1988) (current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7) (2013)), because he was \u201cnot in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document\u201d at the time that he sought admission to the United States. Second, the IJ found that Zheng was also excludable under former INA \u00a7 212(a)(19), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(19) (1988) (current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(l) (2013)), which bars the admission of any person who seeks entry into the United States \u201cby fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-24\">Zheng filed an appeal with the BIA, challenging only the IJ\u2019s finding of fraud or willful misrepresentation. Without adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, .and expressly declining to reach Zheng\u2019s \u00a7 212(a)(19) argument, the BIA observed that Zheng had conceded he had tried to enter the United States without a valid entry document, in violation of \u00a7 212(a)(20). For this reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>it found that Zheng was excludable and dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In his appeal in this Court, Zheng makes no argument regarding the BIA\u2019s \u00a7 212(a)(20) holding. Instead, he argues that the IJ erred by finding that he entered the United States by fraud or willful misrepresentation. However, we are unable to address any claimed error by the IJ because the BIA issued its own opinion without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s decision. Thus, we review only the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir.2015). Zheng\u2019s arguments regarding the IJ\u2019s decision lie beyond the scope of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Neither are we able to address Zheng\u2019s excludability under \u00a7 212(a)(20). We lack jurisdiction to review a petitioner\u2019s claim unless he has exhausted all available administrative remedies, which includes raising the claim in an appeal to the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). This is true even where, as here, the BIA addresses an issue of its own accord. <em>Id. </em>at 1251. Because Zheng failed to raise any claim challenging his excludability under \u00a7 212(a)(20) before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider any such argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-19\">. Zheng\u2019s immigration proceedings began in 1991. At that time, federal immigration law recognized a distinction between \"exclusion\u201d proceedings, which generally applied to pro-spective immigrants seeking to enter the United States, and \"deportation\u201d proceedings, which generally applied to immigrants who already resided here. <em>See Vartelas v. Holder, </em>566 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 1484, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012). In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat, 3009 (1996), which eliminated the distinction between exclusion and deportation proceedings and replaced them with a single \"removal\u201d proceeding. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1252 n. 8 (11th Cir.2008). However, because Zheng\u2019s immigration proceedings began before the IIRIRA went into effect, we apply the relevant law as it existed at the time that his proceedings began. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
