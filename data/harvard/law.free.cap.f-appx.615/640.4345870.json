At sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tencing, the district court found that Raymond\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months imprisonment. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, however, the district court granted Raymond a downward variance and imposed concurrent 90-month sentences on Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On appeal, Raymond challenges only his conviction on Count 1, arguing that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, because it does not require a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce. Raymond does not challenge his sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">As Raymond acknowledges, his facial and as-applied challenges to \u00a7 922(g) are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that this Court has repeatedly held that \u00a7 922(g) \u201cis not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause because it contains an express jurisdictional requirement\u201d and that \u00a7 922(g) is not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant\u2019s intrastate gun possession where the government proved that the gun travelled in interstate commerce); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (finding that the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) defeats a facial constitutionality challenge and that the government\u2019s proof that the defendant\u2019s gun had\u2019 travelled in interstate commerce made the statute constitutional as applied to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Moreover, at trial, Raymond stipulated that his gun travelled in interstate commerce. Therefore, the \u201cminimal nexus requirement\u201d was fully satisfied here. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715-16 (11th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Raymond has not shown error, much less plain error, with respect to his conviction on Count l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Finally, we point out that Raymond does not appeal his 90-month concurrent sentences. It was the government that filed a cross-appeal challenging Raymond\u2019s 90-month sentence on Count 1, contending that the district court erred by imposing a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum 15-year (180-month) sentence required by the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). After the Supreme Court issued <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), however, the government filed an unopposed motion to dismiss its cross-appeal of Raymond\u2019s sentence with prejudice. The government\u2019s motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">. Because Raymond raises his Commerce Clause challenges to \u00a7 922(g) for the first t\u00edme on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See Wright, </em>607 F.3d at 715.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
