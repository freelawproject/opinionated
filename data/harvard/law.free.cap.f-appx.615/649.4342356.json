On appeal Diaz argues the district court erred in (1) imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) for distribution of child pornography, and (2) declining to grant a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) for an offense involving mere receipt or solicitation of child pornography. As the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we weave them into the discussion only as necessary. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The district court did not err by enhancing Diaz\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) for distribution of child pornography. Diaz\u2019s argument that he did not knowingly make child pornography accessible to others lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Creel, </em>783 F.3d 1357, 1358 (11th Cir.2015) (holding \u201cdistribution of child pornography does not require an offender to know that he made child pornography accessible to others\u201d (citation omitted)). Diaz admitted to (1) posting an image of child pornography on his Twitter account; (2) having child pornography in his shared folder on the e-Donkey peer-to-peer file-sharing program; and (3) trading images through the Kik Messenger application. Even if knowledge were an element of distribution, these facts establish Diaz knowingly distributed child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">The district court did not err when it declined to apply a reduction under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) for mere Receipt and solicitation of child pornography. The undisputed facts show Diaz did more than simply receive or solicit child pornography. Diaz entered chat rooms to trade images, used file-sharing networks to make his files accessible to others, and amassed an enormous number of images and videos which he meticulously categorized for easy access, including one folder titled \u201cNeed more of.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 895 (11th Cir.2014) (holding use of peer-to-peer file-sharing network to receive and make child pornography available to others precluded a reduction under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\">. We review the district court\u2019s application and legal interpretations of the Guidelines de novo, and the district court's factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-17\"><em>. </em>To the extent Diaz argues in his reply brief that the Government failed to prove, Diaz's Twitter account was set for public access, this argument fails. We do not consider arguments for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
