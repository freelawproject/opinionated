(\u201cUPS\u201d), on his claims of race discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) and 2000e-3 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. After careful review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">In 1984, defendant UPS hired plaintiff Redd,, an African American man. In 2006, after holding various positions with UPS, Redd became a Business Manager at UPS\u2019s Birmingham, Alabama, package center.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Redd\u2019s claims of race discrimination and retaliation center on three alleged \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d that occurred during his tenure as a Business Manager at the Birmingham package center \u2014 (1) UPS\u2019s creation of a retaliatory hostile work environment by employing a \u201cknown serial harasser\u201d as Redd\u2019s superior, (2) Redd\u2019s placement on a management performance improvement plan (\u201cMPIP\u201d), and (3) Redd\u2019s subsequent demotion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We describe the relevant events, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Redd.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">A. October 2008: Redd\u2019s Internal Race Discrimination Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Each UPS Business Manager \u2014 including Redd \u2014 reports directly to a Division Manager who oversees multiple UPS facilities. Sometime in 2007 or 2008, Dale Mowery, a Caucasian man, became Redd\u2019s Division Manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">On October 23, 2008, Redd submitted an internal complaint to UPS human resources suggesting that Division Manager Mowery and another Caucasian UPS manager had discriminated against him on the basis of race. Although a human resources manager met with Redd regarding the complaint, there is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>UPS ever followed up on the meeting or investigated Redd\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Subsequently, in the summer of 2009, UPS demoted Division Manager Mowery, transferring him out of Alabama. For a few months, Redd reported to an interim manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">B. September 2009: Beginning of Alleged Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In September 2009, Jaime Diaz, a Hispanic man, who UPS recently had transferred from Kansas to Aabama, became the Division Manager over Redd. During Diaz\u2019s time as a manager in Kansas, more than one UPS employee had complained of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Redd contends that UPS transferred Diaz, a \u201cknown serial harasser,\u201d to Aa-bama in order to create a \u201chostile work environment\u201d in retaliation for his earlier complaint against Mowery. Within a few months of Division Manager Diaz\u2019s transfer to Aabama, UPS upper management began receiving complaints by multiple employees of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by Diaz. These complaints included allegations that Diaz discriminated on the basis of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">C. January2010: theMPIP</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">At the time that plaintiff Redd began reporting to Division Manager Diaz, Redd was in charge of the Birmingham package center\u2019s \u201cpreload operation,\u201d the process by which packages are unloaded' from trailers and loaded onto the brown UPS trucks (called \u201cpackage cars\u201d) for delivery to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Division Manager Diaz believed that Redd was struggling with his responsibilities in the preload operation. For example, Diaz determined that the preload operation supervised by Redd was not meeting the \u201cplanned measurement for ... pieces per hour.\u201d As a result, Diaz reassigned Redd to oversee \u201clocal sort,\u201d the late afternoon operation by which packages dropped off by customers are sorted onto feeder trucks for further processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">Even after plaintiff Redd\u2019s reassignment to local sort, Diaz continued to see deficiencies in Redd\u2019s performance. Specifically, Diaz believed that Redd needed to improve his performance in the areas of (1) late and missed service issues; (2) the average time required to complete delivery of packages for Redd\u2019s package center; (3) the distribution of package volume among the package ears for Redd\u2019s package center; and (4) local sort pieces per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Accordingly, on January 15, 2010, Division Manager Diaz placed ' Redd on a MPIP. The MPIP outlined areas in which Diaz determined that Redd was deficient, corrective steps, and goals for improvement, with certain processes to be in place by January 22, 2010, with a final review in 90 days. It is undisputed that the MPIP did not change Redd\u2019s compensation, benefits, or assigned job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">In a declaration, plaintiff Redd stated, however, that the MPIP involved additional work and paperwork and \u201crequired [him] to work more hours in order to ... satisfy the MPIP ... [and] document [his] performance.\u201d And in a deposition, Robert Kibler, a former UPS employee who was never placed on a MPIP, testified that placement on a MPIP is \u201chumiliating\u201d and doubles a manager\u2019s workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">D.March 2010-April 2010: Redd\u2019s EEOC Charge and Subsequent Meeting with Management</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">On March 5, 2010, plaintiff Redd filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) charge, claiming race dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>crimination and retaliation by Division Manager Diaz based on, in relevant part, Redd\u2019s placement on the MPIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In April 2010, UPS demoted Division Manager Diaz and transferred him to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. After Diaz\u2019s transfer, Stan Garrett, an African American man, became the Division Manager who oversaw the Birmingham package center and to whom plaintiff Redd reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Also in April 2010, Division Manager Garrett and two members of UPS\u2019s human resources management met with Redd concerning his March 2010 EEOC charge. At the meeting, the two human resources managers indicated that \u201cthey wanted [Redd] to drop [his] EEOC charge[] because they felt if [he] did, others would drop theirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">E. June 2010: Serious Service Failure</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">On June 3, 2010, while Division Manager Garrett was away on vacation, a \u201cserious service failure\u201d occurred during the local sort operation under Redd\u2019s management. A \u201cserious service failure\u201d involves a failure to make timely delivery of a substantial volume of packages entrusted to UPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The service failure began with a mechanical problem that caused the sort to fall behind. When another UPS employee called Redd, who was off premises, and notified him of the problem, Redd returned and took steps to address the issue. Based on information he received from the other UPS employee, Redd called Operations Manager Linda Nelson and reported that 114 packages were affected by the service failure. Nelson asked Redd to advise her of any change to the estimated number of affected packages. After this call, Redd left the building without walking through to confirm the number of affected packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The next day, June 4, 2010, at 7:00 a.m., another UPS Business Manager informed Redd that the number of affected packages was actually more than 300. This total included approximately 162 air packages \u2014 for which customers paid a premium for next-day delivery \u2014 that had not been included in Redd\u2019s original 114-pack-age estimate given to Nelson. When he learned this information, Redd, however, did not notify Operations Manager Nelson, did not go to the sorting area to confirm the status of the packages, and did not order scans of the additional packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">After Nelson learned about the additional affected packages from the other Business Manager, she confronted Redd at 8:45 a.m. that morning. Nelson realized that Redd had known about the additional packages for an hour and forty-five minutes without notifying her, and she accused Redd of hiding the additional packages and requested that an investigation be launched.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">F. July 2010: Redd\u2019s Demotion</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">When Division Manager Garrett returned from vacation, he received the materials gathered during the investigation of the June 2010 service failure. As part of the investigation, Garrett had Redd prepare his own written report of the service failure. In Garrett\u2019s judgment, in the written report, Redd failed to acknowledge Redd\u2019s own responsibilities and shortcomings as to the service failure and therefore Garrett instructed Redd to prepare a second report acknowledging and addressing those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Based on all the information Garrett received in connection with the June 2010 service failure, he determined that \u201cRedd\u2019s performance was deficient both on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>night of June 3, 2010 and the following morning.\u201d Redd acted properly in returning to the Birmingham facility when he was notified of the mechanical issue that prompted the service failure, but then \u201che did not manage the situation properly thereafter.\u201d In particular, Redd did not determine the correct number of affected packages, gave inaccurate information to Operations Manager Nelson, and did not update Nelson when he learned of additional affected packages. Garrett believed that Redd\u2019s mishandling of the service failure and the errors of the employees for whom Redd was responsible \u201ccompounded\u201d the original problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">On July 19, 2010, Garrett demoted Redd from Business Manager to Supervisor. In his deposition, Garrett testified that Redd was demoted generally \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t perform the duties that he needed to perform as a manager\u201d and \u201che had some service issues that occurred under his management,\u201d including the June 2010 service failure and his mishandling of that service failure. Then, in Garrett\u2019s declaration, Garrett provided more detail as to Redd\u2019s other \u201cservice issues\u201d referenced in Garrett\u2019s deposition. Garrett explained that Redd was responsible for two other serious service failures \u2014 one in January 2010 that affected more than 2,400 packages and one in March 2010. Redd was the only Business Manager under Garrett\u2019s supervision that experienced three serious service failures in less than six months. As to the June 2010 service failure in particular, Garrett also considered in his decision to demote Redd the fact that Redd \u201cdid not seem to acknowledge that he was accountable\u201d for the service failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">II.PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On November 30, 2012, Redd filed the instant suit against UPS, alleging claims of race discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII and \u00a7 1981. Specifically, Redd alleged race discrimination based on his placement on the MPIP and his demotion. He also asserted that UPS retaliated against him for his October 2008 internal complaint of race discrimination by transferring Diaz to be his Division Manager, as Diaz created a hostile work environment. Finally, he alleged retaliation based on his July 2010 demotion following his March 2010 EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Following discovery, the district court granted UPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment. This timely appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Owen v. I.C. Sys., Inc., </em>629 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202. (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">IV. RACE DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">On appeal, plaintiff Redd argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to UPS pn his race dis- . crimination claims based on his placement on the MPIP and his demotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging, or otherwise discriminating against, an individual with respect to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of his race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). The elements of a \u00a7 1981 race-discrimination claim are the same as a Title VII disparate-treatment claim and therefore need not be analyzed separately. <em>See Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>232 F.3d 836, 843 n. 11 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">When a plaintiff offers only circumstantial evidence to prove a Title VII claim, as plaintiff Redd does here, we generally use the analytical framework established by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination through circumstantial evidence by showing that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly situated individual outside his protected class. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">An adverse employment action requires a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits. <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001). To prove the existence of an adverse employment action, an employee must also show a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. <em>Id. </em>The employee\u2019s subjective view of the significance and adversity of the employer\u2019s action is not controlling. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the employment action must be materially adverse as viewed by a reasonable person under the same circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">A. Redd\u2019s Race Discrimination Claim Based on MPIP</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Here, as the district court did, we need discuss only the third element of Redd\u2019s prima facie case as to his race discrimination claim based on his MPIP\u2014 whether he was subjected to an adverse employment action. <em>See Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289. We conclude that Redd failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his placement on the MPIP constituted an adverse employment action. Redd did not present any evidence that the MPIP resulted in a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of his employment. <em>See Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1239. Specifically, in his deposition, Redd testified that the corrective steps and goals in the MPIP all involved existing responsibilities of his po\u2022sition as a Business Manager and that the MPIP did not result in any change in pay or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">On appeal, Redd points to his declaration statements that the MPIP involved additional work and paperwork and \u201crequired [him] to work more hours in order to ... satisfy the MPIP ... [and] document [his] performance,\u201d and former UPS employee Robert Kibler\u2019s testimony that placement on a MPIP is \u201chumiliating\u201d and doubles a manager\u2019s workload. However, these conclusory and vague references to additional paperwork and unspecified increased work and hours are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the MPIP resulted in a serious and material change to the terms and conditions of Redd\u2019s employment. And Ki-bler\u2019s subjective view of the humiliation of being placed on a MPIP is not controlling. <em>See id. </em>In sum, the district court properly granted summary judgment to UPS on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Redd\u2019s race discrimination claim based on the MPIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">B. Redd\u2019s Race Discrimination Claim Based on Demotion</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In this case, the district court found, and neither party disputes, that Redd established a prima facie case of race discrimination based on his demotion. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, once a plaintiff-employee establishes a pri-ma facie case of discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">A defendant\u2019s burden of production in articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is \u201cexceedingly light.\u201d <em>Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, NA, </em>36 F.3d 1057, 1061 (11th Cir.1994) (quotations omitted). The employer need not persuade the district court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reason. <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1087. If the employer satisfies its burden, then the burden of production shifts to the plaintiff to offer evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The plaintiff can show pretext by demonstrating \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions\u201d in the proffered reason that a reasonable factfinder could find it unworthy of credence. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). In attempting to rebut an employer\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an adverse employment action, a plaintiff is not allowed to recast the employer\u2019s reason or substitute his business judgment for the employer\u2019s judgment. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). As long as the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, \u201can employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Here, the district court determined that (1) UPS articulated \u00bf legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Redd\u2019s demotion, and (2) Redd failed to establish that UPS\u2019s reason for demoting him was a pretext for discrimination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">First, UPS\u2019s articulated reason for Redd\u2019s demotion&amp;emdash;his failure to properly manage the June 3, 2010 serious service failure within the context of concerns generally about his performance&amp;emdash;was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that would motivate a reasonable employer to demote Redd. <em>See Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1087; <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. To the extent that Redd argues that UPS did not meet its burden because the evidence underlying UPS\u2019s reason for demoting him was inconsistent, this argument is relevant instead to pretext and does not show that UPS failed to meet its \u201cexceedingly light\u201d burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>See Turnes, </em>36 F.3d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Second, Redd failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether UPS\u2019s reason for demoting him was a pretext for discrimination. Redd does not dispute that a serious service failure occurred in the operations for which he was responsible on June 3, 2010, or that he underre-ported the number of affected packages to management in its aftermath. He instead contends that he took all the necessary steps to address the. service failure and that he should not have been held accountable for the failure in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">The relevant inquiry, however, centers on the beliefs of Division Manager Stan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Garrett, the decision maker, and whether Garrett was dissatisfied with Redd for the proffered nondiscriminatory reasons, even if mistakenly or unfairly so. <em>See Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cThe inquiry into pretext centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the employee\u2019s beliefs and, to be blunt about it, not on reality as it exists outside of the decision maker\u2019s head.... The question is whether [plaintiffs] employers were dissatisfied with her for these or other non-discriminatory reasons, even if mistakenly or unfairly so, or instead merely used those complaints about [plaintiff] as cover for discriminating against her because of her Cuban origin.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Moreover, to the extent that Redd argues his actions in addressing the June 2010 service failure were unworthy of demotion, Redd cannot substitute his business judgment for that of Garrett, who testified that Redd\u2019s actions as well as his lack of accountability were factors in Garrett\u2019s decision to demote him. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Nor has Redd shown that UPS\u2019s reasons for demoting him were inconsistent and therefore unworthy of credence. <em>See Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1348. Redd argues that Division Manager Garrett\u2019s deposition testimony suggested that Redd was demoted solely based on the June 2010 service failure, while Garrett\u2019s subsequent declaration stated that Redd\u2019s demotion was based on multiple serious service failures over a six-month period. We disagree with Redd\u2019s characterization of Garrett\u2019s testimony. In his deposition, when Garrett testified about Redd\u2019s demotion, he explained generally that Redd \u201chad some service issues that occurred under his management\u201d and discussed specifically the June 2010 service failure. Then, in Garrett\u2019s declaration, Garrett provided more detail as to Redd\u2019s earlier \u201cservice issues\u201d referenced in Garrett\u2019s deposition, describing the two other service failures that occurred under Redd\u2019s supervision in less than six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">On appeal, and in the district court, Redd also attempts to show pretext based on a January 2010 \u201cScorecard,\u201d prepared by UPS, that ranks Alabama\u2019s package centers for a one-month period. Redd contends that the \u201cScorecard\u201d shows that he was actually performing well as Business Manager because it ranks the Birmingham package center as ninth out of Alabama\u2019s thirty-three package centers. We agree with the district court that the January 2010 \u201cScorecard\u201d does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">For starters, in his deposition, Redd conceded that the \u201cScorecard\u201d ranked package centers as a whole, not individual managers. In addition, Diaz explained in a declaration that \u201cmany of the elements reflected on the scorecard do not correlate to things within an individual manager\u2019s control and there are factors that might improve or reduce the ranking of areas of operation listed on the [scorecard] for which a Business Manager has no accountability or right to claim credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Finally, Redd attempts to identify other managers who were responsible for multiple service failures but who were not demoted. However, he does not present evidence that another manager under Garrett\u2019s supervision was accountable for a serious service failure where that manager made additional mistakes \u2014 such as inaccurately reporting the number of affected packages \u2014 that compounded the problem. As Garrett explained in his declaration, Redd did not properly manage the June 2010 service failure and, afterward, did not- take responsibility for the service failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>In sum, we cannot say that Redd has demonstrated \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions\u201d in UPS\u2019s proffered reason for his demotion as to create a genuine dispute about whether it was worthy of credence. See <em>Springer, </em>509 F.3d at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">V. RETALIATION CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Title VII prohibits retaliation against an employee \u201cbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing [thereunder].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">A plaintiff-employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII by showing that: (1) he engaged in an activity protected under Title VII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal .connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[A] plaintiff making a retaliation claim under \u00a7 2000e-3(a) must establish that his ... protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.\u201d <em>Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">To demonstrate a causal connection, the plaintiff must show that (1) the decision \u2022 maker knew of his protected activity, and (2) the protected activity and adverse action were not wholly unrelated. <em>Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002). The relatedness between the protected activity and adverse action may be demonstrated by a close temporal proximity between them. <em>Id. </em>at 716-17. The temporal proximity must be very close, however, if the plaintiff lacks other evidence of causation. <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">\u201cA three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, this Court has found that a seven-week gap between a protected activity and an adverse employment action was sufficiently proximate to create a nexus for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>See Farley v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding that a causal nexus was established based on the supervisors\u2019 knowledge of an EEOC charge and the employee\u2019s termination seven weeks later).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">A. Retaliation Claim Based on Demotion</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">On appeal, plaintiff Redd argues that the district court erred in granting UPS summary judgment on his retaliation claim based on his allegation that he was demoted because of his EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">We reject Redd\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in finding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. The district court found, and the parties do. not dispute, that Redd met the first two elements of his prima facie case by showing that he engaged in statutorily protected activity, filing an EEOC charge, and that he suffered a materially adverse action, a demotion. As a result, we consider only whether Redd demonstrated a causal connection between the two. <em>See Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">As an initial matter, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to. Redd, Garrett knew about Redd\u2019s March 5, 2010 EEOC charge because he was present at the April 2010 meeting during which other management personnel allegedly encouraged Redd to drop the charge. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Redd failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find any causal connection between his March 2010 EEOC charge and his demotion four months later in July 2010. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364. This four-month disparity between the protected activity and the' adverse employment action falls squarely within the \u201cthree to four month\u201d range that this Court has held is insufficient alone to show causation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">On appeal, Redd contends that the relevant date under the temporal proximity analysis is not the date he filed his EEOC charge, but the date of the April 2010 meeting in which Redd was \u201cintimidated and pressured to dismiss his EEOC charge but opposed this action by failing to dismiss his charge.\u201d To begin with, Redd mischaracterizes the record evidence of this meeting, as Redd testified in his deposition only that management personnel indicated at the meeting that they wished Redd to drop his EEOC charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no record evidence that Redd was \u201cintimidated and pressured.\u201d In any event, even assuming that Redd engaged in protected activity during the meeting under the meaning of \u00a7 2000e-3(a), this three-month disparity alone is insufficient to create a causal nexus. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Therefore, in the absence of other evidence of causation, Redd failed to demonstrate a causal connection by showing that his protected activity and his demotion were related. <em>See Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 716.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">B. Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Plaintiff Redd\u2019s final argument on appeal is that the district court erred in granting UPS summary judgment on his retaliatory hostile working environment claim. Redd contends that UPS transferred Diaz, \u201ca known serial harasser with pending EEOC charges against him,\u201d to Redd\u2019s division in order to create a hostile work environment in retaliation for Redd\u2019s October 2008 internal complaint against former Division Manager Mowery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">We agree with the district court that UPS was entitled to summary judgment on Redd\u2019s retaliatory hostile work environment claim. Redd again has failed to show a causal connection between his protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action. To the extent that Redd alleges that Division Manager Diaz\u2019s actions while overseeing the Birmingham package center created a hostile work environment, there was no evidence that Diaz knew about Redd\u2019s protected activity in making the October 2008 internal complaint. <em>See Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 716. To the extent that Redd argues that UPS transferred Diaz to his package center to create a hostile work environment in retal- \u25a0 iation for Redd\u2019s protected activity, Redd has failed to show temporal proximity be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tween the protected activity and the allegedly adverse action. <em>See Thomas, </em>506 F.Bd at 1864. Redd filed his internal complaint in October 2008, almost a year before UPS transferred Diaz to Redd\u2019s package center in Fall 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">For the above reasons, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of UPS. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\">. Redd is still working for UPS, and this case is primarily about his demotion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-15\">. The record does not reveal Nelson's race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. In their depositions, the management personnel denied that Redd was in any way encouraged to drop his EEOC charge during the meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">. Alternatively, for all the reasons discussed above as to pretext with regard to Redd\u2019s race discrimination claim based on his demotion, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part IV.B, we reject Redd\u2019s arguments that he showed that UPS\u2019s proffered reason for his demotion was a pretext, <em>see Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 715 (explaining that once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation and the defendant produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the plaintiff must show that the reason the defendant gave was pretextual).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\">.This Court recognizes a retaliatory hostile work environment claim. <em>See Gowski v. Peake, </em>682 F.3d 1299, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2012). The relevant question is whether a reasonable jury could find that the defendant subjected the plaintiff to a hostile work environment in retaliation for protected activity. <em>See id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
