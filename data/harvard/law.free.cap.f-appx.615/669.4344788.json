He asserts that if his offense level is reduced based on both Amendments 599 and 782, then his Guidelines sentence range would be lowered and the district court would have the authority to consider modifying his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). To obtain a reduction in a term of imprisonment based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Because it is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d), Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d). Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of. imprisonment unless: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a Guidelines sentence range the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, and (2) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201can appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, 772 </em>F.3d 662, 668 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation and alteration omitted). There are three exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine: (1) there is new evidence; (2) a change in controlling law dictates a different result; or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would cause manifest injustice. <em>Id. </em>at 668-69. We have applied the law-of-the-case doctrine to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 668-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">Galvez was sentenced on Count 1 of the indictment to 360 months? imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and, on Count 2, to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutively for using a gun in relation to that conspiracy offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The offense level for Count 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>was derived from the drug quantity table that Amendment 782 revised; he was sentenced as a career offender, though, because the offense level for a career offender is the highest of the calculations from the table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 or the \u201cotherwise applicable\u201d offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Galvez\u2019s total offense level was 39 and his criminal history category was VI, resulting in a Guidelines sentence range of 360 months \u25a0 to life for Count 1. If the Count 1 offense level were reduced by two levels to 37, pursuant to Amendment 782, his Guidelines sentence range would remain 360 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014); U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table. As such, the Sentencing Commission, through Amendment 782, did not lower that sentence range; therefore, the district court was not authorized to reduce Gal-vez\u2019s Count 1 sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In Galvez\u2019s previous appeal, we held that he was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 599. <em>United States v. Galvez, </em>437 Fed.Appx. 790, 792 (11th Cir.2011). Thus, the law-of-the-case doctrine bars relitigation of the Amendment' 599 issue unless an exception applies. <em>Anderson, </em>772 F.3d at 668-69. Galvez argues that an exception to the doctrine, that the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would cause manifest injustice, applies to allow us to reexamine our decision. Galvez provides no support for the proposition that it is manifestly unjust for his codefendants to receive sentence reductions while he does not. Consequently, our prior decision that Galvez was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 599 is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\">. In <em>United States v. Galvez, </em>437 Fed.Appx. 790 (11th Cir.2011), we affirmed the district court's decision denying a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 599 did not operate to invalidate a two-level weapons enhancement of his base offense level for a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 conspiracy and had no effect on his Guidelines sentence range for that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
