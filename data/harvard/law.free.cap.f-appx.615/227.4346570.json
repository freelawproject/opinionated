The arbitration clause at issue is contained in a Contract of Cession. The clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-25\">The possible differences in the interpretation of the present CONTRACT OF CESSION that could be' arise between the ASSIGNOR and the ASSIGNEE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>will be resolved as much as possible by agreement between the parties or otherwise by the norms of the Civil code and other effective disposition. In case any discrepancies may remain, these will be subjected to arbitration so that they are \u2022 solved by Arbitration Court made up of three members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">This suit, however, alleges breach of a different contract, an Agency Agreement, signed by the same parties. On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Inman, </em>436 F.3d 490, 492 (5th Cir.2006), we agree with the district court that the Contract of Cession\u2019s arbitration clause is limited to disputes regarding the interpretation and performance of that contract. It does not govern disputes arising from the Agency Agreement. For this reason and those stated by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under \u25a0 the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
