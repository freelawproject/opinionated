Villalonga sought a reduction based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Villalonga\u2019s motion to reduce. Amendment 782 did not alter Villalonga\u2019s sentencing range. Villalonga pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 1000 or more marijuana plants and was sentenced to a minimum statutory penalty of 120 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(vii), 846. Because Villal-onga\u2019s sentence was not based on the drug quantity tables, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1, he was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-26\">Villalonga argues that he is entitled to relief under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), but we disagree. In Freeman, a plurality of the Court concluded that a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction if he enters a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to receive a specific sentence that is based on a guideline range that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 131 S.Ct. at 2690. Freeman does not address defendants, like Villalonga, who were sentenced based on the statutory mandatory minimum and whose guideline range was not lowered by the retroactive amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Villalonga\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
