He argues that the sentence, which is at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing set forth in, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Hurtado did not present this argument in the district court. Thus, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Although Hurtado challenges the application of the plain error standard, he concedes that his argument is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>To show plain error, Hurtado must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. - 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">As Hurtado acknowledges, his argument challenging the presumption of reasonableness due to the lack of an empirical basis for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We also have consistently rejected the \u201cstaleness\u201d and \u201cinternational trespass\u201d arguments that Hurtado asserts. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">Finally, Hurtado\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider his personal history and circumstances is contradicted by the record, which reflects that the district court considered his request for a below-guidelines sentence based on the staleness of his prior erime-of-violence conviction and his health problems, the Government\u2019s opposition to that request, and Hurtado\u2019s allocution. The district court therefore made the requisite individualized determination based on the facts and arguments presented and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Hur-tado has not shown that' the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or to any .particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that attaches to his -within-guidelines sentence, <em>see Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55, and he has not shown that the district court plainly erred. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We also note that there is a clerical error in the judgment. Hurtado was charged with and pleaded guilty to attempted illegal reentry. The written judgment describes the offense of conviction as \u201cillegal reentry.\u201d \u201c[Tjhere is a clear distinction between actual entry into the United States, and attempted entry.\u201d <em>United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 531 (5th Cir.2000). Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36, a district court may correct a clerical error in a judgment at any time. Furthermore, we may review clerical errors in the judgment for the first time on appeal and remand a case to the district court with instructions to correct the errors in the judgment. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 371-72 (5th Cir.2003). We remand to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect that Hurtado was convicted of attempted illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">AFFIRMED; REMAND FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF CORRECTING THE CLERICAL ERROR IN THE JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
