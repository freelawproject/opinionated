Canty argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court faded to explain why it ordered his sentence to run consecutively to an undischarged state sentence. Canty also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court departed upward from his advisory guideline range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Canty\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. When the district court has discretion to order that a sentence run consecutively or concurrently to an undischarged sentence, it is required to consider the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b); United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5G1.3 (Nov. 2013). But the statute for Canty\u2019s offense states that \u201cno term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed upon the person.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D). The district court was not required to explain why it ordered Canty\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively to his state sentence when that was mandated by section 924(c)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">Canty\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. The district court decided to depart upward to \u201creflect the actual seriousness of ... [three drug sales that were] dismissed as part of [Canty\u2019s] plea agreement.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21. Canty argues that his sentence was based on. his dismissed charges, but the district court stated that it considered \u2022 the presentence investigation report, Canty\u2019s \u201cadvisory sentencing range [of 60 months of imprisonment] and the sentencing factors ,.. [to] ma[ke] an individualized assessment based on the facts presented!\u201d Canty\u2019s presentence report provided a criminal history of IV based on his prior convictions for obstructing an officer, possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, and possessing marijuana as an inmate within guard lines. The district court reasonably determined that an upward departure of 12 months was necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That Canty\u2019s sentence is well below his maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment suggests that his sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Canty to 72 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">We AFFIRM Canty\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
