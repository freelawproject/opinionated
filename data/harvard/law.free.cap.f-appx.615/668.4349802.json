Raymer, previously convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e), appeals the district court\u2019s decision to revoke his supervised release for knowingly possessing ammunition in violation of federal law on two separate occasions. On appeal, Raymer argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he know- \u2022 ingly possessed ammunition on those separate occasions. He further argues that because the ammunition was not found in his physical possession, the government had to prove that he had constructive possession of it by a preponderance of the evidence, but the government failed to meet such a burden. Finally, Raymer challenges the credibility of his wife\u2019s testimony at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">\u201cWe generally review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may revoke a term of supervised release if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In making this determination, we give deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">It is unlawful for a person who has been convicted of \u201ca crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The elements that the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ernment must prove are that: (1) the individual \u201cknowingly possessed a firearm or ammunition\u201d; (2) the individual \u201cwas previously convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe firearm or ammunition was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">As an initial matter, because Raymer only challenges whether he knowingly possessed the ammunition on the separate occasions, these are the only findings at issue. That being said, the preponderance of the evidence before the district court established that Raymer knowingly possessed ammunition in violation of federal law. Knowing possession can be proven through actual and constructive possession and through circumstantial as well as direct evidence, <em>see United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004), and constructive possession exists \u201cwhen a defendant does not have actual possession but instead knowingly has the power or right, and intention to exercise dominion and control,\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Here, the evidence showed that Raymer had previously pled guilty to illegally possessing a firearm, and that ammunition was found at the property occupied by him on July 11 and 17. The places where the ammunition was found were open and under the control of Raymer, and no one else was living at the apartment complex. Moreover, the district court considered testimony that: (1) Raymer carried a .32 caliber revolver every day and .32 caliber ammunition was found; (2) he had a .22 caliber rifle and .22 caliber rifle ammunition was found; and (3) he had a shotgun and shotgun ammunition was found. Thus, the evidence shows by a preponderance of the evidence that Raymer had constructive possession of the ammunition. <em>See Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Furthermore, Raymer\u2019s credibility argument is without merit. \u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfin-der,\u201d and w\u00e9 \u201cwill not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility\u201d unless no reasonable factfinder could accept it. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per cu-riam); <em>see also United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Raymer has not met that threshold, but even if a reasonable factfinder chose not to accept Raymer\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony, the other information before the court still supported the revocation of Raymer\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
