Taylor\u2019s brief, construed liberally, <em>see Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990), asserts the district court erred in dismissing his claims based on its conclusion that the Government had probable cause to arrest Taylor for identity fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7), and for threatening federal judges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1), in Taylor\u2019s prior criminal prosecution from which all of his claims arise. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">The parties are familiar with the facts, so we will move straight to the legal analysis. The district court did not err in concluding the Government had probable cause in the prior criminal case to arrest Taylor for both identity fraud and threatening federal judges \u2014 and since each of Taylor\u2019s claims depended on the illegality of his arrest, the district court did not err in dismissing his claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>With regard to the identity fraud charge, the district court did not err in concluding the Government had probable cause to arrest Taylor because Taylor admittedly used federal district judge Tim Leonard\u2019s name to apply for a credit card. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) (prohibiting a person from knowingly using, without lawful authority, a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d of another person in connection with any violation of federal law). We reject the theory that Taylor did not use a \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d as required to commit identity fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7), simply because Taylor used Judge Tim Leonard\u2019s name only, not his social security number. The statute clearly defines \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as \u201cany name or number that may be used ... to identify a specific individual.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We likewise reject Taylor\u2019s argument that the name he used did not identify a \u201cspecific individual\u201d because there is more than one Tim Leonard in Oklahoma. The statute does not require that the name Taylor used on the fraudulent credit card application, standing alone, identify a . unique individual. The statute specifically provides that a \u201cname\u201d may constitute a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d if it \u201cmay be used[ <em>\\ ... in conjunction with </em>any other information[ ] to identify a specific individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding the Government had probable cause to arrest Taylor for identity fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">With regard to the charge of threatening federal judges, the district court did not err in concluding the Government had probable cause to arrest Taylor because the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit \u2014 upon which the magistrate judge who issued the arrest warrant relied \u2014 stated that federal agents searched Taylor\u2019s home and found a copy of one of the threatening letters to Judge Leonard and other letters directed to Judge Miles-LaGrange. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1) (prohibiting a person from threatening to assault or murder a federal judge with the intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the judge in the performance of official duties). We find meritless Taylor\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by considering the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit simply because neither party formally submitted it as evidence. \u201cA district court may take judicial notice of public records within its files relating to the particular case before it or other related cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cash Inn of Dade, Inc. v. Metro. Dade Cnty., </em>938 F.2d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err in concluding the Government had probable cause in the prior criminal case to arrest Taylor for both identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>fraud and for threatening federal judges. Since lack of probable cause laid the foundation for Taylor\u2019s civil claims against the United States, the district court did not err in granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AUG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-17\">. Specifically, Taylor's four claims each arise out of his 2006 arrest and prosecution in <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>Case No. 3:06-004 (S.D.Ga.2006), in which Taylor was indicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>on two counts of threatening two federal judges and one count of identity fraud. <em>See id., </em>DE. 9. In the instant civil lawsuit, Taylor contends unnamed federal employees committed false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and negligence during the previous criminal prosecution and seeks over $3 trillion in damages. An essential element of each claim is a lack of probable cause for Taylor\u2019s prior arrests. <em>See </em>False Arrest, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-1 (requiring an arrest made \"without probable cause\u2019\u2019); False Imprisonment, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-20 (requiring an \"unlawful detention\u201d); Malicious Prosecution, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-40 (requiring a criminal prosecution carried on \"maliciously and without any probable cause\u201d); Negligence, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-1-6 (requiring a \"breach of ... legal duty\u201d \u2014 in this case, an alleged breach of duty by arresting Taylor without probable cause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\">. Furthermore, in his response to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Taylor expressly asked to present the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit to the court. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (\"[WJhere a party invites the trial court to commit error, he cannot later ciy foul on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AMB\">JORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">I concur in the judgment and join most of the majority opinion. As to the district court\u2019s consideration of the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, I am not sure that the court could take judicial notice for the truth of the matters set forth in the affidavit. <em>See United States ex re\u00ed Osheroffv. Humana, Inc., </em>776 F.3d 805, 811 (11th Cir.2015); <em>Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 1271, 1278-79 (11th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>29 F.3d 1549, 1553-54 (11th Cir.1994). Nevertheless, as the majority indicates, Mr. Taylor invited any error by asking the district court to consider the affidavit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
