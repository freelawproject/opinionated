The district court denied Ca-david relief under Amendment 782, but did not mention Amendment 591 in its order. Cadavid contends this Court should remand with instructions for the district court to consider his arguments under Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">There is no need to remand because the record makes clear Cadavid was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 591. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[W]e may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court.\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201cAmendment 591 requires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be based only on the statute or offense of. conviction rather than on judicial findings of actual conduct not made by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 591). The amendment clarified that the enhanced penalties in \u00a7 2D1.2 (Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals) applied only where the defendant was \u201cconvicted of an offense referenced to \u00a7 2D1.2\u201d and not where the defendant simply \u201cengaged in conduct described by that guideline.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Amendment 591 is inapposite to Cada-vid\u2019s case. Cadavid\u2019s guideline range was based on \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s base offense level and a role enhancement, and not on any of the conduct that would increase the offense level under \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Amendment 591 did not lower Cadavid\u2019s applicable guideline range, and Cadavid was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 591. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (explaining a sentence reduction \u201cis not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
