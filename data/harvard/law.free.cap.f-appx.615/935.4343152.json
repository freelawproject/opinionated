The district court granted relief on the ground that Mr. Nejad\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance but did not rule on two other grounds Mr. Nejad raised in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-23\">District judges must resolve all of a habeas petitioner\u2019s claims for relief, regardless of whether relief is granted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>denied. <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 935-36 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc); <em>see also Puiatti v. McNeil, </em>626 F.3d 1283, 1307 (11th Cir.2010) (applying <em>Clisby </em>to vacate a district court\u2019s order granting relief on one ground and deeming all other grounds moot). When a district judge fails to address all of a petitioner\u2019s claims, we \u201cwill vacate the ... judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Mr. Nejad asserted three claims for relief in his petition: (1) the trial court erroneously charged the jury that a pellet gun was per se a deadly weapon; (2) a juror failed to disclose that she was a rape victim; and (3) trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by denying him the choice of whether to testify. A magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny all three claims. The district court declined to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, concluding that habeas relief (a new trial) was warranted based on Mr. Nejad\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. The court did not, however, address the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition of his other two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Because the court did not resolve all three claims, <em>Clisby </em>dictates that we vacate without prejudice the judgment of the district court and remand the case for consideration of Mr. Nejad\u2019s remaining claims for relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. We accordingly do not address the State\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s disposition of Mr. Nejad's ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
