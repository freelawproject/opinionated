Natty contends (1) the district court erred in dismissing her \u00a7 1983 action under Rule 4(m), and (2) the district court erred in denying her motion for appointment counsel. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Natty\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action without prejudice under Rule 4(m) because Natty failed to serve the defendants within the 120-day time period and she has not shown good cause for failing to do so. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) (providing \u201c[i]f a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed, the court ... must dismiss the action without prejudice\u201d unless \u201cthe plaintiff shows good cause for the' failure\u201d). Natty\u2019s argument she did not receive the orders and documents necessary to serve the defendants until after the 120-day time period elapsed does not establish good cause. Natty was made fully aware of the relevant documents and law regarding Rule 4 service requirements by April 14 at the latest \u2014 more than two months before her 120-day window expired \u2014 when the magistrate judge entered an order explicitly reminding Natty \u201cshe is responsible for service pf process upon the Defendants in [both of her lawsuits] as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.\u201d Nonetheless, Natty made no attempt to serve the defendants until after the 120-day time period had elapsed. Even then, Natty\u2019s belated attempt to serve the defendants was insufficient because she simply mailed papers to the defendants. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(2) (requiring personal service on an individual absent waiver). On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Natty\u2019s action without prejudice under Rule 4(m) for failing to properly serve the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Natty\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Natty\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is not so complex or novel as to require appointed counsel. <em>See Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th. Cir.1993) (explaining appointment of counsel in civil cases is \u201ca privilege justified only by exceptional circumstances, such as the presence of facts and legal issues which are so novel or complex as to require the assistance of a trained practitioner\u201d (alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-6\">. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to timely serve a defendant under Rule 4(m). <em>Rance v. Rocksolid Granit USA, Inc., </em>583 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2009). We also review for abuse of discretion a district court's denial of a motion for appointment of counsel. <em>Smith v. Sch.
