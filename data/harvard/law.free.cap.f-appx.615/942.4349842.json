The magistrate judge, having previously granted Savoie\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on her own behalf, had recommended that her motion on behalf of her son be denied. However, the district court, stating that it was approving, adopting, and ratifying the Report and Recommendation, denied the motion to proceed in forma pauperis on behalf of her son and also dismissed the entire case. The court did not explain its decision; and the Report and Recommendation had not addressed the merits of Savoie\u2019s claims on her own behalf. In fact, as mentioned earlier, the magistrate judge had granted Savoie\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris on her own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">A district court is free to \u201caccept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part\u201d the magistrate judge\u2019s findings or recommendations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). In other words, the court is not bound to the decision of the magistrate judge. But when a district court fails to sufficiently explain its rulings, we will remand the case. <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091-92 (11th Cir.2007). Here, there is no explanation of the dismissal, which deprives this court of the ability to review. And, because the magistrate judge had previously granted in for-ma pauperis status to Savoie on her own, deeming the amendments she made to her complaint satisfactory, the decision to dismiss needs explanation. Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision dismissing this case and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-19\">. Savoie had also filed related claims on behalf of her minor son, Savoie-Elston. Her \u2019 appeal- of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the claims on behalf of her son was dismissed by order of this Court dated August 5, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
