After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS A. 1991 Conviction and 1992 Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">In 1991, after a jury trial, Barkley was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine base using individuals under the age of 18, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 845b and 846 (Count 1); possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 2); and using a .firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Barkley\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) grouped Counts 1 and 2, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(b). Count 3, the firearm offense, required a consecutive five-year sentence to any sentence imposed on Counts 1 and 2. The PSI initially determined that the total offense level for Counts 1 and 2 was-35 based on the drug quantity involved and increased by one additional offense level for the use of minors. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(2) (1991) (setting the offense level for drug offenses involving minors as the offense level from the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1 plus one offense level). The PSI calculated 12 criminal history points, which resulted in a criminal history category of V. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table) (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">However, because Barkley qualified as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the PSI assigned Barkley a total offense level of 37, which was greater than the offense level of 35 under \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(A) (1991) (providing for an offense level of 37 for offenses with a statutory maximum of life if it is greater than the otherwise applicable offense level). Based on Barkley\u2019s career-offender status, the PSI also assigned a criminal history category of VI. <em>Id. </em>(providing for a criminal history category of VI in every case) Thus, based on Barkley\u2019s career-offender status, the PSI stated that Barkley\u2019s guidelines range was 360 months to life in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">Barkley objected to the PSI\u2019s recitation of the offense conduct (paragraphs 9 through 25), maintaining that he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the charged offenses, and objected to the PSI\u2019s drug quantity amount (paragraph 37) used to determine his base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.Ps Drug Quantity Table. Barkley did not object to his designation as a career offender or to his offense level and guidelines range as calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1 (paragraphs 65, 66 and 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-17\">At his April 1992 sentencing, Barkley advised the district court that the PSI Addendum correctly noted his objections, .and he continued to deny his involvement in the charged offenses. Barkley also asked for the \u201cminimum sentence,\u201d point<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ing out that he had arrived in the Macon area only in the final weeks of the charged conspiracy and was not a ringleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Without explicitly ruling on Barkley\u2019s factual objections, adopting the PSI, or calculating the applicable guidelines range, the district court imposed concurrent life sentences on Counts 1 and 2, followed by the mandatory, consecutive five-year sentence on Count 3. The district court explained, however, that it was \u201csentencing [Barkley] to the top of the guidelines\u201d because of \u201cthe magnitude of the crime that [Barkley was] involved in and the role that [Barkley] played.\u201d The district court asked for objections to \u201canything that the Court has done in the way of sentencing,\u201d and there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Shortly thereafter, the district court entered a judgment consistent with its oral pronouncement. In its statement of reasons, the district court stated that it adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guidelines calculations, and found that the total offense level was 37, the criminal history category was VI, and the guidelines range was 360 months to life in prison, plus 60 consecutive months for Count 3. The district court further indicated that it had imposed a sentence within the guidelines range \u201cbased on the seriousness of the offense and prior criminal conduct.\u201d This Court affirmed Barkley\u2019s convictions and sentences on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">B. Section 3582(c)(2) Motions in 2011</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In 2011, Barkley filed a <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to' reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706, as amended by Amendment 711, which lowered the offense levels for cocaine base offenses in \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s Drug Quantity Table.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barkley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion also relied on Amendment 591, which clarified that the enhanced penalties for drug offenses involving minors applied only where the offense of conviction (rather than uncharged relevant conduct) is referenced in \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">The district court denied Barkley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, concluding that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction because \u201c[i]t has been previously determined that [Barkley] is a Career Offender pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d Barkley filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court never found that he was a career offender. While his motion for reconsideration was pending, Barkley filed a second <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, this time citing Amendment 750, which changed the base offense levels for cocaine base offenses in the Drug Quantity Table to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C., amend. 750. Then, Barkley filed an amended, counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was not possible to determine from the record whether Barkley was .sentenced as a career offender, and thus he was eligible for a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">In May 2014, the district court denied Barkley\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his first, <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court concluded that there was \u201cample evidence in the record\u201d that Barkley was sentenced as a career offender. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>district court recounted that the sentencing court sentenced Barkley within the career offender guidelines range as calculated in the PSI and adopted that range in its Statement of Reasons in the written judgment. In a separate order, the district court denied Barkley\u2019s second, counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, again finding that Barkley was not entitled to a sentence reduction because the record was clear that Barkley was sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court has the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison sentence if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). If, however, the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by the retroactively applicable guideline amendment, the district court has no authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The Guidelines commentary explains that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201can amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). For this reason, defendants who were convicted of cocaine base offenses but sentenced as career offenders are not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s Drug Quantity Table because these defendants\u2019 \u201csentences were based on the guideline ranges applicable to career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1\u201d and their \u201cbase offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of these ranges.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (involving a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Here, Barkley is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendments 591, 706, and 750. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of Barkley\u2019s sentence, standing alone, was ambiguous, other evidence in the record makes clear that the district court sentenced Barkley as a career offender. , <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that where the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement .of the sentence is ambiguous, the reviewing court may consider extrinsic evidence, including the commitment order, to discern the district court\u2019s intent). Specifically, the district court stated at sentencing that it was imposing life sentences at \u201cthe top of the guidelines,\u201d and the guidelines range calculated in the PSI pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s career offender provision was 360 months to life imprisonment. Further, the district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons in the written judgment stated that the district court had adopted the PSI and then calculated the guidelines range in accordance with career offender provision, finding a base offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI. We readily conclude that the district court\u2019s intent was to sentence Barkley as a career offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Barkley\u2019s sentencing range and ultimate sentence were based on the offense level of 37 from \u00a7 4B1.1(A), and not on his initial base offense level of 35 from \u00a7 2D1.2 and the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1, the provisions affected by Amendments 591, 706, and 750. Thus, those amendments did not lower his applicable guidelines range. Because Barkley\u2019s total sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d an amended guidelines provision, he is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"A5d2\">Barkley argues that the district court procedurally erred by not calculating his amended base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 and the Drug Quantity Table before denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (describing two-step process for evaluating a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in which the district court first recalculates the amended guidelines range using the new base offense level and then decides whether to exercise its discretion to impose a sentence within the new sentencing range or retain the original sentence). Barkley\u2019s argument fails because he overlooks that the first step under <em>Bravo </em>requires the district court to recalculate the amended guidelines range keeping all other guideline decisions intact, including the decision to apply the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 780. By virtue of \u00a7 4B1.1, Barkley\u2019s guidelines range did not change. As such, it was unnecessary for the distinct court to specify Barkley\u2019s amended base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.2 in its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">In sum, because Barkley\u2019s total sentence is not \u201cbased on\u201d an amended guidelines provision, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Accordingly, the district court properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions and his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\">. If the career offender provision had not applied, Barkley\u2019s initial offense level of 35 and criminal history category of V would have yielded a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months in prison. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt.
