The petitioners argue that the BIA abused its discretion because it failed to consider the totality of the evidence establishing that cancellation of removal was warranted. On review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny the petition in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings under the same standard. <em>See Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252,1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">An alien may file one motion to reconsider a decision of removability specifying the errors of law or fact, and must do so within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A)-(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) and (2). In addition, an alien may file one motion to reopen based upon new facts, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)-(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) and (2). This 90-day deadline is a \u201cnon-jurisdictional claim-processing rule,\u201d and is subject to equitable tolling. <em>Avilar-Santoyo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>713 F.3d 1357, 1359-65 (11th Cir.2013) (en banc). The BIA also has authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider any case.in which it has rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We, however, lack jurisdiction to review a challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision not to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider a proceeding. <em>Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 January 12, 2015, motion to reconsider and reopen, as the motion was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B) and (7)(C). The petitioners do not argue on appeal that they meet any of the exceptions to the time restrictions, and they have therefore abandoned any such claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to not <em>sua sponte </em>reopen the removal proceedings or reconsider its prior order. <em>See Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Thus, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-8\">. To the extent that the petitioners seek review of the BIA's June 17, 2014, affirmance of tKe immigration judge's denial of their applications for cancellation of removal, we dismiss that portion of their petition, as it was not filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s order of affirmance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). <em>See also Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir.2012). We also dismiss any portion of the petition seeking review of the BIA's September 4, 2014, denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider its earlier affirmance, to the extent the petitioners seek such review, for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">Further, we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary determination that the petitioners have failed to satisfy the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard for cancellation of removal. <em>See Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
