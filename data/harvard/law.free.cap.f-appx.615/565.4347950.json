Specifically, he contends that the traffic stop on July 17, 2013, and subsequent search of his vehicle and seizure of evidence violated his Fourth Amendment rights because there was no probable cause to stop the vehicle and the plain view exception to the warrantless search did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affording deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, we find that the district court did not err in denying Wright\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lewis, </em>674 F.3d 1298, 1303 (11th Cir.2012) (noting that \u201cwe afford substantial deference to the factfin-der\u2019s credibility determinations\u201d and construe all facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the prevailing party below\u201d when ruling on a motion to suppress (internal quotation marks omitted)). The district court found that Deputy Rose was a credible witness and explicitly credited his testimony regarding his reasons for deciding to stop the vehicle driven by Wright. Deputy Rose testified that the tag light of the vehicle was inoperable and that the tag inquiry revealed the registered owner\u2019s license was invalid; thus, Deputy Rose had a valid basis for initiating the traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201cA traffic stop ... is constitutional if it is either based upon probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred or justified by reasonable suspicion.... \u201d); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.221(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">Additionally, Deputy Rose\u2019s testimony established that the plain view exception to the warrantless search applied because Rose was in a place where he had the right to be when he observed the pill bottle in plain view, containing what he believed to be an illegally possessed controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (setting forth the requirements for a war-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>rantless seizure under the plain view exception); <em>see id. </em>at 1291-93 (noting that w\u00e9 give weight to inferences drawn by experienced officers). The discovery of the controlled substance justified the subsequent search of the immediate area of the vehicle for additional evidence of criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>928 F.2d 1113, 1117 (11th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s determination that the traffic stop was legal and the plain view exception applied to the warrantless search of the vehicle was not erroneous. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
