On appeal, Saavedra asserts that Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced his total offense level by two levels and that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the reduction. However, because Saavedra was responsible for more than 450 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 a fact that he does not dispute \u2014 Amendment 782 would not lower his offense level. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Saavedra\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the [Sentencing [Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission; however, a reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements provide that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Under the Guidelines in effect at the time of Saavedra\u2019s original sentencing, a drug quantity of 150 kilograms or more of cocaine resulted in a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(l) (2012). As a result of Amendment 782, the Guidelines now provide that a drug quantity of 450 kilograms or more of cocaine results in a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(l) (2014). However, at no point has Saavedra disputed that he was responsible for at least 1,100 kilograms of cocaine. Thus, even after Amendment 782 raised the threshold amount of cocaine required for a base offense level of 38 (from 150 kilograms to 450 kilograms), Saave-dra\u2019s base offense level would still be 38 because he was responsible for more than 450 kilograms of cocaine, Because Amendment 782 did not lower Saavedra\u2019s offense level, he was not entitled to relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Therefore, after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, the record on appeal, and the relevant law, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
