Hill was originally convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 5 years of supervised release under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), a Class C felony. His term of supervised release commenced on June 3, 2011. In November 2014, the district court revoked Hill\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 4.5 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"AYy5\">On appeal, Hill contends the district court did not have jurisdiction to revoke his supervised release and impose a sentence because, according to Hill, he had already served the three-year statutory maximum term of supervised release at the time of his revocation hearing. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (requiring a term of supervised release of \u201cat least 3 years\u201d), <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b) (stating \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided,\u201d the term of supervised release for a Class C felony may be \u201cnot more than three years\u201d). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Hill acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by our binding precedent. In <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en banc), abrogated in part on other grounds by United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1308 (11th Cir.2005), this Court held that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(C)\u2019s three-year minimum term of supervised release is not capped by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2)\u2019s three-year maximum because it falls within \u00a7 3583(b)\u2019s \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided\u201d language. <em>See id. </em>at 1287 (\u201cSection 841(b)(1)(C), in fact, expressly \u2018otherwise provide[s]\u2019-specifically, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) provides that the term of supervised release for that particular Class C felony must be \u2018at least three years.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
