Firearms enhancements of five levels each were applied to four other bank robberies listed as objects of the conspiracy in Count 1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) (Nov. 1994). The district court sentenced Miller to a total term of imprisonment of 468 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">In March 2011, Miller moved for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended the commentary to \u00a7 2E2.4, effective November 1, 2000, and based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including his postconviction rehabilitation. The district court denied the motion and denied Miller\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that an appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-21\">Miller now appeals the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and moves to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28' U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Miller\u2019s motion to amend his notice of appeal is construed as a motion to supplement his IFP motion with the documents required by Rule 24(a)(5) and is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">By moving to proceed IFP on appeal, Miller challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. This court\u2019s inquiry into Miller\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">After considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court may reduce a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Miller contends that Amendment 599 prohibited not only a firearms enhancement for the offenses underlying his \u00a7 924(c) convictions, but also firearms enhancements for any relevant conduct for any offense for which he was held responsible under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. His argument is not supported by the language of former note 2, as amended, or by any relevant circuit precedent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2) (Nov. 1, -2000); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>273 F.3d 636, 643 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Miller has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
