On appeal, Wallace argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent in providing him medical care, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, by misdiagnosing him and causing the unnecessary removal of his kidney. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). To avoid dismissal, the complaint must state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment prevents prison personnel from subjecting an inmate to \u201cacts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97- S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). To establish deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than [gross] negligence.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>601 F.3d 1152, 1158 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). Medical treatment violates the Eighth Amendment only when it is \u201cso grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). Incidents of negligence or malpractice do not rise to the level of constitutional violations. <em>Id. </em>Claims concerning the doctor\u2019s medical judgment, such as whether the doctor should have used another form of medical treatment or a different diagnostic test, are inappropriate claims under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Adams v. Poag, </em>61 F.3d 1537, 1545 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Wallace\u2019s complaint does not state a claim for deliberate indifference. He alleges that in March of 2012 he began having stomach problems and underwent a series of tests while under the care of Dr. Hammontree, including ultra sounds, CAT scans, biopsies, and blood tests. Following these examinations, Dr. Hammontree told Wallace that he had cancer in one of his kidneys that required its removal. Yet after the kidney was removed, he continued to have stomach problems. In February 2013, at a follow-up visit at Brookwood Medical Center, physicians informed him that he in fact had never had cancer and instead was suffering from \u201can abnormal swelling in [his] stomach.\u201d When he questioned the medical staff about how such a mistake could have occurred, he was told that he \u201cstill had a good kidney and could live well with just the one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Construing these allegations in a light most favorable to Wallace, he has nevertheless failed to state a claim cognizable under the Eighth Amendment or \u00a7 1983. While the physicians may have unnecessarily removed Wallace\u2019s kidney, he has alleged nothing to suggest that the doctors\u2019 conduct was \u201cso grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>941 F.2d at 1505. Rather, this claim at best amounts to medical malpractice, a claim that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>As we\u2019ve said, claims concerning a doctor\u2019s medical judgment, such as whether the doctor should have used another form of medical treatment or a different diagnostic test, are inappropriate claims under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Adams, </em>61 F.3d at 1545. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
