Okechuku is charged with conspiracy to unlawfully distribute and dispense hydrocodone outside the scope of professional practice and not with a legitimate medical purpose in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Because the magistrate judge found there was probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>believe that Okeehuku continued to illegally dispense hydrocodone while on pretrial release, his pretrial release was revoked and he was ordered detained. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b). The district court denied Okechuku\u2019s motion to revoke the magistrate judge\u2019s detention order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(b). Okechuku\u2019s second motion for reconsideration was denied after a hearing by the magistrate judge, and his third motion for reconsideration was denied by the district court because Oke-chuku noted no new evidence or change in circumstances that had not previously been considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Okeehuku appeals the denial of his third motion for reconsideration. He argues that because he can no longer practice medicine or write prescriptions, he no longer poses a danger to the community. He disagrees with the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that, given the fact that he previously violated the release conditions set by the court, he is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions for release. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3148(b). He also argues that the district court failed to reevaluate the factors for release listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g) before denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">After reviewing the record, we have determined that the district court\u2019s denial of Okechuku\u2019s third motion for reconsideration is supported by the proceedings below and the factual basis of the decision is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Aron, </em>904 F.2d 221, 223, 224-25 (5th Cir.1990). Moreover, given the finding that Okeehuku was unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions for release, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B), it was not necessary for the district court to reevaluate the \u00a7 3142(g) factors for release before denying Okechuku\u2019s motion. The district court\u2019s denial of Okechuku\u2019s third motion for reconsideration is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
