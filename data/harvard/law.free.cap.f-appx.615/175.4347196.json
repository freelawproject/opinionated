His challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Lee contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because his illegal reentry offense was essentially an international trespass and the illegal entry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is problematic because it is not empirically based and results in a double counting of his criminal history. Additionally, he asserts that the sentence is greater than necessary to promote respect for the law. and that it fails to adequately account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Lee contends that the presumption should not be applied but concedes the issue is foreclosed and raises it only for possible further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">This court has rejected challenges to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence based on the same international-trespass and double-counting arguments raised in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the record does not reflect that the sentence fails to \u201caccount for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Lee\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
