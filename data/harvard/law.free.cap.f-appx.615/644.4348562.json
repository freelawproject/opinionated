The district court dismissed Yawn\u2019s second petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255(e). Yawn argued that he was entitled to relief from the judgment under <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and recent decisions of this Court. Because Yawn failed to establish that extraordinary circumstances required the district court to vacate its judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">Yawn pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and to distributing cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Yawn admitted that he had prior convictions for armed robbery, selling a controlled substance, and selling cocaine. The district court sentenced Yawn, as an armed career criminal, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and a career offender,'U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, to 188 months of imprisonment. Yawn challenged his sentence unsuccessfully on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Yawn, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 970 (11th Cir.2006), in a motion to vacate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and by petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">We review the denial of a motion for relief for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>437 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2006). To obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6), the movant must prove \u201cthat the circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary to warrant relief.\u201d <em>Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11th Cir.2000)). \u201c[S]ome-thing more than a \u2018mere\u2019 change in the law is necessary to provide the grounds for Rul\u00e9 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d <em>Ritter v. Smith, </em>811 F.2d 1398, 1401 (11th Cir.1987). The movant \u201cmust demonstrate a justification so compelling that the district court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1342 (quoting <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Yawn\u2019s motion for relief from the dismissal of his second petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Des-camps </em>did not represent a change in the law because it was decided while Yawn\u2019s second petition was pending and available to challenge the validity of his sentence. <em>See Ritter, </em>811 F.2d at 1401. And Yawn failed to explain how <em>Descamps, </em>which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>hibits district courts from \u201capplying] the modified categorical approach when the crime of ... conviction] has a single, indivisible set of elements,\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2282, affected the legality of his sentence. Yawn was convicted of armed robbery, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13, which qualifies as a violent felony because it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Yawn\u2019s convictions for selling drugs, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a), appear to qualify as \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d because they are \u201cof-fensefs] under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a.controlled substance, ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2827, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2015). Yawn\u2019s arguments for relief under <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), <em>Mackey v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>739 F.3d 657 (11th Cir.2014), and <em>McKinney v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>562 Fed.Appx. 917 (11th Cir.2014), were equally unavailing because those decisions do not affect our precedents establishing that Yawn\u2019s prior convictions qualify as predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">We AFFIRM the denial of Yawn\u2019s motion for relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
