For the first time, Gibson\u2014on appeal\u2014argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional; he says it violates the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We generally review constitutional challenges <em>de novo, </em>but because Gibson failed to raise these arguments below, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, Gibson must demonstrate that error occurred, the error was plain, the error affects his substantial rights, and the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). An error cannot be \u201cplain\u201d unless it is \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999). In addition, \u201conly the Supreme Court or this [Cjourt sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision\u201d of our Court. <em>United States v. Dean, </em>604 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">We have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 391 (11th Cir.1996). None of the recent Supreme Court decisions relied on by Gibson abrogated or reversed our prior decisions on the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Furthermore, considering \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, the statute does not violate the Tenth Amendment. <em>See Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">In this case, no plain error occurred. And Gibson\u2019s arguments are squarely foreclosed by binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Next, Gibson argues, for the first time, that the \u201cminimal nexus\u201d test set out in <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), is no longer sufficient for establishing the required connection to interstate commerce under \u00a7 922(g). He points to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Bond v. United States, </em>572 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). Gibson maintains that a more significant connection to interstate commerce is now required for \u00a7 922(g) to cover intrastate possession and says that his conviction cannot stand because no significant connection to interstate commerce exists. As this claim is also raised for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See Peters, </em>403 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">Neither <em>Bond </em>nor <em>Jones </em>involved \u00a7 922(g) or the \u201cminimal nexus\u201d test set forth in <em>Scarborough. </em>Thus, <em>Scarborough </em>remains binding precedent; and the \u201cminimal nexus\u201d test is the applicable standard for establishing a connection with interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">We reject Gibson\u2019s argument. And it is squarely foreclosed by binding precedent. Thus, the district court did not plainly err when it convicted Gibson of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1), where the Government established (and Gibson acknowledged) that the pertinent firearm previously traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
