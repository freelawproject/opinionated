He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Perez-Aguilar contends that his underdeveloped arm \u201crebut[s] any presumption of reasonableness that might be applied to the sentence imposed.\u201d He suggests that his physical deformity will put him at a disadvantage in prison and when he is deported back to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-22\">There is no dispute that Perez-Aguilar\u2019s 57-month sentence was imposed within a properly-calculated guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Perez-Aguilar\u2019s mere disagreement with the applicable guidelines range is insufficient to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Insofar as Perez-Aguilar contends that the district court failed to take into account his personal history and characteristics, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>factors do not require a district court to impose a sentence lower than a guidelines range sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.Bd 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The district court heard defense counsel\u2019s arguments, including the fact that Perez-Aguilar suffers with an underdeveloped arm, but determined that Perez-Aguilar\u2019s circumstances did not take his case \u201coutside the heartland\u201d and that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. His disagreement with the district court\u2019s evaluation of the sentencing factors is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 398; <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
