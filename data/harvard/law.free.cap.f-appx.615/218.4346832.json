Francis, federal prisoner # 27103-034, is serving a 177-month sentence for bank robbery and using, carrying, and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. Francis filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition arguing that he was entitled to resentencing because the indictment failed to notify him of the Government\u2019s intent to seek an enhancement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). He further argued that his sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and that he was actually innocent. The district court denied Francis\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because he failed to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">Section 2255 provides the main vehicle to raise a collateral challenge to a federal sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 relief is hence the appropriate remedy for \u201cerror[s] that occurred at or prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast, \u00a7 2241 is properly used to raise a challenge to \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877. A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors \u201cthat occur[red] at trial or sentencing is properly construed under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877-78. Francis is challenging alleged errors that happened at trial and sentencing. As such, Francis\u2019s claims must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">If a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201c \u2018inadequate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u201d\u2019 he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting \u00a7 2255). To make this showing, Francis must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (ii) \u201cthat was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Francis has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
