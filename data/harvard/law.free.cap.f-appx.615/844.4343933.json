He challenges the. substantive reasonableness of his sentence, contending that the sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of his argument, Borjas asserts that his illegal reentry offense is essentially an international trespass and that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2\u00cdA.2, is problematic because it is not empirically based and results in the double counting of his criminal history. He also asserts that the sentence is greater than necessary to promote respect for the law, to provide adequate deterrence, and to protect the public, and that it fails to adequately account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Because Borjas did not object to his sentence in the district court, we review his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Borjas asserts that a majority of courts of appeals have held that a defendant need not object after imposition of sentence to preserve error where he has already presented his arguments for a lower sentence to the district court. He raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, 556 </em>U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Borjas contends that the presumption should not be applied because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, but he concedes the issue is foreclosed, and he raises the issue only to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">We have rejected challenges to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence based on the same international-trespass, lack-of-empirical-basis, and double-counting arguments raised in this appeal. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the record does not reflect that Borjas\u2019s sentence fails to \u201caccount for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Borjas\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). He has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
