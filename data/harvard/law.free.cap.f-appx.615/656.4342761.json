Guest argues (1) the Postmaster of Unadilla, Georgia denied his constitutional right of access to the courts; (2) the Postmaster violated his due process rights by falsely accusing him of making threats, which caused his three-day confinement in involuntary segregation; and (3) his state law claims are not barred by the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity. As Guest is familiar with the facts of his case, we weave them into the discussion only as necessary. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOC\">\n<em>A Access to Courts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADP\">The district court did not err in concluding the complaint failed to state a violation of Guest\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts. A litigant asserting a denial-of-access-to-courts claim must prove he has a \u201ccolorable underlying claim for which he seeks relief.\u201d <em>Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.2006). The complaint must identify a nonfrivolous, arguable underlying claim \u201cdescribed well enough ... to show that the arguable nature of the underlying claim is more than hope.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Escambia Cty., </em>592 F.3d 1237, 1271 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation and internal quotation marks omitted). Guest has not sufficiently alleged a colorable, nonfriv-olous underlying claim. <em>See Barbour, </em>471 F.3d at 1226. The complaint merely says Guest mailed a motion for reconsideration to the Georgia Court of Appeals and that, had the motion been timely, it would have been granted. The complaint\u2019s blanket assertions do not show Guest\u2019s underlying claim was \u201cmore than hope.\u201d <em>See Cunningham, </em>592 F.3d at 1271 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>B. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The district court did not err in concluding the complaint failed to state a violation of due process arising from Guest\u2019s confinement in involuntary segregation. Guest\u2019s due process theory requires alleging not only the' deprivation of a liberty interest, but also that such deprivation \u201cimpose[d] atypical and significant hardship\u201d relative \u201cto the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Guest\u2019s complaint, however, alleges only that he was placed in involuntary segregation as a result of the alleged deprivation. Guest\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim because he has not alleged specific facts showing involuntary segregation at his facility is an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d in relation to ordinary prison life. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">\n<em>C. Federal Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The district court did not err in dismissing Guest\u2019s state law claims brought pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346. The federal government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity though the FTCA is subject to certain statutory exceptions, <em>Zelaya v. United States, </em>781 F.3d 1315,1322 (11th Cir.2015), one of which is the exception from \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b). Since Guest\u2019s FTCA claims are premised on the Postmaster\u2019s purported miscarriage of mail, they are barred by the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Guest\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. We review de novo a district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), using the same standards that govern Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr, </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Timson v.
