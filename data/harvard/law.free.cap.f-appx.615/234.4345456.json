Hofman contends that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>trict court committed procedural error by failing to adequately explain its reasons for imposing a sentence 28 months above the top of the advisory guidelines range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Because Hofman did not object to the purported inadequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation, we review the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). A district court commits clear procedural error when it \u201cfail[s] to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentencing court\u2019s explanation is adequate if it \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Our review of the record satisfies us that the district court adequately explained its decision to impose a 148-month sentence in this case. The district court expressly adopted the findings and conclusions in Hofman\u2019s presentence report (PSR), which stated that an upward variance from the advisory guidelines maximum of 125 months might be warranted \u2022based on Hofman\u2019s decades-long criminal history. The PSR further described Hof-man\u2019s commission of an exceedingly brutal, albeit unprosecuted, physical assault upon his wife immediately preceding his arrest on federal charges, which was not fully taken into consideration in determining the guidelines range. Citing those reasons, and after considering mitigation arguments by Hofman and his counsel, the district court determined that a sentence less than 148 months would not adequately address the fair sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">We have held that a district court\u2019s references to the contents of the PSR and the defendant\u2019s mitigation arguments in imposing an above-guidelines sentence \u201cprovide the background to clarify the \u2018factors\u2019 considered by the district court in determining the chosen sentence and provide adequate reasons for that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 657-59 (5th Cir.2008) (quote at 658); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432, 438-39 (5th Cir.2013). We conclude that the district court in this case \u201cadequately explained] the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50,128 S.Ct. 586. Therefore, Hofman fails to show that the district court committed clear or obvious error in relation to its explanation of reasons for imposing a 148-month sentence. <em>Se</em>e <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
