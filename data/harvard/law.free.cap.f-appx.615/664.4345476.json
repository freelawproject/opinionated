On appeal, Thelisma argues that the district court erred in finding credible the testimony of his trial counsel, Ana Davide; specifically, that she presented Thelisma with a second plea offer from the government at an evidentiary hearing. In addition, Thelisma contends that this error caused the district court to err in concluding that that his trial counsel was constitutionally effective, err in applying the wrong legal standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel, and err in sentencing him 120 months above the statutory limit. If Thelisma\u2019s arguments with respect to the district court\u2019s credibility determination fail, then we need not address Thelisma\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing claims because those claims are contingent upon whether the district court\u2019s credibility determinations were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">We accord considerable deference to the district court\u2019s credibility findings. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On review, we will accept the district court\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Here, Thelisma has not demonstrated any basis for rejecting the credibility determinations. Davide\u2019s testimony at the second hearing that she presented the government\u2019s second plea offer to Thelisma on August 1 while in the marshal\u2019s lockup at the courthouse was detailed, consistent with her first hearing testimony in material respects, and supported by documentary evidence, which included her personal records, documents from the government, and visitor logs from the marshal\u2019s lockup. The district court was able to hear Davide and Thelisma testify and observe their demeanor in order to determine the credibility of their statements, and none of Thelis-ma\u2019s arguments have demonstrated that Davide\u2019s testimony was contrary to the laws of nature or unacceptable to a reasonable factfinder, <em>Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d at 748-49. We also note that Thelisma has not challenged the district court\u2019s determination that his testimony was not credible, and has, therefore, abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (noting that an appellant waives a claim on appeal when he either makes no reference to it, only passing references to it, or raises it in a perfunctory manner without supporting arguments and authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Accordingly, we defer to the district court\u2019s determination that Davide\u2019s testimony regarding the presentation of the second plea offer to Thelisma was credible. Because we hold that the district court did not err in its credibility determinations, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>need not address Thelisma\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AaIh\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
