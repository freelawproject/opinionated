On appeal, Reed contends that, although he is a career offender, he has . been a model prisoner who should be able to benefit from recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the base offense levels for drug offenses. After careful review, we conclude that the district court was not authorized to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Reed is a career offender. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-19\">Whether the district court is authorized to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a guideline range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)(a). It is the policy of the Sentencing Commission that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the retroactive guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">Here, the district court properly denied Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction. Amendment 782 revised the guidelines applicable to most drug offenses by reducing the base offense levels found in the drug-quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G. app. C, Amend. 782. However, the total offense level of a career offender, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>such as Reed, is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline, not \u00a7 2D1.1, the drug-offense guideline. As a result, Reed\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range produced by \u00a7 4B1.1, which, Reed acknowledges, has not been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Thus, although Amendment 782 is applicable to Reed, a drug offender, the district court was not authorized to grant a reduction because the amendment did not\u2019 have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in. sentence.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction where an amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In short, Reed is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 because he was sentenced as a career offender. We affirm the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
