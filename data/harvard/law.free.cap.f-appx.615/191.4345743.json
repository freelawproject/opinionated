Valdez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 210 months of imprisonment. The district court denied Valdez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, finding that Valdez was ineligible for a reduction of sentence because his guidelines range was based on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and was not based on a drug quantity determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Valdez is challenging the certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). A district court must first determine whether a prisoner is eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) before determining whether to grant a reduction and the extent of the reduction. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Valdez contends that the court failed to provide an explanation for the denial of his motion; the court failed to review his post-conviction conduct; and the court failed to notify Valdez of the contents of a new presentence report. Valdez further asserts that the court\u2019s denial of his motion created a disparity in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Because Valdez\u2019s guidelines range was not based on drug quantity but rather his status as a career offender, the district court was correct in concluding that Valdez was not eligible for a reduction under Amendment 782 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 782 (amending the drug quantity table set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 788 (providing that Amendment 782 becomes retroactively applicable on November 1, 2015). Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address Valdez\u2019s remaining arguments. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Valdez has failed to show that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
