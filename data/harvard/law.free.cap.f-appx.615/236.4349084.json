On appeal, Martinez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. In reviewing the evidence for sufficiency, we examine \u201call evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>740 F.3d 956, 962 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 54, 190 L.Ed.2d 56 (2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>774 F.3d 837, 841 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">To support a conviction under \u00a7 2422(b), the government must prove that (1) the defendant used a facility of interstate commerce to commit the offense; the defendant was aware that the victim was younger than eighteen; (3) by engaging in sexual activity with the victim, the defendant could have been charged with a criminal offense under state law; and (4) the defendant knowingly persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced the victim to engage in criminal sexual activity. <em>See United States v. Rounds, </em>749 F.3d 326, 333 (5th Cir.2014). \u201cTo sustain a conviction for an attempt, the evidence must show that the defendant (1) acted with the culpability required to commit the underlying substantive offense, and (2) took a substantial step towards its commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Olvera, </em>687 F.3d 645, 647 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">Martinez communicated with law enforcement agents posing as a 16-year-old girl named Whitney. He notes that he initially offered only to give Whitney a massage, and he points out that his subsequent and more detailed text-messaged descriptions were given only in response to Whitney\u2019s repeated questions as to \u201cwhat else\u201d he would do. He argues that the statements made in response to Whitney\u2019s queries are insufficient to prove that he was attempting to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce Whitney to engage in sexual activity. Martinez also contends that the acts discussed in the communications with Whitney are insufficient to show that conduct criminalized under Texas law was contemplated. Martinez does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence as to his use of a facility of interstate commerce, his awareness of the age of the intended victim, or his taking a substantial step toward commission of the offense, so we need not address the sufficiency of the evidence as to these elements. <em>See Rounds, </em>749 F.3d at 333 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">\u201cWhether there was inducement, persuasion, or enticement is a question of fact-for the jury to decide. All we must decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>is whether or not enough evidence was presented for a reasonable jury to come to the conclusion that there was some form of inducement.\u201d <em>United States v. Lundy, </em>676 F.3d 444, 450 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cEvidence can establish that a defendant intended to induce, persuade, entice, or coerce a minor by sending the minor sexually explicit messages.\u201d <em>Rounds, </em>749 F.3d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The evidence shows that after Martinez offered to give Whitney a massage, the law enforcement agent posing as Whitney inquired whether Martinez wanted her clothed. Martinez replied that it would be better if she were naked. Subsequently, in response to queries, Martinez indicated that he would touch, kiss, and lick Whitney\u2019s body in a manner explicitly intended to arouse her sexual desire. Given the sexually-charged nature of Martinez\u2019s messages to Whitney, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that Martinez knowingly attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity. <em>See Lundy, </em>676 F.3d at 447, 450. We likewise conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found that Martinez contemplated \u201csexual conduct\u201d that would have constituted a violation of Texas law. <em>See </em>Tex Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43.25(a)(2), (b), 43.01(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
