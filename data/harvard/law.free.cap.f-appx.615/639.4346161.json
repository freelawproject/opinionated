Flores challenges the 16-level enhancement of his sentence based on his prior conviction for the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (Nov. 2014). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Flores acknowledges that our decision in <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960 (11th Cir.2005), forecloses his argument that his prior conviction cannot be used to enhance his sentence because it was not alleged in his indictment, U.S. Const. Amend. V, or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, U.S. Const. Amend. VI. In <em>Orduno-Mireles </em>we held, based on <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), \u201cthat recidivism under section 2L1.2(b)(2) is not a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d or to allege in an indictment. 405 F.3d at 962. And we are bound by <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>unless and until it , is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 963; <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1250 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">We AFFIRM Flores\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
