Berry appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his second request for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission and \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the retroactive guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">As explained in our prior opinion affirming the district court\u2019s denial of Berry\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion (based on Amendment 750), where the guideline amendment reduces the defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not change the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based, the district court is not authorized to grant the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, a defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction if the amendment does not actually lower his applicable guidelines range because the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This time, Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 782. Amendment 782 lowered the base offense level for many drug offenses, including Berry\u2019s offense, by revising the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d) (listing Amendment 782 among the amendments that may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The district court did not err in denying Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782. Although Amendment 782 lowered the base offense level for Berry\u2019s offense, it had no effect on Berry\u2019s guidelines range or ultimate sentence. Berry\u2019s applicable guidelines range of 360 to life was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline, not on the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1. And, Berry\u2019s life sentence was required by the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (requiring a life sentence if the \u00a7 841(a) defendant had two or more prior convictions for felony drug offenses); U.S.S.G \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2) (2002) (permitting the sentence to be imposed at any point within the applicable guidelines range, but not less than the statutory minimum). Accordingly, Berry was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Berry raises several arguments for the first time on appeal, all of which lack merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Berry contends that his Fifth and Eighth Amendment, rights have been violated because he will be incarcerated for longer than he would be if the amendments applied. However, these constitutional claims are \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d that are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-82 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Berry also argues that denying him a reduction based on Amendment 782 violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. There is no merit to this argument, however, because Amendment 782 did not increase the range of punishment applicable to Berry above what it was at the time he committed his crime. <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that no Ex Post Facto problem exists \u201c[s]o long as the effect of post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>conduct amendments to the guidelines is not to increase the defendant\u2019s punishment beyond what it would have been without those amendments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\u2022 Finally, Berry argues that the district court should have given him a sentence reduction based on' Amendment 788. Amendment 788 merely added Amendment 782 to the list of retroactive amendments that could serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and delayed its effective date until November 1, 2015. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 788. As such, Amendment 788 is not itself an amendment that could have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s sentencing range. Further, Amendment 788 is not included in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1O\u2019s list of amendments that may be considered for retroactive application pursuant to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
