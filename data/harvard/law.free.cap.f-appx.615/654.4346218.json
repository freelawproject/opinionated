The district court dismissed the case for failure to exhaust state remedies. On appeal, D.D. concedes that his due process rights must be challenged through a writ of habeas corpus; thus, D.D. does not challenge on appeal the dismissal of his claim for lack of exhaustion. However, D.D.\u2019s parents argue on appeal that D.D.\u2019s detention by the DJJ violates their constitutional parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-21\">Regardless of how the Appellants frame the claims, both claims \u2014 D.D.\u2019s own claim (Count Two) and his parents\u2019 claim based on their parental rights (Count One) \u2014 are, in their essential nature, challenges to D.D.\u2019s detention. Therefore, the appropriate method to challenge D.D.\u2019s detention is to seek a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\u201cCongress has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement, and that specific determination must override the general terms of \u00a7 1983.\u201d). Because the available remedies in Georgia courts have not been exhausted, we agree with the district court\u2019s holding that the claims must be dismissed for failure to exhaust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-18\">. In light of our holding that the parents\u2019 claim sounds in habeas and must be dismissed for lack of exhaustion, we need not, and do not, address the parents\u2019 argument that the district court erred in suggesting that the parents\u2019 fundamental parental rights were not implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
