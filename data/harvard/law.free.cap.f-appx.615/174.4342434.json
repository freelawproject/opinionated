Ramirez-Torres\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Because Ramirez-Torres did not raise in the district court his current challenges to his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hemandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). The record contains both the indictment and the judgment pertaining to Ramirez-Torres\u2019s Texas conviction for burglary of a dwelling with intent to commit assault, and we therefore reject as factually incorrect his argument that the district court based the enhancement entirely upon information contained in his presentence report. <em>See United States v. Conde-Castaneda, </em>753 F.3d 172, 177 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 311, 190 L.Ed.2d 225 (2014). The indictment and judgment establish that Ramirez-Torres was convicted under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1); accordingly, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, by imposing the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement. <em>See Conde-Castaneda, </em>753 F.3d at 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">As Ramirez-Torres does not assert, much less show, that the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure resulted from its mistaken belief that it lacked authority to depart, we lack jurisdiction to review that denial. <em>See United States v. Tumo, </em>738 F.3d 681, 691 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2875, 189 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014). The district court declined to grant Ramirez-Torres\u2019s request for a downward variance after listening to his arguments regarding the severity of the applicable guidelines range as well as his cultural assimilation, familial ties, and employment history in the United States. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Our review reveals no abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
