Respondent\u2019s conduct is inexcusable and intolerable, and violates DR 1-102 (A) (7) of the Code of Professional Responsibility (22 NYCRR 1200.3 [a] [7]) in that it reflects adversely on his fitness to practice law <em>(see, Matter of Simon, </em>20 AD2d 46; <em>In re Williams, </em>414 NW2d 394 [Minn 1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In unanimously recommending a public censure instead of a more severe sanction, the Hearing Panel of the Departmental Disciplinary Committee took into consideration respondent\u2019s apology by letter and in person at the disciplinary hearing to the attorney who had patiently borne his insults, the respondent\u2019s youth (28 years) and inexperience, the fact that monetary sanctions were imposed on respondent by the Judge to whom the civil case was assigned, and that soon after the incident in question respondent was fired from the law firm at which he had been employed. We agree with the recommended sanction under all the circumstances, but respondent is put on notice that a repetition of such conduct will almost certainly warrant a suspension from practice <em>(see, Matter of Simon, </em>32 AD2d 362; <em>Matter of Vincenti, </em>114 NJ 275, 554 A2d 470).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Accordingly, the motion by the Departmental Disciplinary Committee to confirm the Hearing Panel\u2019s report and recommendation should be granted to the extent indicated, and respondent should be publicly censured.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Carro, J. P., Rosenberger, Ellerin, Wallace and Rubin, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Respondent publicly censured.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
