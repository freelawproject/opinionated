The physician testifying for respondent State and Local Employees\u2019 Retirement System stated that although there would be some \"permanent residual weakness\u201d in petitioner\u2019s thumb, the strength in her uninjured fingers could be regained by exercise and the weakness would not be \"prohibitive to the type of work she engaged in\u201d. It was for the Comptroller to resolve any conflicts in the medical evidence <em>(see, Matter of Ramseur v Regan, </em>154 AD2d 869) and he was free to accord more weight to the opinion of one physician over another <em>(see, Matter of McGrath v Regan, </em>109 AD2d 1007). Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the determination denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement benefits, it must be upheld <em>(see, Matter of Clay v Regan, </em>90 AD2d 625). Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions have been considered and rejected as unpersuasive.</p><p id=\"b937-4\">Mikoll, J. P., Yesawich Jr., Mercure, Crew III and Casey, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
