Mr. Rosenberg was admitted to the practice of law by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Second Judicial Department, on October 16, 1968, under the name Roger Michael Rosenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Mr. Rosenberg acknowledges that he is the subject of an investigation by the Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District concerning his plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to mail fraud, in violation of 18 USC \u00a7 1341. He admitted that he forged the signature of the actual owner of certain stock certificates on the stock power which was used for the transfer of an ownership document. That crime constitutes a Federal felony cognizable as a \"serious crime\u201d under Judiciary Law \u00a7 90, thereby mandating the respondent\u2019s suspension pending a hearing. The suspension became effective upon receipt by this Court on November 23, 1992, of the record of such conviction. He acknowledges that he cannot successfully defend himself on the merits against any disciplinary charges which the Grievance Committee\u2019s investigation might generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Mr. Rosenberg further acknowledges that his resignation is freely and voluntarily tendered, that he is not being subject to coercion or duress, and that he is fully aware of the implications of submitting his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Counsel for the Grievance Committee recommends that the Court accept the resignation. Under the circumstances, the resignation of Roger Rosenberg as a member of the Bar is accepted and directed to be filed. Accordingly, Roger Rosenberg is disbarred and his name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law, effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Mangano, P.
