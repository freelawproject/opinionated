The facts have been considered and are determined to have been established.</p><p id=\"b732-9\">On the morning after the defendant\u2019s arrest, one of the arresting officers, who later testified at trial, was separately interviewed by two Assistant District Attorneys. The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>informed both of these individuals that while he and a fellow officer were guarding the defendant at the hospital following his arrest the previous night, the defendant told them that had his machine gun not jammed, he would have \"sprayed the police officers like Raid sprays roaches\u201d or \"bugs\u201d. Both Assistant District Attorneys made written copies of the officer\u2019s statements. At trial the People were permitted to place these facts in evidence on re-direct examination of the officer in order to rebut the defendant\u2019s assertions that this officer and others had fabricated the defendant\u2019s alleged hospital statements in retaliation for the defendant having filed a claim of police brutality, false arrest, and malicious prosecution against these officers. The defense counsel subsequently moved for a mistrial, asserting that the sole written account he had received of the defendant\u2019s hospital statement was a voluntary disclosure form dated almost two months after the defendant\u2019s arrest. Counsel argued that had he received a written account of the arresting officer\u2019s assertions concerning the defendant\u2019s statement recorded only hours after the defendant\u2019s arrest, he never would have pursued the line of cross-examination that he did. The prosecutor could not definitely say that the documents had been included in the <em>Rosario </em>package delivered to the defense counsel, and the trial court found that the documents prepared by the Assistant District Attorneys after interviewing the officer-witness only hours after the defendant\u2019s arrest were not forwarded to the defense counsel prior to trial. While there was reference to the statements in question in the officer\u2019s pre-trial testimony, this did not mitigate the People\u2019s obligation to nevertheless turn them over prior to the trial proper <em>(see, People v Ranghelle, </em>69 NY2d 56, 64; <em>cf., People v Toro, </em>168 AD2d 400; <em>People v Rogelio, </em>160 AD2d 359, <em>affd </em>79 NY2d 843; <em>see also, People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154, 160). Because the defendant\u2019s ability to effectively cross-examine the People\u2019s witnesses was substantially prejudiced by the People\u2019s failure in this regard, he is entitled to a new trial <em>(see, </em>CPL 240.45; <em>People v Perez, </em>65 NY2d 154, 159, <em>supra; see also, People v Goins, </em>73 NY2d 989; <em>People v Thompson, </em>71 NY2d 918). Eiber, J. P., O\u2019Brien, Ritter and Copertino, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
