C. 303.23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The affidavit claims, in relevant part, that appellant \u201cdid unlawfully use [his] said premises <em>(land) </em>in violation of . . . Sec. 51.11 . . . [of the Hamilton County Zoning- Resolution] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">No part of the zoning- resolution was introduced in evidence. Apparently the trial judge erroneously took judicial notice of it. Cf. R. C. 2317.441,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in effect on the day of the trial, October 21, 1969. Cf., also, Civil Rule 44.1(A) (2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> effective July 1, 1970. However, appellant not only does not attempt to reverse his conviction on this ground, but in his brief provides the text of portions of the zoning resolution relevant to his defense, to which the prosecution offers no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The undisputed facts are that appellant purchased the premises located in a single-family residence district on or before June 3, 1969; that on that date he removed therefrom a house trailer which had been occupied continuously as a single-family residence since before the addition of Section 51.11 to the zoning resolution; and that he simultaneously placed thereon another house trailer which he immediately commenced to use as a residence for himself and his family. The record is devoid of any reference to the relative size, type or foundation of the two trailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We reverse the conviction and discharge the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Section 51.11 of the zoning resolution does prohibit \u201cplacing a trailer\u201d in any residence district for \u201coccupancy for human habitation.\u201d The claim of the affidavit, however, and the theory of the prosecution is that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>used his land </em>in violation of the resolution. And, the use of the land in question for the residence of a single family in a house trailer was established long before July 22, 3958, when Section 51.11 was first adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s conduct as charged is exonerated by Section 151 of the zoning resolution, which reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>\u201cThe lawful use </em>of any dwelling, building or structure and <em>of any land or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enactment of this resolution or amendment thereto, may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this resolution or amendment. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The words, \u201cof any dwelling, building or structure and,\u201d are inapplicable to this case for the reason that, by the specific terms of Section 31.46 of the zoning resolution, trailers (including, by definition, appellant\u2019s house trailer) \u201cshall not be considered buildings, dwellings or structures for the purpose of\u201d the zoning resolution. Thus, even assuming that the affidavit had charged appellant specifically with <em>locating a building </em>on his premises contrary to R. C. 303.23, the conviction would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We do not reach, on this record, the question of the constitutionality of the provisions of Section 51.11 of the Hamilton County Zoning Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-10\">0 \u2019Neill, C.
