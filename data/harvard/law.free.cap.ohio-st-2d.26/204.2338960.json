For the reasons stated in that opinion, this issue must be decided in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second contention is that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to admit evidence pertaining to the results of the chemical analysis of the defendant\u2019s bodily substance, unless the prosecution affirmatively proved that such substance was withdrawn within two hours of the time of defendant\u2019s arrest. Reviewing the narrative bill of exceptions, the trial judge\u2019s separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the transcript, we can find no indication that this question was brought to the attention of the trial judge so that he could have ruled thereon. In its opinion, the Court of Appeals stated that the question of \u201c* * * the time which transpired from arrest to test * * *\u201d was not questioned during trial. As this was the case, we shall not decide the question raised in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-6\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Duncan, Stern and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b244-7\">Schneider and Corrigan, JJ., dissent,</judges>\n<judges id=\"b244-8\">Schneider, J., dissents for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>26 Ohio St. 2d 190.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
