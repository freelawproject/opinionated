They assert as a proposition of law that an adopted child, who is permanently surrendered to a social agency in accordance with R. C. 5103.15, thereafter has no right of inheritance from the surrendering parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">R. C. 5103.15<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes the parents of a child to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>enter into an agreement with certain accredited associations or institutions whereby the parents relinquish their rights to custody and support of such child and agree that the institution alone has the power to consent to the adoption of the child under R. C. 3107.06.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">R. C. 5103.15 makes no distinction between natural children of the surrendering parents and adopted children. Thus, it must follow that if the permanent surrender by the parents of \u201ccare and custody\u201d of the child, when coupled with authorization to the institution to consent to the legal adoption of the child, would have the legal effect of disinheriting an adopted child, such effect would also result in disinheriting a natural child.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We find nothing in the Ohio statutes which would compel, or even authorize, such a conclusion. The statutes clearly distinguish between \u201ccare and custody,\u201d whether temporary or permanent, and the rights of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The rights of inheritance to, through and from a legally adopted child are vested by R. C. 3107.13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tire legislative scheme requires <em>judicial </em>action before the basic rights of <em>inheritance </em>otherwise in force, are altered. This is true, even as to the \u201cdesignation\u201d of a person \u201cto stand toward him in the relation of an heir at law in the event of his death\u201d and as to the vacation or change in such \u201cdesignation of heir,\u201d the approval of the Probate Court being required in either event. R. C. 2105.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Kenneth Lee Thompson did not cease to be an heir of his natural parents when he was surrendered by them to the Catholic Charities prior to 1945. He did not become an heir of the Hemmerts when they took custody of him in 1945. He did, however, become an heir of the Hemmerts when he was legally adopted by them in accordance with the provisions of R. C. Chapter 3107, in 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Pursuant to R. C. 3107.07, providing that \u201cIn proceedings for the adoption of a child previously adopted, the written consent of the preceding adopting parents shall be required in the same manner and extent as if they were natural parents,\u201d the status of the Hemmerts in authorizing the Catholic Charities to appear in any legal proceeding for the adoption of Kenneth and consent to has adoption, in accordance with R. C. 5103.15, was exactly the same as if they had been the natural parents of Kenneth. Had Kenneth again been legally adopted by others, he then, in accordance with the provisions of R. C. 3107.13, would have ceased to be an heir of the Hemmerts and would have become an heir of his new adopting parents. However, this never took place, and since the order of adoption by the Hemmerts was never modified or vacated by the Probate Court, he remained an heir of the Hemmerts by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We conclude that a child surrendered by its parents into the permanent custody of an institution established for the purpose of aiding, caring for and placing children in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>homes, under a written agreement pursuant to R. 0. 5103.15, which agreement provides that the institution may appear in any legal proceeding for the adoption of such child and consent to the child\u2019s adoption, continues as an heir of such parents, either natural or adoptive, until such time as the child has been legally adopted pursuant to the provisions of R. C. Chapter 3107.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
