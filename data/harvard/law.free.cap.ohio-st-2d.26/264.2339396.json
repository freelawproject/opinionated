A railroad has nothing to do with it. <em>There is no insurance company involved in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">\u201cMr. Grinocchio: I object, your Honor, to all this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">\u201cThe Court: I think the objection is well taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">\u201cMr. Utz: There is no party, insurance company, in this case nor a railroad, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">\u201cThe Court: Objection is well taken. I will sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">\u201cMr. Utz: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">\u201cMr. Grinocchio: Would you ask the jury to disregard that question, I mean that statement? It was not a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-15\">\u201cThe Court: <em>There is nothing to disregard. </em>There has been <em>no\u2014the objection was put to a statement of fact, which is not a proper subject. There is nothing here involving any of these.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-16\">\u201cMr. Utz: I know, but Mr. Grinocchio asked about railroads and so forth, your Honor. <em>There is nothing in this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">The attention of counsel for appellant is directed to the fourth paragraph of the syllabus in <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Hume </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 319, 3 N. E. 2d 39:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">\u201c4. The plaintiff in an action for damages for wrongful death caused by the alleged unlawful operation of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>automobile, has a right to interrogate the jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>(1) as to whether they are connected with or interested in a casualty insurance company and (2) as to the extent thereof; <em>but when the mode of questioning is such as to indicate lacle of good faith on the part of plaintiff\u2019s counsel it is the duty of the court to compel the </em>in-j <em>quiry to proceed according to approved methods of interrogation. (Dowd-Feder, Inc., </em>v. <em>Truesdell, </em>130 Ohio St. 530, approved and followed.)\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In the case at bar, no objection was made to the repetitive nature of the \u201cinsurance company\u201d inquiries. Thus, we turn to the remarks of counsel for appellee, in which the error was preserved by objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">There is little question that counsel\u2019s statements to the jury represented a distinct impropriety and were clearly prejudicial to the rights of the appellants. Standing uncorrected, they constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Appellants\u2019 motion for an instruction that the jury disregard counsel\u2019s remarks should have been sustained and the instruction given. Instead, the trial court announced in the presence of the jury that \u201c <em>there is nothing to disregard * * * the objection was put to a statement of fact, which is not a proper subject. There is nothing here involving any of these.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">This language by the court, coupled with the erroneous refusal to instruct the jury to disregard counsel\u2019s statements, could only have led the jury to a false conclusion of fact, <em>i. e., </em>that any judgment rendered for the appellants would wrest from appellee and his family whatever funds or property were necessary for the total payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-11\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Duncan, Corrigan, Stern and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b304-12\">Schneiper, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
