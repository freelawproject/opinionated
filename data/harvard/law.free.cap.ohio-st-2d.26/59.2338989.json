In those hypothetical questions, the content of Dr. Parker\u2019s report, as read and interpreted by Dr. Oser, was specifically emphasized.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">I paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Burens </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 549, this court stated: \u201cThe hypothesis upon which an expert witness is asked to state an opinion <em>must be based upon facts within the witness\u2019 own personal knowledge or upon facts shown by other evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">As the opinions of Dr. Parker contained in the fourth report were not in e idence, and as substantial emphasis was placed upon those opinions in establishing the plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting testimony as to such opinions to be admitted in evidence over objection. Consequently, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-11\">O\u2019Neill, C.
