In addition, at trial on direct examination, each of these witnesses told of a prior out-of-court identification of Abner Wilkinson by selecting his photograph from a group of other photographs. It is the evidence of the prior out-of-court identification procedure about which appellant complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">This court recently has had occasion to decide a case concerning an out-of-court identification procedure and its impact upon the trial of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Breedlove </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 178. We held that under R. C. 2945.55 evidence of a prior out-of-court identification of the defendant by a photograph selection is admissible at trial if the photographs do not provide the finder of facts with the reasonable inference that defendant has had prior criminal involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">In this case, the photographs of Wilkinson admitted in evidence and submitted to the jurors had no identification numerals on them. We have examined these photographs and cannot find, as a matter of law, that any of them provide a basis for a reasonable inference that appellant had had prior criminal involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Defense counsel\u2019s reference, on cross-examination, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the photographs as \u201cmug shots,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first injected into the trial the suggestion that the photographs were mug shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">John Raso and Timothy Raso identified appellant\u2019s photograph prior to the stage of the criminal procedure when his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution attached. Officer Watkins had known appellant some years before, and there is no evidence that his testimony regarding his having observed Wilkinson\u2019s photograph on the wall at a police station tainted the in-court identification. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 74; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1967), 388 U. S. 218; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969), 388 U. S. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs in evidence without the laying of a proper foundation in that at no time was the jury informed when, how, or why the photos were taken. Although this contention is somewhat incongruous with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>fact that defense counsel termed them \u201cmug shots,\u201d the admission or rejection of photographs was in the sound discretion of the court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodards </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 14; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 88. The state\u2019s witnesses stated that the pictures were in fact pictures of the man they saw on the night of the crime. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Apparently, appellant also assigns as prejudicial error the court rulings on the admissibility of evidence of a relationship between Clarence Holland and himself. The prosecutor obviously was attempting to produce testimony from Detective Patterson that appellant\u2019s connection with the robbery was first suggested by the fact that a check of Holland\u2019s police file showed appellant to have been an associate of Holland. The trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s attempted elicitation of such testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no need to determine whether there is evidence of a criminal conspiracy, or if one was proved. We believe the record in this regard demonstrates no prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Schneider, Herbert, Duncan, Corrigan, Stern and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The defense on cross-examination went into the fact that three days after the robbery Officer Watkins observed a photograph of Wilkinson at the police station. In the cross-examination defense counsel used the term \u201cmug shot\u201d in referring to the photograph, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201cQ. You did testify on direct examination when Mr. Hanna was examining you that you have known him for about 15 years, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201cA. Well, I said about 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">\u201cQ.

A roll call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">\u201cQ. A roll call you saw a photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">\u201cQ. As best as you can remember, how large was this photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">\u201cA. Well, I\u2019d say two by four probably. Two inches by four inches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-17\">\u201cQ. Then it was a small photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">\"A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">\u201cQ. Like a mug shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-20\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">\u201cQ. The average size mug shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-22\">\u201cA. That is what is was, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The following direct testimony of Detective Patterson was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201cQ. No, prior to that, sir. What I am getting at is, after the lineup that was conducted! and the identification made, did you do anything or your partner do anything in your presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">\u201cA. Yes. After the failure to identify from slides, my partner reviewed the arrest record of Clarence Roland\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">\u201cQ. Wait a minute. Of who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">\u201cA. Clarence Roland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\"><em>\u201cQ.

Did your partner cheek anything in your records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">\u201cQ.
