We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>de novo the questions of whether the defendant has waived his right to appeal and whether the condition illegally exceeds the permissible statutory penalty. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>582 F.3d 974, 981 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Defendant signed a plea agreement containing an appellate waiver that notes his right to appeal his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and in which he agrees to waive \u201cany and all right to directly appeal the sentence.\u201d This unambiguously includes any right to appeal conditions of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Joyce, </em>357 F.3d 921, 923-24 (9th Cir.2004) (finding agreement to waive \u201cmy right under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to appeal any aspect of the sentence imposed in this case,\u201d covers appeal of conditions of supervised release and concluding that the meaning of \u00a7 3742 is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that \u201ca \u2018sentence\u2019 can include fines, periods of imprisonment and supervised release, and mandatory and special conditions of supervised release\u201d). However, \u201c[a] waiver of the right to appeal does not bar a defendant from challenging an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>582 F.3d at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In this case, the challenged condition of supervised release is not illegal. \u201cAn illegal sentence is one not authorized by the judgment of conviction or in excess of the permissible statutory penalty for the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>405 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2005). Because of the defendant\u2019s extensive, violent criminal history, the failure of his previous court supervision to rehabilitate him, and his troubled relationship with his girlfriend and co-defendant, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion in this case, which is substantially the same as the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Watson </em>that \u201cthe only way to prevent [the defendant] from returning to a life of further misconduct [i]s to force him to make a new life somewhere else.\u201d 582 F.3d at 983. In addition, as in <em>Watson, </em>the challenged condition of supervised release is not absolute, as the defendant may obtain permission from his probation officer to visit Wyola. <em>See id. </em>at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Because the challenged condition is not illegal and the defendant does not argue that another exception to enforcement of the appellate waiver applies, <em>see United States v. Bibler, </em>495 F.3d 621, 624 (9th Cir.2007), we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-24\">. The government\u2019s argument that Defendant\u2019s appellate waiver deprives us of jurisdiction is mistaken:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Generally, appellate courts retain[] subject matter jurisdiction over [an] appeal by a defendant who has signed an appellate waiver. Absent some miscarriage of justice, however, we will not exercise that jurisdiction to review the merits of [an] appeal if we conclude that [the defendant] knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to bring the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-13\"><em>United States v.
