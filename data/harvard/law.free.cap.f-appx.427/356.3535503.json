The district court denied Robinson leave to appeal IFP, but it did not certify that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). We may nevertheless dismiss the appeal sua sponte pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 if it is apparent that the appeal lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">Robinson argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a sentencing reduction because it failed to consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which concerns the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and placed too great a weight on his criminal history. Robinson\u2019s unwarranted-disparity argument is without merit because it amounts to a request that the court make a sentencing reduction mandatory when requested pursuant to the crack cocaine amendments. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3374, 176 L.Ed.2d 1260 (2010). The district court provided reasons for denying Robinson\u2019s motion that reflect its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>factors. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Robinson\u2019s effort to have us weigh the factors anew is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Robinson has not shown that the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion presents a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
