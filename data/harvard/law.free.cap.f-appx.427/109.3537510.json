The District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands sentenced Jackson to a seventy-five month term of imprisonment to be followed by four years of supervised release and levied both a $400 special assessment and a $400 fine. On appeal, Jackson argues (1) the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence; and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct false testimony deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial. Because Jackson is entitled to relief on neither of these grounds, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">The jury returned its guilty verdict on March 17, 2004. On April 1, 2004, Jackson filed a motion for a new trial or, alternatively, to dismiss with prejudice, in which he alleged the jury verdict \u201cwas secured through active governmental misconduct and impropriety.\u201d Specifically, he argued two material witnesses had provided false testimony at the behest of the prosecution. In support of his motion, Jackson attached an unsworn letter from one of the witnesses, Donovan Dailey, who testified at trial he had already been sentenced for his role in the drug importation scheme and did not anticipate receiving additional benefits in exchange for his testimony. In his letter, Dailey claimed he testified as directed by the government only after having been threatened with additional charges for his role in an unrelated matter. Moreover, Jackson alleged the government had assured the second witness, Damian Daniel, that he would not be charged in this case. Such an understanding would have belied the government\u2019s argument, offered in its closing, that Daniel\u2019s testimony was credible precisely because he was still theoretically susceptible to prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">The District Court denied Jackson\u2019s motion on May 11, 2004. Significantly, it reasoned Jackson had given \u201cno indication of exactly what testimony of Donovan Dailey and Damian Daniel was false,\u201d and it concluded Jackson\u2019s allegations \u201cdo not rise to the threshold [that] would require any evidentiary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-17\">Jackson renewed his motion on May 25, 2004. In support, he attached as exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>four additional unsworn letters from those purporting to possess material information. Both Robert La Ware and Vernon S. Morgan, a co-defendant who testified at Jackson\u2019s trial, stated Daniel was aware prior to taking the witness stand that he would not be charged because his stepfather, who was friendly with a senior Drug Enforcement Administration agent, had intervened on his behalf. Russell Robinson wrote that Kendrick Vanterpool, a co-conspirator with whom he was incarcerated at Guaynabo Metropolitan Detention Center, acknowledged having been \u201cinstructed\u201d as to how to testify before the grand jury in order to ensure Jackson would be indicted. At trial, Vanterpool testified he had met with the prosecutor only twice and could not remember whether he had spoken with DEA agents on more than five occasions. In his letter, Robinson stated Vanterpool admitted having been flown to St. Thomas \u201cat least fourteen times to be interviewed, prepared and directed as to what to say and not to say.\u201d And Lenford Rogers wrote he had agreed to testify in the manner suggested by the prosecution only after having been threatened with incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On July 6, 2006, Jackson supplemented his renewed motion with an affidavit from Esteban Rosario, a correctional officer at St. Croix Golden Grove Prison. Rosario wrote that Dailey had confided to him on numerous occasions that the government induced him to testify against Jackson, \u201can individual that he didn\u2019t know,\u201d by threatening him with a protracted sentence in an undesirable facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The District Court denied Jackson\u2019s motion on August 30, 2006. In finding Jackson could not satisfy \u201cany of the required prongs for new trial based upon false testimony,\u201d the court concluded the \u201coverwhelming ... number of witnesses, corroborating testimony, and physical evidence [were] such that the jury\u2019s verdict would most likely have been the same\u201d even if the \u201callegedly challenged testimony\u201d of Rogers and Vanterpool were to be discounted. The court noted Vanterpool had not personally recanted his testimony and opined that, if examined, Vanterpool \u201cwould be pressed to explain various details of his self-incriminating trial testimony and motivation for recanting sworn testimony and for subjecting himself to the separate crime of perjury.\u201d Furthermore, the court described Rogers\u2019 \u201cpurported recantation\u201d as \u201cinherently suspicious,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with corroborating physical evidence received at trial tying the defendant to the transaction,\u201d and \u201cimplausibly inconsistent with the testimony of other co-conspirators.\u201d Again, the court determined no evidentiary hearing was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The court issued a supplemental order on August 31, 2006. It stressed the jury\u2019s verdict had not been \u201csecured through active governmental misconduct and impropriety, including perjurious testimony, since there is no competent evidence submitted by defendant of such misconduct.\u201d It discredited Dailey\u2019s \u201cpurported recantation\u201d and found that \u201ca not so close reading of [Dailey\u2019s statement] shows that he has neither stated that he was told by agents to testify falsely nor has he stated that he did, in fact, testify falsely.\u201d Moreover, the court discerned \u201cno factual basis\u201d for Jackson\u2019s contention that DEA agents had notified Daniel he would not be charged and \u201cno evidence that Daniel[ ] was a criminal co-conspirator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Jackson was sentenced on November 30, 2006, and he filed a timely notice of appeal the following day. Having received credit for time served, he completed his term of imprisonment and was released from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons on September 18, 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Upon a defendant\u2019s motion filed within three years of a guilty verdict, a district court may order a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence \u201cif the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 38. Motions for a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence \u201care to be granted with the greatest of caution.\u201d <em>United States v. Kozak, </em>438 F.2d 1062, 1067 (3d Cir.1971). \u201cCourts have historically viewed recantation testimony with great suspicion.\u201d <em>Landano v. Rafferty, </em>856 F.2d 569, 572 (3d Cir.1988); <em>see also United States v. Miner, </em>131 F.3d 1271, 1273 (8th Cir.1997) (\u201cCourts look upon recantations with suspicion.\u201d); <em>Spence v. Johnson, </em>80 F.3d 989, 997 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201crecanting affidavits and witnesses are viewed with extreme suspicion by the courts\u201d (internal quotation omitted)); <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>944 F.2d 1253, 1264 (6th Cir. 1991) (\u201cRecanting affidavits and witnesses are viewed with extreme suspicion.\u201d). Consequently, courts have proven \u201cparticularly reluctant to grant such motions where the newly discovered evidence consists of a witness recantation.\u201d <em>United States v. Di Paolo, </em>835 F.2d 46, 49 (2d Cir.1987) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Curley v. Klem, </em>499 F.3d 199, 206 (3d Cir.2007). But when a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial \u201cis based on application of a legal precept,\u201d our review is plenary. <em>Honeywell, Inc. v. American Standards Testing Bureau, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 652, 655 (3d Cir.1988). Generally, we apply the test outlined in <em>United States v. Iannelli, </em>528 F.2d 1290, 1292 (3d Cir.1976), when determining whether a new trial should be granted in light of newly discovered evidence. Yet, in declaring Jackson incapable of satisfying \u201cany of the required prongs for new trial based upon false testimony,\u201d the District Court cited to <em>United States v. Massac, </em>867 F.2d 174, 178 (3d Cir.1989), in which we reviewed a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the rule enunciated in <em>Larrison v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 82, 87 (7th Cir.1928). We noted in <em>Massac </em>that our Circuit has refrained from adopting the <em>Larrison </em>test, but we nevertheless proceeded to review the district court\u2019s application of that standard for abuse of discretion because the parties had agreed upon <em>Larrison </em>as the appropriate analytical framework. 867 F.2d at 178. Jackson contends the court\u2019s invocation of <em>Lamson </em>was an erroneous \u201capplication of a legal precept\u201d sufficient to justify application of the more searching <em>de novo </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Under <em>Iannelli, </em>a district court may, in its discretion, order a new trial based on newly discovered evidence if the defendant satisfies a five-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">(a) the evidence must be in fact, newly discovered, i.e. discovered since the trial; (b) facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant; (c) the evidence relied on must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (d) it must be material to the issues involved; and (e) it must be such, and of such nature, as that, on a new trial, the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>528 F.2d at 1292. By contrast, the approach announced in <em>Larrison </em>requires a defendant to satisfy a three-part standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">(a) The Court is reasonably well satisfied that the testimony given by a material witness is false, (b) That without it the jury might have reached a different conclusion, (c) That the party seeking the new trial was taken by surprise when the false testimony was given and was unable to meet it or did not know of its falsity until after the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">24 F.2d at 87-88. Critically, as is the case with any multi-factor test, failure to satisfy one element \u201cis a sufficient basis to deny a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Jasin, </em>280 F.3d 355, 365 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cAlthough it may be advisable for a district court to analyze each prong of the <em>Iannelli </em>test after finding that one factor has not been met, such an analysis of the remaining factors is not required.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In denying Jackson\u2019s motion, the District Court wrote: \u201cThe trial evidence against defendant is overwhelming as to the number of witnesses, corroborating testimony, and physical evidence such that the jury\u2019s verdict would most likely have been the same [][w]ithout the allegedly challenged testimony.\u201d Irrespective of the case to which the district court cited in support of its subsequent holding that Jackson was unable to meet \u201cany of the required prongs for a new trial based upon false testimony,\u201d the court\u2019s articulation of the standard for assessing the likely impact on the jury\u2019s verdict was consistent with <em>Iannelli. </em>Indeed, the <em>Larrison </em>standard is less stringent on this front than is the <em>Iannelli </em>standard \u2014 rather than having to demonstrate newly discovered evidence would \u201cprobably produce an acquittal,\u201d a defendant whose motion is being governed by <em>Larrison </em>need only show that, without the benefit of materially false testimony, the jury \u201cmight have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Compare Iannelli, </em>528 F.2d at 1292 <em>with Larrison, </em>24 F.2d at 87-88. Newly discovered evidence \u201clikely\u201d to have no effect on a jury\u2019s guilty verdict necessarily would not \u201cprobably produce an acquittal.\u201d Therefore, we conclude the court employed the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The court\u2019s denial of Jackson\u2019s motions for a new trial fell within the proper exercise of its discretionary powers. Notwithstanding Jackson\u2019s post-verdict submissions, the court concluded the \u201coverwhelming ... number of witnesses, corroborating testimony, and physical evidence\u201d proving Jackson\u2019s complicity in the trafficking scheme were sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The court correctly conducted a credibility determination as part of its inquiry, <em>see United States v. Kelly, </em>539 F.3d 172, 189 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cTo make a determination under <em>[Iannelli\u2019s </em>probability-of-acquittal] standard, the district court cannot view the proffered testimony in a vacuum; it must weigh the testimony against all of the other evidence in the record, including the evidence already weighed and considered by the jury in the defendant\u2019s first trial.\u201d), and it properly regarded the \u201cpurported recantation[s]\u201d with a healthy measure of skepticism, <em>see Landano, </em>856 F.2d at 572. The court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on Jackson\u2019s motions for a new trial. <em>United States v. Herman, </em>614 F.2d 369, 372 (3d Cir.1980). Having presided over the trial and being intimately familiar with the record, the court was well-situated to rule on the implications of Jackson\u2019s belated submissions, <em>see United States v. Marino, </em>868 F.2d 549, 557 (3d Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Provenzano, </em>521 F.Supp. 403, 408 (D.N.J.1981), and it did not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing, <em>see United States v. Hines, </em>628 F.3d 101, 104 (3d Cir.2010) (setting forth the standard of review)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jackson\u2019s motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Next, Jackson contends the government\u2019s failure to correct false testimony deprived him of his right to a fair trial. <em>See Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959). After closely reviewing Jackson\u2019s submissions, however, the District Court concluded Jackson had produced \u201cno competent evidence\u201d tending to show the prosecution had procured its conviction through \u201cactive ... misconduct and impropriety, including perjurious testimony.\u201d For largely the same reasons outlined above, we agree with the District Court\u2019s finding. We therefore conclude Jackson\u2019s due process rights were not violated, and we will deny his appeal for relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction over the court\u2019s final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
