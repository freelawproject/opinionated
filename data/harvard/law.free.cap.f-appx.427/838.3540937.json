(\u201cRoadway\u201d) and International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 769 (\u201cunion\u201d) petition for review of a final National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) ruling. Because we conclude that (1) issue preclusion does not bar the General Counsel of the NLRB (\u201cGeneral Counsel\u201d) from pursuing a claim against Roadway, and (2) substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s conclusions that the union breached its duty of fair representation (\u201cDFR\u201d) towards Amadeo Bianchi and that Roadway violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by discharging Bianchi, we deny appellants\u2019 petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">In October 2001, Gerome Daniels, a former Roadway employee, was admitted into a hospital after he experienced chest pain while unloading a Roadway trailer. A few days later Daniels informed his union steward, Bianchi, that he had been injured at work. Bianchi helped Daniels file an injury claim. After investigation of the claim, Roadway discharged Bianchi because it believed he assisted Daniels in filing a fraudulent worker\u2019s compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Daniels and Bianchi grieved their discharges in union arbitration hearings; both were represented by union agent Donald Man\u2019. Marr and Bianchi were longstanding political rivals within the union, having run against each other for office six times and having twice appeared before a union master to settle campaign disputes. Notwithstanding their apparent enmity, when at the end of the arbitration hearing the committee asked Bianchi whether the union had represented him properly and fully, Bianchi answered in the affirmative. Bianchi states in his briefs on appeal that he did so because he wanted to return to work without further delay. Without stating its reasoning, the arbitration committee denied both Daniels\u2019s and Bianchi\u2019s grievances and upheld their discharges from Roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Bianchi then filed unfair labor practices claims against Roadway and the union in a private lawsuit before a federal district court. The jury found in favor of Bianchi on his DFR claim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but this Court reversed, granting Roadway\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Bianchi v. Roadway Exp., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We reasoned that Bianchi had waived any claim that Marr represented him in bad faith by failing to raise it before the arbitration committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">The General Counsel then filed before the NLRB an unfair labor practice complaint against Roadway and the union, asserting that Bianchi was wrongfully discharged on the basis of protected union activities and that the union breached its DFR towards Bianchi during his grievance proceedings. In March 2008, the ALJ dismissed the DFR claim against the union and upheld Bianchi\u2019s discharge from Roadway. On review, the NLRB (1) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that issue preclusion did not bar the General Counsel from as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>serting a breach of the DFR as a basis for declining to defer to the arbitration results; (2) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings that the arbitration results were not the product of a fair and regular proceeding and that Roadway violated section 8 of the NLRA by discharging Bianchi; and (3) reversed the ALJ\u2019s finding that the union had not breached its DFR toward Bianchi. Accordingly, the NLRB awarded Bianchi seven years of backpay and ordered Roadway to reinstate him. Roadway and the union now petition for review of the NLRB decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We must accept the NLRB\u2019s findings with respect to questions of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Fla. Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>587 F.2d 735, 745 (5th Cir.1979) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). While this Court will not act as a mere enforcement arm of the NLRB, <em>see BE &amp; K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, </em>133 F.3d 1372, 1375 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam), we will not substitute our own judgment for the NLRB\u2019s choice between two reasonable positions. <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The threshold question is whether issue preclusion operates to bar the General Counsel from pursuing its DFR claim against Roadway in light of this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bianchi, </em>441 F.3d 1278, that Bianchi waived it. For issue preclusion to apply, both cases must involve the same parties or their privies. <em>See EEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc. (\u201cPemco\u201d), </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). Whether a party is in privity with another for purposes of issue preclusion is a question of fact that we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We have noted that the requirement of privity is \u201cparticularly important where the party in the second action is a governmental agency reposed with independent statutory power to enforce the law and having independent interests not shared by a private party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Congress vested the General Counsel with the independent authority to enforce the NLRA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(d). Similarly, section 10(a) of the NLRA states that the NLRB\u2019s authority to prevent unfair labor practices \u201cshall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, law or otherwise....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a). Further, the NLRB has independent interests\u2014 while Bianchi\u2019s interest is in seeking reinstatement and damages for the personal harm resulting from his discharge, the NLRB represents the \u201cpublic[\u2019s] interest in effectuating the policies of the federal labor laws, not the wrong done the individual employee\u201d when \u201cfashioning unfair labor practice remedies.\u201d <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 182 n. 8, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). To put it another way, the NLRB\u2019s interest is in protecting the workforce as a whole by pursuing remedies that will deter future unfair labor practices. Whether those remedies would fully redress Bianchi\u2019s individual injuries is irrelevant in this case. Thus, we conclude that the General Counsel of the NLRB and Bianchi were not in privity for purposes of invoking issue preclusion. <em>See Pemco, </em>383 F.3d 1280 at 1283 (holding that the district court erred by applying issue preclusion against the EEOC where employer had prevailed in a separate lawsuit brought by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>a number of individual plaintiffs alleging racial harassment).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Next, we consider the record as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that the union breached its DFR towards Bianchi, despite a union arbitration decision to the contrary. Notwithstanding Bianchi\u2019s statement at the end of the arbitration hearing that he believed Marr had represented him \u201cproperly and fully,\u201d the NLRB concluded that Marr had \u201callowed his personal animosity towards Bianchi to undermine his defense of Bianchi\u2019s grievance .... \u201d The NLRB further stated that \u201cthe record demonstrates that Marr acted in bad faith ... by deliberately misleading the [arbitration c]ommittee about crucial matters.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">\u201cA breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. at 190, 87 S.Ct. 903. The burden to establish a breach of DFR is \u201ca substantial one.\u201d <em>Harris v. Schwerman Trucking Co., </em>668 F.2d 1204, 1206 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting another source). Further, mere negligence is never sufficient to sustain a claim for breach of the DFR. <em>Parker v. Connors Steel Co., </em>855 F.2d 1510, 1521 (11th Cir.1988). Nor are simple mistakes of judgment during the representation. <em>Harris, </em>668 F.2d at 1206. In <em>Spielberg Manufacturing Co., </em>112 NLRB 1080, 1082 (1955), the NLRB explained that deference to an arbitration decision is warranted only where \u201cthe proceedings appear to have been fair and regular, all parties had agreed to be bound, and the decision of the arbitration panel is not clearly repugnant to the purposes and polices of the [NLRA].\u201d The NLRB has refused to defer to an arbitration where it found a breach of the DFR, a conflict of interest, or hostility between the union and grievants. <em>See Tubari Ltd., Inc., </em>287 NLRB 1273, 1273-74 &amp; n. 4 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Here, substantial evidence in the record supports the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that Marr\u2019s representation of Bianchi was in bad faith. The NLRB found that Bianchi failed to disclose exculpatory information that would have aided Bianchi and that Marr purposefully persuaded the arbitration committee that Bianchi believed Daniels\u2019s injury was not work-related but encouraged him to file it as such anyway. After careful review of the record and having heard oral argument on the matter, we hold that substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that the union breached its DFR towards Bianchi in violation of section 8(b)(1)(A) of the NLRA. Thus, the NLRB did not err by refusing to defer to the arbitration committee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">And finally, we consider the record as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s finding that Roadway violated section 8(a)(1) of the NRLA, \u00a7 158(a)(1), by discharging Bianchi. The ALJ found that Roadway believed that Bianchi knowingly helped Daniels file a fraudulent work-injury report. The ALJ also found that Bianchi believed that report to be truthful and therefore had not engaged in misconduct in the course of his protected union-steward activities. Agreeing with the ALJ, the NLRB stated that \u201c[t]he credited testimony establishes that Daniels told Bianchi that he was injured at work.\u201d Thus, the NLRB concluded that Bianchi was acting within the scope of his protected union-steward activities when assisting Daniels.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">An employer\u2019s conduct violates section 8(a)(1) of the NRLA if it has a reasonable tendency to interfere with employees\u2019 section 7 right to \u201cform, join or assist labor organizations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 157; \u00a7 158(a)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The Supreme Court has said that an employer violates section 8(a)(1) where \u201cthe discharged employee was at the time engaged in a protected activity, that the employer knew it was such, that the basis of the discharge was an alleged act of misconduct in the course of that activity, and the employee was not, in fact, guilty of that misconduct.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Burnup &amp; Sims, Inc., </em>379 U.S. 21, 23, 85 S.Ct. 171, 13 L.Ed.2d 1 (1964). An employer acts unlawfully by discharging an employee for misconduct arising out of protected activity when it is shown that the misconduct never occurred, despite the employer\u2019s honest belief that it did. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 85 S.Ct. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We conclude that substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole supports the NLRB\u2019s conclusion. Despite Roadway\u2019s honest belief that Bianchi had engaged in misconduct, it violated section 8 by discharging him on the basis of protected union-steward activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Roadway\u2019s and the union\u2019s petitions for review and enforce in full the order of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, CROSS-APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">.
