Davis appeals his convictions after pleading guilty under a plea agreement to being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possessing a stolen firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(jj).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges the district court\u2019s denial, in part, of his motion to suppress evidence, contending that the court erred in finding that probable cause existed to arrest him for opening or consuming an alcoholic beverage within 100 feet of a store selling such beverages in package form, in violation of Atlanta Code \u00a7 10-7(a). He argues that because there was no probable cause for that arrest, the two guns discovered on his person during a search incident to his arrest and the post-Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> statements he made to law enforcement agents were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">At the suppression hearing before the magistrate judge, the government called Senior Officer Christopher Lanier of the Atlanta Police Department to testify about the circumstances of Davis\u2019 arrest. Lanier, who is assigned to a street-level police drug unit, stated that he and three fellow officers had been patrolling one of them regular areas when they pulled into the parking lot of a commercial shopping center. Lanier saw several people, including Davis, standing in front of the \u201cOld Simpson Road Store,\u201d a package store. The group was drinking, and Lanier focused on Davis, who was some 20 to 30 yards away and holding a \u201clong, slender\u201d colored-glass bottle, which was \u201cpretty obviously]\u201d a beer, \u201ca Heineken or something like that.\u201d On cross-examination Lanier confirmed that he had seen Davis put the bottle \u201cup to his lips\u201d and that it \u201clooked like he was drinking it.\u201d According to Lanier, when Davis saw the police car, he \u201chad a very extreme reaction,\u201d and turned around quickly and walked into the store. Leaving his police car, Lanier ordered Davis to come back outside, intending to arrest him for violating the Atlanta ordinance forbidding consumption of alcohol within 100 feet of a package store. Davis complied, and Lanier grabbed one of Davis\u2019 arms in order to handcuff him. At that point Lanier felt a gun in one of Davis\u2019 pockets. After a full pat-down, Lanier found a second gun in another pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Davis also testified at the suppression hearing, asserting that the bottle he was seen with was actually a Sharp\u2019s \u201cNonAlcoholic Beer\u201d; that he had not had a chance to drink from it before he was arrested; and that he did not turn and run back to the store after he saw the police. In his version of events, he never saw the police until Lanier summoned him back outside to arrest him. Davis claims he had gone back in the store as the police arrived only because he was told there was a telephone call for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The actual bottle Davis was seen with was not entered into evidence at the hearing or preserved by the police. One other police officer and an investigator for the Federal Public Defender\u2019s office testified, and the parties then submitted briefs to the court. The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation concluded that Lanier and the other officers had probable cause to arrest Davis on the Atlanta code violation and that the resulting search incident to arrest, which had revealed the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>firearms, was thus not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqj\">[T]he evidence shows that Defendant was drinking or about to drink what to all appearances was a beer. Even if the Court accepts Defendant\u2019s testimony that the beer was nonalcoholic, it was still a beer, and only by a careful examination of the bottle could the officer have discovered it was \u201cnonalcoholic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An5\">The magistrate judge further noted that even the photograph of a Sharp\u2019s beer label that Davis had used as an exhibit at the hearing indicated that Sharp\u2019s contained \u201cless than 0.5 <em>% </em>alcohol\u201d and was not, therefore, \u201ccompletely nonalcoholic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, oveiTuling Davis\u2019 objections and denying his motion to suppress the guns and post-<em>Miranda </em>statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we employ a mixed standard of review: we accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and consider <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts. <em>United States v. Gil, </em>204 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Talley, </em>108 F.3d 277, 281 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that our review of findings of historical fact is \u201conly for clear error and [we] give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers\u201d) (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). When considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the district court, which as to the issue here, was the government. <em>See United States v. Hromada, </em>49 F.3d 685, 688 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\u201cFor probable cause to exist, an arrest must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1305 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and ellipsis omitted) \u201cBecause sufficient probability,, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, probable cause itself is a doctrine of reasonable probability and not certainty.\u201d <em>Craig v. Singletary, </em>127 F.3d 1030, 1042 (11th Cir.1997) (en banc) (quotations and citation omitted) (addressing a federal habeas petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find no error, let alone a clear one, in the district court\u2019s findings of fact. And we conclude that given those facts, Officer Lanier had an objectively reasonable belief, based on the totality of the circumstances, that Davis had violated Atlanta Code \u00a7 10-7(a). Because the arrest was legal, the warrantless search incident to it, during which the firearms were discovered, was valid. Finally, because the district court did not err in finding probable cause, we decline to address Davis\u2019 argument that the <em>post-Miranda </em>statements he made to law enforcement officers were inadmissible because they were tainted by an illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">.
