Taylor was convicted of one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and sentenced to 77 months in prison. Subsequently, the Sentencing Commission approved Amendment 706, which together with Amendment 713, retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Taylor filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking a reduction in his sentence on the basis of Amendment 706. The district court denied the motion, relying on the holding in <em>United States v. Peveler, </em>359 F.3d 369 (6th Cir.2004), which stated that, \u201cabsent an agreement of the parties,\u201d the plain language of Rule 11(c)(1)(C) did not permit alteration of the agreed sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), despite the retroactivity of the amendment at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">Taylor appealed the district court\u2019s denial, challenging this court\u2019s holding in <em>Peveler. </em>During the pendency of the appeal, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in another case from this circuit addressing the same issue raised by Taylor and also relying on Peveler\u2019s holding to deny relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>See United States v. Goins, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 1 (6th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court recently issued its decision, reversing this court\u2019s decision and remanding the case for further proceedings. <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). Although there was no majority opinion in <em>Freeman, </em>Taylor\u2019s case is still controlled by even the most narrow interpretation of the case\u2019s holding as advanced by the concurrence. Here, as in <em>Freeman, </em>Taylor\u2019s recommended sentence was both imposed in light of and expressly tied to the Guidelines sentencing range in which his sentence fell, and it was that range that was lowered by Amendment 706. <em>See id. </em>at 2694; <em>id. </em>at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Accordingly, we remand Taylor\u2019s case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
