Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Singh failed to establish that he was targeted by police on account of a protected ground. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.2004) (petitioner has the burden of showing a purported criminal investigation has no bona fide objective). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See id. </em>at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Singh failed to establish it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">We lack jurisdiction over Singh\u2019s due process claim because he failed to exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (curable procedural defects must be raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
