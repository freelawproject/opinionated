The district court entered an order granting summary judgment against Elmore on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>23, 2009, 2009 WL 3060402. That same day the court entered final judgment dismissing Elmore\u2019s case. A few days later Elmore filed a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment. On November 6, 2009, the district court entered an order denying Elmore\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment, but apparently did not send Elmore notice of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">In January 2010 Elmore requested an update on the status of his motion to alter or amend. On January 13, 2010, the district court responded and informed Elmore that his motion had been denied more than two months earlier in the November 6 order. Elmore filed a motion for leave to file an out of time notice of appeal under Rule 4(a)(6) dated January 13, 2010, requesting that the district court reopen his time to appeal due to his lack of notice of the November 6 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Along with that motion Elmore filed a proposed notice of appeal, which indicated that Elmore desired to appeal from the final judgment and, construing the <em>pro se </em>notice liberally, the order denying his motion to alter or amend that judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied his motion, holding that it could \u201cfind no interpretation of [Rule] 4(a)(6) that would allow a district court to reopen the time to file a notice of appeal based on a failure to receive notice that a [motion to alter or amend the judgment] was denied.\u201d Elmore moved the court to reconsider, which the district court also denied. Elmore then filed this appeal, essentially contending that the district court erred in its interpretation of Rule 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Although we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen the time to appeal under Rule 4(a)(6) only for an abuse of discretion, <em>see McDaniel v. Moore, </em>292 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.2002), we review de novo a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s interpretation of federal procedural rules,\u201d <em>Vencor Hosps., Inc. v. Standard Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">If a party fails to file a notice of appeal within the 30-day period required by Rule 4(a)(1), Rule 4(a)(6) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">(A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice ... of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">(B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 14 days after the moving party receives notice ... of the entry, whichever is earlier; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">Fed. R App. P. 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">The district court denied Elmore\u2019s motions to reopen his time to appeal without reaching the merits of his motion be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>cause it interpreted Rule 4(a)(6) not to allow a court to reopen an order denying a motion to alter or amend the judgment. That interpretation was incorrect. The language of Rule 4(a)(6) does not restrict its application to the entry of a final judgment. Fed R.App. P. 4(a)(6) (\u201cThe district court may reopen the time to file an appeal ... but only if ... the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice ... of the entry of the judgment <em>or order </em>sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry [and] the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or <em>order </em>is entered .... \u201d (emphasis added)). Because Elmore alleged that he did not receive the order denying his motion to alter or amend within 21 days of its entry and the motion to reopen was filed within 180 days after that order was entered, the district court should have considered the merits of his motion to reopen his time to appeal under Rule 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand to allow the district court to consider the merits of Elmore\u2019s motion to reopen his time to appeal. We express no opinion on whether Elmore has satisfied the requirements of Rule 4(a)(6) that must be met in order to give the district court discretion to reopen the time to appeal from the order denying his motion to alter or amend that judgment. Additionally, we express no opinion on whether any failure to receive notice of an order denying a motion to alter or amend the judgment gives the district court discretion under Rule 4(a)(6) to allow Elmore to reopen the time to appeal from the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-6\">. We must construe Elmore\u2019s <em>pro se </em>proposed notice of appeal liberally. <em>See Bellizia v. Fla. Dep't of Corr., </em>614 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe construe <em>pro </em>se filings ... liberally.\u201d); <em>KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIn this circuit, it is well settled that an appeal is not lost if a mistake is made in designating the judgment appealed from where it is clear that the overriding intent was effectively to appeal.\u201d). Elmore\u2019s proposed notice explicitly referenced the order denying his motion to alter or amend the final judgment in addition to referencing the final judgment itself, and thus evinced an intent to appeal from both the final judgment and the order denying Elmore\u2019s motion to alter or amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
