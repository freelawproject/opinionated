Gillis later asked the court to \u201carrange\u201d an inspection of the prison so he could document certain conditions for his deliberate-indifference claim, and the court denied the request. In subsequent filings, Gillis complained that prison officials set overly severe restrictions on a visit he proposed for an inspector he himself had hired, but a magistrate judge found nothing wrong with the prison\u2019s handling of the matter. Later, the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and Gillis appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-22\">Gillis\u2019s brief on appeal rehashes his claims of retaliation and deliberate indifference, as well as his contention that the district court erroneously \u201crefused\u201d his request for an inspection. But he barely raises any legal challenge to the court\u2019s decision. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Generously construing his brief, we discern one issue. He argues that the court improperly discredited his allegations by determining that he \u201cfailed to submit proposed findings of fact sufficient to put critical issues into dispute.\u201d Gillis, however, misapprehends the court\u2019s statement. The court was commenting not on Gillis\u2019s credibility, but merely his failure to produce evidence raising a genuine dispute over whether his rights were violated, as was his burden at summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); <em>McAllister v. Price, </em>615 F.3d 877, 881 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
