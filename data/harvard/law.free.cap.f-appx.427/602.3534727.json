He contends that the underlying deportation was invalid because the Immigration Judge (IJ) failed to advise him of his eligibility for voluntary departure. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain our decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">An IJ must inform an alien of his or her \u201capparent eligibility\u201d for relief from deportation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.11(a)(2), and \u201c[w]e have repeatedly held that an IJ\u2019s failure to so advise an alien violates due process and can serve as the basis for a collateral attack to a deportation order where ... the order is used as the predicate for an illegal reentry charge under \u00a7 1326,\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>629 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc). Ramirez-Arreola contends that at the time of his deportation hearing, he was eligible for voluntary departure because he could have shown that he was \u201ca person of good moral character\u201d under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e) (repealed 1996). An alien cannot make that showing, however, if he or she \u201cadmits having committed ... acts which constitute the essential elements of ... a violation of ... any law or regulation ... relating to a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3). Because Ramirez-Arreola admitted to selling hashish, he could not have qualified as a person of good moral character and therefore was statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure. Accordingly, even if there were a due process violation, Ramirez-Arreola\u2019s collateral attack fails because he has not established prejudice. <em>See United States v. UbaldoFigueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1050 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
