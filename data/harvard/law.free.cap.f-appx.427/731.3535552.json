Speight pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to one count of conspiracy to commit carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, three counts of carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, and three counts of using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). For these offenses, the district court sentenced Speight to 819 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Speight did not file a direct appeal. Less than one year later, Speight filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that she received ineffective assistance of counsel when her trial attorney failed to consult with her concerning the advisability of appealing either her guilty plea or the sentence imposed. The district court denied her motion, finding that Speight\u2019s attorney was not deficient in failing to consult with Speight about an appeal because, <em>inter alia, </em>no rational defendant in Speight\u2019s position would have wanted to appeal. Speight now appeals the dismissal of her \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>We first note that the Speight does not argue that she specifically requested that her counsel file an appeal. Nevertheless, Speight\u2019s counsel was still constitutionally deficient if he failed in his duty to consult with her regarding an appeal. That constitutional duty is triggered if either (1) a rational defendant in Speight\u2019s position would want to appeal or (2) Speight reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). If Speight\u2019s attorney did perform deficiently, then to succeed in her ineffective assistance of counsel claim Speight must show that she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal, i.e., Speight \u201cmust demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with [her] about an appeal, [s]he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In the \u201cvast majority of cases,\u201d the Supreme Court expects lower courts to find \u201cthat counsel had a duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 120 S.Ct. 1029; <em>see also Thompson v. United States, </em>504 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2007). Factors that help us determine whether a rational defendant would want to appeal include whether there are non-frivolous grounds for appeal, whether the conviction follows a guilty plea, whether the defendant received the sentence she bargained for, and whether the plea agreement waived appellate rights. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029; <em>see also Otero v. United States, </em>499 F.3d 1267, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The government argues that no rational defendant would have wanted an appeal because 57 years of Speight\u2019s sentence was the result of mandatory consecutive sentences for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) offenses, and because Speight pleaded guilty, which ordinarily weighs against a defendant because it indicates that the defendant was interested in \u201cseekfing] an end to judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029. We disagree, and find that the district court clearly erred in finding that no rational defendant would want to appeal Speight\u2019s guilty plea or 819 month sentence. Speight is a mother of two young children, and she received a sentence of roughly 68 years for her first criminal episode. Unlike many defendants, Speight entered a blind guilty plea, thereby preserving her appellate rights. <em>See Otero, </em>499 F.3d at 1271 (holding that \u201con account of the plea agreement\u2019s broad appeal waiver, any appeal taken by Otero would have been frivolous and would have been an appeal that no rational defendant would have taken\u201d); <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (finding that there were no nonfrivolous grounds for appeal because the defendant had pleaded guilty, there was no suggestion the plea was invalid, and the defendant\u2019s plea contained an appeal waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Further, Speight had issues of arguable merit to appeal. Specifically, the court may have committed a Rule 11(b) violation by not clearly advising Speight that the three mandatory minimum sentences for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) offenses would be consecutive to <em>each other. </em>Speight also could have appealed the reasonableness of the discretionary eleven year portion of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Because a rational defendant in Speight\u2019s position would have sought to appeal, Speight\u2019s attorney was under a constitutional obligation to consult Speight about an appeal. <em>See Otero, </em>499 F.3d at 1270. After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge found that Speight\u2019s attorney did not consult with Speight about an appeal, and the district court agreed. These decisions were not clearly erroneous \u2014 Speight\u2019s attorney\u2019s only advice to Speight and her family was that there was nothing to appeal. <em>See Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1207 (\u201cSimply asserting the view that an appeal would not be successful does not constitute \u2018consultation\u2019 in any meaningful sense.\u201d). Instead, adequate consultation requires that an attorney inform a client about her right to appeal, advise the client about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, and make a reasonable effort to determine whether the client wishes to pursue an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1206. Accordingly, Speight\u2019s attorney performed deficiently by not consulting with Speight about an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Finally, we conclude that Speight was prejudiced as a result of counsel failing to consult with her regarding an appeal. There was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult, Speight would have timely appealed. Speight has showed nonfrivolous grounds for appeal, thereby bolstering her contention that she would have appealed if her attorney had consulted with her. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029 (explaining that \u201cshowing nonfrivolous grounds for appeal may give weight to the contention that the defendant would have appealed\u201d). Moreover, like the defendant in <em>Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1208, Speight and her family expressed dissatisfaction with what they perceived as a lengthy sentence. Had counsel consulted adequately with Speight about an appeal, there is a reasonable probability that Speight would have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Speight is entitled to pursue an out-of-time appeal of her conviction and sentence. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Speight\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">.

We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).
