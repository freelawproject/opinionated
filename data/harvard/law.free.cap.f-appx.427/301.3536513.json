Caudill contends that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l)\u2019s cross reference to \u00a7 2G2.1 to obtain his base offense level. He further asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5) and 2G2.1(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 762-63 (5th Cir.2005). The applicable cross reference at issue in this case is triggered if the \u201coffense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(c)(l). The cross reference is to be construed broadly, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2G2.2, comment. (n.5), and the term \u201coffense,\u201d as used in the cross reference includes both charged and uncharged conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(H)) (defining \u201coffense\u201d to include \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The district court properly considered the taking of nude photographs of an underage victim as relevant conduct pursuant to \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) because Caudill\u2019s action was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Ekanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Canada, </em>110 F.3d 260, 264; \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2); \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A), (B)). Furthermore, while taking the illicit photographs, Caudill touched the victim\u2019s vagina, causing harm. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(3). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the cross reference. <em>See Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Likewise, because Caudill\u2019s actions were properly considered relevant conduct and the offense involved sexual contact, the district court did not err in applying a two-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A). <em>See Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d at 763. Moreover, Caudill admitted on several occasions that he actually babysat the victim. Therefore, his objection to the district court\u2019s application of a two-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5) because the minor was in his care or custody is without merit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5), comment. (n.3(A)). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5 Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
