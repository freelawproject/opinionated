On appeal, Johnson contends that the district court imposed a plainly unreasonable sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">We treat sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release and probation similarly and therefore review the sentences imposed in either situation under the same plainly unreasonable standard. <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 655-56 (4th Cir.2007). When a defendant violates terms of his probation, the district court may revoke the probationary period and resentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2006); <em>Moulden, </em>478 F.3d at 657. The district court has broad discretion to impose a probation revocation sentence. <em>Moulden, </em>478 F.3d at 657. Thus, we assume \u201ca deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of [that] discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), and will affirm unless the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d in light of the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-19\">Our first step is to \u201cdecide whether the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. In doing so, \u201cwe follow generally the procedural and substantive considerations\u201d employed in reviewing original sentences. <em>Id,. </em>A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court has considered the policy statements contained in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>id. </em>at 439, and has adequately explained the sentence chosen, though it need not explain the sentence in as much detail as when imposing the original sentence. <em>Moulden, </em>478 F.3d at 657. A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court states a proper basis for its imposition of a sentence up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. If, after considering the above, we determine that the sentence is not unreasonable, we will affirm. <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-20\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the revocation sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Accordingly, we deny Johnson\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
