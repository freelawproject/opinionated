Agents then obtained a warrant to search his home. They found 19.5 grams of heroin, drug paraphernalia, a handgun, and cash. Akins was arrested and charged with possessing heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and the government filed an enhancement information, which raised the maximum prison term for this offense to 30 years, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 851. Akins pleaded guilty and was sentenced within the guidelines range to 188 months. On appeal Akins argues that the district court applied an impermissible presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guidelines range. He additionally contends that the court failed to consider his arguments in mitigation. Because the record does not support Akins\u2019s claims of procedural error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">At sentencing the district court concluded that Akins is a career offender, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), based on two Illinois convictions for a crime of violence and a third Illinois conviction for a controlled substance offense. Akins had pleaded guilty to robbery in 1992 and to aggravated discharge of a firearm in 1993. He served time and was on parole for both offenses when he violated the terms of his parole and was reimprisoned; the sentence for each conviction was fully discharged in 1996. Since that time Akins has been convicted of four drug offenses, as well as domestic battery, aggravated battery, trespass, and unlawful use of a weapon. Even apart from his status as a career offender, Akins\u2019s extensive criminal history places him in Category VI. With his total offense level of 31, Akins faced an imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The district court noted that it had reviewed a handwritten letter from Akins and the sentencing memorandum filed by his lawyer and then listened to both parties\u2019 views about the appropriate sentence. Defense counsel argued for a prison term of 144 months on the premise that Akins\u2019s convictions from 1992 and 1993 \u201cbarely counted as part of his criminal history because of their age. Without those convictions, said counsel, the career-offender guideline would not apply and Akins\u2019s range would be 41 to 51 months. Counsel also observed that Akins\u2019s statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>mum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and his corresponding guidelines range would have been lower if the government had not filed the \u00a7 851 enhancement, which, counsel argued, caused a sentencing disparity among Akins and other defendants convicted of drug crimes. The government replied that a sentence within the guidelines range was necessary to account for Akins\u2019s extensive criminal history, but argued for a term at the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">After listening to the parties, the court explained its conclusion that a guidelines sentence was appropriate in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Mr. Akins, the record that you have amassed is certainly an impressive one. That is your criminal history. Now, there\u2019s no doubt that you have a criminal history number of points at 24. This is almost double a Category VI. Almost double. It\u2019s 13, so that would be 26, you\u2019re just two points off of a double Category VI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Now, the guidelines are just that, guidelines for the sentencing judges. And the record cannot be ignored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">Normally we begin at the middle of the guideline range, go up further if there are aggravating factors, or if there are mitigating factors we go down. So we\u2019re talking a spread here of 188 months to 235. That\u2019s a 47 month spread. And the Government has asked for the minimum under the guidelines, 188. And Mr. Wilmouth on your behalf has asked for 144. That\u2019s 44 months difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">But we simply cannot ignore your background and the criminal history you have presented to us. It can\u2019t be ignored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">So I\u2019m going to sentence you to the minimum number under the guidelines, 188 months. And that is giving you credit for having entered a plea of guilty here. And not put the Government through the expense or the time, or the Court, to a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">The court imposed a sentence of 188 months, and in its written statement of reasons listed \u201cpunishment and deterrence\u201d as further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Akins argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s reference to starting \u201cat the middle of the guidelines range\u201d evidences that the court applied an impermissible presumption of reasonableness to that range. Additionally, Akins insists that the court failed to consider his contentions that the convictions making him a career offender are \u201cstale\u201d and that the \u00a7 851 enhancement created a sentencing disparity between him and other similar defendants. Neither of these appellate claims is substantiated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">As to the first, the record as a whole suggests that the district judge followed the Supreme Court\u2019s admonishment that \u201cthe Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d when calculating a term of imprisonment. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court \u201cmust first calculate the Guidelines range, and then consider what sentence is appropriate for the individual defendant in light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Nelson v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 350, 129 S.Ct. 890, 891-92, 172 L.Ed.2d 719 (2009). In making this determination, a district court \u201cmay not presume that the guidelines range is reasonable,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, but \u201cthe judge will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis,\u201d <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2691, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Despite the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[njormally we begin at the middle of the guideline range,\u201d the rest of the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>script shows that the court did not give undue weight to the guidelines. The court stated that it understood \u201cthe guidelines are just that, guidelines for the sentencing judges.\u201d After calculating the imprisonment range, the court addressed Akins\u2019s request for a sentence that was 44 months below the low end. The court expressed concern about the extent of Akins\u2019s criminal history; if anything, a Category VI criminal history understates Akins\u2019s past crimes, since he had amassed almost double the criminal history points needed to reach Category VI. The court concluded that \u201cwe simply cannot ignore your background and the criminal history you have presented to us,\u201d and then imposed a sentence at the bottom of the range. This explanation shows that the court did not mechanically start in the middle of the range \u2014 if it had, the court would have <em>increased </em>Akins\u2019s sentence from the midpoint based on his extensive criminal history. Instead, the court simply showed awareness of the guidelines range as it weighed but rejected Akins\u2019s arguments for a sentence below that range. <em>See United States v. Kirkpatrick, </em>589 F.3d 414, 416 (7th Cir.2009) (explaining that, before district court exercises discretion to reject Sentencing Commission\u2019s recommendation, \u201cthe judge should know what that recommendation is, and thus how [defendant\u2019s] sentence will compare with the punishment of similar persons elsewhere\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We have characterized as \u201cunobjectionable\u201d a district judge\u2019s acknowledgment that he is exercising his discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by \u201celecting to impose a guideline sentence in [the] particular case unless the defendant could persuade him otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v. Schmitt, </em>495 F.3d 860, 865 (7th Cir.2007). Thus, we will not assume that the judge was impermissibly presuming a guidelines sentence to be reasonable unless the judge said something akin to placing a \u201cthumb on the scale\u201d in favor of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Sachsenmaier, </em>491 F.3d 680, 685 (7th Cir.2007). For example, in <em>United States v. Panice, </em>598 F.3d 426, 441 (7th Cir.2010), we ordered resentencing where the district court had stated that the statutory scheme \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d And in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>635 F.3d 983, 988-89 (7th Cir.2011), we were troubled by the sentencing judge\u2019s speculation that the defendant might gain some relief from a change to the guidelines and by the court\u2019s statement that it was imposing a sentence within the guidelines range \u201cregrettably.\u201d The district court\u2019s comments here, even taken in isolation, do not rise to that level. We have rejected arguments like Akins\u2019s in situations where the sentencing judge concluded that the guidelines were reasonable in the particular case, <em>see United States v. Coopman, </em>602 F.3d 814, 817 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Allday, </em>542 F.3d 571, 573-74 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>533 F.3d 574, 576-77 (7th Cir.2008), or said that it was up to the defendant to show that the guidelines were inappropriate, <em>see United States v. Hurt, </em>574 F.3d 439, 443 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>562 F.3d 866, 872 (7th Cir.2009) (affirming sentence despite judge\u2019s remarks that he had \u201cto go back to the guidelines\u201d and that defendant \u201cbetter tell me why the guidelines are improper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Akins\u2019s additional contention that the district court did not address his arguments in mitigation also fails. A sentencing court must give an adequate statement of reasons, consistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but the need for explanation often is diminished if the court imposes a sentence within the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>631 F.3d 401, 408 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>622 F.3d 739, 744 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>States v. Harris, </em>567 F.3d 846, 853-54 (7th Cir.2009). And mitigating arguments that are clearly without merit or so routine as to be \u201cstock\u201d can be passed over in silence. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Oliveros, </em>639 F.3d 380, 382 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>608 F.3d 340, 347 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Young, </em>590 F.3d 467, 474 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. White, </em>582 F.3d 787, 798 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Tahzib, </em>513 F.3d 692, 694-95 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">This last point applies readily to both of Akins\u2019s pleas for a lower sentence. His contention that his 1992 and 1993 convictions \u201cbarely\u201d counted and thus exaggerated his criminal history category is an example of the \u201cstock\u201d arguments that require no response from a sentencing court. <em>See Garcia-Oliveros, </em>639 F.3d at 382; <em>United States v. Moreno-Padilla, </em>602 F.3d 802, 811-12 (7th Cir.2010); <em>Tahzib, </em>513 F.3d at 694-95. Akins did not object to the use of these convictions in the presentence report, nor should he have; because his incarceration for those convictions extended until 1996, he served his terms of imprisonment within 15 years of the commencement of his May 2010 offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l); <em>Moreno-Padilla, </em>602 F.3d at 807-808; <em>United States v. Souffront, </em>338 F.3d 809, 833 (7th Cir.2003). Likewise, Akins\u2019s contention that he should receive a break to compensate for the government\u2019s resort to \u00a7 851 also was too routine to require comment. Akins never challenged the validity of the prior convictions, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c), and the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on those convictions to seek an enhancement under \u00a7 851 did not create an unwarranted disparity, <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 761-62, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997); <em>United States v. Crayton, </em>357 F.3d 560, 572 (6th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>79 F.3d 584, 599-600 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Thus, the district court was not required to explain its rejection of Akins\u2019s arguments in mitigation, but the court did respond anyway. According to Akins, the court \u201cdid not indicate in open court that counsel\u2019s principal arguments were outweighed by the defendant\u2019s criminal history, which was too serious to warrant a variance from the advisory Guideline range.\u201d But the district court did almost precisely that. Akins\u2019s arguments amounted to a contention that the guidelines range overstates his criminal history. And while the district court did not explicitly state that it was addressing this contention, the court relied on Akins\u2019s criminal history to justify the sentence. The court also cited the need for punishment and deterrence in its statement of reasons, which we review along with the sentencing transcript. <em>See United States v. Pape, </em>601 F.3d 743, 747 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>445 F.3d 987, 991-92 (7th Cir.2006). And we can conclude from the record that the court rejected Akins\u2019s arguments for leniency because of his criminal history. <em>See United States v. Curby, </em>595 F.3d 794, 796-97 (7th Cir.2010) (affirming sentence, despite district court\u2019s terse discussion of defendant\u2019s argument in mitigation, where it was \u201capparent from the record\u201d that court rejected defendant\u2019s plea for leniency \u201cbecause of his extensive criminal history\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Akins\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
