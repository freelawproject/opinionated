We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Rodriguez-Flores contends she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution by gangs in Honduras on account of her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Rodriguez-Flores failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Because petitioners failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, their claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Rodriguez-Flores failed to demonstrate it is more likely than not she would be tortured by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official if returned to Honduras. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Rodriguez-Flores\u2019 CAT claim. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 747-48 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ\u2019s credibility-related findings deprived them of a fair hearing, because the BIA evaluated their claim assuming it to be credible. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
