We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Celis\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed more than ten years after the issuance of the August 27, 1997, in absentia order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii), and Celis failed to establish she acted with the due diligence required to warrant tolling of the 180-day filing deadline, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (equitable tolling is available to petitioner who is prevented from filing due to deception, fraud, or error, and exercises due diligence in discovering such circumstances). It follows that Celis\u2019s due process claim fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Celis has waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that she received proper notice of her hearing. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
