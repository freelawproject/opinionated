Thus the appeal is submitted on the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

The complaint is difficult to parse but seems to allege that Poole-Clayton was arrested for a crime she did not commit. The complaint also appears to allege that Poole-Clayton\u2019s pursuit of a remedy in state court has been derailed by \u201cmisconduct\u201d and \u201cdeceit.\u201d The district court dismissed the suit, observing that the complaint \u201cis unintelligible to a significant extent\u201d and fails to state a claim against any of the defendants. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Two months later Poole-Clayton filed a motion to reconsider, but the court refused to disturb the judgment because Poole-Clayton had not raised any \u201cproper\u201d basis. Poole-Clayton then filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In an earlier order we explained that Poole-Clayton\u2019s notice of appeal is not timely as to the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Accordingly we limited our review to the motion for reconsideration. Nevertheless, Poole-Clayton\u2019s appellate brief simply elaborates on her grievances against the Illinois attorney general; it does not mention the motion for reconsideration, much less develop a legal argument why the district court was wrong to deny her relief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). We construe all pro se filings generously, but we may not invent arguments on the litigant\u2019s behalf. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir.2001). Because Poole-Clayton\u2019s brief does not comply with the requirements of Rule 28, we will not entertain her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
