The district court imposed the sentence, which fell at the bottom of the guideline range, after considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that Basoco-Gonzalez had three prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-21\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentencing court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>fendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need' to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">A sentence may be either procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">On review, we conclude that Basoco-Gonzalez\u2019s 46-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. With respect to procedural reasonableness, the district court expressly stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated its reasons for imposing the particular sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). The court was not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">As to substantive reasonableness, the 46-month sentence occupies the bottom of the applicable guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Additionally, this sentence was significantly below the statutory maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Although Basoco-Gonzalez argues that the district court placed undue emphasis on his criminal history, particularly given that his last conviction was in 1998, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). Further, both the statute and the guidelines specially provide an enhanced sentence to deter convicted aggravated felons from re-entering the United States, without regard to the date of prior convictions. <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1160-61 (11th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Based on Basoco-Gonzalez\u2019s three prior felony convictions and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Basoco-Gonzalez to 46-months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
