We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s discovery rulings, <em>Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Evans sent a letter to the district court requesting that the clerk process and serve five enclosed subpoenas to non-parties, which Evans had attempted to mail but were returned to him as undeliverable. In a Notice of Document Discrepancies, the clerk noted that Evans\u2019s request was \u201cnot grantable by Clerk without further direction of the Judge,\u201d and Magistrate Judge Brooks ordered that the letter be rejected and not filed. Evans did not file a motion for the district court to issue a subpoena duces tecum or order a U.S. Marshal to effect proper service, and has not shown any resulting prejudice. Accordingly, his contention that the district court refused to allow him to obtain documentary evidence by rejecting his letter request to the clerk is unpersuasive. <em>See Hallett, </em>296 F.3d at 751 (trial court\u2019s broad discretion \u201cwill not be disturbed except upon the clearest showing that denial of discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(b) (service of subpoenas).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
