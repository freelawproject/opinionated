We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">Mr. Ortiz fractured his left ankle in 1972 while serving on active duty in the U.S. Army. The injury was found to be service connected, and Mr. Ortiz was assigned a disability rating of 10% for residuals associated with that injury. Mr. Ortiz later requested that his disability rating be increased. He also asked to be rated as totally disabled based on individual unemployability (\u201cTDIU\u201d). Following a series of decisions by the regional office, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, and the Veterans Court, the Board issued an order denying Mr. Ortiz\u2019s request for an increase in rating and remanding Mr. Ortiz\u2019s TDIU claim to the regional office. The Board explained that the medical evidence of record and the veteran\u2019s self-reported evaluation of his ankle condition all confirmed that the proper rating is 10%. With respect to the TDIU claim, the Board instructed the regional office to consider the combined effect of Mr. Ortiz\u2019s service-connected ankle injury and his diabetes on his ability to maintain gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Mr. Ortiz appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court. The court reviewed the evidence of record and concluded that the Board\u2019s decision to maintain a 10% rating was not clearly erroneous. With respect to the TDIU claim, the court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Mr. Ortiz\u2019s appeal because that claim had been remanded to the regional office. Finally, the court held that the Secretary had complied with the notice requirements of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (\u201cVCAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">This court has limited jurisdiction to consider appeals from the Veterans Court. We have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof [by the Veterans Court] ..., and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Except to the extent that a veteran\u2019s appeal presents a constitutional issue, we may not review challenges to factual determinations or challenges to the application of a law to the facts of a partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ular case. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Nearly all of Mr. Ortiz\u2019s assertions of error are outside of this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, we do not review the merits of those claims; as to the only issue over which we have jurisdiction, we uphold the decision of the Veterans Court and affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Ortiz\u2019s contention that the evidence of record, including medical reports and Mr. Ortiz\u2019s social security disability records, required the Secretary to increase his disability rating. That is a pure question of fact. We also lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Ortiz\u2019s argument that the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule requires judgment in his favor. Neither the Board nor the Veterans Court interpreted the statute codifying that rule, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b). The \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d rule applies only when the evidence in support of and against the veteran\u2019s claim is approximately balanced; it has no application to cases such as this one, in which the Board found that a preponderance of the evidence supports maintenance of the 10% rating. <em>See Fagan v. Shinseki, </em>573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]he benefit of the doubt doctrine has no application where the Board determined that the preponderance of the evidence weights against the veteran\u2019s claim or when the evidence is not in equipoise.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Mr. Ortiz faults the Board for failing to articulate the reasons supporting its decision. The Veterans Court concluded that the Board\u2019s explanation of its decision was satisfactory, and we lack jurisdiction to review that determination. Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the Secretary provided Mr. Ortiz with the notice required by the VCAA. <em>See Conway v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2004) (assessing the Board\u2019s compliance with the notice provisions of the VCAA in a particular case is a review of the application of law to fact and is therefore outside of this court\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The Veterans Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review Mr. Ortiz\u2019s appeal related to TDIU benefits. The Veterans Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to reviewing \u201cdecisions\u201d made by the Board. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a). To constitute a reviewable \u201cdecision,\u201d the Board\u2019s order must either grant or deny the veteran\u2019s request for relief. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(d)(2); <em>Kirkpatrick v. Nicholson, </em>417 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir.2005). Here, the Board\u2019s remand order directed the regional office to consider the merits of Mr. Ortiz\u2019s request for a TDIU rating. That order did not grant or deny relief to Mr. Ortiz, and it is therefore not a \u201cdecision\u201d within the meaning of the Veterans Court\u2019s jurisdictional statute. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>417 F.3d at 1364. We have jurisdiction to review the Veterans Court\u2019s decision on that issue, and we sustain the court\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction over the TDIU claim, as that decision is plainly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Mr. Ortiz states that he is entitled to disability compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) and a number of other conditions. That issue does not appear to have been raised before the Board or the Veterans Court, and we cannot consider it in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Finally, Mr. Ortiz suggests that the Veterans Court and the DVA have acted out of racial animus. He has pointed to no evidence in support of that argument. His vague allegations do not rise to the level of a non-frivolous constitutional issue that would fall within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"Apr\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
