De La Rosa\u2019s Complaint alleged violations of both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court (Yanthis, <em>M.J.) </em>awarded USPS summary judgment on the Rehabilitation Act claims and dismissed the Title VII claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">On appeal, De La Rosa challenges only the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his Rehabilitation Act claims. We therefore need not address the other aspects of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Bogle-Assegai v. Connecticut, </em>470 F.3d 498, 504 (2d Cir.2006). We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., </em>582 F.3d 268, 274 (2d Cir.2009). Rehabilitation Act claims are analyzed under the familiar three-step burden-shifting framework laid out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Reg\u2019l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, </em>294 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir.2002). The plaintiff bears the initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 48-49. To carry that burden, \u201ca plaintiff must prove,\u201d among other things, that \u201che is an individual with a disability.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amico v. City of New York, </em>132 F.3d 145, 150 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). At the time of the events in question, the Rehabilitation Act defined the phrase \u201cindividual with a disability\u201d to include employees who are \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled by their employer. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(B)(iii) (2000). Therefore, employees perceived as having \u201ca physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities\u201d are considered \u201cindividuals] with a disability\u201d under the Rehabilitation Act, regardless of whether they are actually disabled. <em>Reg\u2019l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, </em>294 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">De La Rosa has abandoned any claim that he was actually disabled. <em>See Bogle-Assegai, </em>470 F.3d at 504. His only argument on appeal is that, after his injury, USPS perceived him as disabled and discriminated against him on that basis by terminating his employment at the conclusion of his probationary period. That argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">It is undisputed that De La Rosa\u2019s doctors, his employer, and even De La Rosa himself anticipated a fast and full recovery from his back injury. In fact, De La Rosa was able to complete his route on the very day that he was injured, and USPS appears to have offered De La Rosa an opportunity to begin a new probationary period once his back healed. A \u201ctemporary impairment\u201d lasting only a few months is, \u201cby itself, too short in duration ... to be substantially limiting.\u201d <em>Adams v. Citizens Advice Bureau, </em>187 F.3d 315, 316-17 (2d Cir.1999) (internal alteration and quotation marks omitted). Because De La Rosa offers no evidence that USPS believed his injury to be anything other than a temporary setback requiring (at most) a short-term reduction in duties, no reasonable jury could conclude that USPS perceived De La Rosa as disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">De La Rosa\u2019s only evidence comes from his supervisor\u2019s signature on a claim for continuation of pay form indicating that De La Rosa was \u201cdisabled [from] work.\u201d But, as USPS points out and De La Rosa does not contest, the form in question refers to disability under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), which defines \u201cdisabled\u201d in terms substantially broader than its definition under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Compare </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.5(f) (defining disability under FECA as \u201cthe incapacity ... to earn the wages the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ployee was receiving at the time of injury\u201d) <em>with </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(A)(i) (2000) (defining disability for Rehabilitation Act purposes as a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d that \u201cconstitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Rolland v. Potter, </em>492 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that Congress adopted broader language to define disability for workers\u2019 compensation purposes than the \u201cmore demanding definition of \u2018disability\u2019 \u201d in the Rehabilitation Act). Therefore, this evidence says nothing about whether USPS perceived De La Rosa as disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, the only statute relevant to this case. De La Rosa also notes that his treating physicians indicated that he had a \u201cpartial disability,\u201d but that was also in the context of De La Rosa\u2019s claim for continuation of pay under FECA. In any event, what matters is not what De La Rosa\u2019s doctors thought, but what USPS thought, and the record reveals no evidence that USPS perceived De La Rosa as disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We have considered all of De La Rosa\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-13\"> The parlies\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal inconsistently capitalize Mr. De La Rosa\u2019s name. We have adopted the capitalization used by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
