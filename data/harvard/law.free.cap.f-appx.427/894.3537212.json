Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Eddie Howard\u2019s appeal from the United States Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>peals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>Howard v. Shinseki, </em>08-3512, 2010 WL 3075286, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Howard served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 1967 until his dishonorable discharge in March 1970. In May 1979, a Department of Veterans Affairs regional office (RO) denied Howard entitlement to disability benefits for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on his discharge status. Although that determination became final when Howard failed to perfect his appeal with the Board, the matter was reopened in 2004 after Howard had submitted new and material evidence. In light of the full evidence of record, the RO awarded Howard entitlement to service-connected disability benefits for his PTSD and changed his status to honorably discharged. The RO assigned the effective date of his award as January 28, 2002 \u2014 the date of receipt of his claim to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Seeking an earlier effective date, Howard argued that the May 1979 RO decision denying him benefits based on his discharge status should be revised because it rested on clear and unmistaken error (CUE). The Board of Veterans\u2019 Affairs denied that request on the basis that the change in discharge status did not rest on a clear legal error but rather a reweighing all of the facts and evidence now of record. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Although Howard seeks this court\u2019s review in order to grant his request to award him an earlier effective date, this court\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is limited. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292; <em>Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">In light of this court\u2019s jurisdictional limitations, we must dismiss Howard\u2019s appeal. Howard\u2019s informal brief does not make any argument that his appeal involves the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation. Howard also admits that his appeal does not involve any constitutional issue that this court may have authority to review. To the extent that Howard argues that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims misapplied the law of CUE to the facts of his case, that challenge is also outside of this court\u2019s limited jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
