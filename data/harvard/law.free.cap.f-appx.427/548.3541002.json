Counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">We conclude that the district court committed no procedural error in sentencing Chapelli-Pedroso, and imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (in reviewing sentence, appellate court first ensures that district court committed no significant procedural error, and then considers substantive reasonableness of sentence under abuse-of-discretion standard; if sentence is within Guidelines range, appellate court may apply presumption of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Valadez, </em>573 F.3d 553, 556 (8th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (sentence at bottom of Guidelines range is presumed reasonable). Nothing in the record indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>cates that the district court failed to consider a relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factor, gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or committed a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (describing ways in which court might abuse its discretion at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-15\">. The Honorable Linda R.
