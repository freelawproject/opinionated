On appeal, Cortes challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">A. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Cortes\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Paragraph 11 of the PSI recommended a sixteen-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), because Cortes was previously deported after being convicted of a felony that is a crime of violence. Paragraph 28 of the PSI outlined the details of the prior convictions supporting the sixteen-level enhancement, which consisted of two counts of battery on a police officer and one count of resisting an officer with violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">According to paragraph 28, on September 11, 2005, Cortes (at age sixteen) crawled under a bathroom stall in a bar and robbed a man at knife-point. The robbery victim reported the crime to the bar manager. A police officer confronted Cortes as he entered a pickup truck. Cortes became violent, shoved the officer and fled into a nearby cemetery. An hour and a half later, the officer found Cortes crawling on the ground behind the truck, and Cortes fled again. As officers apprehended Cortes, Cortes punched an officer in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Although the resulting charges initially were filed in juvenile court, on October 3, 2005, Cortes\u2019s case was transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>criminal division of the Florida Circuit Court, where Cortes was charged as an adult. On February 9, 2006, the criminal court withheld adjudication (on his two battery offenses and one resisting an officer with violence offense) and sentenced Cortes as a youthful offender to 364 days in jail, followed by two years of probation. After Cortes completed his jail term and probation, Cortes was removed to Mexico on October 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">B. Objection to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Cortes objected to the sixteen-level enhancement in paragraph 11 of the PSI. Cortes argued that his withheld adjudications did not count as adult convictions for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because the Florida Circuit Court sentenced him as a youthful offender. Cortes did not object to paragraph 28 of the PSI or dispute the facts relating to the withheld adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">During the sentencing hearing, Cortes admitted that his criminal charges were transferred for prosecution to \u201cadult court,\u201d i.e., the criminal division of the Florida Circuit Court. Cortes submitted copies of records from the Florida Circuit Court relating to the charges. The \u201cFinding of Guilt and Order of Withholding Adjudication/Special Conditions,\u201d dated February 27, 2006, stated that, upon a guilty plea, Cortes was found guilty of, <em>inter alia, </em>two counts of \u201cBATTERY/ POLICE OFFICER/FIREFIGHTER/INTAKE OFFICER,\u201d and one count of \u201cRESISTING OFFICER WITH VIOLENCE TO HIS PERSON,\u201d which were third degree felonies. After finding that \u201cthe defendant is not likely to engage in a criminal course of conduct and that the ends of justice and welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by law,\u201d the state court ordered that the adjudication of guilty be withheld.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">A separate Florida Circuit Court order, also dated February 27, 2006 and denominated \u201cSentence,\u201d stated that, after \u201chaving been adjudicated guilty herein\u201d and the Florida Circuit Court \u201chaving given the defendant an opportunity to be heard and to offer matters in mitigation of [the] sentence,\u201d Cortes was \u201ccommitted to the custody of the Dade County Jail (Youthful Offender)\u201d and was \u201csentenced as a youthful offender in accordance with F.S. 958.04\u201d to a term of 364 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">After reviewing the language of the Youthful Offender Act and the Florida Circuit Court records, the district court concluded that Cortes\u2019s withheld adjudications were \u201cadult conviction[s].\u201d The district court stressed that the case was transferred to the criminal division of the Florida Circuit Court and that the Youthful Offender Act merely gave that adult court \u201cmore options to treat a youthful offender more leniently than\u201d someone who was older.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Cortes next argued that his withheld adjudications for two battery offenses and one resisting an officer with violence offense were not crimes of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The district court overruled Cortes\u2019s objection, finding, based on its reading of the PSI, that Cortes\u2019s offenses of battery on an officer and resisting an officer with violence involved more than an innocuous touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guidelines calculations, which resulted in an advisory guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a 57-month sentence. Cortes filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">A. Adult Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Section 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a sixteen-level increase in the defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was previously deported after certain kinds of felony convictions, including a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The enhancement \u201cdoes not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was eighteen years of age unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. l(A)(iv).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Here, we conclude that Cortes\u2019s withheld adjudications are \u201cadult convictions\u201d under Florida law. First, Florida law defines a \u201cconviction\u201d as \u201ca determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or a trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.0021(2). Thus, the fact that Cortes\u2019s adjudications were withheld did not prevent application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Second, under Florida\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law, adult criminal convictions occur in the criminal division of the state\u2019s Circuit Courts. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 900.03. Under Florida\u2019s Juvenile Justice Act, adjudications of law violations by children under the age of 18 occur in the juvenile court (i.e., the juvenile division of the Circuit Courts) \u201cunless, in compliance with the Act, juvenile jurisdiction is waived or the juvenile falls under a statutory exception.\u201d <em>State v. Griffith, </em>675 So.2d 911, 912-13 (Fla.1996); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 985.0301(1) (conferring jurisdiction), \u00a7 985.35 (providing for adjudicatory hearings in juvenile court). Florida law provides several ways the criminal case of a child fourteen or older may be transferred from juvenile court to adult court for prosecution. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 985.556-985.56 (providing for transfer to adult court by voluntary and involuntary waiver and for direct filing of an information in adult court for certain offenses). It is undisputed that Cortes\u2019s criminal case began in the juvenile court, but was transferred, pursuant to Florida\u2019s Juvenile Justice Act, to the criminal division of the Florida Circuit Court for adult prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Third, we agree with the district court that the Florida Youthful Offender Act, Florida Statutes \u00a7 958.04, does not negate a juvenile\u2019s adult conviction in the criminal division of a Florida Circuit Court. <em>See United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that prior Florida convictions supported U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement and application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), despite sentencing as a youthful offender because defendant was sentenced in adult court and was otherwise treated as an adult criminal).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 958.04 gives the criminal division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Florida Circuit Court the discretion to sentence eligible defendants who are under 21 years of age as \u201cyouthful offender[s].\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 958.04(1). If the Florida Circuit Court decides to sentence a defendant as a youthful offender, \u201c[i]n lieu of other criminal penalties authorized by law,\u201d the court is given an array of alternative sentencing options, such as probation, placement in a community control program, incarceration in county facilities, restitution centers or public or private community residential facilities, and to split sentences between options. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 958.04(2)(a)-(c); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 958.021 (stating that the purpose of the Florida Youthful Offender Act is \u201cto provide an additional sentencing alternative to be used in the discretion of the court when dealing with offenders who have demonstrated that they can no longer be handled safely as juveniles and who require more substantial limitations upon their liberty to ensure the protection of society\u201d while at the same time encouraging their rehabilitation \u201cby preventing their association with older and more experienced criminals during the terms of their confinement\u201d). Nothing in Florida\u2019s youthful offender statute suggests that a youthful offender\u2019s conviction in the criminal division of the Florida Circuit Court is not an adult conviction under Florida law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In sum, the fact that the Florida Circuit Court later sentenced Cortes as a youthful offender did not change the fact that, under Florida law, it first convicted him as an adult of two counts of battery on an officer and one count of resisting an officer with violence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in counting these withheld adjudications as predicate offenses for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">B. Crime of Violence</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes, <em>inter alia, </em>any offense \u201cthat has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). Generally, when determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for purposes of a sentencing enhancement, we use a modified categorical approach, looking at the fact of the conviction, the statutory definition of the prior offense, and, if the statute encompasses conduct falling both inside and outside the enhancement, certain <em>Shepard-approved </em>documents, such as the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy and explicit findings of fact. <em>United States v. Rainer, </em>616 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.2010) (involving ACCA enhancement), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 968, 178 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011); <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1327-29 (11th Cir.2010) (involving sixteen-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Construing identical language in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this Court concluded that, when applying the categorical approach, \u201cthe fact of a conviction for felony battery on a law enforcement officer in Florida, standing alone, no longer satisfies the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 enhancement criteria\u201d of physical force. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168, 1169-70 (11th Cir.2010). The <em>Williams </em>court explained that under Florida\u2019s battery statute, a person could commit a battery by either actually and intentionally touching someone or by intentionally causing bodily harm to someone. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. The <em>Williams </em>court concluded that there was \u201cno evidence in the record, that we may consider under <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>to clarify under which of these provisions Williams was convicted.\u201d <em>Id,. Williams </em>relied upon <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), which concluded that the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), meant \u201cviolent force\u201d\u2014 that is, \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1271; <em>see also Williams, </em>609 F.3d at 1169.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Cortes argues that, after <em>Williams </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>his Florida convictions for battery on an officer and resisting an officer with violence categorically do not qualify as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The problem for Cortes is that he did not dispute the facts in paragraph 28 of the PSI, which show that Cortes\u2019s Florida offenses did involve violent force. In fact, it is undisputed that Cortes\u2019s offenses involved violently shoving an officer and then later punching an officer in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">At sentencing, the district court may rely on facts contained in the PSI that are undisputed and deemed admitted. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832-34 (11th Cir.2006). To the extent Cortes argues for the first time on appeal that the facts in paragraph 28 were drawn from non-S/iepard-approved materials, he has not preserved that argument for appellate review. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the \u201cfailure to object to a district court\u2019s factual findings [as to the nature of the prior offense] precludes the argument that there was error in them\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that Cortes\u2019s Florida withheld adjudications for two counts of battery on an officer and one count of resisting an officer with violence were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">. This language in the order tracks the language of Florida\u2019s statute authorizing withheld adjudications in criminal (adult) proceedings. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 948.01(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\">. We note that, while <em>Wilks </em>involved U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 's career offender provision, that provision, like U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1), counts only prior adult convictions and limits an adult conviction for an offense committed before age 18 to one \"classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted....\" <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. Cortes's reliance on <em>Green v. State, </em>975 So.2d 1090 (Fla.2008), is misplaced. The issue in <em>Green </em>was whether a defendant\u2019s New York youthful offender adjudication constituted a conviction for purposes of Florida\u2019s death penalty statute. <em>See </em>975 So.2d at 1112. In any event, the <em>dicta </em>to which Cortes points seems to support our reading of the Florida Youthful Offender Act given that it states that in Florida \"youthful offender status appertains to the sentence rather than to the adjudication\" and that \"youthful offender status does not bear on the issue of whether the adjudication constitutes a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1112-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b833-14\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">. For purposes of the career offender provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, \u00a7 4B1.2 defines a \"crime of violence\u201d to include an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b834-14\">. As with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1), the ACCA defines a \"violent felony\u201d to include a crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
