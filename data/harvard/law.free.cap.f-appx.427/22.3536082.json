Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez, pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and/or possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, and 860. He was sentenced by the district court to 72 months in prison and now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in considering his prior criminal convictions in reaching the sentencing decision. Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez further asserts that the amendment to the sentencing guidelines promulgated in response to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) should apply retroactively to him. For the reason explained below, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>I. Facts &amp; Background</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On July 28, 2009, Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez appeared before a magistrate judge to plead guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to count one of a multi-count indictment. After a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court accept the guilty plea, and the district court subsequently followed that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The plea agreement described the crime to which the defendant pled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">[The defendant] and other persons, did knowingly and intentionally, combine, conspire, and agree ... to knowingly and intentionally possess with the intent to distribute and/or to distribute controlled substances, to wit: in excess of one (1) kilogram of heroin ...; and/or in excess of fifty (50) grams of cocaine base ...; and/or in excess of five (5) kilograms of cocaine ...; and/or in excess of one hundred (100) kilograms of marijuana ... within one thousand (1,000) feet of the real property comprising a public or private school, as prohibited by [\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 860]. All in violation of [\u00a7 846],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The agreement specified that, \u201cbased on the stipulated and agreed amount of narcotics possessed by the defendant, that is, at least thirty-five (35) grams but less than fifty (50) grams of cocaine base, the penalty for the offense shall be, a term of imprisonment of not less than five (5) years.... \u201d Although the agreement set the defendant\u2019s total offense level at 26, the parties did not stipulate to a criminal history category (\u201cCHC\u201d). Instead, they agreed that (1) if the defendant was found to be in CHC I, the defendant could request a sentence of 63 months and the government could recommend a sentence of 78 months; (2) if the defendant was found to be in CHC II, the defendant could request a sentence of 70 months and the government could recommend a sentence of 78 months; and (3) if the defendant was found to be in CHC III or higher, both parties agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. Notably, the agreement included a waiver of appeal that read as follows: \u201cThe defendant hereby agrees that if [the district court] accepts this Plea Agreement and sentences him according to its terms, conditions and recommendations, defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concluded that the defendant fell into CHC I with a total offense level of 26, and therefore his guideline range was 63 to 78 months. The PSR also listed several incidents that resulted in criminal convictions for the defendant between 1983 and 1993. These included a controlled substance violation and a conviction for possession of a firearm without authorization. Because of their age, however, these convictions did not yield any criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">On October 30, 2009, the district court convened a sentencing hearing. In keeping with the terms of the plea agreement, the government urged the court to impose a 78-month sentence and the defendant requested a 63-month sentence. The district court acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s prior convictions did not yield any criminal history points, but explained that those convictions were nonetheless relevant to the sentencing decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">If [the defendant] had been brought to this court ... [there] would be consecutive violations of drugs, and a weapon, and he would have been considered a felon in possession, if it had been brought to this court, because he has a controlled substance violation of 10/10/87 ... and he has a weapons violation .... also ... he has a domestic violence case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>which was reduced to a simple aggression back in 1993 which this court is also not counting, but I am still concerned because he continues with some proclivity to get himself involved in drug cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">After finding that the defendant\u2019s total offense level was 26 and his CHC was I, the district court imposed a special assessment of $100.00 and sentenced the defendant to 72 months in prison, followed by 8 years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court explained that this sentence was based on the plea agreement and the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court again cited the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions and noted that it was \u201cimpressed with the [defendant\u2019s] proclivity to drug cases, [his] proclivity to use weapons, which although those violations did not receive any points, it allows the Court to go to the middle range [of the applicable guideline range].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">After the sentence was announced, defense counsel objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, arguing that \u201cthe guidelines say when a crime [was] committed over 15 years [ago], it should not be counted.\u201d The district court clarified that it had only considered the controlled substance and weapon convictions, and then explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t count [the convictions] for criminal history. I only counted [them] [in determining] where I\u2019m placing him within [the guideline range].... \u201d Shortly after the sentencing hearing, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and/or correction of sentence, which the district court denied after holding another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">A waiver of appeal will generally be honored if it was knowing and voluntary. <em>Sotirion v. United States, </em>617 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Teeter, </em>257 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.2001). However, \u201ceven if the waiver is knowing and voluntary, we retain discretion not to enforce the waiver if it would result in a \u2018miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sotirion, </em>617 F.3d at 33 (quoting <em>Teeter, </em>257 F.3d at 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">The defendant does not dispute that he waived his right to appeal knowingly and voluntarily. Rather, the defendant contends that enforcing the waiver would constitute a miscarriage of justice. Specifically, the defendant takes issue with the district court\u2019s consideration of his twenty-year-old criminal convictions. The defendant claims that these convictions \u201cw[ere] not sufficient to conclude that [the defendant] will repeat the conduct in the future\u201d and that the district court\u2019s reasoning \u201cresulted in a penalty that was harsher than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing.\u201d He argues that the \u201csentence [was] procedurally incorrect because the [district court\u2019s] explanation as to why the recommended sentence of 63 months ... was not reasonable is not reliable[,]\u201d and the sentence was substantively unreasonable because he deserved a more lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u201cTh[e] miscarriage of justice exception is meant only for \u2018egregious cases\u2019 and is to be applied \u2018sparingly and without undue generosity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36 (citing <em>Teeter, </em>257 F.3d at 25-26). It \u201c \u2018requires a strong showing of innocence, unfairness, or the like,\u2019 and is \u2018demanding enough to prevent defendants who have agreed to waive their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>right to appeal from successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). In determining whether the miscarriage of justice threshold has been reached, this court considers, among other things, \u201cthe clarity of the error, its gravity, its character ..., the impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\u201d <em>Teeter, </em>257 F.3d at 26. For example, we have observed that a miscarriage of justice occurs when a sentencing court considers a constitutionally impermissible factor such as the defendant\u2019s race. <em>Id. </em>at 25 n. 9. A miscarriage of justice may also occur when the district court plainly errs in sentencing a defendant, such as where the sentence exceeds the maximum penalty permitted by law. <em>Id. </em>at 25 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In the case at hand, enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. First, neither the district court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s old convictions, nor its explanation that its within-the-guideline sentence was based in part on those convictions, were procedural errors giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. Not only does the defendant fail to cite any authority supporting the argument that the district court\u2019s reasoning was procedurally flawed, but he concedes in his brief that there is \u201cno limitation on the information concerning the background character and conduct of [the defendant] [that may be considered] for the purpose of imposing a sentence.\u201d <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1) (instructing court to consider, among other things, \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4 (\u201cIn determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range ... the court may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.\u201d). Regardless, the defendant certainly does not explain how any such procedural error was so grave or egregious as to cause a miscarriage of justice, and we cannot see how allowing this sentence to stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Second, the 72-month sentence was substantively reasonable. Although a sentence within the applicable guideline range is not presumed reasonable, a defendant challenging the substantive reasonableness of such a sentence bears a heavy burden, even when the right to appeal has not been waived. <em>See United States v. Madera-Ortiz, </em>637 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2982, 180 L.Ed.2d 260, 261 (2011). The defendant here has not met that burden. To the extent he argues that the sentence did not appropriately reflect certain mitigating considerations, we disagree. We see nothing about the defendant\u2019s circumstances that required the district court to impose a more lenient sentence. Just because the district court did not weigh the mitigating factors as heavily as the defendant would like, it does not mean that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 32 (\u201cThat the court below chose not to give greater weight to [various mitigating factors] ... represented a judgment call. Within wide margins, not approached here, such judgment calls are for the sentencing court, not for this court.\u201d). Nor do we think the sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court considered the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. Although more than twenty years elapsed between those convictions and the guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>plea in the instant case, it was not unreasonable for the district court to reject a bottom-of-the-range request \u2014 in favor of a 72-month, middle-of-the-range sentence\u2014 because of the defendant\u2019s criminal record and what that record portends for the defendant\u2019s ability to avoid criminal activity in the future. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a) (instructing sentencing court to consider, among other things, \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe need for the sentence ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). In short, the district court advanced \u201ca plausible sentencing rationale\u201d to support \u201ca defensible result,\u201d <em>see West v. United States, </em>631 F.3d 563, 572 (1st Cir.2011), and the sentence was substantively sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Lastly, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that changes to the sentencing guidelines promulgated pursuant to the FSA should apply retroactively to him. The defendant was sentenced in 2009. The FSA was enacted on August 3, 2010, the emergency guideline amendment promulgated in response to the FSA took effect on November 1, 2010, and the permanent guideline amendment is scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2011. <em>See United States v. Douglas, </em>644 F.3d 39 (1st Cir.2011) (setting forth the timeline of the relevant developments). As the defendant acknowledges, absent some directive from Congress or the Sentencing Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), a sentencing court should generally apply the guidelines that \u201care in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a) (4) (A) (ii). We recognize that the Commission recently voted \u201cto give retroactive effect to its proposed permanent amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines that implements the [FSA].\u201d News Release, U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n Votes Unanimously to Apply Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 Amendment to the Fed. Sentencing Guidelines Retroactively (June 30, 2011) (available at http://www.ussc.gov/ Legislative_and_Public_Affairs/Newsroom/ Press-Releases/ 20110630_Press_Re-lease.pdf); <em>see also </em>U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n Notice of Final Action Regarding Amendment to Policy Statement \u00a7 1B1.10, 76 Fed.Reg. 41332 (July 13, 2011); U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n Notice of Submission to Congress of Amendments to Sentencing Guidelines and Request for Comment, 76 Fed.Reg. 24960 (May 3, 2011). Unless Congress halts the Commission\u2019s plans, retroactivity will accompany the permanent amendment when that amendment takes effect on November 1, 2011. News Release, U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, supra. No matter how this turns out, however, the defendant\u2019s request for resentencing under the new guideline regime is premature. <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>630 F.3d 44, 52-53 (1st Cir.2010) (concluding that appellant\u2019s request for retroactive application of guideline amendment was premature because the Commission had yet to issue the permanent guideline amendment or determine whether that amendment would apply retroactively), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2122, 179 L.Ed.2d 914 (2011). If and when the permanent amendment becomes retroactive, the defendant \u201cis free to petition for re-sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">. The transcript of the sentencing hearing quoted the district court as describing the defendant\u2019s guideline range as \"63 to 68.\u201d It is unclear whether this reflects a typographical error or a misstatement by the district court. Regardless, other portions of the transcript indicate that the district court was well aware that 72 months was in the middle of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-12\">.
