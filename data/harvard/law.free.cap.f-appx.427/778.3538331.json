In their complaint, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>appellants allege that appellees \u201cviolated the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and omissions, ultimately causing HomeBanc\u2019s shareholders millions of dollars in losses when the truth was finally revealed.\u201d Appellants argue specifically that appellees concealed numerous purchases of sub-prime mortgage securities \u2014 purchases that contributed to HomeBanc\u2019s demise when the housing and subprime mortgage markets crashed. After limited briefing, the district court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, reasoning that the \u201ccomplaint fails to adequately allege a primary violation under [Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j; 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5],\u201d and that as a result the \u201c[appellants] claim for controlling person liability under [Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) ] necessarily fails.\u201d This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn assessing the sufficiency of the complaint\u2019s allegations, we are bound to apply the pleading standard articulated in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).\u201d <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2011). Thus, the complaint \u201cmust ... contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d at 1289 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">To state a claim for securities fraud under section 10(b) of the Security Act, a plaintiff must allege \u201csix elements: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; .(2) made with scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance on a misstatement or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) a causal connection between the material misrepresentation or omission and the loss, commonly called \u2018loss causation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Instituto De Prevision Militar v. Merrill Lynch, </em>546 F.3d 1340, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 341\u201442, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005)). As to the element of scienter, \u201c[i]n this Circuit, [section] 10(b) ... require[s] a showing of either an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, or severe recklessness.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Relation-Serve Media, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 628, 634 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Furthermore, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995), a plaintiff pleading a private securities cause of action faces heightened pleading requirements. As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">First, the PSLRA slightly altered [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement by mandating that a securities fraud class action complaint</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-11\">specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1)(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">Second, and more importantly, the PSLRA raised the standard for pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>scienter. Specifically, in any securities fraud class action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular, state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7f\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, in a securities fraud class action, a plaintiff can no longer plead the requisite scienter element generally, as he previously could under Rule 9(b). Moreover, the complaint must allege facts supporting a strong inference of scienter \u201cfor each defendant with respect to each violation.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Sci</em>entific-Atlanta, <em>Inc., </em>374 F.3d 1015, 1016 (11th Cir.2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><em>Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Finally, section 20(a) of the Securities Act \u201cimposes derivative liability on persons that control primary violators of the Act.\u201d <em>Laperriere v. Vesta Ins. Group, Inc., </em>526 F.3d 715, 721 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, as the parties concede, appellants\u2019 section 20(a) claim cannot stand unless the Complaint states a claim for relief under section 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 brief, and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm. Before setting forth our reasoning, we note that although the district court determined that the plaintiffs failed to plead three elements of their 10(b) complaint, for our purposes here, we need only agree regarding one of these elements to affirm. <em>See Molinos Valle Del Cibao, C. por A. v. Lama, </em>633 F.3d 1330, 1349 n. 20 (11th Cir.2011). Therefore, our discussion today is limited to our conclusion that appellants failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the appellees acted with the necessary scienter to commit securities violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">As set forth above, the PSLRA imposes heightened pleading requirements for scienter. The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a] complaint will survive ... only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Malcor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd, </em>551 U.S. 308, 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2510, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). We find no such inference in this case. A1-though the Complaint alleges that the appellees expressed mistaken confidence in HomeBane\u2019s financial well-being and furthermore engaged in business practices that contributed to HomeBanc\u2019s demise, the facts alleged do not give rise to a strong inference that appellees\u2019 knew that their statements were fraudulent or were reckless in light of their actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Rather, the stronger inference is that appellees simply failed to predict the eventual collapse of the housing and subprime mortgage market, and, as a result, were ill-prepared to respond when those markets crashed. Indeed, as the district court explained, \u201c[t]he Complaint cites differences of opinion, conjecture and innuendo in an attempt to make [appellees\u2019] behavior look suspicious, but it conspicuously omits any facts that would require one to rule out an innocent explanation for the alleged behavior.\u201d Moreover, the public disclosures identified in the Complaint are replete with myriad warnings and other cautionary statements,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>undermines any inference that appellees intended to mislead HomeBanc\u2019s investors. As a result, it is simply not \u201cat least as compelling as any opposing inference\u201d that appellees acted with the necessary scienter to violate section 10(b) of the Securities Act. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 324, 127 S.Ct. at 2510; <em>Mizarro, </em>544 F.3d at 1238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We hold therefore that the Complaint fails to \u201cplead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the [appellees] either intended to defraud investors or were severely reckless when they made the alleged materially false or incomplete statements.\u201d <em>Mizarro, </em>544 F.3d at 1238 (quotation marks omitted). As a result, we affirm the decision of the district court dismissing appellants\u2019 Complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. Although courts possess limited discretion to consider documents that are not part of the Complaint, we have held that \"a court, when considering a motion to dismiss in a securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ties fraud case, may take judicial notice (for the purpose of determining what statements the documents contain and not to prove the truth of the documents\u2019 contents) of relevant public documents required to be filed with the SEC, and actually filed.\" <em>Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 1271, 1278 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
