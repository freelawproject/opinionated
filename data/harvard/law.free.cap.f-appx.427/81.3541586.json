Goodman, a prisoner incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tion in Fort Dix, New Jersey, appeals from an order of the District Court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In January and February of 1998, Goodman committed two drug-related offenses while he was on parole from a sentence imposed by the State of New Jersey. As a result, Goodman was remanded to state custody and sentenced on May 17, 1998, to 15 months of imprisonment for violating his parole. Goodman was subsequently released to federal authorities on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. After pleading guilty to possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine, Goodman was sentenced on June 24, 1999, by a judge in the District of New Jersey, to 198 months of imprisonment to run consecutively to the state term he was serving on the parole violation. On April 7, 2000, the state paroled Goodman into federal custody and his federal term began to run from that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">After challenging the calculation of his sentence through the federal Bureau of Prison\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) administrative remedy program, Goodman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in the District Court. Goodman asserted that the BOP failed to credit him with 379 days that he served in state custody between March 25, 1999, when he first became eligible for parole, and April 7, 2000, when he was released into federal custody. The District Court denied the petition and Goodman timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Goodman\u2019s habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 242 (3d Cir.2005). We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Goodman\u2019s habeas petition de novo, <em>see Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir. 2007), and may summarily affirm if no substantial question is presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The authority to calculate a federal sentence and provide credit for time served has been delegated to the Attorney General, who acts through the BOP. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333-35, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). In calculating a federal sentence, the BOP first determines when the sentence commenced and then determines whether the prisoner is entitled to any credits toward his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585. We conclude that the BOP correctly calculated Goodman\u2019s sentence and that Goodman\u2019s challenges are baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Goodman suggests that his federal sentence should have commenced as of the date that he was eligible for parole on his state sentence, instead of the date that he was actually paroled. But the date that Goodman became eligible for parole on his state sentence is irrelevant because his federal sentence could not have commenced until he was in federal custody, which did not happen until he was actually paroled by the State of New Jersey. <em>See Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 274 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[A] prisoner detained pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum remains in the primary custody of the first jurisdiction unless and until the first sovereign relinquishes jurisdiction over the prisoner.\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a) (providing that a federal sentence commences on \u201cthe date the defendant is received in custody ... at[ ] the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served\u201d). Accordingly, the BOP properly treated Goodman\u2019s federal sentence as commencing on April 7,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In his traverse, Goodman asserts that the BOP could have nunc pro tunc designated the state facility where he was serving his state sentence as the place of federal confinement as of March 25, 1999, pursuant to <em>Barden v. Keohane, </em>921 F.2d 476 (3d Cir.1990). Even though Goodman failed to exhaust that claim because he did not request such a designation during the administrative process, <em>see Mathena v. United States, </em>577 F.3d 943, 946 (8th Cir. 2009), we think the District Court appropriately dismissed it as meritless. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir.2000); <em>cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2). In <em>Barden, </em>a state judge sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment to be served concurrently with an already-imposed federal term. 921 F.2d at 478. But since the defendant was in primary custody of the state, his federal term did not commence until he was released into federal custody after having served his state term, effectively resulting in consecutive service. <em>Id. </em>We recognized that the BOP had the discretion to nunc pro tunc designate the state facility as the place of federal confinement so as to allow the sentences to run concurrently. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84. Goodman is clearly not entitled to his requested nunc pro tunc designation under <em>Barden </em>because there is no subsequently imposed, concurrent state sentence to consider. Nor is Goodman entitled to relief under BOP Program Statement 5160.05, the relevant BOP internal policy. This is because the federal judge who sentenced him expressly dictated that his federal sentence run <em>consecutively </em>to his already-imposed state sentence. <em>See </em>BOP Program Statement 5160.05, <em>Designation of State Institution for Service of Federal Sentence </em>(Jan. 16, 2003) available at, http://www. bop.gov/policy/progstat/5160_005.pdf at 6-7 \u00b6 9(4)(f) (explaining that the BOP \u201cwill not allow a concurrent designation if ... the federal sentencing court ordered the sentence to run consecutively to any other sentence, or custody in operation, during any time in which the inmate requests concurrent designation!)]\u201d). Accordingly, we find no merit to Goodman\u2019s claim that the BOP should have designated his state facility as the place of his federal confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Goodman\u2019s argument that he should be credited with the 379 days is also baseless. Since that time has been served on and credited toward Goodman\u2019s state sentence, the BOP is prohibited from double-counting that time toward his federal sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (requiring credit for time served \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence\u201d); <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (\u201cCongress made clear [in \u00a7 3585(b) ] that a defendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time.\u201d). Furthermore, despite Goodman\u2019s assertions, there is simply no evidence in the record that the federal sentencing court intended for Goodman to be credited with any time served in state custody. To the contrary, the federal sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>clearly intended for Goodman\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively to his state sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Since Goodman\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. At the time Goodman was paroled, he was already in federal custody pursuant to a federal writ. Although federal authorities apparently did not learn that Goodman had been paroled until May 3, 2000, the BOP calculated his federal sentence as commencing on the date he was actually paroled, April 7, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. To the extent Goodman seeks a writ of co-ram nobis with respect to his state conviction, the District Court correctly recognized that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. <em>See Obado v. New Jersey, </em>328 F.3d 716, 718 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-15\">. To the extent Goodman challenges the validity of his federal sentence by arguing that the federal sentencing court misunderstood \u00a7 5G1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, he may not pursue such a challenge in a petition brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Eakman, </em>378 F.3d 294, 297 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that a prisoner attacking the validity of his sentence, as opposed to the execution of his sentence, must proceed under \u00a7 2255).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
