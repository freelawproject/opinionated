R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b34-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s October 25, 2010, and November 22, 2010, orders be affirmed. Appellant has identified no error in the district court\u2019s decision, and the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of the complaint was proper. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (\u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time\u201d if the court determines that an action is frivolous or fails to state a claim). Also, appellant has not shown that allowing him to amend the complaint would not have been futile. <em>See Firestone v. Firestone, </em>76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.Cir.1996). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA Rule 59(e) motion is discretionary and need not be granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
