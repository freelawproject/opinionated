On appeal, Interial argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint rather than tolling the statute of limitations by applying the continuous treatment doctrine. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute of limitations <em>de novo. Brown v. Georgia Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>335 F.3d 1259, 1261 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, district courts are required to screen civil complaints filed by prisoners against governmental entities or employees, and dismiss any portion of the complaint that \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1). Dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint as time-barred is appropriate if it appears beyond a doubt from the complaint itself that the prisoner cannot avoid a statute of limitations bar. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">Actions brought under <em>Bivens </em>are subject to the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state where the claim has been brought. <em>Kelly v. Serna, 87 </em>F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1996). Interial brought his claim in Georgia, where the governing limitations period for personal injury claims is two years. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33; <em>M.H.D. v. Westminster Sch., </em>172 F.3d 797, 802-03 (11th Cir.1999). Pursuant to federal law, a cause of action accrues, and thereby sets the limitations clock running, when \u201cthe facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent\u201d to a reasonably prudent person. <em>Brown, </em>335 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">Under the continuous treatment doctrine, \u201c \u2018a plaintiffs cause of action does not accrue until the tortious continuing treatment ends, even if the plaintiff is aware of the facts constituting negligence before that time.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCullough v. United States, </em>607 F.3d 1355, 1361 (11th Cir.2010) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>(quoting <em>Wehrman v. United States, </em>830 F.2d 1480, 1483 (8th Cir.1987)). \u201cHowever, neither the Eleventh Circuit nor the former Fifth Circuit has specifically adopted the continuous treatment doctrine.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">We are unpersuaded by Interial\u2019s claim that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint. Indeed, viewing the allegations in Interial\u2019s complaint as true, the alleged conduct of which he complains commenced on or about June 16, 2005, the date on which Interial first sought treatment for chest pain and shortness of breath, and continued until approximately August 5, 2005, the date on which Interial had triple bypass surgery. However, the <em>Bivens </em>complaint in this case was not filed until February 16, 2010. By August 5, 2005, Interial was aware of the facts that form the basis of his complaint, and thus, the applicable statute of limitations required him to file his complaint on or before August 6, 2007, in order to be considered timely filed. Instead, Interial filed his complaint more than two and a half years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Nor is the statute of limitations tolled under the continuous treatment doctrine, as this court has not adopted the continuous treatment doctrine. <em>See McCullough, </em>607 F.3d at 1361. However, even if we were to adopt the continuous treatment doctrine, it still would not save Interial\u2019s claim. The doctrine states that a \u201ccause of action does not accrue until the tortious continuing treatment ends,\u201d <em>id., </em>but Interial has not alleged any tortious treatment by the defendants after August 2005. Thus, the two-year statute of limitations started to run in August 2005, and Interial\u2019s claim would still be time-barred. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the applicable statute of limitations barred Interial\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
