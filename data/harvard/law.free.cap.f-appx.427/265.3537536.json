On appeal, Jackson contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Reid, </em>523 F.3d 310, 317 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will uphold a jury\u2019s verdict \u201cif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>523 F.3d at 317. Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In resolving issues of substantial evidence, we do not reweigh the evidence or reassess the factfinder\u2019s determination of witness credibility, <em>see United States v. Brooks, </em>524 F.3d 549, 563 (4th Cir.2008), and \u201ccan reverse a conviction on insufficiency grounds only when the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006), the Government must prove that: (1) Jackson was a convicted felon; (2) Jackson knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm traveled in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001). Jackson stipulated that he had been convicted of a felony and that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce. Thus, the Government only had to prove Jackson\u2019s knowing possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we hold that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson possessed a gun. The jury heard from a police officer who saw Jackson holding a gun, as well as from several other officers who observed Jackson\u2019s nervous behavior, described his attempt to flee from them, and saw the gun at the scene. Because we cannot say that the officers\u2019 testimony was inherently improbable or incredible, we decline to reassess the jury\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Close, </em>349 F.2d 841, 848-49 (4th Cir.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
