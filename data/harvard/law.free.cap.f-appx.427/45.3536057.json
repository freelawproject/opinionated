KG and Peter Doehle Schiffahrts-KG, now appeal from a judgment in favor of defendants after trial. Plaintiffs charge the district court with error in (1) denying their motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, (2) instructing the jury and providing it with a verdict form, (3) granting partial summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damages claims, and (4) engaging in prejudicial conduct at trial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">1. <em>Weight of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">We generally review the denial of a new trial motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See SEC v. DiBella, </em>587 F.3d 553, 563 (2d Cir.2009). Where, as here, a district court denied such a motion \u201cmade on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,\u201d however, \u201csuch a ruling is not reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>DeFalco v. Bernas, </em>244 F.3d 286, 325 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201conly appellate recourse is to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d <em>see id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), something that they do not, and cannot, do. To the extent plaintiffs complain that the district court failed to charge one of their theories of liability to the jury, we address that argument in our review of the jury instructions. But we are without jurisdiction to review plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the denial of their motion for a new trial on the ground that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">2. <em>Jury Instructions and Verdict Form</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court\u2019s instructions and verdict form failed to alert the jury of the need to return a verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 alternate theory of liability under the rule in <em>The Pennsylvania, </em>86 U.S.(19 Wall.) 125, 136, 22 L.Ed. 148 (1873), based upon defendants\u2019 alleged violation of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (\u201cCOLREGS\u201d), Oct. 20, 1972, T.I.A.S. No. 8587, 28 U.S.T. 3459. <em>See generally Otal Invs. Ltd. v. M.V. Clary, </em>494 F.3d 40, 51 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cUnder the rule in <em>The Pennsylvania, </em>a vessel that violates a navigational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>rule not only must show that her fault did not cause the collision, but also must persuade the court that her own explanation of the collision is correct.\u201d). Because plaintiffs did not object to the district court\u2019s instruction or verdict <em>form on </em>this ground, we may review only for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2). That civil rule standard is \u201cmore exacting\u201d than its criminal counterpart, requiring a showing of error \u201cso serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.\u201d <em>SCS Commc\u2019ns Inc. v. Herrick Co., </em>360 F.3d 329, 343 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have identified such error where instructions \u201cfail[ed] to provide even the barest legal guideposts to aid the jury in rationally reaching a decision.\u201d <em>Frederic P. Wiedersum Assocs. v. Nat'l Homes Constr. Corp., </em>540 F.2d 62, 66 (2d Cir.1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is not this case. The district court incorporated <em>The Pennsylvania </em>rule, as well as the allegedly violated COLREGS, into its instructions on negligence. In light of these instructions, as well as counsel\u2019s closing arguments, a reasonable jury would have understood the verdict form inquiry as to proof of negligence \u201cin the manner claimed by plaintiffs\u201d to include all theories of liability. In sum, there was no error, let alone plain error, in the instructions or verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">3. <em>Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the award of summary judgment on them punitive damages claims is rendered moot by the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiffs failed to prove negligence and by our ruling that this finding was not infected by any error in the district court\u2019s jury instructions or verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">4. <em>Prejudicial Statements by the Distinct Couri</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that they were denied due process by the biased conduct of the trial judge is meritless. Although plaintiffs fault the trial court for admonishing their counsel and witnesses, no new trial is warranted because the record does not indicate that \u201cthe judge expresse[d] his opinion on an ultimate issue of fact in front of the jury or argue[d] for one of the parties.\u201d <em>Shah v. Pan Am. World Servs., Inc., </em>148 F.3d 84, 98 (2d Cir.1998). Nor do we identify any error, let alone prejudicial error, in the district court\u2019s allocation of trial time or its chosen order for presenting summations to the jury. Such trial management is generally consigned to the broad discretion of the district court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Quattrone, </em>441 F.3d 153, 183 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Universal Licensing Corp. v. Paola del Lungo S.p.A., </em>293 F.3d 579, 584 (2d Cir.2002); <em>accord </em>Fed. R.Evid. 611; S.D.N.Y. Local Civil Rule 39.2 (granting district court discretion to manage order of summations). Finally, although plaintiffs fault the district court for not giving a limiting instruction with respect to the testimony of one of defendants\u2019 expert witnesses, they do not demonstrate that they ever requested such an instruction, nor do they point to testimony presented to the jury that required a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Consequently, we identify no denial of due process warranting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">5. <em>Fees and, Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Defendants request an award of appellate costs and fees incurred to defend plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cMotion to Stay the Instant Appeal and Remand the Matter to the District Court.\u201d \u201cIt is the general rule in the United States that in the absence of legislation providing otherwise, litigants must pay their own attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 416, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>(1978). Thus, we will award appellate sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38 only where \u201cone party proceeds with an argument totally lacking in merit, framed with no relevant supporting law, conclusory in nature, and utterly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp. Inc., </em>995 F.2d 1138, 1147 (2d Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard is satisfied here. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion rests on the same arguments advanced in its merits briefs, which themselves contain almost no citation to relevant legal authority and rest on dubious, and even misleading, characterizations of the record. Further, the asserted bases for a new trial are all either contrary to settled circuit law or patently meritless. We need not here decide whether we would sanction plaintiffs for maintaining such arguments in their merits briefs. We hold only that plaintiffs\u2019 multiplication of litigation expenses through a motion so totally lacking in support in law or evidence warrants a sanction in the amount of defendants\u2019 reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defense of plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cMotion to Stay the Instant Appeal and Remand the Matter to the District Court.\u201d Having reviewed the amount of defendants\u2019 request, which plaintiffs do not contest, and finding it to be reasonable, we grant defendants\u2019 request for $15,512.12 in fees and costs, for which plaintiffs and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel will be jointly and severally liable. See e.g., <em>Bartel Dental Books Co., Inc. v. Schultz, </em>786 F.2d 486, 491 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
