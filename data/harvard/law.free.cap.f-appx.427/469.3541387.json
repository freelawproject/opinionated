WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Defendant-Appellant Darryle Hunter appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion seeking a sentence modification under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">On September 1, 1998, Hunter was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute approximately 5.6 grams of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Count I), and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count II). On December 1, 1998, Hunter pleaded guilty to Count I pursuant to a plea agreement with the Government that provided for the dismissal of Count II. The plea agreement also included stipulations that Hunter was a career offender within the meaning of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, that his base offense level was thirty-four, and that his adjusted base offense level \u2014 taking into account a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of <em>responsibility </em>\u2014 was thirty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">At Hunter\u2019s March 2, 1999 sentencing, the parties agreed that Hunter\u2019s total offense level was thirty-one and his criminal history category was VI. The resulting Guidelines range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court sentenced Hunter to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Almost ten years later, on February 3, 2009, Hunter filed a pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>3582(c)(2), </em>based on Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. The government opposed Hunter\u2019s motion, arguing that Hunter was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced under the career-offender Guidelines, which, unlike the crack-cocaine Guidelines, had not been lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The district court appointed counsel for Hunter, and on June 17, 2009, counsel filed another motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that although his \u201cinitial offense calculation was increased by the career offender enhancement,\u201d Hunter should nevertheless prevail on his motion because the district court had \u201cexpanded discretion in sentencing under the now advisory sentencing guidelines, and because [his] conviction and sentence were grounded in a criminal offense involving cocaine base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">The district court also granted Hunter leave to file a supplemental brief in support of his motion, in which he argued for the first time that he was not a career offender because the predicate offenses underlying his career-offender classification \u2014 two burglaries \u2014 were related. Hunter argued that he was \u201ccarrying property taken during the first burglary when caught for the second burglary, reflecting the fact that the burglaries were part of a single common scheme or plan,\u201d there was no intervening arrest, he was arrested for both offenses on the same day, and he pleaded guilty of both offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>and was sentenced on the same day and by the same judge for both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On August 13, 2009, the district court denied Hunter\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction, stating that \u201c[bjecause [Hunter\u2019s] Guideline range was determined based upon his Career Offender status rather than the offense level for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, he [was] not eligible for a reduction.\u201d Hunter timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Hunter argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to modify his sentence because (1) the career-offender classification should not render Hunter ineligible for a sentence modification in light of the Guidelines\u2019 advisory nature pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) Hunter\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d an offense involving crack cocaine \u201ceven though the career offender guideline of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 also figured into the guideline calculation\u201d; and, (3) Hunter \u201cwas erroneously found to be a career offender at the time of sentencing.\u201d In turn, the government contends that the district court properly denied Hunter\u2019s motion because <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not render Hunter eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2),\u201d and Hunter\u2019s \u201cenhanced offense level [that was based on his career-offender status] ... remains unchanged by the crack cocaine amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">We typically \u201creview[] the denial of a motion to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) under the abuse-ofdiseretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Payton, </em>617 F.3d 911, 912 (6th Cir.2010) (citations omitted). However, where the district court does not \u201cexercise its discretion in denying the motion but \u2018instead concludes that it lacks the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under the statute, the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant is ineligible ... is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913 (citing <em>United States v. Curry, </em>606 F.3d 323, 327 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>569 F.3d 619, 623 (6th Cir.2009))).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201cA district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence only as provided by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>614 F.3d 253, 256 (6th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court to modify a sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) ... after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The district court undertakes a two-step inquiry in a proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Allen, </em>614 F.3d at 256. First, the district court must \u201c \u2018determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\u2019 if the amendment had been in effect at the time of the original sentence, [and in making this determination] ... \u2018substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced\u2019 and ... \u2018leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l)). If the district court determines that the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, it proceeds to the second step of the inquiry, pursuant to which it \u201cmust consider any applicable factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and \u2018determine whether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted in whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256-57 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Guidelines Amendment 706, enacted November 1, 2007, \u201camended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c),\u201d and \u201creduced the sentencing range[s] applicable to all but the largest quantities of cocaine base.\u201d <em>Payton, </em>617 F.3d at 912. Amendment 713 made Amendment 706 retroactive. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Hunter would qualify for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if he had been convicted of a crack-cocaine offense and sentenced on this basis. However, Hunter was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and we have repeatedly held that a \u201cdefendant convicted of crack-related charges but sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is not eligible for a reduction based on Amendment 706.\u201d <em>United States v. Bridgewater, </em>606 F.3d 258, 260-61 (6th Cir.2010) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Perdue, </em>572 F.3d 288, 293 (6th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause Amendment 706 has no effect on the ultimate sentencing range imposed on Perdue under the career-offender Guideline, the district court did not err in declining to grant his motion for a reduction in sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Hunter\u2019s additional argument that, following <em>Booker, </em>all guideline provisions are discretionary rather than mandatory, and therefore his career-offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1 alone does not control the determination of his sentence, was explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). <em>Dillon </em>rejected the argument that the interests identified in <em>Booker </em>require that the Guidelines be treated as advisory in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. 130 S.Ct. at 2692. (\u201cGiven the limited scope and purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), ... proceedings under that section do not implicate the interests identified in <em>Booker.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Lastly, we address Hunter\u2019s contention that he was improperly classified as a career offender. In arguing that his two prior offenses were related, it appears that Hunter is attempting to rely on Guidelines Amendment 709, effective November 1, 2007, which \u201caltered the way in which the Guidelines determined whether prior crimes would be treated as single or separate offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Horn, </em>612 F.3d 524, 526 (6th Cir.2010). Pursuant to this Amendment, \u201cmultiple offenses for which sentences are imposed on the same day are counted as a single offense unless there was an intervening arrest between the offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However such a consideration \u201cis outside the scope of a resentencing proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Allen, </em>614 F.3d at 258. According to <em>Dillon, </em>\u201c[b]y its terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2690. \u201cInstead, it permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2694. Although Hunter\u2019s prior offenses would likely be counted as a single offense under Amendment 709, this Amendment was not made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission, and we have held that district courts lack authority to resentence defendants under this Amendment. <em>See Horn, </em>612 F.3d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Because the district court did not err in denying Hunter\u2019s motion for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
