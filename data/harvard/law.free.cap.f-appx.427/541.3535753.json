The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 41 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Almaguer appeals. His counsel has moved to withdraw, and in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), he argues that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence by not varying downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">Almaguer has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence, which falls at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range, is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc). Additionally, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-20\">.
