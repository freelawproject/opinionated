We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo constitutional claims and questions of law, and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Khan v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 773, 776 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Martinez Hernandez was convicted on March 23, 1999, of possession of cocaine in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11350(a). Accordingly, Martinez Hernandez is ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Martinez Hernandez\u2019s contention that the IJ violated his right to due process by exhibiting bias and by not affording him an opportunity to present evidence in his favor is not supported by the record. <em>Cf. Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Insofar as Martinez Hernandez contends that the IJ erred by relying on an inconclusive record, his contention is unavailing as Martinez Hernandez bore the burden of proof to show eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d) (where evidence indicates that one of the mandatory grounds for denial of an application for relief may apply, alien bears burden to show eligibility for the requested relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-10\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
