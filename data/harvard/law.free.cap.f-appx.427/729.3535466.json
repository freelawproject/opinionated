First, he argues that the IJ incorrectly concluded that he was not a member of a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d Second, he argues that his right to due process was violated by a delay of nearly six years between the date he filed his application for asylum and the date of his asylum hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">To establish asylum eligibility, an alien must show (1) past persecution or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened because of his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Because the evidentiary standard for withholding of removal is higher than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, an applicant who does not meet the latter generally fails the former. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Pinz\u00f3n argues that he is eligible for asylum or withholding of removal because, as a volitional informant, he is a member of a particular social group. In assessing whether the alien\u2019s alleged group constitutes a particular social group, we consider the group\u2019s immutability and social visibility. <em>Castillo-Anas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s determination that \u201cnoncriminal informants working against the Cali drug cartel\u201d do not constitute a particular social group within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 1191. We upheld the BIA\u2019s reasoning that while activity as an informant is immutable to the extent that it is a historical fact, \u201cthe social visibility of informants is different in kind from the particular social groups that have been afforded protection under the INA\u201d because \u201cthe very nature of the activity prevents them from being recognized by society at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">Pinz\u00f3n, like the appellant in <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>was a noncriminal informant who worked against a Colombian drug cartel. He attempts to distinguish <em>Castillo-Arias </em>because he was paid for his work and was an informant for several years. But it is irrelevant that Pinz\u00f3n was paid because \u201cthose who engage in risks similar to those of the police or military, <em>regardless of motive, </em>do not receive protection as a particular social group under the INA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198 (emphasis added). The BIA did not err when it found that \u201cnoncriminal informants\u201d do not constitute a particular social group.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Pinzon\u2019s petition as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We review constitutional due process challenges <em>de novo. Avila v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>560 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). To establish a due process violation, Pinz\u00f3n must show deprivation of a liberty interest without due process of law. <em>Id. </em>He must also show that the deprivation substantially prejudiced him by affecting the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>It is well-established that an alien has a due process right to a full and fair deportation hearing. <em>See Ibrahim v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). As a threshold matter, Pinzon\u2019s due process claim has no merit because the government is not statutorily (or otherwise) required to process asylum applications within a specific time frame. Moreover, Pinz\u00f3n does not offer examples of testimony or evidence that he was unable to obtain because of the delay in his case. And Pinz\u00f3n never requested an earlier hearing date \u2014 instead, he requested more time to prepare his case, which the IJ allowed. Accordingly, we deny Pinzon\u2019s petition as to his due process claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">. The Government argues that Pinz\u00f3n has abandoned any challenge to the BIA's determination that Pinz\u00f3n did not demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution because Pinz\u00f3n did not raise these claims in his initial brief. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining \"a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>and its merits will not be addressed\u201d). We do not address this argument because Pinzon\u2019s claim fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-21\">. Because Pinzon\u2019s wife, Maria Fernanda Palau Echeverry, seeks derivative relief based on Pinz\u00f3n asylum application, we also affirm the denial of her petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
