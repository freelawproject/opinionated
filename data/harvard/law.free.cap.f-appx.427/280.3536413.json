He appeals, claiming, first, that his guilty plea was invalid because the district court failed to adequately review the elements of the offense and that the factual basis was insufficient to support the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Second, Brown asserts that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">We have reviewed the record, including the transcript of Brown\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, and find that there were no errors with respect to the Rule 11 plea colloquy that affected Brown\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Hairston, </em>522 F.3d 336, 341 (4th Cir.2008). During the plea hearing, the district court informed Brown of the nature of the charges, the maximum penalties he faced, and all of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, and found that Brown was competent and entering his plea voluntarily. The record discloses that Brown was adequately advised of the elements of each of the offenses that the Government would have to prove if he were to go to trial. We also find the evidence presented in the factual basis to be sufficient to support Brown\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Perry, </em>560 F.3d 246, 254 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 177, 175 L.Ed.2d 112 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Second, Brown claims that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecuting attorney was not licensed. We find that Brown has failed to establish a violation of his constitutional right to due process of law or prejudice warranting reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment arising from the fact that the Government\u2019s attorney had had his license to practice law suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
