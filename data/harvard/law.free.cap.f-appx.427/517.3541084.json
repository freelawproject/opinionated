His plea agreement preserved his right to appeal a penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>enhancement that he received for a prior felony drug offense. He also contends that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (Aug. 3, 2010), should be applied retroactively to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The panel has had the opportunity to consider the arguments advanced by the parties and to conduct our own independent review of the record on appeal. In this case, the district court entered an Order on April 29, 2009, which explains in detail why defendant\u2019s prior conviction in Michigan state court for possession of dihydrocodeinone qualifies as a prior \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). We agree with the reasoning of the district court and affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">With respect to the second issue raised by defendant, a prior panel of this court has decided that the FSA does not apply retroactively to cases on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Carradine, </em>621 F.3d 575 (6th Cir.2010). A panel of this court cannot overrule a published decision of another panel. <em>Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985). Defendant recognizes that <em>Carradine </em>is controlling authority but raises the issue to preserve it for possible en banc review, which he is entitled to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
