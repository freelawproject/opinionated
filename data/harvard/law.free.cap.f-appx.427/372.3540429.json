A certificate of appealability was granted on the issue whether the district court erred by denying Turner\u2019s claim that his appellate counsel, Cori Harbour, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge on hearsay grounds the admission of testimony by State witness Roy Snyder regarding his reactions to his conversations with the victim, J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">We must defer to a state habeas court\u2019s determination of the merits of the prisoner\u2019s claims unless the state decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). To obtain relief under \u00a7 2254, a state prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). \u201c[Ejven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Propes v. Quarteman, </em>573 F.3d 225, 227 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3272, 176 L.Ed.2d 1188 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Because Turner did not object at trial to at least two of the four instances at issue of Snyder\u2019s testimony, hearsay arguments regarding those statements were not properly preserved for appeal, and Harbour did not perform deficiently by failing to raise such unpreserved arguments. <em>See </em>Tex. R.App. P. 33.1(a)(1); <em>Fernandez v. State, </em>805 S.W.2d 451, 455-56 (Tex.Crim.App.1991); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Even if this court presumes that reasonable jurists could not disagree that Harbour performed deficiently by failing to challenge the admissibility of Snyder\u2019s testimony regarding his reactions to his other two conversations with J.S., in light of the other record evidence of his guilt, Turner cannot show \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement\u201d that he was prejudiced by Harbour\u2019s performance. <em>See Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87; <em>Strickland </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
