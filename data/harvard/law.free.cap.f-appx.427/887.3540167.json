Escudero seeks review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) dismissing his petition for review as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for the delay. <em>See Escudero v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. DA0752100118-I-1, 116 M.S.P.R. 83 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 30, 2010). Because the Board did not abuse its discretion, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-23\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">Escudero was employed as a Public Health Advisor by the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention. In 1982, Escudero signed a document entitled \u201cAcknowledgement of Understanding of Reassignment Requirement,\u201d in which Escudero indicated that he understood that the CDC may relocate him during the course of his employment. In particular, Escudero \u201caccept[ed] the relocation aspects\u201d of his career as a \u201cnormal condition of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-25\">In 2001, as part of a settlement of an action that Escudero filed at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Escudero was assigned to work in Houston, Texas as a Special Project Coordinator/Public Health Official in the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS), a CDC employment position created as part of a 2000 agreement between the CDC and the State of Texas. In 2007, TDSHS determined that Escudero\u2019s position was no longer needed, and the CDC subsequently offered Escudero a position in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Escudero declined the reassignment to Nashville and elected to retire, effective October 31, 2007. Escudero thereafter filed a complaint at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging, among other things, that his retirement was involuntary. In October of 2009, the agency issued a final decision finding neither discrimination nor retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Escudero then appealed the agency\u2019s final decision to the Board, arguing that his retirement was involuntary. After holding a hearing, the administrative judge assigned to Escudero\u2019s appeal concluded that Escudero failed to show that his retirement was involuntary. Thus, the Board concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Escudero\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The deadline for Escudero to file a petition for review by the full Board was April 28, 2010. That deadline passed, and Escudero filed a petition for review on May 3, 2010. The Clerk of the Board advised Escudero that his appeal appeared to be untimely filed and instructed Escudero to file a motion showing that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the late filing. Escudero failed to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Board then issued a final order determining that Escudero lacked good cause for filing a late petition. In particular, the Board noted that Escudero failed to present any evidence that would establish good cause. Escudero timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a Board decision is limited. We can only set aside the Board\u2019s decision if it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>see Briggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>331 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2003). The Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence \u201cif it is supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Brewer v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>227 Ct.Cl. 276, 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Board regulations provide that a petition for review of an initial decision must be filed within 35 days after issuance of the initial decision or, if the petitioner shows that he received the initial decision more than five days after its issuance, within 30 days of receipt of the initial decision. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(d). The Board can waive the time limit if the petitioner shows good cause for the delay. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1201.114(e). To establish good cause, the petitioner must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances. <em>Phillips v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed.Cir.1982). Whether a regulatory time limit should be excused for good cause \u201cis a matter committed to the Board\u2019s discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed.Cir.1992) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">In this ease, Escudero failed to present any evidence that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. In a supplemental brief filed in this court, Escudero declares that he filed his petition on April 26, 2010, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Indeed, the evidence that Escudero points to is an email dated May 6, 2010 that contains no indication that Escudero timely filed his petition for review. On these facts, we cannot conclude that the Board abused its discretion in concluding that Escudero\u2019s petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Instead of focusing on the timeliness issues, the bulk of Escudero\u2019s appeal challenges the administrative judge\u2019s determination that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Escudero\u2019s involuntary retirement appeal. While that issue is not presently before us, <em>Ashworth v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>190 Fed.Appx. 952, 952 (Fed.Cir.2006), we note that the administrative record contains substantial evidence to support the administrative judge\u2019s finding that Escudero failed to prove that his retirement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
