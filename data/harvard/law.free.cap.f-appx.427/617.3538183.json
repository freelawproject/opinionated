Thus, the magistrate had a substantial basis to determine that probable cause existed. <em>See generally United States v. Crews, </em>502 F.3d 1130, 1135 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Because the search warrant authorized officers to search for \u201cany and all paperwork, documents, vehicle registrations, driver\u2019s licenses, or identification cards with the names Sergio Betel Gomez, Antonio Gomez or any combination thereof\u2019 on them, the search of the rag was within the scope of the warrant. <em>Cf. United States v. Gomez-Soto, </em>723 F.2d 649, 654 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that if a warrant sufficiently describes the premises to be searched, this will justify a search of the personal effects therein belonging to the person occupying the premises if those objects <em>might </em>contain the items described in the warrant.\u201d (emphasis added)). A driver\u2019s license with a false name, or several, might well be concealed in a rag.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Also, the officer was performing \u201can otherwise lawful search\u201d for the items specified in the warrant, and would immediately recognize the item in the rag by feel as evidence of a crime. Thus, under the \u201cplain touch\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule, the district court did not err in refusing to suppress the firearm. <em>See Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
