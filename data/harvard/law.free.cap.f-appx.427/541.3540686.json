Dahlin appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. Upon de novo review of the record, <em>see Mason v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>559 F.3d 880, 884-85 (8th Cir.2009), we agree with the district court that Dahlin\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims were based solely on his disagreement with treatment decisions, <em>see Nelson v. Shuffman, </em>603 F.3d 439, 448-49 (8th Cir.2010) (prison physicians remain free to exercise their independent medical judgment, and inmate\u2019s mere disagreement of opinion over matters of expert medical judgment or over course of treatment does not rise to level of constitutional violation).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Dahlin\u2019s motion for appointment of a medical expert. The judgment is affirmed, and we deny Dahlin\u2019s request for an order directing appellees to provide him with an April 2011 incident report.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-17\">. The Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Arthur J. Boylan, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-29\">. We decline to address the new matters Dahlin raises on appeal, <em>see Stone v. Harry, </em>364 F.3d 912, 914-15 (8th Cir.2004); or to consider the new evidence he offers, <em>see Minn. Supply Co. v. Raymond Corp., </em>472 F.3d 524, 532 (8th Cir.2006) (this court considers only evidence that was before district court when summary judgment ruling was made).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
