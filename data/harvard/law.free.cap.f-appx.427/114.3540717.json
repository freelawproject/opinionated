For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-23\">Taylor filed two motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in District Court in 2009 and 2010. The District Court consolidated the cases and ordered Taylor to file an amended motion, before ultimately dismissing the case with prejudice on August 2, 2010. We denied his application for a certificate of appealability. (C.A. No. 10-3480.) On August 30, 2010, Taylor filed a \u201cPetition to challenge the subject matter jurisdiction, and personal jurisdiction of the [District] Court.\u201d On March 8, 2011, Taylor filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting that the District Court act on his motion challenging its jurisdiction. He argues that the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction has never been \u201cproven upon the record by the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-24\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in extraordinary cases, <em>see In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005); the petitioner must demonstrate that he has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain the relief desired and a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996). We recognize that approximately eight months have elapsed since Taylor filed his motion challenging the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. However, we cannot conclude that the overall delay in this matter warrants mandamus relief. <em>See Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79 (an appellate court \u201cmay issue a writ of mandamus on the ground that undue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction\u201d). The District Court\u2019s lack of urgency in addressing his motion is understandable, given that Taylor filed it after his case had been closed and that he had previous opportunities to challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. We are confident that the District Court will enter an order in due course. Accordingly, the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
