France\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">John France pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and (2). In preparation for sentencing, the probation office created a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR calculated France\u2019s base offense level as 24; recommended a four-level enhancement because France possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, i.e., manufacturing methamphetamine; determined that France was an armed career criminal because he had three prior qualifying convictions; and included a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. France\u2019s resulting adjusted offense level was 81, and his advisory Guideline\u2019s range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. As an armed career criminal, France also faced a statutorily-mandated minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">At the sentencing hearing, France objected to the PSR\u2019s determination that he was an armed career criminal. He argued that because two of his qualifying convictions were committed on the same day, they should count as a single offense, rather than as separate offenses. The district court disagreed. It concluded that the two challenged burglary convictions were separate offenses under \u00a7 924(e), reasoning that \u201c[e]ven a slight deviation of ... time is sufficient to allow the charges to be considered as separate offenses, particularly if they are at different locations and against different victims; and, of course, in this case, they were.\u201d The district court then sentenced France to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">France timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">France makes one argument on appeal: that the district court erred in counting his two burglary convictions separately for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), because it \u201cignored reliable judicial fact-find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ing by the state criminal court judge who determined ... that the two offenses ... actually both occurred on the same date; and were, based on the testimony of France himself, part of a continuous course of conduct \u2014 and not two separate offenses.\u201d Upon de novo review, <em>see United States v. Sawyers, </em>409 F.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir.2005) (abrogated on other grounds), we find this claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The ACCA provides that \u201ca person who violates [\u00a7 ] 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, ... shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Offenses are committed on different occasions if \u201cit is possible to discern the point at which the first offense is completed, and the subsequent point at which the second offense begins\u201d; it would have been possible for the offender \u201cto cease his criminal conduct after the first offense, and withdraw without committing the second offense\u201d; or the offenses are committed \u201cin different residences or business locations.\u201d <em>United States v. Paige, </em>634 F.3d 871, 873 (6th Cir.2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">In this case, France\u2019s contention that the district court erred by failing to give credence to the state court\u2019s decision is baseless for two reasons. First, the district court alternatively assumed that France committed the burglaries on the same day, and correctly concluded that that fact did not change the ACCA analysis. <em>See United States v. Brady, </em>988 F.2d 664, 668 (6th Cir.1993) (en banc) (rejecting the idea that \u201cmere proximity in time\u201d is enough to \u201cmerge ... offenses\u201d under the ACCA). Second, France\u2019s personal belief that his burglaries were part of the same course of conduct, as well as any state court determination to that effect (and France has not shown that there is one), are beside the point because the district court was required to make its own legal finding as to whether the crimes were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">As to the merits, France could have ceased his criminal conduct after the first offense, and he admits that he committed the burglaries at different times and places and against different victims. He testified: \u201cI went to one house, and then in the same day, 20 minutes later, I went to the next house.\u201d On this record, we agree with the district court that France committed the burglaries on \u201coccasions different from one another\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Cf. Brady, </em>988 F.2d at 669 (concluding that a defendant\u2019s prior robbery convictions were separate offenses because, \u201calthough committed within less than an hour of each other,\u201d the crimes were committed at \u201cdifferent times and places and against different victims\u201d); <em>United States v. Carnes, </em>309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied </em>537 U.S. 1240, 123 S.Ct. 1371, 155 L.Ed.2d 211 (2003) (holding that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions for burglary were separate offenses because he had completed the first burglary before committing the second burglary, such that it was \u201cpossible to identify an endpoint between the two offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
