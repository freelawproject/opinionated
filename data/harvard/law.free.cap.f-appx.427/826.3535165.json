Leis-es argues that: (1) her experiences in Venezuela, taken cumulatively, constituted past persecution and occurred on account of a protected ground, and (2) she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. After thorough review, we grant the petition for review, vacate the agency\u2019s decision, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>We review only the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, but where the BIA agrees with the IJ about an issue, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA regarding that issue. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Here, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Leises failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. Specifically, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Leises\u2019s experiences in Venezuela did not rise to the level of persecution. Therefore, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s findings with respect to these issues. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the highly deferential substantial-evidence test and will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350-51 (quotations omitted). Under the substantial-evidence test, we may reverse a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">An alien may receive asylum in the United States if she is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir. 2005). The INA defines a refugee as a person who cannot return to his home country due to \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Thus, to be eligible for asylum, an alien must establish, with credible evidence, either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, both on account of a protected ground. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31. \u201c[A] showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">An alien need not establish past persecution to qualify for asylum based on a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352. To establish such independent well-founded fear, an alien needs to show \u201ca reasonable possibility\u201d of suffering persecution upon return to her home country. <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must establish that, if returned to her country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground, namely, race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The standard for establishing a claim for withholding of removal is substantially the same as for asylum, except that an alien cannot qualify for such relief without a presumption or a showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and, if the alien fails to establish past persecution, she must demonstrate a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d probability of future persecution rather than the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d required for asylum. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). Consequently, an alien generally cannot qualify for withholding of removal if she is unable to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>We define persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). To illustrate, we have held that menacing phone calls and threats to an alien, coupled with a bombing at the restaurant where she worked, did not compel a finding of persecution. <em>Id. </em>We have also rejected a claim of persecution where an alien, in addition to receiving threats, was detained at a police station for 36 hours and was kicked and beaten with a belt, suffering multiple scratches and bruises. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353 (concluding that no persecution existed where the petitioner was arrested for participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, detained for four days, and monitored by authorities after his release).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On the other hand, persecution may well exist where an alien has suffered a direct threat to her life, even absent physical harm. Specifically, we have found persecution where the alien was shot at while driving. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233-34 (11th Cir.2007). In <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>the alien received numerous intensifying death threats from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), and several FARC members attempted to kidnap his daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 1228-29. The alien\u2019s only physical altercation with the FARC occurred when two armed men on motorcycles followed the alien on his way home and fired on his car, leaving several bullet holes. <em>Id. </em>at 1229. The alien managed to evade the attackers and suffered no harm. <em>Id. </em>In reversing the IJ\u2019s finding of no persecution, we stated: \u201cWe have no difficulty concluding that intentionally being shot at in a moving car multiple times by two armed men on motorcycles qualifies as \u2018extreme\u2019 under any definition. Put simply, attempted murder is persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233. We also observed that a lack of physical harm \u201cdoes not undermine the basic conclusion that being shot at while driving is sufficiently \u2018extreme\u2019 to constitute persecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The BIA and the IJ need not \u201caddress specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented, but they must consider the issues raised and announce their decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that they have heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010) (quotations and alterations omitted). Where the BIA or the IJ has failed to give \u201creasoned consideration or make adequate findings,\u201d we remand for further proceedings because we are \u201cunable to review the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In this case, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Leises\u2019s experiences did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1233-34. In addition to other threatening incidents\u2014 including threatening phone calls and a beating \u2014 Leises experienced a direct attempt on her life when two individuals on a motorcycle fired on her as she drove to work. In fact, one of the bullets hit the driver\u2019s door. Despite any factual differences between this case and <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>there we focused largely on the fact that the attackers fired bullets at the alien, putting his life in immediate danger, and this case involves an almost identical scenario. <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34. Like in <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>Leises experienced more than just verbal harassment or intimidation, and although she did not suffer serious physical harm during any of the incidents, a lack of physical harm does not prevent a finding of persecution in a case such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>this one. <em>See id. </em>at 1284. Accordingly, Leises suffered past persecution when men on a motorcycle shot at her, and \u201c[t]he motorcyclists\u2019 poor marksmanship does not undermine this conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Moreover, the IJ and the BIA did not adequately address whether Leises\u2019s past persecution occurred on account of a protected ground. As the record shows, the BIA appeared to agree with the IJ that Leises failed to establish persecution \u201con account of political opinion or imputed political opinion,\u201d but the IJ made no finding as to whether the 2008 threatening phone calls, the beating, and the car shooting occurred on account of a protected ground; he only found, in relevant part, that Leises failed to establish past persecution. <em>See Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 949 (\u201cWe cannot meaningfully review the ruling of the Board when it relies entirely on a ruling that the immigration judge did not make.\u201d). Nor is it clear whether the IJ gave any consideration to relevant parts of Leises\u2019s testimony (found credible by the IJ) and her asylum application, which indicate that incidents from 2007 occurred because of Leises\u2019s and her husband\u2019s participation in political activities. <em>See id. </em>at 949-50 (concluding that the BIA failed to provide a reasoned explanation for finding no nexus to a protected ground where the BIA reasoned that \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d of such a nexus existed, but where neither the BIA nor the IJ acknowledged relevant testimony or reconciled that testimony with their findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Furthermore, the BIA and the IJ made insufficient findings as to whether the government has rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, or whether Leises has established an independent well-founded fear of persecution. As the record shows, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Leises failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. In addressing Leises\u2019s claims of future persecution, the IJ stated: \u201cThere is not enough there to rise to the level of past persecution, so she would not have a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Without the presumption, the respondent would not be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal or protection under [CAT].\u201d However, the law is clear that an alien may \u201cestablish a well-founded fear of persecution without proving past persecution.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352. In analyzing Leises\u2019s claims, the IJ either failed to address this independent fear of persecution, or he erroneously applied the law by stating that future persecution may only be established through a showing of past persecution. Because we cannot meaningfully review these issues, we remand this case for further proceedings. <em>See Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-5\">. The most relevant case the BIA cited in support of its finding of a lack of persecution was <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231, as described above. However, <em>Sanchez Jimenez </em>specifically distinguished <em>Sepulveda </em>on the ground that in <em>Sepulveda, </em>\"the evidence did not compel the conclusion that the bomb was 'directed at' \" the alien, and \"there appears to have been no evidence of the reason for the bombing,\u201d while in <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>evidence compelled the conclusion that the shooting was directed at the alien. <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1234 n. 10; <em>see Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Here, regardless of whether other incidents were directed at Leises or her family, no one contests that the car shooting was directed at Leises, especially given that her car was the only one hit among the many surrounding cars, and the shooters wore the same red berets as individuals who physically beat her at a shopping mall. Accordingly, <em>Sepulveda </em>does not undermine Leises\u2019s claims. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1234 n. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
