R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed November 5, 2010, be affirmed. The district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint as frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(E)(1)(B). <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Dismissal was also proper because the complaint failed to meet the minimal pleading requirements under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d in order to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en bane. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
