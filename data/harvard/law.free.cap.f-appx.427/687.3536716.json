HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">After Defendant Joseph Dale Flowers violated the terms of his supervised release, the United States District Court for the District of Kansas revoked his release and sentenced him to incarceration for 12 months and one day and supervised release for 12 months. Defendant appeals his sentence, arguing that it was substantively unreasonable. We disagree and affirm. Defendant has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guideline-range sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">In October 2005 Defendant pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of possessing with intent to distribute approximately 40 grams of a mixture containing methamphetamine, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). On July 28, 2006, the district court imposed sentences of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently. His sentence was later reduced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Defendant\u2019s term of supervised release began on September 15, 2010. On November 17 the probation office executed a petition to revoke it. The petition alleged that Defendant had violated the terms of his supervised release by (1) failing to report to the probation office within 72 hours after being released from prison; (2) failing to make himself available for a visit by a probation officer; (3) possessing and consuming methamphetamine; (4) failing to participate in an approved program for substance abuse; and (5) failing to report to the probation office as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">The district court held a revocation hearing on December 9, 2010. At the hearing Defendant stipulated to the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>leged violations and asked that the court modify the conditions of his release to require him to complete an inpatient drug-treatment program. The court continued the hearing for 60 days and ordered Defendant to begin an inpatient treatment program immediately. It also imposed a curfew and required Defendant to reside with his parents. The court told Defendant that this was \u201c[absolutely [his] last chance,\u201d R., Vol. 2 at 11, and that it had \u201creached the end of [its] rope as to what [it] [could] do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Defendant began inpatient drug treatment on December 9, 2010, and successfully completed the program on December 22. But within a month of finishing the program he failed to submit to drug testing on four occasions and once submitted a urine specimen that tested positive for methamphetamine. In response, the probation office amended its petition and again asked the district court to revoke Defendant\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The district court resumed the revocation hearing on February 3, 2011. At the outset of the hearing, Defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged his prior stipulations and said that Defendant was \u201cvery cognizant of the Court\u2019s statements\u201d at the prior hearing. Nevertheless, she requested that the court continue Defendant on supervised release, and stated that he would \u201cabide by any additional conditions that the Court might set.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. If, however, the court was not amenable to this request, Defendant wished to receive a sentence of 12 months and one day (to make him eligible for good-time credit), with no supervision following his release. The court, voicing frustration with Defendant\u2019s repeated relapses, rejected the proposal. Although the court thought that Defendant needed help more than punishment, it had \u201ctrouble reaching any solution ... except incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements suggest that a defendant with a grade B violation and criminal-history category of IV should receive a sentence within a range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 incarceration. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4. Following this suggestion, the district court sentenced Defendant to incarceration for 12 months and one day followed by one year of supervised release. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Our review of the sentence imposed is deferential. \u201c[W]e will not reverse a revocation sentence imposed by the district court if it can be determined from the record to have been ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir.2005) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). A revocation-of-supervised-release sentence within the range suggested by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, such as the sentence here, is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>633 F.3d 1229, 1233 (10th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Defendant does not contest the district court\u2019s calculation of the suggested sentencing range. Instead, he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the court\u2019s stated goal of helping him overcome his methamphetamine addiction and the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the sentence imposed \u201ccommunicated to [him] that successfully completing inpatient treatment, and trying to get back on the right track meant nothing.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 6. He suggests that continuing his supervised release rather than imposing additional incarceration would have been a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">We disagree. The sentence proposed by Defendant may have been reasonable. But that does not mean that a harsher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>penalty was unreasonable. As we have previously explained, there is often \u201ca range of possible [sentences that] the facts and law at issue can fairly support[.] ... [W]e will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment so long as it falls within the realm of these rationally available choices.\u201d <em>United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1053 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cThe fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Defendant\u2019s failure to heed the district court\u2019s warning that this was \u201c[absolutely [his] last chance\u201d to avoid incarceration, R., Vol. 3 at 11, together with his history of repeated relapses, justifies the sentence imposed. Defendant has not overcome the presumption that his within-guideline sentence fell within the realm of rationally available choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
