Our jurisdiction is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>For substantially the same reasons stated in Magistrate Judge Kellison\u2019s thorough memorandum opinion, <em>Sazhneva v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>No. 08-300, 2009 WL 3246979 (ED.Cal. Sept. 30, 2009), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Sazhneva argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) who denied her claim erred by, first, determining her residual functional capacity without considering some of her medical conditions and, second, relying on the medical opinions of non-examining doctors over the contrary opinions of a treating doctor and an examining doctor. We are satisfied that the ALJ considered all of Sazhneva\u2019s relevant medical conditions. But even if certain conditions were overlooked, Sazhneva has not established why they are material to a determination of her residual functional capacity. <em>See Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 543 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe claimant must prove not only the existence of an impairment but that the impairment prevents him from performing his past work.\u201d). Further, the ALJ gave \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record,\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation omitted), for relying on the medical opinions of C. Richard Dann and Sudhir Jaituni, non-examining physicians, over the contrary opinions of Pavel Polskiy, a treating physician, and Gabriel Borges, a non-treating examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We agree with the district court that \u201c[wjhile the evidence may support a different conclusion, there is sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, and that decision is not to be overturned on such a record.\u201d <em>Sazhneva, </em>2009 WL 3246979, at *10. Because the decision of the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
