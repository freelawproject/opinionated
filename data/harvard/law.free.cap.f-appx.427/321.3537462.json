Garcia contends that the within-guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and therefore is substantively unreasonable. He specifically argues U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 essentially double-counts his criminal history. He contends that his offense constitutes a mere international trespass and that the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his benign motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">We review the sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Garcia\u2019s guidelines range sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">We have previously rejected the argument that an appellant is entitled to relief because \u00a7 2L1.2 double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). We have also determined that the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument raised by Garcia does not justify disturbing an otherwise presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>lively reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 379. We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
