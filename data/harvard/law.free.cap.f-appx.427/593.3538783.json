We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-26\">1. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal, because Petitioners failed to show that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their United States citizen children. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 978 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-27\">2. However, we do have jurisdiction to review Petitioners\u2019 due process claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>See id. </em>Petitioners\u2019 due process rights were not violated when the IJ denied their request to present additional evidence after the BIA\u2019s limited remand. The BIA\u2019s order was sufficiently limited; it vacated its prior decision and limited the scope of the remand to proceedings consistent with <em>Molina-Camacho v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 937, 940-42 (9th Cir.2004) (overruled by <em>Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc)). <em>See Fernandes v. Holder, </em>619 F.3d 1069, 1074 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Even if the IJ should have considered the additional evidence, the error is harmless because the BIA considered the additional evidence. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">3. To the extent that the BIA considered Petitioners\u2019 second appeal as a motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600-01 (9th Cir.2006). The additional evidence concerned the same basic hardship grounds as the Petitioners\u2019 application for cancellation of removal, which the BIA rejected as those ordinarily expected to result from an alien\u2019s deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">4. Petitioners\u2019 argument regarding eligibility for voluntary departure lacks merit. Petitioners were initially granted voluntary departure by the BIA. The BIA in its March 15, 2007 Order again noted that Petitioners were previously granted voluntary departure and reissued an order granting voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">5. Petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit. First, the February 3, 2004 decision by the BIA was issued by a three-member panel as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)(vi). Second, the BIA did not issue a \u201csummary dismissal,\u201d use \u201cboilerplate\u201d language, or fail to \u201cprovide a comprehensive reason for its decision.\u201d To the contrary, the BIA\u2019s decisions contained individualized review of Petitioners\u2019 circumstances and \u201ccontain[ed] a statement of its reasons for denying the petitioner[s] relief adequate for us to conduct our review.\u201d <em>See Ghaly, </em>58 F.3d at 1430. We require nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b619-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
