Martinez asserted that she was eligible for relief based on her political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The IJ and BIA determined that Martinez was not credible and denied relief. After thorough review, we deny Martinez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-27\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>asylum because the BIA found that Martinez\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201c8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse [her] untimely filing\u201d of an asylum application). We therefore dismiss that portion of Martinez\u2019s petition for review. Our review is limited to the denial of her application for withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">\u2018Where the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Najjar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA issued its own decision in which it relied on the IJ\u2019s findings, we will review both decisions. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but we review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for substantial evidence to support them. <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230-31. The substantial evidence test is highly deferential. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. We \u201cmust affirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). In making that determination, \u201c[w]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision, and we will reverse the agency\u2019s findings only if the record compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, a credibility determination may be based on \u201cany inaccuracies or falsehoods in [the applicant\u2019s] statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d An adverse-credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of relief, especially if the applicant fails to produce corroborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. \u201cIf the IJ explicitly determines that the alien lacks credibility, the IJ must offer specific, cogent, reasons for the finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts to \u201cthe applicant alien to show that the ... credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. As the basis for the adverse credibility finding, the BIA and IJ pointed to specific inconsistencies between Martinez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>asylum application, testimony at the removal hearing, asylum interview, and the documentary evidence that she submitted. Specifically, the BIA and IJ pointed out that there were numerous discrepancies regarding the details of Martinez\u2019s alleged persecution and dates significant to her claim, such as when she joined the Democratic Action Party. After review of the evidence, we conclude that the record does not compel us to overturn the adverse credibility finding. Accordingly, Martinez has not carried her burden of showing past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution entitling her to withholding of removal. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. Martinez has failed to carry her burden of showing that she would more likely than not be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the Venezuelan government upon deportation. <em>See Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1201 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we deny Martinez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-8\">. Martinez included her husband Julio Enrique Blanco Chirinos and her daughter Marian Alejandra Blanco Lander as derivative beneficiaries in her asylum application. The statutes and regulations governing withholding of removal and CAT relief do not create derivative rights. <em>See Delgado </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that the withholding-of-removal statute does not create derivative rights); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c) (discussing eligibility of applicant for CAT relief but not derivative beneficiaries). Thus, Blanco Chirinos and Blanco Lander are not entitled to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
