For the following reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Gutierrez entered the United States in November 2004 on a nonimmigrant visa, which he overstayed. After filing an application for asylum and withholding of removal. he was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Gutierrez conceded removability but reaffirmed his application for asylum and withholding of removal. He also sought protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), or in the alternative, voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Gutierrez\u2019s claims are based on a series of encounters with the Shining Path that occurred while he was studying to become a Catholic priest. In 1999, the Church sent Gutierrez from a seminary in Guayaquil, Ecuador to a seminary in his hometown of Hu\u00e1nuco, Peru to continue his studies and to obtain pastoral experience. Accordingly, in the spring of 2000, he began working as a pastor on weekends, which involved making home visits and working on social justice projects. In July or August 2000, Gutierrez began receiving threats in the form of fifteen or sixteen leaflets that were left at the parish. The leaflets stated that the \u201c[Cjhurch was deceiving the population and stealing from the people.\u201d The leaflets also stated that if \u201cthey\u201d did not back down, \u201cthey\u201d would have problems or be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Then, in September 2000, three people who identified themselves as members of the Shining Path \u201ccame in\u201d and repeated the insults contained in the leaflets, and \u201ctold us that in order to avoid problems ... we had to leave that zone and not to interfere with anything.\u201d Upon reporting this incident to his superiors at the seminary, Gutierrez was told that he should quit working as a pastor. His superiors also told him not to report the incident to the police because they wanted to \u201ckeep it within the seminary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Gutierrez remained at the seminary until January 2001. He was then invited by Father Oswaldo Rodriguez to help run a home for juveniles in Churubamba, Peru, which is located about an hour-and-a-half from Hu\u00e1nuco. He also participated in pastoral duties in Churubamba and the surrounding communities, which entailed evening visits to peasants, teaching catechism, and saying mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">In June 2001, Gutierrez again received several threatening leaflets, accusing the Church of stealing from the community, calling him a dog, and threatening his life. The next month, four people entered the chapel and identified themselves as members of the Shining Path from Alta Huallaga. They told Gutierrez that he \u201cwas an obstacle against\u201d their projects and that it \u201cwas not good that [he] was visiting the communities.\u201d When Gutierrez refused to stop his pastoral duties, the individuals grabbed him and forced him into a car. He was made to crouch uncomfortably behind the driver\u2019s seat for an hour-and-a-half while the kidnappers drove to Hu\u00e1nuco. During the drive to Hu\u00e1nuco, the kidnappers threatened to kill him, stating that they had killed other priests, and it \u201cwas no difference to ... eliminate\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">After being dropped off in front of the Hu\u00e1nuco cathedral, Gutierrez walked to his house. The next day he reported the incident to a judge and to Father Rodriguez and the Bishop. The Church superiors advised him to leave, and told him not to pursue the judicial complaint by going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to the Truth Commission, the next step in the process. A few days later, Gutierrez left Hu\u00e1nuco and moved in with his sister in Lima. While there, his sister-in-law, with whom he had lived in Hu\u00e1nuco, told him that people whom she did not recognize came to her house looking for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A week or so later, Gutierrez moved to Ecuador, where he remained until February 2008. Gutierrez experienced no problems in Ecuador, but testified that his sister-in-law received more visits from strangers in mid-2002. In February 2003, Gutierrez moved to Guatemala, where he also experienced no problems. His sister, who lived in Lima, told him that she had received several phone calls from people who said that he \u201cshould take care of [himself], and that the group Shining Path had eyes and ears everywhere.\u201d The calls stopped in 2003 when his sister changed her phone number and moved. Additionally, during the time Gutierrez lived in Ecuador and Guatemala, he returned to Peru without incident on three occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Gutierrez left Guatemala in 2004 and came to the United States after being invited by a priest in Florida to work with the Hispanic community. He is no longer involved with the Catholic Church and has become a member of the Episcopalian Church. However, he believes that he would be in danger if he returned to Peru because \u201c[f]or the Shining Path group, once they mark you, you\u2019re marked forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Gutierrez\u2019s claims for relief, determining that the incidents he described did not rise to the level of persecution, that he had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that he failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, adding its own analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Gutierrez has now filed a petition for review, which the government opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">We have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). In this case, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004). The decisions are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard and will be upheld \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">The IJ determined that the incidents described by Gutierrez, considered alone or cumulatively, do not amount to persecution. We agree. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005) (reiterating that persecution is defined as \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom\u201d) (internal citation omitted). While being forced into a car and held for almost two hours was undoubtedly traumatic, it is not persecution. <em>See, e.g., Kibinda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>477 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir.2007) (finding that five-day detention of a 16-year-old boy by Angolan army did not rise to the level of persecution, as the conduct complained of was not \u201cextreme\u201d); <em>cf. Voci v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 607, 614-15 (3d Cir.2005) (finding that multiple severe beatings and intimidation tactics rose to the level of persecution). Further, although a death threat that occurred while being detained could be considered a threat of a \u201chighly imminent and menacing nature,\u201d in this case the threat\u2019s impact is diminished because Gutierrez\u2019s kidnappers did not physically injure him. <em>See Li v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 157, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005). Moreover, neither the threatening leaflets nor phone calls amount to past persecution, whether considered alone or in conjunction with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>other incidents. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the determination that Gutierrez failed to demonstrate past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Gutierrez has declined to challenge the conclusion that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear or clear probability of future persecution, precluding success as to his request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Zubeda, </em>333 F.3d at 469-70. Finally, we agree that Gutierrez failed to establish eligibility for CAT protection, as he did not offer sufficient evidence that he is likely to be tortured upon his return to Peru. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In sum, the evidence does not compel us to overturn the BIA\u2019s decision to deny the petitioner\u2019s claims, and for the foregoing reasons, we deny Gutierrez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-16\">. Gutierrez\u2019s brief on appeal argues that the BIA erred by \"upholding the IJ\u2019s finding that the petitioner lacked credibility.\u201d We note, however, that neither the IJ nor the BIA determined that Gutierrez was not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
