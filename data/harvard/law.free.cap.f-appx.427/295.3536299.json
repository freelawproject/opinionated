Nolley argues that the decision to reduce his sentence by only eight months was an abuse of discretion because the district court focused solely on his post-conviction conduct and failed to address whether the extent of the reduction was consistent with Amendment 706\u2019s goal of alleviating the sentencing disparity between offenses involving crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where his guidelines range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2009). In such cases, the sentencing court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence is informed by the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the pertinent guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court is required to consider \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community\u201d that may result from a reduction in sentence and it may also consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct occurring after imposition of the original term of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court has no obligation to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not required to provide reasons or to explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673-74 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). In this case, however, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Nolley\u2019s extensive post-conviction prison disciplinary record in determining that an eight-month reduction in sentence was appropriate. No abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
