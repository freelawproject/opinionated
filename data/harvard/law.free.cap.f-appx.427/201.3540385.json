Shortly thereafter, he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). He alleged that his wife underwent two forced abortions and that he left China because he feared that he would be sterilized'for violating the country\u2019s one-child policy. In 2004, an Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied the application, concluding that Liu had not met his burden of proof. The BIA affirmed without opinion, and we denied Liu\u2019s petition for review. <em>Liu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>236 Fed. Appx. 744 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In August 2007, Liu filed a motion to reopen, claiming that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel and asserting that country conditions in China had changed. The BIA denied the motion, concluding that it was untimely and that Liu had not satisfied the requirements stated in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Liu filed a petition for review, which we denied in part and granted in part. <em>Liu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>296 Fed.Appx. 253 (3d Cir. 2008). In particular, we held that the motion to reopen was untimely, that Liu was not entitled to equitable tolling, and that he did not make any effort to comply with any of the procedural requirements stated in <em>Lozada. </em>But because there was no indication that the BIA had considered whether Liu satisfied the conditions for reopening based on changed country conditions, we remanded the matter to the BIA. <em>Liu, </em>296 Fed.Appx. 253, at 256. On remand, the Board held that Liu\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish a change in country conditions so as to create an exception to the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen. Liu did not file a petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Liu filed a second motion to reopen in January 2010, seeking to submit a \u201csuccessive asylum application ... because of changed country conditions and changed personal circumstances.\u201d This time Liu alleged that he feared persecution based on his participation in pro-democracy political groups in the United States, such as the China Democracy Party (\u201cCDP\u201d) and the Federation for a Democratic Party (\u201cFDC\u201d). He also claimed that Chinese authorities visited his wife and warned her that Liu had to stop his political activities. Liu further asserted that \u201c[c]onditions in China have changed greatly regarding the ability to propagate any ideas dissenting from the official one-party line on the Internet or traditional media since [he] was denied asylum.\u201d To support the allegedly changed country conditions, Liu submitted State Department reports, news articles describing CDP members who had been arrested upon their return to China, and an affidavit from a friend in China surmising that Liu will be persecuted if he returns because of the government\u2019s increased suppression of political dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">On August 18, 2010, the BIA denied the motion to reopen, holding that it was time- and number-barred and that Liu did not qualify for the exception from those requirements based on changed circumstances arising in China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The Board concluded that Liu\u2019s involvement in pro-democracy organizations constituted a change in per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>sonal circumstances and not changed country conditions, that he failed to establish that the Chinese government was aware of his political activities in the United States, and that he had not demonstrated a relevant change in country conditions based on China\u2019s treatment of returnees who participated in pro-democracy activities. Liu filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242 [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252], We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Filja v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 241, 251 (3d Cir.2006). Under this standard, we may reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002). An alien generally may file only one motion to reopen, and must file the motion with the BIA \u201cno later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The time and number requirements do not apply to motions that rely on evidence of \u201cchanged country conditions,\u201d INA \u00a7 240(e)(7)(C)(ii) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) ], or \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality ... if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The term \u201cprevious hearing\u201d in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) refers to the proceedings before the IJ. <em>Filja, </em>447 F.3d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Liu does not dispute that the BIA correctly determined that the motion to reopen was untimely and number-barred. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). In addition, the BIA correctly held that Liu\u2019s alleged membership in pro-democracy political groups in the United States is a change in his personal circumstance, not a change in country conditions that would support reopening. <em>See Liu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 145, 150-51 (3d Cir.2009); <em>see also Liu v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 485, 492 (6th Cir.2009) (holding that \u201cmembership and participation in the CDP and its activities in the United States ... demonstrated a change in [Petitioner\u2019s] personal circumstances but did not demonstrate changed country conditions in China.\u201d). Liu maintains, however, that the BIA \u201cabused its discretion because it did not explicitly consider all of the evidence of changed country conditions.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The BIA is required to \u201cactually consider the evidence and argument that a party presents.\u201d <em>Zheng v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>549 F.3d 260, 266 (3d Cir.2008) <em>(quoting Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001)). Indeed, \u201cthe BIA abuses its discretion if it fails completely to address evidence of changed country circumstances offered by a petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268 <em>(quoting Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006)). Here, the Board specifically identified the evidence that Liu submitted in support of his claim, including evidence of changed country conditions that \u201cmaterially bears on his claim.\u201d <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 81 (2d Cir.2005). In particular, the BIA noted Liu\u2019s submission of \u201cvarious county reports that address the government\u2019s crackdown on political opponents in China,\u201d the statement from Liu\u2019s friend describing \u201cmore and more severe\u201d government suppression, and other \u201cevidence of county conditions in China,\u201d which included news articles about the arrests of two CDP members. After considering this evidence, the Board held that Liu had not demonstrated a relevant change in country conditions in China. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the BIA adequately considered the materials submitted by Liu in support of his claim of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>We also agree that Liu\u2019s evidence did not establish changed country conditions in China sufficient to warrant reopening. Liu\u2019s changed country conditions argument relied primarily on excerpts from State Department Country Reports, which described harassment, detention, and imprisonment of those perceived to be a threat to the Chinese government. Those Reports, however, do not demonstrate a material change in the treatment of members of pro-democracy political groups since the 2004 proceedings before the IJ. For instance, the 2007 Report states that individuals \u201cwho participate in high-profile pro-democracy activities in the United States <em>still </em>run the risk of arrest and imprisonment should they return to China.\u201d (emphasis added). Notably, the 2004 State Department Profile of Asylum Claims, which was submitted in connection with Liu\u2019s initial asylum proceedings, indicates that political dissenters generally, and CDP members specifically, faced repression by the Chinese government. Although Liu quotes portions of the more recent State Department reports that refer to \u201cincreased\u201d harassment, detention, and censorship, those alleged changes pertain generally to the treatment of the press and those perceived as threats to government authority, not to members of pro-democracy groups specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Liu also relied on affidavits from his nephew and a friend which suggested that Liu would face persecution in China based on his political activism. Liu\u2019s nephew claimed that Chinese authorities \u201casked [Liu\u2019s wife] to inform [him] to quit the FDC ... immediately\u201d and \u201cthreatened ... that if [Liu] returned, he must report to the ... [p]olice [s]tation ... and accept investigation and punishment.\u201d Liu\u2019s friend claimed that because \u201cin recent years the Chinese government\u2019s suppression on democratic movements became more and more severe,\u201d Liu \u201cwill definitely be persecuted\u201d if he returns to China. These affidavits provide, at most, anecdotal evidence of China\u2019s long-standing policy of prohibiting political dissent. Accordingly, we agree that the affidavits do not sufficiently demonstrate a change in country conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In sum, because the BIA properly concluded that Liu did not satisfy the exception to the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen based changed country conditions, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. Throughout the immigration proceedings, the petitioner\u2019s name has also appeared as \"Yong Zhao,\u201d \"Youngzhao,\u201d and \"Yougzhao.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">. Because Liu failed to establish that reopening was warranted, we reject any assertion that he is entitled to file a successive asylum application pursuant to INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D)] or to pursue relief under the CAT. <em>Liu, </em>555 F.3d at 150 (explaining that \"8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) allows successive asylum applications only within the 90-day reopening period for orders denying asylum unless the alien can show changed country conditions on the required accompanying motion to reopen.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
