Damian argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court did not consider whether an upward departure under the Guidelines was appropriate before imposing an upward variance, the district court did not adequately explain the extent of the upward variance, and the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">Sentences, whether inside or outside the advisory guidelines range, are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard for procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Damian\u2019s argument that the district court should have first considered whether an upward departure under the Guidelines was appropriate before imposing an upward variance is unavailing. A district court is not required to \u201cconsult or comply\u201d with \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Guidelines prior to the consideration or imposition of a non-guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 <em>&amp; </em>n. 43 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">As for Damian\u2019s contention that the district court failed to explain the extent of the imposed variance, the record belies this assertion. The district court did state reasons for its upward variance \u2014 the sentencing goal of deterrence; the nature, circumstances or severity of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; and the need to promote respect for the law. The district court specifically voiced concern about the 32 times Damian illegally reentered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-24\">Lastly, Damian\u2019s non-Guidelines sentence of 32 months of imprisonment, a 16-month variance from the top of his 10 to 16 month advisory guidelines sentencing range, is substantially reasonable. Damian\u2019s sentence is supported by numerous \u00a7 3553(a) factors and is less than the statutorily authorized sentence of 10 years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>imprisonment set forth in the statute of conviction. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 812-13 (5th Cir.2008). Also, we have upheld variances greater than this variance. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 &amp; n. 40 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, in light of the record and the deference that this court affords to the district court\u2019s findings, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a non-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A7g\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
