Liebb argues that there was not \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the denial of his parole. In light of <em>Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 859, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011) (per curiam), we hold that Liebb\u2019s federal right of due process was not violated. Liebb does not argue that he was denied an opportunity to speak at his hearing and contest the evidence against him, that he was denied access to his record in advance, or that he was not notified of the reasons why parole was denied. <em>See id. </em>at 862. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-18\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
