Slough, both proceeding pro se and <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims without prejudice against the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (\u201cTDFPS\u201d), Tarrant County, the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office, Safe Haven Mission, and several employees of these entities in them individual and official capacities. On appeal, Appellants contend that the district court improperly dismissed their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment unreasonable search-and-seizure claim that Defendants entered their home without consent and removed their child without a warrant, court order, or exigent circumstances. While the district court correctly dismissed the claims as to all defendants other than Carnesha Collins, we find that the district court erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 unreasonable search-and-seizure claim against Collins. Therefore, we affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">On or about June 15, 2009, Plaintiffs Lorenzo Allen Thomas and Heather D. Shough got into an argument. The two lived together at the time with their young daughter. As a result of the argument, Shough left the home late one night and relocated to a shelter, where she informed the counselors that Thomas had choked her and that she was a victim of domestic violence. Both Shough and Thomas now claim that Thomas did not abuse Shough, but that Shough manufactured the allegations because she was angry at Thomas for continuing to smoke marijuana. Regardless, Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges that a call was placed to TDFPS, and that Defendant Carnesha Collins, an employee of TDFPS, told Shough that if she left the shelter she would not be allowed to take her daughter with her. Collins also allegedly informed Shough that if TDFPS found out that she had contact with Thomas, TDFPS would remove their child from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the home. Shough then called Thomas, who agreed to leave the house so that Shough and their child could return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">After Shough returned home with the child, on or about June 23, 2009, Collins paid a visit to Shough\u2019s residence. It is unclear from the complaint whether or not this visit was scheduled. The complaint alleges that Collins knocked on Shough\u2019s door, which Shough opened, and that Collins then walked into the house uninvited and began questioning Shough about why she left the shelter, whether she had been using drugs, and whether she had been seeing Thomas. Shough admitted to smoking marijuana on June 19, and denied having contact with Thomas except once when she turned him away when he tried to collect personal items from the house. Collins then allegedly drafted a \u201csafety plan,\u201d whereby TDFPS would remove the child if Shough used drugs or had contact with Thomas in the future. The complaint states that later the same day, Shough took her daughter to the doctor for a physical and her daughter was given a \u201chealthy report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On June 25, 2009, Collins and three unidentified women allegedly awakened Shough by knocking at her door. The complaint states that Collins and the women told Shough that she must move back to Ohio to live with her parents if she wanted to retain custody of the child. After initially refusing, Shough called her parents on the phone to discuss arrangements. After hanging up, Collins claimed that Shough had told Shough\u2019s mother on the phone that she had been in contact with Thomas, which Shough denied. Collins then convinced Shough to take a drug test, and while taking the test, one of the women allegedly grabbed Shough\u2019s daughter and ran out the door. The complaint alleges that Collins then gave Shough a \u201cnotice of removal of child\u201d and told Shough: \u201cNow you can be with [Thomas] all you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Because Appellants only contest the district court\u2019s dismissal of their illegal search-and-seizure claim on appeal, the rest of the allegations in the complaint are not relevant to this appeal. In summary, after numerous proceedings concerning custody of the child and parental rights, on February 10, 2010, Shough received a letter from TDFPS stating that it had ruled out allegations of abuse and neglect for lack of evidence and had closed the case. Although the complaint states that Shough and Thomas\u2019s daughter was in TDFPS custody for approximately nine months, it is unclear whether she was ultimately returned to Shough\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">On March 23, 2010, Appellants filed suit pro se in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, asserting nine claims against Defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988. Appellants also filed motions for appointment of counsel and to proceed IFP, the latter of which the district court granted on April 12, 2010. On April 15, 2010, the district court sua sponte reviewed whether it should dismiss Appellants\u2019 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Section 1915(e)(2)(B) allows the district court to sua sponte dismiss any IFP complaint that it finds \u201cfrivolous or malicious,\u201d that \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted,\u201d or that \u201cseeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d The district court dismissed Appellants\u2019 complaint without prejudice on two grounds. First, it held that TDFPS and its officials sued in their official capacities are immune from liability under the Eleventh Amendment, and that neither the agency nor officials have waived that immunity. Second, the district court held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over all of the claims, because \u201c[t]his is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>strictly a suit affecting the parent-child relationship that is currently being litigated in the Texas family courts, and Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to cast it as a civil rights complaint are unavailing.\u201d Based upon the dismissals, the district court denied Appellants\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Because the district court\u2019s dismissed Appellants\u2019s claim on immunity grounds and impliedly because Appellants failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted, we review the dismissal de novo. <em>See, e.g., Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cWe ... employ the same <em>de novo </em>standard to review the \u00a7 1915(e)(B)(ii) dismissal as we use to review dismissal pursuant to 12(b)(6).\u201d). We review the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to appoint counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">On appeal, Appellants\u2019 brief challenges only the district court\u2019s dismissal of its Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment unreasonable search-and-seizure claim and the denial of appointment of counsel. Additionally, the arguments in Appellants\u2019 brief address only why dismissal was improper as to Defendant Collins, Safe Haven Mission, and perhaps TDFPS as an entity. The brief makes no mention of the roles of the other Defendants relevant to the unreasonable search-and-seizure claim. Therefore, arguments as to the dismissal of all other Defendants are waived. <em>Sanders v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>553 F.3d 922, 926 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cA party waives an issue if he fails to adequately brief it on appeal.\u201d). Further, Appellants failed to make any allegation in their complaint regarding the role of Safe Haven or its employees in the illegal search-and-seizure. While Appellants\u2019 brief implies that Safe Haven employees entered Shough\u2019s residence without consent along with TDFPS employees, they fail to make any such claim in them complaint. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of the claims against Safe Haven for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">A. Eleventh Amendment Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">To the extent that Appellants preserved any arguments against TDFPS as an entity, the district court correctly dismissed claims against TDFPS pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. As this Court and the Supreme Court have held, \u201cThe eleventh amendment generally divests federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain citizen suits directed against states.\u201d <em>Stem v. Ahearn, </em>908 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, </em>495 U.S. 299, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 109 L.Ed.2d 264 (1990); <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 662-63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974)). Similarly, suits against employees of state entities in their official capacity run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 101-02, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945)). Although the <em>Ex Parte Young </em>doctrine creates an exception to this rule concerning suits for prospective relief against individual state actors, <em>Ex Parte Young </em>\u201chas no application in suits against ... States and their agencies.\u201d <em>P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 146, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). TDFPS is undisputedly a state entity that has not waived its immunity. <em>See Stem, </em>908 F.2d at 4 (\u201cTexas has not consented to be sued in federal court by resident or nonresident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>citizens regarding its activities to protect the welfare of children.\u201d). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed all claims against TDFPS and all official capacity claims against TDFPS employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The only remaining issue, therefore, is whether the district court properly dismissed Appellants\u2019 individual capacity unreasonable search-and-seizure claim against Defendant Collins. As a first matter, we cannot accept the district court\u2019s justification for dismissal of all the claims: that Appellants\u2019 suit is merely an attempt to shoehorn a parent \u2014 child relations dispute that is pending in state court into a civil rights complaint. The district court\u2019s citation in support of its dismissal on these grounds refers to a case where the district court remanded a complaint to state court in part because the complaint \u201cconsisted of purely state law claims concerning the State\u2019s protection of children.\u201d <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs. v. Mitchell-Davis, </em>No. 3:07-CV-1726-D, 2007 WL 4334016, at *4 (N.D.Tex. Dec. 11, 2007). Here, Appellants have made claims asserting federal constitutional violations, and seek monetary relief and injunctive relief to prevent further allegedly unconstitutional searches and seizures. The mere fact that the underlying dispute arose from an issue concerning a parent\u2014 child relationship does not destroy a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction over a properly pleaded constitutional claim. Therefore, we must proceed to consider whether the district court erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 individual capacity claim against Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We have previously held that social workers employed by state agencies may assert a qualified immunity defense when sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Roe v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>299 F.3d 395, 400 (5th Cir.2002). The district court had not yet requested that Defendants respond to the complaint in this suit, and therefore Collins has not had an opportunity to assert a qualified immunity defense. Nonetheless, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii), we may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claim against Collins if we find that she is entitled to qualified immunity. We find that based on the complaint alone, Collins is not entitled to qualified immunity at this time, and therefore the district court erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 individual capacity unreasonable search-and-seizure claim against her. We emphasize that this does not preclude the district court from finding that Collins is entitled to qualified immunity at any time upon remand, including after the filing of responsive pleadings or at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Qualified immunity protects state officials from civil damages liability \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). As the Supreme Court established in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), we must undertake a two-step inquiry to determine whether the official is entitled to immunity, asking: (1) whether the plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to establish a violation of a constitutional right; and (2) whether that right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. <em>Pearson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 815-16 (citing <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151). As the <em>Pearson </em>Court established, we may address these two prongs in either order. <em>Id. </em>at 818, 129 S.Ct. 808. In determining whether Collins violated a constitutional right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cwe employ currently applicable constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Wernecke v. Garcia, </em>591 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc)) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the \u201cclearly established\u201d inquiry, we have noted that \u201c[ojfficials should receive the protection of qualified immunity \u2018unless the law is clear in the more particularized sense that reasonable officials should be \u201con notice that their conduct is unlawful.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Wernecke, </em>591 F.3d at 393 (quoting <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 350 (quoting <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 206, 121 S.Ct. 2151)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Appellants allege that Collins violated their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search-and-seizure in several respects. First, they maintain that Collins entered Shough\u2019s home without a warrant or court order and without Shough\u2019s consent, any exigent circumstances, or justification under the special needs doctrine. Second, they contend that Collins remained in the house after Shough asked her to leave. Third, they allege that by seizing the child without a court order and absent exigent circumstances or special needs, Collins also violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We first inquire whether any of the alleged violations, as stated, would represent a violation of Appellants\u2019 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In this Circuit, it is \u201cwell established ... that the Fourth Amendment regulates social workers\u2019 civil investigations.\u201d <em>Gates v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>537 F.3d 404, 420 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Roe, </em>299 F.3d at 401). We have further noted that \u201c[wjarrantless searches of a person\u2019s home are presumptively unreasonable unless the person consents, or unless probable cause and exigent circumstances justify the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gomez-Moreno, </em>479 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 2007)) (alteration in Gates). Therefore, based on the allegations in the complaint, Collins violated Appellants\u2019s constitutional rights unless we find that consent, exigent circumstances, or special needs existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We can quickly dispose with the issue of consent. On this basis of the complaint, Shough did not consent to Collins\u2019s entry into the home, although she did not verbally object. We have previously held that \u201c[sjilence or passivity cannot form the basis for consent to enter,\u201d <em>Roe, </em>299 F.3d at 402, and that \u201ca defendant\u2019s mere acquiescence to a show of lawful authority is insufficient to establish voluntary consent.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>537 F.3d at 420-21 (quoting <em>United States v. Jaras, </em>86 F.3d 383, 390 (5th Cir.1996)). Therefore, on the basis of the complaint alone, Shough did not consent to Collins\u2019s entry into the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We can similarly dispose of the possibility of a special needs exception based on the facts alleged. Under similar circumstances, we recently concluded that a home visit to investigate possible child abuse \u201cwas not separate from general law enforcement,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe special needs doctrine cannot be used to justify the warrantless entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. Because Collins\u2019s visit to Shough\u2019s home was also to investigate the possibility of child abuse and the safety of Shough and Thomas\u2019s daughter, we conclude that the special needs exception does not apply on the basis of the facts alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Concerning exigent circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that \u201claw enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.\u201d <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). In <em>Gates, </em>we addressed whether exigent circumstances existed for TDFPS officials to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ter a home without a warrant or court order when the father had \u201cpushed and kicked [his son] that morning, had handcuffed [his son] to his bed at some point, and used unusual discipline methods.\u201d 537 F.3d at 422. We held that exigent circumstances were not present, because (1) at the time of entry, the allegedly abusive father was not at home; (2) there were no allegations he had abused his other children, his \u201cunusual discipline methods\u201d aside; and (3) the interviews conducted at the home were \u201croutine, non-emergency interviews.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Because the district court has not yet ordered Defendants to respond in this case, it is unclear what information Collins may have had at the time of the allegedly unlawful entry. The complaint alleges that Thomas was not at home or even living at the house at the time. While the complaint notes that Collins presented an affidavit at a later removal hearing averring that Shough told her that (1) Thomas had picked up their daughter by the limbs and thrown her into a playpen; (2) Thomas had grabbed their daughter by the neck; and (3) the child had been sexually assaulted, the complaint contends that these allegations were all fabricated. Although Collins\u2019s belief that these allegations were true at the time of the unlawful entry may have sufficed to create exigent circumstances, the complaint does not establish whether or not this information was known to Collins at the time of the entry. Therefore, the complaint alone does not support the application of the exigent circumstances exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Having found that the complaint alleges a constitutional violation, we must decide whether the law supporting such a finding was clearly established at the time of the allegedly unconstitutional conduct. In <em>Gates, </em>we held under similar factual circumstances that the law of consent and exigent circumstances in this area \u201chas been clearly established for some time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. While in <em>Gates </em>we held that the law regarding special needs was not clearly established at that time, we find that <em>Gates </em>sufficiently established the law for purposes of this case. As we noted above, we held in Gates that the \u201cpurpose of TDPRS\u2019s entry into the Gateses\u2019 home \u2014 the investigation of possible child abuse \u2014 was closely tied with law enforcement,\u201d and that \u201cbecause the need to enter the Gateses\u2019 home was not divorced from the state\u2019s general interest in law enforcement, there was no special need that justified the entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the rationale behind the entry here was likely the same, we hold that the law was clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">C. Denial of Motion to Appoint Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The district court denied Appellants\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel because it had already dismissed all of their claims. We have held that \u201c[t]here is no automatic right to the appointment of counsel in a section 1983 case,\u201d and that \u201ca district court is not required to appoint counsel in the absence of \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Cupit, </em>835 F.2d at 86. \u201cIn evaluating whether the appointment of counsel is proper, the district court considers the type and complexity of the case, the litigant\u2019s ability to investigate and present the case, and the level of skill required to present the evidence.\u201d <em>Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Castro Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 354 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Appellants allege that the district court abused its discretion in failing to appoint counsel because \u201cthe issues in the complaint are factually and legally complex,\u201d and because they generally lack resources to expend on the case. At this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>juncture of the case, Appellants have failed to show the presence of exceptional circumstances. Only one party remains in Appellants\u2019 suit, and responsive pleadings have not yet been filed. While Appellants may have limited resources at their disposal, this constraint applies to all litigants proceeding IFP and thus is not one of the above factors evaluated under the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d inquiry. Therefore, Appellants have failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Because we are unable to grant qualified immunity to Collins on the basis of the complaint alone, we REVERSE AND REMAND the district court\u2019s dismissal of Thomas and Shough\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment individual capacity claim against Collins. We emphasize, again, that the district court may find that Collins is entitled to qualified immunity at another stage in this case, and that this decision rests solely on the basis of the complaint, as Defendants have not yet been ordered to respond. We AFFIRM on all other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED AND REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
