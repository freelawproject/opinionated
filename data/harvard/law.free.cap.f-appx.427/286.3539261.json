Michael Willock and Gwendolyn E. Willock appeal from the tax court\u2019s order sustaining the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiencies and penalties with respect to their 2002 and 2003 federal income tax liability. We have reviewed the record on appeal as well as the parties\u2019 briefs and find no reversible error in the tax court\u2019s conclusions regarding the business deductions and losses that the Commissioner disallowed and the resulting penalty pursuant to IRC \u00a7 6662. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the tax court. <em>See Willock v. Commissioner, </em>Tax Ct. No. 06-25616 (U.S. Tax Ct. Sept. 4, 2010). However, because the Commissioner concedes that the tax court\u2019s computation of the \u00a7 6662 penalty was overstated, we vacate, in part, the tax court\u2019s order and remand for correction of the amount of penalty owed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
