Because we perceive no errors in the District Court\u2019s resolution of Meyers\u2019 claims, we will affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-32\">Meyers is serving a prison sentence of 63 months, imposed on December 17, 2009, following his guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to one count of being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>felon in possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to a federal detainer, Meyers was held in custody on the crime of conviction between February 16, 2007, and the date of his sentencing. Immediately preceding that period, Meyers had been held in state custody for 75 days (between December 1, 2006, and February 15, 2007) on a state charge that was eventually nolle prossed. All told, then, Meyers spent 1,112 days in custody prior to sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the BOP set Meyers\u2019 projected release date, after factoring in good time credits, at July 8, 2011. The BOP set the date of his eligibility for home detention at January 8, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Meyers\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition, filed in May 2010, contained ten claims, which the District Court ably summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">1) Respondent directed BOP staff to place Meyers in the General Population where an inmate was waiting to kill him ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">2) the BOP failed to properly credit the time Meyers spent confined in the Federal Detention Center (\u201cFDC\u201d) Philadelphia ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">3) the BOP failed to follow the direction of the sentencing court to place Petitioner in a federal medical center to receive psychiatric treatment ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">4) there is no Mental Health Unit (\u201cMHU\u201d) at USP Allenwood ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">5) Respondent refuses to stop performing PPD skin tests on Petitioner ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">6) Respondent has informed inmates ... that Petitioner is an informant</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">7) the BOP ... is denying him [home] release and has untruthfully scored his security classification level ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">8) Petitioner\u2019s projected release date and home detention eligibility date are incorrect ...;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">9) on February 23, 2010, Respondent allowed an inmate to be placed in Petitioner\u2019s cell, and the inmate stabbed, cut, and sexually assaulted Petitioner ...; and</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">10) on April 24, 2010, Respondent again allowed an inmate to be placed in Petitioner\u2019s cell, and the inmate held Petitioner hostage....</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">(DC dkt # 5.) The District Court summarily dismissed without prejudice six of the ten claims in the petition (numbers 1, 4-6, 9 and 10) because those claims challenged the conditions of Meyers\u2019 confinement, and thus were not properly raised in habeas corpus proceedings. The warden of USP-Allenwood, R. Martinez, was then ordered to respond to Meyers\u2019 habeas petition. By order entered July 9, 2010, the District Court denied the remaining claims in Meyers\u2019 habeas petition (numbers 2, 3, 7, and 8), concluding that they were both unexhausted and without merit. Meyers timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), and our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). A certificate of appealability is not required for Meyers\u2019 appeal. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009). We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief. <em>McGee v. Martinez, </em>627 F.3d 933, 935 n. 2 (3d Cir.2010). The District Court\u2019s factual findings are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>viewed for clear error. <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The District Court properly dismissed Meyers\u2019 conditions of confinement claims without prejudice to Meyers\u2019 ability to pursue those claims in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See McGee, </em>627 F.3d at 936 (\u201cthe fact that a civil rights claim is filed by a prisoner rather than by an unincarcerated individual does not turn a \u00a7 1983 case or a <em>Bivens </em>action into a habeas petition ... even where the complained-of condition of confinement creates, as a secondary effect, the possibility that the plaintiff will serve a longer prison term than that to which he would otherwise have been subject.\u201d). We also agree with the District Court that Meyers failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the other four claims in the habeas petition. <em>See Gambino v. Morris, </em>134 F.3d 156, 171 (3d Cir. 1998) (\u201cOrdinarily, federal prisoners are required to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to seeking a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.\u201d). It was Meyers\u2019 burden, <em>see Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 488 (3d Cir.2001), to prove that he exhausted his administrative remedies \u2014 here, completion of the BOP\u2019s multitier Administrative Remedy Program\u2014 and he failed to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Furthermore, we agree with the District Court that Meyers\u2019 habeas claims related to the BOP\u2019s security classification and sentence calculations are without merit, for substantially the reasons given in the District Court\u2019s opinion. Importantly, Meyers has failed to demonstrate on appeal that any of the District Court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous. Finally, while Meyers\u2019 third claim \u2014 that the BOP is defying a court order that he \u201creceive mental health services at a Federal Medical Center\u201d (DC dkt # 1, pg. 3) \u2014 also lacks merit, we note that the Eastern District of Virginia <em>did </em>order Meyers to undergo psychiatric evaluations at FMC Butner from November 2007 to March 2008, and then again from September 2008 to March 2009, during the pendency of the underlying criminal proceedings. The \u201cSpecial Conditions of Supervision\u201d section of Meyers\u2019 criminal judgment states that, \u201c[wjhile on supervised release, pursuant to this Judgment ... [t] he defendant shall participate in a program approved by the Probation Office for mental health treatment.\u201d (DC dkt # 7, Attachment 3, pg. 4.) On appeal, Warden Martinez states that \u201c[a]ny mental health treatment Meyers receives aside from that is squarely -within the discretion of the BOP.\u201d (Resp. Br. at 13.) To the extent feasible, we encourage the BOP to exercise that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Meyers\u2019 direct appeal, based on the appellate waiver contained in the plea agreement, by order entered August 18, 2010. Meyers' motion to vacate his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, is currently pending in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-21\">. 2008 was a leap year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">.
