On appeal, the VanBenthuysens argue that the district court erred in concluding that their claims were barred by the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">In July 2010, the VanBenthuysens filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 complaint against the State of Florida. Their complaint was based upon the following facts. In July 2002, the Circuit Court of Polk County, Florida, entered a temporary order in a divorce proceeding between Keith and Jill Ann VanBenthuysen. The order directed Keith to make monthly child support and alimony payments to Jill Ann. No judgment of divorce ever was entered in the Polk County case. According to the VanBenthuysens\u2019 \u00a7 1983 complaint, the Polk County judge had been \u201cco-opted\u201d by Jill Ann\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">While the Polk County case was pending, Keith filed a separate divorce action in Okaloosa County, Florida. Jill Ann was notified of the Okaloosa County case but did not participate in the proceedings. In March 2003, the Okaloosa County Circuit Court issued a final judgment dissolving the marriage between Keith and Jill Ann. The complaint explained that the Okaloosa County judgment nullified the earlier Polk County support order. In April 2003, Keith and Beverly were married in Las Vegas, Nevada. One year later, the Okaloosa County Circuit Court granted a motion by Jill Ann\u2019s attorney to vacate the final judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">The VanBenthuysens\u2019 complaint set forth three causes of action. In Count One, the VanBenthuysens argued that the state had violated Keith\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by continuing to garnish his paychecks under the Polk County support order, even though that order had been \u201csubsumed\u201d by the Okaloosa County divorce decree. The VanBenthuysens further asserted the state had violated Keith\u2019s First Amendment right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>travel by confiscating his passport. In Count Two of the complaint, the VanBenthuysens sought a declaratory judgment that the Okaloosa County divorce judgment was valid and that the order vacating that judgment was <em>\u201cultra vires.\u201d </em>In Count Three, the VanBenthuysens sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction directing the state to stop garnishing Keith\u2019s paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The state moved to dismiss the complaint, contending, among other things, that the VanBenthuysens\u2019 claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The district court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court concluded that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevented it from reviewing the Polk County judgment ordering Keith to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Whether a plaintiffs complaint is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is a legal question that we review <em>de novo. Doe v. Florida Bar, </em>630 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2011). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is a jurisdictional rule that precludes lower federal courts from reviewing state court judgments. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court has explained that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). We have interpreted <em>Exxon Mobil </em>to mean that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply if the state proceedings are still ongoing at the time that the federal action is filed. <em>See Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Here, it is unclear whether the state court divorce proceedings had concluded at the time that the VanBenthuysens filed their complaint in federal district court. According to the complaint, no final judgment ever was entered in the Polk County divorce proceeding, and the final judgment in the Okaloosa County proceeding was set aside in 2004. Nevertheless, we need not decide whether the district court erred in applying the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine because the record reveals at least two alternative bases for dismissing the VanBenthuysens\u2019 complaint. <em>See Green v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1245 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009) (noting that we may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record). First, the complaint was subject to dismissal because the VanBenthuysens brought their claims directly against the State of Florida, which is not a proper defendant in a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding that a state is not a \u201cperson\u201d liable to suit under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Second, the VanBenthuysens\u2019 claims are barred by the statute of limitations. In a \u00a7 1983 action, federal courts apply the forum state\u2019s residual statute of limitations for personal injury actions. <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1188 (11th Cir.1999). In Florida, the applicable limitations period is four years. <em>Id.; </em>Fla.Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(p). The statute of limitations begins to run when \u201cthe facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1182 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Here, the VanBenthuysens\u2019 complaint was not filed until July 2010, eight years after the entry of the Polk County support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>order, and more than six years after the Okaloosa County Circuit Court entered an order vacating its earlier divorce judgment. Thus, all of the VanBenthuysens\u2019 claims were barred by the four-year statute of limitations. <em>See Burton, </em>178 F.3d at 1188; Fla.Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(p). Accordingly, after review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-15\">. <em>Rooker v.
