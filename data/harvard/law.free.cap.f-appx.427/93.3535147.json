For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-22\">Crawford, a South Carolina prisoner, filed a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in District Court in New Jersey. Crawford\u2019s petition did not specify the conviction for which he was incarcerated. The District Court determined that Crawford was serving a life sentence for a conviction in South Carolina state court for the murder of his child. <em>See Crawford v. SC Att\u2019y Gen. Office, </em>No. 06-908, 2006 WL 4766029, *1 (D.S.C. Dec. 18, 2006) (unpublished decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-23\">The District Court dismissed Crawford\u2019s habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that jurisdiction over a \u00a7 2241 petition lies in the district of confinement. The District Court further ruled that the dismissal was without prejudice to Crawford\u2019s filing a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina challenging his South Carolina conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-24\">Crawford then filed in District Court a motion for reconsideration, a motion to recuse District Judge Julie Carnes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and supporting affidavits and exhibits. The District Court denied these motions, noting that Crawford\u2019s filings did not contain a cogent rationale for reconsidering its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>earlier order or supporting jurisdiction in the District Court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Crawford\u2019s habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Ballentine v. United States, </em>486 F.3d 806, 808 (3d Cir.2007). We review the denial of Crawford\u2019s motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Max\u2019s Seafood Cafe v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The District Court did not err in dismissing Crawford\u2019s habeas petition, which did not provide a basis for jurisdiction in the District of New Jersey. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 443, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004) (stating jurisdiction over \u00a7 2241 habeas petition lies only in the district of confinement). To the extent Crawford seeks to challenge his state court murder conviction, the District Court also correctly stated that the dismissal was without prejudice to Crawford\u2019s filing of a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2254 in the District of South Carolina. <em>See Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485-86 (3d Cir.2001) (noting state prisoner must challenge the legality of his custody pursuant to \u00a7 2254, not \u00a7 2241). The District Court also did not err in denying Crawford\u2019s motion for recusal or motion for reconsideration, which provided no basis to reconsider the District Court\u2019s earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-18\">. Crawford\u2019s motion to reopen his appeal and motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-25\">. It appears that the recusal motion is a copy of a document filed by Crawford in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. Crawford\u2019s remaining outstanding motions, including his motion to suspend the requirement that other named appellants sign the notice of appeal in order to proceed as parties, are denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
