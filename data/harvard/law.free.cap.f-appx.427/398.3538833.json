Cabello\u2019s complaint stemmed from injuries he suffered in a work-related accident while he was incarcerated at the Bastrop Federal Correctional Institution. He claimed that following the accident, he received negligent medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Cabello\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>556 F.3d 326, 334 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Because Cabello\u2019s injury was work-related, the district court correctly determined that the Inmate Accident Compensation Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4126, provided Cabello\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>See Aston v. United States, </em>625 F.2d 1210, 1211 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Demko, </em>385 U.S. 149, 152, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258 (1966). The district court did not err in dismissing Cabello\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>376 F.2d 848, 849 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Nor has he demonstrated that the district court\u2019s denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion was based upon manifest errors of law or fact or presented newly discovered evidence. <em>See Templet v. HydroChem, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 478 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Cabello has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion. <em>See Midland West Corp. v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>911 F.2d 1141, 1145 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Cabello\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus it is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. He is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Also, Cabello is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.
