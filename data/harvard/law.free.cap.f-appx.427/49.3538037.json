Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), which standard is met \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct.1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A fraud claim must further satisfy Rule 9(b), which requires the complaint to \u201cstate with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). While we review a judgment of dismissal <em>de novo, see, e.g., Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002), in this case, applying New York law to the contracts at issue \u2014 the Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d), the Collaboration Services Agreement (\u201cCSA\u201d), and the Repurchase Option Agreement (\u201cROA\u201d) \u2014 we affirm largely for the reasons stated by the district court in its thorough opinion, <em>see Verus Pharm., Inc. v. Astrazeneca AB, </em>No. 09 Civ. 5660, 2010 WL 3238965 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">1. <em>Breach of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">a. APA</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Plaintiff contends that APA \u00a7 5.3.3 imposes on defendants an obligation to take the acquired assets to an End of Phase 2 meeting (\u201cEOP II meeting\u201d) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The argument finds no support in the contract. <em>See, e.g., Diesel Props S.r.l. v. Greystone Bus. Credit II LLC, </em>631 F.3d 42, 51 (2d Cir.2011) (observing interpretation of unambiguous contract is matter of law). Viewed in context, \u00a7 5.3.3 is reasonably interpreted to relate only to regulatory processes associated with execution of the asset purchase transaction, not subsequent development of the purchased assets. <em>See, e.g., Law Debenture Trust Co. of N.Y. v. Maverick Tube Corp., </em>595 F.3d 458, 466 (2d Cir.2010) (interpreting contract in \u201ccontext of the entire integrated agreement\u201d); <em>Matter of Riconda, </em>90 N.Y.2d 733, 738, 665 N.Y.S.2d 392, 396, 688 N.E.2d 248 (1997) (looking to \u201centirety\u201d of agreement in context of \u201cparties\u2019 relationship and circumstances\u201d). This conclusion follows from \u00a7 5.3.3\u2019s placement among other provisions in the APA addressing pre-transaction regulatory and other obligations. <em>See </em>APA \u00a7 5.3.2 (establishing obligations with respect to filings required by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-435 (Sept. 30, 1976)), <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5.2.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 (establishing certain pre-closing covenants and other pre-closing obligations). The conclusion is reinforced by the totality of documents structuring the parties\u2019 relationship, which make clear that the CSA, not the APA, was intended to govern development of the acquired assets. <em>See </em>CSA pmbl. \u00b6 4. Consequently, plaintiff fails to state a claim that defendants breached APA \u00a7 5.3.3 by failing to take the acquired assets to an EOP II meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">b. CSA</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Plaintiff contends that the CSA also imposes an obligation on defendants to take the acquired assets to an EOP II meeting. Like the district court, we conclude that the CSA can only be construed to impose on defendants an obligation to use \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d to develop the acquired assets, CSA \u00a7 10.1.1, not an \u201cunqualified requirement to reach an EOP II meeting,\u201d <em>Verus Pharm., Inc. v. Astrazeneca AB, </em>2010 WL 3238965, at *10. CSA \u00a7 10, entitled \u201cThe Purchaser Business Covenants,\u201d obligates defendants to \u201cuse Diligent Efforts to develop the [acquired assets] consistent with and in furtherance of the Joint Development Plan.\u201d CSA \u00a7 10.1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Joint Development Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u201coutlines the technical and regulatory plans to move [the acquired assets] forward to a successful [EOP II meeting],\u201d the \u201ckey project objectives\u201d of which are set forth in accompanying Study Schedules. Joint Dev. Plan at 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, rather than create an unqualified obligation to reach an EOP II meeting, these provisions require defendants to use diligent efforts to develop the acquired assets consistent with plans intended to move the assets towards a successful meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">(i) <em>CSA \u00a7 2.2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In urging otherwise, plaintiff relies on CSA \u00a7 2.2, which states that \u201cPurchaser shall perform the Purchaser Transition Services and use Diligent Efforts to execute the Joint Development Plan for the development of the Products (excluding Albuterol) and generate the applicable Work Product.\u201d CSA \u00a7 2.2. Because \u201cTransition Services\u201d are defined as \u201call services and other obligations to be conducted pursuant to [the CSA], <em>including all services set forth on the Study Schedules,\u201d </em>CSA \u00a7 1 (emphasis added), plaintiff argues that defendants are required to complete each Study Schedule, including Study Schedule 8. This argument proves too much. If CSA \u00a7 2.2 creates an obligation to complete each Study Schedule, it also creates an obligation to complete \u201call services and other obligations\u201d required by the CSA, including the Joint Development Plan. Such a construction conflicts with both the general obligation (created in CSA \u00a7 10.1.1 and referred to in CSA \u00a7 2.2) that defendants use diligent efforts to execute the Joint Development Plan, and the specific obligation imposed by CSA \u00a7 3.3 to use diligent efforts in completing the Study Schedules. <em>See, e.g., Gessin Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. 95 Wall Assocs., LLC, </em>74 A.D.3d 516, 518, 903 N.Y.S.2d 26, 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2010) (stating \u201ccourts should construe a contract in a manner that avoids inconsistencies and reasonably harmonizes its terms\u201d); <em>accord Law Debenture Trust Co. of N.Y. v. Maverick Tube Corp., </em>595 F.3d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">We therefore reject plaintiffs interpretation of CSA \u00a7 2.2 and, consequently, its argument that defendants breached that section by not taking the acquired assets to an EOP II meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">(ii) <em>Diligent Efforts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Plaintiff next contends that defendants breached the CSA by failing to use diligent efforts to develop the acquired assets, but plaintiffs complaint does not allege a failure of diligent efforts. Rather, it alleges that defendants abandoned development of the acquired assets \u201c[a]s soon as ... potential delays\u201d arose to pursue a transaction with plaintiffs competitor, whose own pediatric asthma product was close to receiving FDA approval. Compl. \u00b6 69; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67-68. These allegations fail to state a violation of the CSA\u2019s \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d standard because that standard specifically contemplates that defendants\u2019 actions will be informed by, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe competitiveness of alternative or competing compounds or products, ... the nature and extent of their market exclusiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ity, [and] the likelihood of regulatory approval.\u201d CSA \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">(iii) <em>CSA \u00a7 kk-lk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Finally, plaintiff contends that defendants breached CSA \u00a7 4.4.14 by refusing further to develop the acquired assets. Although that provision vests the Joint Development Committee with authority to \u201cdetermine whether and when to discontinue any Studies,\u201d CSA \u00a7 4.4.14, the Joint Development Committee itself is vested only with responsibility for \u201coverseeing the development of the Products,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4.4. Thus, although the Joint Development Committee was authorized to direct <em>how </em>the acquired assets would be developed, defendants retained authority to determine <em>whether </em>they should be developed at all through the use of diligent efforts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a consequence, plaintiff fails to state a \u00a7 4.4.14 breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">c. <em>ROA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Plaintiff contends that its right to repurchase the acquired assets never matured because it did not receive a timely or complete Loss Amount Certificate (\u201cLAC\u201d), and that defendants therefore breached the ROA by asserting that plaintiffs repurchase rights had expired.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">(i) <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Plaintiffs timeliness argument relies on its contention that the Earnout Payment Termination Date (\u201cEPTD\u201d), <em>see </em>APA Ex. 1, which triggered defendants\u2019 obligation to submit an LAC, <em>see </em>APA \u00a7 9.6.2 (requiring LAC to be submitted within five business days of EPTD), had not yet occurred when defendants submitted their LAC on October 8, 2008. This is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">As relevant for this appeal, the EPTD was the EOP II Drop Dead Date, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>was defined to be October 2, 2008. <em>See </em>APA Ex. 1. Plaintiff submits that the EOP II Drop Dead Date was subject to an automatic extension provision so long as defendants \u201c[were] using commercially reasonable best efforts\u201d to pursue an EOP II meeting. <em>Id. </em>But that provision does not apply because, as plaintiff itself recognizes, defendants had ceased using any such efforts as of October 2, 2008. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. While plaintiff points to other allegations indicating defendants\u2019 earlier pursuit of an EOP II meeting in June 2008, the fact remains that plaintiffs own allegations indicate that by October 2, 2008, defendants had altogether ceased efforts to take the acquired assets to an EOP II meeting. Therefore, the EOP II Drop Dead Date was not extended, and defendants\u2019 October 8, 2008 LAC was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">(ii) <em>Completeness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Alternatively, plaintiff contends that the LAC was incomplete because of objections raised in an October 22, 2008 letter to defendants. <em>See </em>ROA \u00a7 2.2 (indicating Exercise Notice must be transmitted within 45 days \u201cafter delivery of the complete [LAC]\u201d). Although plaintiff now asserts that \u201cmaterial information about the liabilities that [plaintiff) would be assuming upon a Repurchase Closing\u201d was omitted from the LAC, Reply Br. at 12 (citing Compl. \u00b6 61), it did not identify that objection in its October 22, 2008 letter. In any event, to the extent this belated assertion references information required to be in the LAC, namely \u201cthe amounts referred to in Section 2.3.1 (ii), (iv), and (v),\u201d ROA \u00a7 12.4(a), the LAC did include such information. Plaintiffs dispute as to the accuracy of that information, therefore, goes to finality of the LAC, <em>see </em>APA \u00a7 9.6.3(a), a dispute which may only be resolved through mandatory arbitration, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 9.6.3(b), and provides no cause to delay the potential repurchase closing, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 9.6.3(c). Consequently, plaintiffs argument that its obligation to submit an Exercise Notice never matured fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">2. <em>Other Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Having rejected plaintiffs claims for breach of the relevant contracts, we further conclude that plaintiffs other claims \u2014 for anticipatory breach, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \u2014 must be dismissed for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Verus Pharm., Inc. v. Astrazeneca AB, </em>2010 WL 3238965, at *11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">3. <em>Leave to Amend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Plaintiff submits that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a request for leave to amend the complaint, a request plaintiff included on the final page of its brief in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and did not renew after grant of the motion. <em>See, e.g., Chavis v. Chappius, </em>618 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2010) (reviewing denial of leave to amend complaint for abuse of discretion). Our precedent clearly holds that a district court does not abuse its discretion in declining to address such informal requests for leave to amend. <em>See In re Lehman Bros. Mortgage-Backed Sec. Litig., </em>650 F.3d 167, ---, 2011 WL 1778726, at *16 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., </em>466 F.3d 187, 220 (2d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">We have considered plaintiffs remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\">. Tika L\u00e1kemedel AB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca AB. The relevant agreements identify Tika L\u00e1kemedel as \"Purchaser\u201d and AstraZeneca as \"Parent,\u201d and impose varying obligations on each. The parties have not assigned any significance to this distinction, however, and address their arguments on appeal to both defendants together. For convenience, we adopt this convention and refer to Tika L\u00e1kemedel and AstraZeneca collectively as \"defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">. Diligent efforts are defined as the \"efforts and resources used by [defendants] for [their] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>own compounds or products with similar commercial and scientific potential and at a similar stage in their lifecycle, taking into consideration their safety and efficacy, their cost to develop, the competitiveness of alternative or competing compounds or products, and the nature and extent of their market exclusivity ..., the likelihood of regulatory approval, their expected profitability, ... and all other relevant factors.\u201d CSA \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-13\">. Study Schedule 8 contemplates taking the acquired assets to an EOP II meeting with the FDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">. The district court concluded that plaintiff did not state a violation of the \"diligent efforts\" standard because the complaint alleged that defendants ceased development of the acquired assets due to professed safety concerns. <em>See Vents Pharm. v. Astrazeneca AB, </em>2010 WL 3238965, at * 10. Plaintiff now faults this conclusion as impermissible fact-finding, arguing that the district court effectively credited defendants\u2019 proffered reason over plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded alternative. We need not address this argument because plaintiff\u2019s alternative also fails to state a violation of the \"diligent efforts\u201d standard for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">. Plaintiff urges a different interpretation in light of defendants\u2019 own efforts to persuade the Joint Development Committee to cease development of the acquired assets. We need not resort to such extrinsic evidence because the language of CSA \u00a7 4.4 is clear. <em>See, e.g., Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc., </em>98 N.Y.2d 562, 569, 750 N.Y.S.2d 565, 569, 780 N.E.2d 166 (2002); <em>see also LaSalle Bank Nat'l Ass\u2019n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., </em>424 F.3d 195, 205 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, defendants\u2019 responsibilities to use \"Diligent Efforts\u201d terminated on the \"Diligence Covenant Termination Date,\u201d or October 2, 2008. CSA \u00a7 1. Therefore defendants' efforts to persuade the Joint Development Committee to discontinue the studies are irrelevant to the breach of contract claim as the parties were no longer subject to product development obligations at the time of the defendants\u2019 attempts at persuasion. Rather, the parties were only subject to their respective repurchase obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b80-14\">. In its complaint, plaintiff also alleges that, assuming defendants\u2019 LAC was timely and complete, defendants wrongly rejected plaintiff's Exercise Notice. Instead, the district court construed plaintiff\u2019s Exercise Notice as a counter-offer that defendants were entitled to and did reject. <em>See Verus Pharm., Inc. v. Astrazeneca AB, </em>2010 WL 3238965, at *9. Plaintiff does not challenge the district court's construction. Rather, it argues that because an Exercise Notice was not then required, plaintiff \"was free to later send a second Exercise Notice.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 42 n. 36. That argument is forfeited and, in any event, fails because plaintiff\u2019s contention that its Exercise Notice obligation had not yet matured is not supported by the ROA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
