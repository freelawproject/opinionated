Walsh filed a complaint in the district court alleging a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d) violation, conspiracy to commit a RICO violation, and related state law claims. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">This court reviews de novo the grant of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Coleman v. Md. Court of Appeals, </em>626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>79 U.S.L.W. 3480 (U.S. Feb. 8, 2011) (No. 10-1016). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Although in most cases, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require \u201cthat a claimant set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim ... [the Rules] still require a showing rather than a blanket assertion of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555 n. 3, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The showing made by the plaintiff must be more than a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\u201d and more than \u201cnaked assertions] devoid of further factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing the district court\u2019s decision to grant the motion to dismiss, this court \u201cmust ... accept the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 268, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994). This court must also \u201cconstrue factual alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>gations in the light most favorable to [Walsh].\u201d <em>Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>176 F.3d 776, 783 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">After review of the record, we conclude that the district court was correct in finding that Walsh failed to sufficiently allege a pattern of racketeering activity and therefore, his RICO claim failed. Because Walsh failed to state a claim as to the violation of \u00a7 1962(c), the district court also correctly found that his claim of conspiracy to violate RICO pursuant to \u00a7 1962(d) was meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The district court dismissed the remaining counts in Walsh\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (2006). A district court enjoys discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims after dismissal of all claims brought pursuant to its original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (2006); <em>see also Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., </em>239 F.3d 611, 617 (4th Cir.2001) (applying abuse of discretion standard to district court\u2019s order of remand of state claims). In the interest of avoiding \u201c[n]eedless decisions of state law,\u201d the Supreme Court has stated that, when \u201cfederal claims are dismissed before trial ... state claims should be dismissed as well.\u201d <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining supplemental jurisdiction over Walsh\u2019s remaining state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
