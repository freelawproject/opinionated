On appeal, James contends that the district court erred in (1) applying a Sentencing Guidelines enhancement for James\u2019s leadership role in the offense; and (2) denying the Government\u2019s motion for a two-level downward departure on Count Two. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In doing so, we review legal questions de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d 381, 387 (4th Cir.2010). Specifically, a district court\u2019s decision to apply a sentencing adjustment based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2008), a defendant qualifies for a.two-level enhancement if he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(e). In determining a defendant\u2019s leadership role, a court should consider seven factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4; <em>see also Sayles, </em>296 F.3d at 224. \u201cLeadership over only one other participant is sufficient as long as there is some control exercised.\u201d <em>United States v. Rashwan, </em>328 F.3d 160, 166 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">We hold that the district court did not clearly err in determining that James should receive an enhancement for being a manager. The evidence presented at sentencing indicated that James organized, recruited, and directed the participants, supplied the gun for the robberies, and exercised control over the proceeds of the robberies. Thus, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the district court to find that James qualified as a leader and to apply the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">We lack the authority to review a district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure unless the district court did not recognize its authority to do so. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 371 (4th Cir.2008). Here, it is clear that the district court understood its authority to depart downward pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, as it explicitly stated that it was departing downward on Counts One and Three but not on Count Two. Therefore, we decline to review the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s substantial assistance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
