Elwood appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">Elwood argues that the district court erred because: (1) the weight of the evidence was that the claims administrator\u2019s decision was not only wrong, but arbitrary and capricious; and (2) the claims administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because of its failure to have the claim reviewed by a neuropsychologist, contrary to ERISA regulations, and in disregard of its own peer reviewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-20\">Having carefully considered the matter, we find no error. The district court\u2019s order on summary judgment (R. 39) addresses the arguments now made on appeal, and rejects them. We find no error in either the district court\u2019s analysis of these arguments or its decision to reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
