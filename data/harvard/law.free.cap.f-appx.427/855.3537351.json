He also contends that the City\u2019s physical fitness requirements for Fire Investigators are not \u201cjob-related\u201d or consistent with \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence before the court demonstrates that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">1. <em>Is Firefighting an Essential Function of the Fire Investigator Position?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We evaluate ADA discrimination claims under the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>burden-shifting analysis. <em>See Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1255. Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing: \u201c(1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is \u201csomeone with a disability who, \u2018with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8)). \u201c[Ejssential functions \u2018are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257 (quoting <em>Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam)). If the particular function is essential, an ADA plaintiff must show that he can perform it either without accommodation or with a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256. An accommodation is reasonable only if it enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the job. <em>Id,. </em>Though the ADA may require an employer to alter or eliminate marginal job functions, it does not require an employer to eliminate essential job functions. <em>Id. </em>And an employer\u2019s previous acceptance of an accommodation pertaining to an essential function does not require the employer to make that accommodation in the future. <em>See Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., </em>112 F.3d 1522, 1528 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, if a disabled individual is unable to perform an essential function of the job, even with a reasonable accommodation, he is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d and cannot establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADA. <em>Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Whether a particular job duty is an essential function is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. The ADA\u2019s implementing regulations provide a non-exclusive list of factors indicating that a particular function is essential, which includes, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the employer\u2019s judgment as to which functions are essential; (2) the written job descriptions of the position; (3) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3). We give substantial weight to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a position are essential, but that factor alone is not conclusive. <em>Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">The evidence in this case establishes that firefighting is an essential function of the Fire Investigator position, a function that Cremeens concedes he cannot perform. Assistant Chief Davis, the division chief of the Fire Investigations Division, testified that Fire Investigators may be ordered to engage in fire suppression activities by either a superior officer or an on-scene fire commander and that failure to comply could subject them to disciplinary action. Davis also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>that, even absent such an order, Fire Investigators have a responsibility to engage in fire suppression activities if the lives of other firefighters or civilians are in danger and fire suppression units are not on the scene. Fire Investigators may engage in fire suppression activities infrequently, but that does not mean firefighting is a nonessential function of the position. Indeed, the firefighting function is essential whenever the need arises, and the consequences of not requiring a Fire Investigator to engage in fire suppression activities when necessary could be dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Cremeens\u2019s proposed accommodation\u2014 to work as a Fire Investigator without being required to fight fires \u2014 is not reasonable because it would require the City to eliminate an essential job function from the Fire Investigator position, which the ADA does not require it to do. Accordingly, Cremeens is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d within the meaning of the ADA, and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">II. <em>Are the City\u2019s Physical Fitness Requirements for Fire Investigators Job-Related, and Consistent with Business Necessity ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Discrimination under the ADA includes an employer\u2019s use of qualification standards or employment tests that tend to screen out those individuals with disabilities, \u201cunless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">[J]ob-relatedness is used in analyzing the questions or subject matter contained in a test or criteria used by an employer in making hiring or promotional decisions. Business necessity, in contrast, is larger in scope and analyzes whether there is a business reason that makes necessai\u2019y the use by an employer of a test or ciiteria in hiring or promotional decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\"><em>Allmond v. Akal Sec., Inc., </em>558 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOnce an employer demonstrates that the pertinent qualification standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to offer a reasonable accommodation that would allow him to satisfy that standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The physical fitness requirements are directly related to a Fire Investigator\u2019s duty to fight fires, and they are necessary to ensure that Fire Investigators are able to perform that function when called upon to do so. As stated above, Cremeens\u2019s proposed accommodation is not reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">. Cremeens's brief also raises the issue of whether the district court erred in denying his motion to alter judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, but the brief does not offer any argument on this issue. Therefore, the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
