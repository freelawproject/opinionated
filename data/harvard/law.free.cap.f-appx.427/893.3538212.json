FCC, </em>316 U.S. 4, 9-10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)). A stay, however, is not a matter of right but instead an exercise of judicial discretion. <em>Nken, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1761. The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances, justify an exercise of that discretion based on consideration of four factors, the first two of which are the most critical: (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. <em>Hilton v. Braunskill, </em>481 U.S. 770, 776, 107 S.Ct. 2113, 95 L.Ed.2d 724 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-25\">Based on the arguments in the motions papers, and without prejudicing the ultimate disposition of this case by a merits panel, we determine that Millennium has met its burden to obtain a stay of the district court\u2019s September 30, 2010 Order enforcing a settlement agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-26\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b919-27\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b919-28\">The motions are granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-22\">.
