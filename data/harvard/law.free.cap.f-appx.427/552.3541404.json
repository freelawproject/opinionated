We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d </em>1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Petitioners fail to raise any substantive challenge to the denial of their CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">The record does not compel the conclusion that petitioners filed their asylum application within a reasonable period of time after any extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5); <em>Husyev, </em>528 F.3d at 1181-82. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that petitioners did not experience harms in Indonesia amounting to past persecution. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2009) (being beaten by youths, robbed of sandals and pocket money, and accosted by a threatening mob did not compel a past persecution finding). However, because the agency did not have the benefit of our recent decisions in <em>Tampubolon v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 1056 (9th Cir.2010), and <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir.2009), we remand for the agency to assess petitioners\u2019 withholding of removal claim under the disfavored group analysis in the first instance. See <em>Tampubolon, </em>610 F.3d at 1062; <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
