WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Doussou Hadjuratou Kaba (Kaba), a native and citizen of Guinea, seeks asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The Immigration Judge (IJ) and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied Kaba\u2019s applications. Kaba seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Kaba entered the United States on April 1, 2000. She filed her asylum application with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on April 2, 2003. In her application, Kaba alleged that she \u201cspent 13 months in jail,\u201d during which time she was \u201craped [and] injured,\u201d and that when she was released from jail she \u201cwas ordered to move out of the country.\u201d Kaba stated that she believed she was arrested and jailed because she was an active member of \u201cAlpha Konse\u2019s party.\u201d She claimed that she was afraid of being subjected to torture if returned to Guinea because \u201c[t]he same government which sent [her] away, which tortured [her], [was] still there.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">On March 3, 2004, the DHS issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) charging Kaba with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). Kaba appeared with counsel before an IJ in Arlington, Virginia, conceded removability, and stated that she was seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">On April 12, 2007, following several continuances and at least one failure to appear,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kaba appeared at her merits hearing without counsel. The IJ observed that Kaba had been represented by two successive attorneys, that her case had \u201cbeen pending for a long time[,] and [that she] [had] had sufficient time to get a lawyer.\u201d As a result, the IJ decided to proceed with Kaba\u2019s case. Kaba apparently declined the assistance of an interpreter and testified in English. Before taking Kaba\u2019s testimony, the IJ accepted several documents into evidence, including a letter from Kaba\u2019s ex-boyfriend, which was typed in English and dated March 30, 2000,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a membership card for the \u201cRassemblement Du Peuple De Gui\u00f1ee\u201d (RPG) party, and a Guinean identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">In support of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, Kaba testified that she was born in Conakry, Guinea on November 11, 1979. She completed high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>school and attended college for one year. Kaba\u2019s parents were deceased, but her stepmother was still alive and residing in Guinea. She also had a nine-year old daughter who was living in Guinea with Kaba\u2019s sister. Her daughter\u2019s father, who was not the ex-boyfriend referred to in the letter, was living in Europe. Kaba stated that while she lived in Guinea, she did not have to work; her mother owned a great deal of land and some houses, and Kaba and her sister supported themselves by collecting rent for these properties. After Kaba left Guinea, her sister took over the management of their mother\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">According to Kaba, she was a \u201c[l]ittle bit\u201d involved in politics in Guinea, and she was a member of the RPG party. Each school had an RPG party group, and she joined her school\u2019s group in 1997. Kaba did not hold any official position in the party, and she only attended one party-sponsored event \u2014 a meeting in the stadium of Kaba\u2019s high school where the president of the RPG was supposed to speak\u2014 which occurred at the end of 1999. Between 100 to 200 people attended this meeting, but the police prevented the president of the RPG from speaking and arrested a number of the attendees, including Kaba. Kaba testified that she was \u201cbeaten\u201d when she was inside the police truck, stating \u201cwhen they w[ere] getting me in the truck, they ... pull[ed] me [by] my feet and two guys, one holding [my] feet [and the other holding my] hand[s,] [threw me] inside the truck where other people[ ] [were already waiting].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Kaba testified that she was taken to jail, where she was locked in a cell with nine other women. She stated that she remained in jail for three days, and that she and the other women were treated well during the day, receiving food and water, but not as well during the night-time hours, as the guards were present during that time. Kaba said that on her second night in jail she was raped by a guard. Two guards took her from her cell to the guard-room and one guard raped her while the other guard prevented her from screaming and hit her when she attempted to cry out. Kaba was then brought back to her cell. The following afternoon, she and the other women in her cell were released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Kaba testified that following her release she had to stay at a friend\u2019s house because the home where she had been living with her sister and her daughter had been destroyed by rebels belonging to a different political party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Her sister and daughter went to live with Kaba\u2019s stepmother. Kaba stated that she felt humiliated about her rape during this time. Kaba further testified that approximately two months after she was released from jail, in February 2000, she left her friend\u2019s house and traveled to Nigeria, where she had a contact who had promised to help her leave Guinea. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kaba paid the contact\u2019s sister to obtain a passport that she could use to enter the United States and a plane ticket to the United States. Kaba testified that after spending four days in Nigeria, she returned to Guinea because the ticket she had purchased was for a plane leaving from Conakry.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">According to Kaba, on March 31, 2000, she flew out of Conakry and, following several stops, landed in New York. Kaba\u2019s passport was checked at the airport, but she was not detained. Kaba testified that the brother of the woman whose passport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>she had purchased was supposed to pick her up from the airport, but he never came to get her. As a result, Kaba called Alpha Konate (Konate), a high school friend who was attending school in New York, and Konate\u2019s uncle picked her up from the airport. Kaba stated that she subsequently lived in New Jersey for seven months before moving to Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In explaining why she waited so long to file her asylum application, Kaba testified that she did not know how to obtain an asylum application, that she was eventually introduced to an unidentified individual whom she paid $150 to obtain an application, and that this individual filled out and signed an application for her. Kaba stated that the allegation in her application that she was in jail for thirteen months was not true, and that the person who filled out her application \u201cwas supposed to do what I said but he did not.\u201d When asked whether she had a fear of returning to Guinea, Kaba responded \u201c[f]or now, yes,\u201d explaining that \u201cthe government is still there.... They destroy everything you have.\u201d Kaba also stated \u201cI\u2019m not asking to stay permanently in [the United States]. I\u2019m just asking permission to stay until things change in my country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Following Kaba\u2019s testimony, the IJ rendered an oral decision denying Kaba\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. In a written decision, the IJ found Kaba not credible based on the inconsistencies between her testimony and the information in her asylum application and her ability to speak and write English and her claim that someone else filled out her application. The IJ also determined that Kaba\u2019s asylum application was untimely, that she did not present any evidence of changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances, and that ignorance of the filing deadline was no excuse. Further, the IJ stated that Kaba did not present credible evidence or corroborating evidence when it was available in support of her asylum application. Lastly, the IJ found that Kaba failed to meet her burden of proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution with respect to her asylum application. Based on this finding, the IJ determined that Kaba failed to satisfy the higher standard required for withholding of removal. The IJ also concluded that Kaba failed to present any evidence that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if forced to return to Guinea.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Kaba timely appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA with the assistance of counsel. On January 22, 2009, the BIA dismissed the appeal. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kaba\u2019s asylum application was time-barred \u2014 a conclusion that Kaba had not challenged on appeal. It also found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. Thus, the BIA concluded that even if Kaba\u2019s asylum application was timely, she had not met her burden of establishing eligibility for asylum or \u201cthe higher standard regarding her claim for withholding of removal.\u201d Finally, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Kaba was ineligible for protection under the CAT. Kaba seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Kaba argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in finding that (1) her testimony was not credible; (2) she did not sufficiently corroborate her persecution with credible evidence; and (3) she did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. The government, in turn, claims that Kaba has (1) failed to exhaust her administrative remedies regarding the IJ\u2019s decision that her asylum application was untimely; (2) waived her claim for protection under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>CAT; and (3) failed to show that the record evidence compels a conclusion contrary to the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which was the basis for denying Kaba\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u201cBecause the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision with additional commentary, we review the decision of the IJ, as supplemented by the BIA, as the final administrative order.\u201d <em>Acquaah v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 332, 334 (6th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). \u201cWe review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s findings for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the decision was \u2018manifestly contrary to law,\u2019 that is, if the evidence \u2018not only supports a contrary conclusion, but indeed <em>compels </em>it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruz-Samayoa v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 1145, 1149 (6th Cir.2010) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The INA \u201crequires that an asylum applicant \u2018demonstrate[ ] by clear and convincing evidence that [her asylum] application [was] filed within 1 year after the date of [her] arrival in the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vincent v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 351, 352 (6th Cir.2011) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B)). \u201cThis requirement is subject to exceptions in cases where the \u2018alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within\u2019 the required one-year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-53 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D)). Section 1158 also \u201ccreates a jurisdictional bar to review of the timeliness issue: \u2018[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u2019 regarding whether changed or extraordinary circumstances exist to excuse the filing of an asylum application beyond one year after [the alien\u2019s] arrival in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)). However, this bar applies \u201conly when the appeal seeks review of discretionary or factual questions, but not when the appeal seeks review of constitutional claims or matters of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Kaba contended that her asylum application was two years late because she did not know where to obtain the application, indicating that she was ignorant of the one-year filing deadline. The IJ found that Kaba did not present any evidence of changed or extraordinary circumstances, and ignorance of the filing deadline was no excuse. As the BIA pointed out, Kaba, who was represented by an attorney before the BIA, did not appeal the IJ\u2019s determination regarding the late filing of Kaba\u2019s asylum application. Moreover, although Kaba contends in her pro se opening brief that she did not timely apply for asylum \u201cbecause of [her] barrier of language,\u201d she does not argue in her supplemental brief, which was filed by counsel, that the IJ erred in finding her asylum application to be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Kaba\u2019s argument regarding the timeliness of her asylum application because she failed to exhaust it below. <em>See Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 289 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201cOnly those claims that have been properly presented to the BIA and considered on their merits can be reviewed .by the court in an immigration appeal.\u201d). In any event, we are barred from considering this claim because it concerns a factual dispute, and not a constitutional question or an issue of statutory construction. <em>See Vincent, </em>632 F.3d at 353; <em>see also Lybesha v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 877, 881 (8th Cir.2009) (holding that an argument concerning ignorance of asylum laws or application filing deadlines is a factual one); <em>Magdalena v. Attorney Gen. of the U.S., </em>139 Fed.Appx. 467, 469 (3d Cir.2005) (concluding that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>lacked jurisdiction to review the issue whether \u201clanguage and cultural barriers\u201d excused the late filing of asylum applications). As a result, we decline to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Kaba\u2019s asylum application as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The only remaining questions on appeal concern the denial of Kaba\u2019s application for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To prevail on such a claim, a petitioner must demonstrate that she faces a \u201cclear probability\u201d of \u201cpersecution\u201d based on her \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Pablo-Sanchez v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 592, 594 (6th Cir.2010) (citations omitted). The \u201cclear probability\u201d standard is more demanding \u201cthan the \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 standard for obtaining asylum because it requires the applicant to show that \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that [her] life or freedom would be threatened by persecution if [s]he returned to [her] home country.\u201d <em>Pablo-Sanchez, </em>600 F.3d at 594 (citation omitted). An adverse credibility determination is fatal to a withholding of removal claim in the absence of other evidence. <em>See El-Moussa v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 250, 257 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The new standards adopted by the REAL ID Act of 2005 for credibility determinations do not apply here because Kaba filed her asylum application prior to May 11, 2005. <em>See Ikharo v. Holder, </em>614 F.3d 622, 634 (6th Cir.2010). Credibility determinations are considered findings of fact, and are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 703 (6th Cir.2004). An \u201cimmigration judge\u2019s conclusion must be supported by specific reasons and must be based upon issues that go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. In other words, if discrepancies cannot be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution, they have no bearing on credibility.\u201d <em>Ceraj v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 583, 591 (6th Cir.2007) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Here, Kaba wrote in her asylum application that she was jailed for thirteen months but testified at the merits hearing that she was jailed for three days. When asked about this inconsistency, Kaba stated that she had hired someone to fill out the asylum application for her and provided this person with the appropriate information, but this person did not complete the application exactly as directed. The IJ and the BIA found Kaba not credible based on the discrepancy between the information in Kaba\u2019s asylum application and Kaba\u2019s testimony. Additionally, the IJ and the BIA found unpersuasive Kaba\u2019s explanation that someone else filled out her asylum application based on her level of education and her ability to speak and read English.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The record in this case does not compel a finding contrary to the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. An inconsistency does not necessarily mean that the petitioner is exaggerating or dissembling. Nevertheless, the IJ and the BIA had sufficient grounds to so find. The IJ and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Kaba was not credible was supported by specific reasons and the relevant discrepancy could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>be viewed as an attempt by Kaba to enhance her claim of persecution. There was a significant discrepancy regarding the length of Kaba\u2019s detention. Moreover, contrary to Kaba\u2019s testimony at the merits hearing, Kaba\u2019s asylum application states that her uncle, Ely Fofona, assisted her in completing her application and the section of the application containing the \u201cdeclaration of person preparing form if other than applicant, spouse, parent or child\u201d is left blank. Even if it is assumed that Kaba did hire someone to fill out her asylum application, it is difficult to believe that she was unable to review the completed application based on her demonstrated knowledge of English and evidence showing that she was able to at least read, if not write, English at the time of the application\u2019s filing. Thus, we affirm the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Even if a petitioner is found to be credible, \u201cwhere it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant\u2019s claim, such evidence should be provided .... The absence of such corroborating evidence can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof.\u201d <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>565 F.3d 971, 977 (6th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). The IJ\u2019s \u201cdetermination regarding the availability of corroborating evidence will not be reversed \u2018unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In support of her asylum application, Kaba presented an identification card, an RPG party card, and a letter from her ex-boyfriend that provided no information relevant to Kaba\u2019s claim. The IJ noted in the decision denying Kaba\u2019s applications that Kaba failed to submit corroborating evidence such as letters from her sister, the friend she stayed with after being released from jail, and the friend whose uncle picked her up from the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On appeal, Kaba argues that \u201cneither the IJ nor the BIA discussed or even mentioned the evidence submitted by [ ]Kaba.\u201d Indeed, the BIA did not discuss the issue of corroborating evidence in its opinion. However, the IJ did, and we review this portion of the final administrative order. <em>Acquaah, </em>589 F.3d at 334. Moreover, the documents submitted by Kaba prove nothing beyond that she was a member of the RPG party at some point in time, and there is no indication in the record that the corroborating evidence mentioned by the IJ was not available. Thus, we uphold the IJ\u2019s determination regarding the availability of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Because the IJ and the BIA did not err in finding that Kaba was not credible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Kaba fails to satisfy the burden of proof for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s decision denying Kaba\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">. Kaba failed to appear for her first hearing before the IJ on June 15, 2004, and was ordered removed in absentia. On August 27, 2004, Kaba, with the assistance of her first counsel, moved to reopen her proceedings before the Immigration Court. The IJ granted Kaba\u2019s motion on September 14, 2004. Kaba\u2019s proceedings were then continued until June 16, 2006. On October 15, 2005, Kaba\u2019s first counsel withdrew. On May 2, 2006, Kaba, with the assistance of her second counsel, filed a motion for a continuance. Kaba\u2019s proceedings were subsequently continued until April 12, 2007. On March 19, 2007, Kaba\u2019s second counsel moved to withdraw. The IJ granted this motion on March 29, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\">. Kaba explained that she was submitting this letter to show \"that it wasn\u2019t her plan to come and stay [in the United States].\u201d She said that \"I came here because I thought things were going to change after I left so I [could] go back because we were supposed to get married there....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\">. Kaba stated that these rebels would destroy houses owned by persons with whose opinions they disagreed, but the relationship between Kaba\u2019s RPG party membership and the destruction of her family\u2019s home is unclear, as her party participation was minimal and her sister was not an RPG parly member.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. Kaba also asked for protection under the CAT, which both the IJ and the BIA denied. However, Kaba does not mention her CAT claim in her supplemental brief except to request, at the conclusion of the brief, that \u201cthe decision of the Immigration Judge be reversed and [Kaba] be granted relief under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d Because Kaba fails to develop any argument in favor of her CAT claim, we deem it waived. <em>McPherson v. Kelsey, </em>125 F.3d 989, 995 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">. In connection with this claim, Kaba also argues that because she was not represented by counsel, she did not receive \"proper advise regarding her claim to asylum.\u201d Kaba also claims in her pro se opening brief that her proceedings should have been continued because she did not have a lawyer at the time of the merits hearing. However, Kaba did not present these claims to the BIA, and therefore we lack jurisdiction to consider them in the first instance. <em>See Bi Xia Qu v. Holder, </em>618 F.3d 602, 609 (6th Cir.2010). Moreover, Kaba received several continuances during the two years prior to her merits hearing, and she in fact hired two successive attorneys, each of whom ultimately withdrew from representing her. We are also foreclosed from considering Kaba\u2019s allegation that the IJ did not allow for a Fulani translator to be present at the merits hearing because Kaba did not present this claim to the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b537-7\">JANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATC\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">I concur in the result in this case and all its reasoning save reliance on the BIA\u2019s finding that Kaba was not credible. Kaba\u2019s petition for review is correctly dismissed based on the agency\u2019s determination that she failed to present reasonably available corroborating evidence. Therefore, it is unnecessary to affirm the adverse credibility determination of the IJ\u2019s and BIA and, in my opinion, preferable not to do so. I cannot view Kaba\u2019s testimony that she spent three days in prison as an attempt to enhance her claims of persecution. Had Kaba been disposed to self-serving lies, she would have testified that she was in prison for thirteen months, thus conforming her testimony with the petition and enhancing the possibility of being granted relief. Instead, Kaba testified that her petition statement contained an error. That testimony has all the indicia of truth, just as the petition statement has all the indicia of a scrivener\u2019s error or an error of translation by someone for whom English is a third language. I would not affirm the adverse credibility finding of the BIA as I believe it discourages aliens from testifying truthfully in removal proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
