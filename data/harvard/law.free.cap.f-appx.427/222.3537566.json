His counsel has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Johnson has declined to submit a pro se brief. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we will grant counsel\u2019s motion and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">In 2007, Johnson pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. On October 3, 2007, he was sentenced to a 15-month term of imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release. His supervision commenced on December 5, 2008. On September 4, 2009, his probation officer filed a Petition for Offender Under Supervision alleging that Johnson violated his conditions of supervised release by delivering a quantity of cocaine on August 18, 2009. On February 17, 2010, Johnson was sentenced in the Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas to Uf\u00e9 to 23 months\u2019 incarceration for the offense, and, upon his release, the District Court held a revocation hearing on the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">At his revocation hearing, Johnson admitted the violation. The District Court verified that Johnson understood that he had the right to have evidence of the violation produced, cross-examine witnesses, and produce evidence on his own behalf concerning the violation. The District Court also verified that Johnson had discussed this with his counsel and wished to admit the violation. Johnson\u2019s counsel noted that he was aware that the maximum sentence he could receive was 24 months and was aware of the Guidelines provision for the violation. The government noted that the Guidelines range for Johnson\u2019s violation was 30-37 months\u2019 imprisonment, and recommended imprisonment for the 24-month statutory maximum. The District Court sentenced the defendant to a 24-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">Johnson timely appealed and his counsel ultimately filed a motion to withdraw and supporting brief in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-19\">When the defendant\u2019s counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief, this Court\u2019s inquiry is \u201ctwofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In order to meet the requirements of the first part of the inquiry, counsel must both satisfy the court that she has thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues and explain why those issues are frivolous. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere the <em>Anders </em>brief initially appears adequate on its face, the proper course \u2018is for the appellate coui\u2019t to be guided in reviewing the record by the <em>Anders </em>brief itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (quoting <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Here, counsel\u2019s brief identifies three potential issues in the record: the jurisdiction of the District Court, the validity and voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s admission of the violation and waiver of his procedural rights, and the legality and reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s sentence. The District Court had jurisdiction of the underlying offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; it is authorized to revoke a term of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Counsel notes that because the defendant admitted to violating his conditions of supervised release, \u201cthe inquiry is ordinarily confined to whether the underlying plea was both counseled and voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 569, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). In this case, Johnson was represented at the hearing and the District Court informed him of his rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b). <em>See also United States v. Barnhart, </em>980 F.2d 219, 223 (3d Cir.1992) (addressing due process requirements in context of a revocation hearing). Johnson\u2019s counsel indicated that he pled guilty to the crime that served as the basis for the violation, and Johnson informed the court that he understood his rights, had discussed them with his lawyer, and wanted to waive the hearing and admit the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We review sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness with regard to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d 540, 542 (3d Cir.2007). \u201cAbsent procedural error, we will affirm the sentencing court \u2018unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>617 F.3d 766, 770 (3d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir.2009)). The defendant asked the District Court to consider that he committed the violation out of desperation and requested \u201cas low a sentence as possible\u201d at a prison that will help him develop a marketable skill. The District Court, noting that it had considered the arguments and the factors required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), sentenced the defendant to the statutory maximum of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court specifically noted that this sentence was below the Guideline range for this violation, which Johnson did not contest was 30-37 months for this Grade A violation for an individual in Criminal History Category V. We cannot say that no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed this sentence in this case. <em>Cf. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d at 545-46 (declining to find unreasonable a 60-month sentence on revocation of supervised release for Grade B violation, where Guideline range was 21-27 months\u2019 imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We find that counsel has adequately shown that there are no nonfrivolous appealable issues and our independent review of the record reveals that there are no appealable issues of merit. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is granted, and the District Court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>that the defendant violated his supervised release and sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
