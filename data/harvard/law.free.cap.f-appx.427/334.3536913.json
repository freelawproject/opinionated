While working for a third-party cargo interest as a marine surveyor, Waas fell from a Jacob\u2019s ladder rigged by the stevedore, Appellee Pacorini Holding, LLC, between a river barge and the MW IKAN MEXICO, owned by Appellee KK <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Shipping Marine S.A. Waas filed suit against Pacorini and KK Shipping, claiming negligence under the Longshore Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>and general maritime law. Both Pacorini and KK Shipping moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted their motions, dismissing Waas\u2019s claims. Waas filed a Rule 59(e) post-judgment motion to alter judgment, which the District Court denied. Waas timely appealed. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir.2008), and denial of a motion to alter judgment under Rule 59(e) for an abuse of discretion, <em>Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, LLC, </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The District Court held that Pacorini owed Waas a duty of ordinary care and that Pacorini did not breach that duty. Waas argues that the District Court improperly focused on the duty of care and failed to address Waas\u2019s argument that Pacorini breached its warranty of workmanlike performance. However, the warranty of workmanlike performance is not applicable to this case because it is a principle of contribution and indemnity between defendants. <em>See generally </em>1 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty &amp; Mar. Law \u00a7 5-8 (4th ed.2010) (discussing the limited use of the warranty of workmanlike performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Next, citing no authority for the proposition, Waas contends that by allowing Waas to use its ladder, Pacorini\u2019s duty of care became heightened. Under maritime law, Pacorini\u2019s duty is defined using general tort law. <em>In re Signal Int\u2019l, LLC, </em>579 F.3d 478, 491 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe determination of the existence and scope of a duty involves a number of factors, including most notably the foreseeability of the harm suffered by the complaining party.\u201d <em>In re Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>624 F.3d 201, 211 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation omitted). Based on testimony in the record, the District Court found that the use of a Jacob\u2019s ladder was a standard practice in the industry. And, there was no evidence that the ladder itself was defective. Pacorini acted with reasonable care. Nor do 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1915.74 and 1918.23(d) operate to increase the duty Pacorini owed Waas, because they regulate the duty owed by an employer to its employees, and Pacorini was not Waas\u2019s employer. Pacorini owed Waas a duty of ordinary care, which it did not breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The District Court also held that the vessel\u2019s owner, KK Shipping, did not have a duty to intervene to prevent use of the Jacob\u2019s ladder without fall protection. Waas argues that a jury should have been allowed to determine whether Pacorini\u2019s judgment in using the Jacob\u2019s ladder without fall protection was \u201cobviously improvident,\u201d triggering the duty to intervene. However, because as we explained above Pacorini\u2019s employment of the Jacob\u2019s ladder was standard practice in the industry and the ladder itself was not defective, the duty to intervene did not arise as a matter of law. <em>Greenwood v. Societe Francaise De, </em>111 F.3d 1239, 1249 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201c[I]n order for the expert stevedore\u2019s judgment to appear \u2018obviously improvident,\u2019 that expert stevedore must use an object with a defective condition that is so hazardous that anyone can tell that its continued use creates an unreasonable risk of harm even when the stevedore\u2019s expertise is taken into account.\u201d). KK Shipping had no duty to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Waas also argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to alter the judgment under Rule 59(e). The District Court concluded that even in light of Waas\u2019s other theories of negligence, Pacorini owed a duty of reasonable care, which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>did not breach. We cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Waas\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion to alter the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
