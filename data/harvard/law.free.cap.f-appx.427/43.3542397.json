The district court held that Adrogu\u00e9 Chico was precluded from continuing its suit under the doctrines of international comity and judicial estoppel because- it failed to disclose the present claim against the Bank during its 2001 bankruptcy proceedings in Argentina. Following entry of summary judgment, Adrogu\u00e9 Chico moved under Rule 60(b) for relief from the judgment, and the district court denied the motion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-21\">We review an order granting summary judgment de novo, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor. <em>City of Pontiac Gen. Empl. Ret. Sys. v. MBIA, Inc., </em>637 F.3d 169, 173 (2d Cir.2011). A motion seeking Rule 60(b) relief is reviewed for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>discretion. <em>See Nemaizer v. Baker, </em>793 F.2d 58, 61-62 (2d Cir.1986). On appeal, Adrogu\u00e9 Chico argues that the district court: (1) erred in granting summary judgment; and (2) abused its discretion in denying Adrogu\u00e9 Chico\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the courts. <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001). Under its 2001 Argentinian plan of reorganization, Adrogu\u00e9 Chico was required to repay only forty percent of its debts to its creditors, which would receive only approximately $2.7 million. It was relieved of approximately $6.7 million in pre-petition debt. Adrogu\u00e9 Chico obtained this relief based on, <em>inter alia, </em>its disclosure of its assets. Yet, it never disclosed what was arguably its largest asset \u2014 a $10 million claim against the Bank \u2014 even though, as it acknowledges on appeal, it was required by Argentine law to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">For substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion and order, the judgment and order of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED, with costs. We have considered appellant\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
