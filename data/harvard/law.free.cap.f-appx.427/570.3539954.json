We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, and review de novo constitutional challenges to removal orders. <em>Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Higareda Avila participated in alien smuggling as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), where the record reflects that he delivered fraudulent entry documents to another alien and drove the alien to the border intending to assist his entry into the United States in violation of law. <em>See Urzua Covarrubias v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 742, 748-A9 (9th Cir.2007) (knowing act of assistance to another\u2019s effort to enter the United States illegally is an affirmative act constituting alien smuggling); <em>cf. Aguilar Gonzalez v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 1204, 1209 (9th Cir.2008) (no affirmative act of alien smuggling where petitioner did not provide her daughter\u2019s birth certificate for use by another to enter the United States, but merely acquiesced to its use).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">Higareda Avila\u2019s due process rights were not violated by admission of the Form 1-213 because Higareda Avila failed to produce probative evidence casting doubt on the form\u2019s reliability. <em>See Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 311 (9th Cir.1995) (there is no right to cross-examine the preparer of a Form 1-213 where the alien fails to produce probative evidence casting doubt on the form\u2019s reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">Higareda Avila\u2019s claim that the Due Process Clause required that he be given a <em>Miranda </em>warning before questioning is without merit. <em>See Samayoa-Martinez v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 897, 901 n. 6 (9th Cir.2009) (noting the government is not required to notify an alien of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>remain silent or a right against self-inerimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
