For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">Because we write only for the parties, we assume their familiarity with the facts and procedural history, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">In the 1970s, hazardous waste was discarded in a sanitary landfill located on two parcels of land in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, polluting the surrounding environment. GE owns one of the lots on which the landfill was operated; Voorhees Township owns the other lot. Haddonbrook owns a parcel of land adjacent to Voorhees Township\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-17\">In 1991, GE brought an action against the operator of the landfill and numerous other parties seeking to recover costs incurred in responding to the environmental contamination at the former landfill site. In 1994, Plantation Homes, Inc. (\u201cPlantation\u201d), Haddonbrook\u2019s predecessor in title, moved to intervene in GE\u2019s action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plantation\u2019s proposed complaint alleged that GE and Voorhees Township, in addition to the defendants in GE\u2019s action, illegally \u201cdisposed or permitted disposal of toxic and hazardous waste at [the landfill] site,\u201d resulting in the contamination of the surrounding environment and consequent \u201cirreparable harm to [Plantation] in the use and enjoyment of its land.\u201d (J.A. 248-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">Like Haddonbrook\u2019s complaint in the instant action, Plantation\u2019s 1994 proposed intervenor complaint included claims for negligence and strict liability. Joseph Samost, who is a managing partner of Haddonbrook and was Plantation\u2019s president, submitted a certification in support of Plantation\u2019s motion to intervene in which he attested that he was aware of the facts set forth in the proposed complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that the complaint\u2019s allegations were true and accurate. On January 27, 1995, Plantation\u2019s motion to intervene was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On November 14, 2007, approximately thirteen years after Haddonbrook\u2019s predecessor in title was denied leave to intervene in the GE cost recovery action, Haddonbrook initiated this action against GE in New Jersey Superior Court, which GE removed to the District Court. Haddonbrook alleges that as a result of the disposal of hazardous waste on GE\u2019s property and the contamination of Haddonbrook\u2019s property it \u201chas been precluded from developing the Haddonbrook Property for any commercial and/or residential use, and from otherwise having, enjoying and receiving full use and value of its investment.\u201d (J.A. 272.) Haddonbrook asserts claims for negligence, strict liability, and nuisance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Because Samost attested to his knowledge of the facts set forth in Plantation\u2019s proposed intervenor complaint in 1994, and because Samost\u2019s knowledge is imputed to his partnership under N.J.S.A. 42:lA-3(f), the District Court concluded that Haddonbrook was aware of its claims against GE at least thirteen years before it filed suit. Rejecting Haddonbrook\u2019s argument that it had alleged \u201ccontinuing torts,\u201d the District Court granted GE\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Haddonbrook\u2019s claims were barred by the six-year limitations period. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 2A:14-1. Haddonbrook argues that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Under the continuing tort doctrine, \u201calthough the initial tortious act may have occurred longer than the statutory period prior to the filing of an action, an action will not be barred if it can be based upon the continuance of that tort within that period.\u201d <em>Thorndike v. Thorndike, </em>154 N.H. 443, 910 A.2d 1224, 1227 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Russo Farms, Inc. v. Vineland Board of Education, </em>144 N.J. 84, 675 A.2d 1077 (1996), the New Jersey Supreme Court set forth the principles governing the doctrine\u2019s application. The court explained that the doctrine is \u201cbest understood in the context\u201d of nuisance claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">When a court finds that a continuing nuisance has been committed, it implicitly holds that the defendant is committing a new tort, including a new breach of duty, each day, triggering a new statute of limitations. That new tort is an \u201calleged present failure\u201d to remove the nuisance, and \u201c[sjince this failure occurs each day that [defendant] does not act, the [defendant\u2019s] alleged tortious inaction constitutes a continuous nuisance for which a cause of action accrues anew each day.\u201d Essentially, courts in those cases impose a duty on the defendant to remove the nuisance. Because the defendant has a duty to remove the nuisance, and because the defendant\u2019s failure to remove the nuisance is a breach of that duty, each injury is a new tort. The plaintiff is therefore able to collect damages for each injury suffered within the limitations period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1084 (citations omitted). Thus, under <em>Russo Farms, </em>a continuing tort must \u201ccontain[ ] every element of a tort, including a new breach of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1087. Moreover, the <em>Russo Farms </em>court was explicit that \u201cnew injury\u201d must result from \u201ca new breach of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091; <em>see also Maslauskas v. United States, </em>583 F.Supp. 349, 351 (D.Mass.1984) (\u201cA continuing tort sufficient to toll the statute of limitations is occasioned by continual un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>lawful acts, not by continuing ill effects from an original tort\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In determining that Haddonbrook had failed to allege a continuing nuisance, the District Court relied on the fact that Haddonbrook sought damages for the diminution in value of its property \u2014 a measure of damages generally associated with permanent and not continuing nuisances. <em>See Weinhold v. Wolff, </em>555 N.W.2d 454, 465 (Iowa 1996); <em>Frank v. Envtl. Sanitation Mgmt., Inc., </em>687 S.W.2d 876, 883 (Mo.1985). As the District Court astutely observed: \u201cRecovery for value-diminution makes little sense in the context of continuing tort because if a nuisance can be abated (as it must to constitute a continuing tort), then the damage to appurtenant property is not permanent, and therefore a measure of damages that assumes permanent injury would be inappropriate.\u201d (J.A. 16-17.) In light of the \u201cpermanent\u201d damages sought and the evidence establishing that the value of the property was completely destroyed well before the six-year period prior to Haddonbrook\u2019s suit, the District Court concluded that Haddonbrook failed to allege any \u201cnew injury\u201d within the limitations period necessary to apply the continuing tort doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Haddonbrook argues that the District Court\u2019s decision ignores the evidence of the ongoing migration of contaminants from GE\u2019s property, which Haddonbrook argues establishes its \u201cnew injury\u201d within the limitations period. While it is true that contaminants may continue to flow onto Haddonbrook\u2019s property, the District Court correctly concluded that Haddonbrook failed to claim or adduce evidence of any compensable injury occurring within the limitations period. <em>See Player v. Motiva Enters. LLC, </em>No. 02-3216, 2006 WL 166452, at *9 (D.N.J. Jan. 20, 2006) (\u201c[T]he release of contaminants into the groundwater aquifer does not itself generate damages, unless Plaintiffs can show that they suffered harm.\u201d). We accordingly agree with the District Court that Haddonbrook failed to allege a continuing nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">As to Haddonbrook\u2019s negligence claim, the District Court determined that Haddonbrook failed to allege any newly breached duty apart from the duty to abate the contamination that is alleged in the nuisance claim. Indeed, <em>Russo Farms </em>requires a \u201cnew\u201d breach of duty, 675 A.2d at 1091, i.e., a breach of duty within the limitations period, and in the absence of any such allegation to support a claim distinct from the claim of nuisance, the District Court properly concluded that the negligence alleged was not a continuing tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Finally, the District Court determined that Haddonbrook failed to allege any conduct within the limitations period to support application of the continuing tort doctrine to its strict liability claim. In New Jersey, \u201cthose who use, or permit others to use, land for the conduct of abnormally dangerous activities are strictly liable for resultant damages.\u201d <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 N.J. 473, 468 A.2d 150, 157 (1983). Thus, for its strict liability claim to qualify as a continuing tort, Haddonbrook was required to demonstrate that GE engaged in abnormally dangerous activity within the limitations period. Haddonbrook\u2019s argument that GE is strictly liable for the continuing flow of contaminants onto Haddonbrook\u2019s property does not make this requisite showing. The District Court therefore correctly concluded that Haddonbrook\u2019s strict liability claim was not a continuing tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">As Haddonbrook\u2019s nuisance, negligence, and strict liability claims do not constitute continuing torts under <em>Russo Farms, </em>they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>are barred by the statute of limitations. We will accordingly affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of GE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-12\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-19\">. In 2000, Joseph Samost, Plantation\u2019s owner and president, conveyed the property to Haddonbrook, a partnership between Samost, his wife, and his daughter, for the consideration of $1.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. A fourth claim for trespass was dismissed on GE's motion for partial summary judgment. Haddonbrook does not appeal that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
