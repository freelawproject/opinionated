We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In support of its summary judgment motion, the government introduced evidence that Farid was convicted of forgery in violation of Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 470(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and check fraud in violation of \u00a7 476a(a), and that he committed these crimes after January 9, 1991, the date when Farid\u2019s statutory period of good moral character began to run. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(3). Farid did not dispute the government\u2019s evidence, but merely argued that the government failed to provide sufficient case law establishing that Farid was convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Because both forgery under \u00a7 470(a) and check fraud under \u00a7 476a(a) require proof of an intent to defraud, Farid was convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See Tall v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 1115, 1119 (9th Cir.2008). Thus, he was statutorily barred from establishing good moral character, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3), which is a statutory prerequisite to naturalization, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a). Given that Farid failed to \u201cshow[ ] that the materials cited do not establish the absence ... of a genuine dispute,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1)(B), the district court correctly concluded that Farid \u201cillegally procured\u201d his naturalization and properly granted summary judgment to the United States on this basis. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451; <em>Fedorenko v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 490, 506, 101 S.Ct. 737, 66 L.Ed.2d 686 (1981) (\u201cFailure to comply with [statutory prerequisites to naturalization] renders the certif\u00edcate of citizenship \u2018illegally procured,\u2019 and naturalization that is unlawfully procured can be set aside.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 517, 101 S.Ct. 737 (\u201c[District courts lack equitable jurisdiction to refrain from entering a judgment of denaturalization against a naturalized citizen whose citizenship was procured illegally or by willful misrepresentation of material facts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Because our conclusion that Farid\u2019s forgery and check fraud convictions rendered him statutorily ineligible for naturalization is dispositive of this appeal, we need not address the government\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">. Although the record is not entirely clear as to whether Farid pled guilty to forgery in violation of Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 475 or to forgery in violation of \u00a7 470(a), what is clear is that Farid pled guilty to forgery in violation of one of these two sections. Ultimately, the particular section under which Farid was convicted does not matter because both forgery under \u00a7 475 and forgery under \u00a7 470(a) require proof of an intent to defraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
