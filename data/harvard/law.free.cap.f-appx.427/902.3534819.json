That order explained that the court received the petition 63 days after the arbitrator\u2019s decision. That order further explained that a petition for review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision must be filed within 60 days of receipt of the decision. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121(f), 7703(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">Alcantar claims that it is \u201cirrelevant\u201d when his union representative received the award. The court, however, rejected this argument, explaining that the time for filing a petition starts when a copy of the final decision is received by petitioner\u2019s designated union representative. <em>See Ballard v. Defense Logistics Agency, </em>38 F.3d 1223 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>see also Gragg v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 1343 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b928-20\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-21\">Alcantar\u2019s motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
