We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-22\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Suwanda established changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse the delay in filing his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a); <em>Toj-Culpatan v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 1088, 1090-92 (9th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, Suwanda\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-23\">The record also does not compel the conclusion that Suwanda suffered past persecution based on the one beating, unfulfilled threats, and harassment that he experienced in Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60. Further, the record does not compel the conclusion that Suwanda demonstrated a clear probability of future persecution in Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha, </em>319 F.3d at 1184\u2014 85. Accordingly, Suwanda\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-24\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Suwanda failed to establish a likelihood of torture by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
