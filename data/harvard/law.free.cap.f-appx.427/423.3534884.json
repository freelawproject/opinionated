The district court sentenced Van to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Van now appeals, claiming that the district court (1) improperly denied his Rule 8(a) motion to sever the felon-in-possession charge; (2) violated his due process rights by, among other things, describing a federal agent as an expert witness; and (3) failed to recognize the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">A grand jury charged Andre Van with distribution of heroin and crack cocaine (counts one, three, four, and five); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime (count two); and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (count six). The drug charges stem from Van\u2019s interactions with an undercover ATF Special Agent, Michael Yott, who claimed that Van sold him drugs on four separate occasions over the course of a week. The felon-in-possession count arose a week after these drug buys when Detroit police discovered a firearm in Van\u2019s vehicle during a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Before trial, Van filed a Rule 8(a) motion to sever count six of the indictment, claiming its joinder would allow the government to \u201cbootstrap\u201d its elements into count two (possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime), which occurred nearly two weeks earlier. The district court denied the motion for lack of prejudice, and Van proceeded to trial on all six counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">At trial, Van admitted to two of the drug buys but denied responsibility for the other two, including the purchase underlying the possession-of-a-firearm-in-furtherance-of-drug-traffieking charge. Van claimed that his nephew conducted those sales and that Van merely recommended Yott as a reliable customer. Yott wore a wire and recorded three of the transactions; the government introduced the recordings into evidence. It also introduced recorded telephone conversations between Van and Yott arranging for drug purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Yott testified that Van had a firearm either nearby or on his person during all four transactions. According to Yott, during one buy, he and Van even \u201cdiscussed the caliber of the firearm, as well as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>couple of jokes ... about, you know, don\u2019t shoot yourself, that type of thing.\u201d Van does not contest that, during the initial drug buy, a revolver rested on the coffee table and a shotgun leaned against the wall. But Van disputes Yott\u2019s claim that Van carried this same revolver during the other transactions. Yott conceded that he could see only part of the gun during the latter three drug buys.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">After the third drug purchase, Yott\u2014 who then knew Van only as \u201cDre\u201d \u2014 directed two officers to conduct a traffic stop of Van\u2019s vehicle to procure identification. During this stop, one of the officers observed a brown leather holster in the bed of the truck, but did not see drugs or a firearm. While Van claims that the officers searched him and his truck, this same officer testified that he did not search Van, but did not recall whether his partner did.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A week after Van\u2019s final sale to Yott, Detroit police stopped Van for a traffic violation. Two officers attested that, as they attempted to pull Van over, they witnessed him bend downward \u201cas [if] he was placing something by his feet or under the seat.\u201d As the officers approached, Van started to step out of his truck and one of the officers observed an empty holster on his left hip. When questioned about the empty holster, Van said that he \u201c[wore] it for show.\u201d One of the officers spotted a blue steel .38-caliber revolver lying under the driver\u2019s seat. Van admitted that he did not have a concealed-carry permit, and the officers arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Detroit Police Sergeant Ramon Childs interviewed Van following his arrest. Childs testified that Van admitted to having a gun when arrested. According to Childs, Van said that \u201che had got[ten] shot almost two weeks ago, and he ... forgot his nephew had the pistol in the truck.\u201d When pressed by Childs as to why he really had the gun in his truck, Van said \u201cfor my protection.\u201d After the interview, Van initialed these statements. At trial, however, he denied bending forward in his truck, and again claimed that his nephew put the gun in his vehicle and that he did not know it was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">A few weeks after Van\u2019s interview with Childs, ATF Special Agent Gregory Lotoczky videotaped an interview with Van. According to Lotoczky, Van admitted to selling crack. He also admitted to having a .38-caliber revolver that \u201che would wear ... when he was at the house in his waistband\u201d and \u201cwould ... carry ... out to his truck if he was going to the bank or something like that.\u201d Van maintained, however, that the gun police discovered at the traffic stop \u201cdidn\u2019t belong to him\u201d and \u201cwas put in [his truck] by his nephew.\u201d Van refused to initial the majority of his statements as recorded by Lotoczky \u2014 including that he carried a .38-caliber revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">At trial, Van denied telling Lotoczky that he sold crack cocaine, carried the .38-caliber revolver in his waistband, or carried a firearm for protection. He accused Lotoczky of \u201cchanging the story around,\u201d and denied initialing some of the statements. Following Van\u2019s testimony, the government recalled Lotoczky. He testified that, on the night before, he reviewed the videotape of his interview with Van; and he confirmed that Van admitted to selling crack cocaine and to carrying the .38-caliber revolver in his waistband when he was at home. Lotoczky admitted to accusing Van of lying at certain times during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The jury convicted Van on all counts. Under the career-offender guideline, Van\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 360 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court sentenced Van to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Van first claims that the district court erred in denying his pretrial Rule 8(a) motion to sever his felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm charge. Under Rule 8(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">[t]he indictment or information may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged \u2014 whether felonies or misdemeanors or both \u2014 are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a). We typically review this issue de novo, <em>United States v. Locklear, </em>631 F.3d 364, 368 (6th Cir.2011), by examining the allegations on the face of the indictment, <em>United States v. Deitz, </em>577 F.3d 672, 691 (6th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1720, 176 L.Ed.2d 201 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we forgo this analysis because we determine that, even if the indictment improperly joined the counts against Van, any error qualifies as harmless. <em>See Locklear, </em>631 F.3d at 369 (noting that a finding of misjoinder is subject to harmless-error review); <em>Miller v. Stovall, </em>608 F.3d 913, 927 (6th Cir.2010) (recognizing that this court may conduct harmless-error review sua sponte but has no obligation to do so), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>79 U.S.L.W. 3404 (U.S. Dec. 21, 2010); <em>United States v. Mitts, </em>396 Fed.Appx. 296, 302-03 (6th Cir.2010) (applying harmless-error review despite government\u2019s failure to argue for such review on appeal), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (\u00da.S. Feb. 'll, 2011) (Nos.10-9035,10A546).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Under harmless-error review, we reverse only if the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights by \u201chav[ing] a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Locklear, </em>631 F.3d at 369 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Factors demonstrating harmlessness include (1) the issuance of limiting instructions to the jury; (2) overwhelming evidence of guilt; and (3) the admissibility of evidence concerning the misjoined counts. <em>Chavis, </em>296 F.3d at 461. The presence of each of these mitigating factors in Van\u2019s case supports our finding of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">\u201c[T]he danger of prejudice resulting from improper propensity inferences can be reduced significantly by proper curative instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Where the court issues such instructions, \u201c[ejrror based on misjoinder is almost always harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Cody, </em>498 F.3d 582, 587 (6th Cir.2007). \u201c[W]e should presume that the jury followed this instruction and did not make an improper propensity inference.\u201d <em>Chavis, </em>296 F.3d at 462. The district court thus likely offset any potentially prejudicial effect of the joinder with its curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-14\">This defendant has been charged with several crimes. The number of charges itself is no evidence of guilt and this should not influence your decision in any way. It\u2019s your duty to separately consider the evidence that relates to each charge and to return a separate verdict for each one. For each charge, you must decide whether the Government has presented proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of that particular charge. Your decision on one charge, whether it is guilty or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>guilty, should not influence your decision on any of the other charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">This court has previously found virtually identical instructions to significantly reduce the potential prejudice of any misjoinder. <em>See Cody, </em>498 F.3d at 588; <em>Chavis, </em>296 F.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The government, moreover, presented substantial \u2014 and possibly overwhelming\u2014 evidence against Van on the possession-of-a-firearm-in-furtherance-of-drug-trafficking charge. Yott testified that Van sold him crack cocaine and heroin while standing only a few feet from both a revolver and a shotgun. Although Van denied responsibility for that drug sale, he admitted that a revolver sat on the table during the transaction. Yott testified that Van carried this revolver during the ensuing drug buys, and that he and Van discussed the caliber of the firearm during a recorded buy \u2014 the tape of which the government played for the jury. Lotoezky corroborated Yott\u2019s statements, claiming that Van admitted to \u201ccarrying a 38 revolver in [his] waistband.\u201d Although Van refused to initial this statement following the interview, and denied making it, Lotoezky identified the portions of the interview videotape that reflected this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Finally, Van does not contend that severing the felon-in-possession charge would have barred the government from introducing the underlying firearm in support of the possession-of-a-firearm-in-furtheranee-of-drug-trafficking charge. He posits merely that the government could not have introduced evidence of his felon status. The prejudicial effect of this information, however, was limited because the specific crime underlying his previous conviction was never revealed to the jury since Van stipulated to his felony status, \u201cthereby preventing the jury from hearing testimony about it.\u201d <em>See Locklear, </em>631 F.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Based on these factors, any error the district court may have committed in permitting joinder of these counts qualifies as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Van next demands reversal of his convictions on counts one, two, three, and six, contending that the district court violated his right to due process and a fair trial when it described Yott as an expert witness without either formally qualifying him as such or distinguishing between Yott\u2019s factual and expert testimony. According to Van, this oversight bolstered Yott\u2019s \u201csuspect\u201d credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">In the challenged statement, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">You have heard the testimony of Michael Yott, who testified as an expert witness and as a fact witness. Regarding his expert testimony, you should treat his expert opinion as any other expert opinion. You do not have to accept an expert\u2019s opinion. In deciding how much weight you give to it, you should consider the witness\u2019[s] qualifications and how he reached his conclusions. Remember, that you alone decide how much of a witness\u2019[s] testimony to believe and how much weight it deserves. You should consider that he was also a fact witness and participated in the investigation of this case in deciding how much of his expert testimony to believe or what weight to give it, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Van\u2019s counsel objected to this instruction, arguing that Yott \u201cwas never qualified as an expert in this case.\u201d The district court acknowledged that Yott was not formally qualified as an expert, but held that the instruction could not \u201ccredibly be said to prejudice the jury in any way,\u201d especially because Yott \u201cwas, to some extent, treated as an expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cWe review challenges to jury instructions under the abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>612 F.3d 500, 506 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 367, 178 L.Ed.2d 237 (2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe Court considers the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly and adequately submitted the issues and applicable law to the jury.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Memphis City Sch., </em>589 F.3d 257, 264 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA judgment may be reversed based upon an improper jury instruction only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading, or prejudicial.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>612 F.3d at 506 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Van\u2019s argument for reversal based on the district court\u2019s description of Yott as an \u201cexpert witness\u201d during this jury instruction fails. Though Van cites a string of cases opining that courts should not describe a witness as an expert, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>488 F.3d 690, 697-98 (6th Cir.2007), none supports reversal of Van\u2019s convictions. The judge referred to Yott as an expert only once. And he did so in the context of a cautionary jury instruction, thereby mitigating any additional credence the jury might have granted. <em>See United States v. Serafina, </em>281 F.3d 327, 331 (1st Cir.2002) (finding \u201cwhatever special aura the jury might otherwise have attached to the term \u2018expert\u2019 \u201d mitigated by instruction that \u201c[e]x-pert testimony should be considered just like other testimony\u201d (alteration in original) (emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Van\u2019s argument that the district court compounded this supposedly improper jury instruction by failing to qualify Yott as an expert similarly falters. To the extent that Yott\u2019s general statement regarding the frequency with which drug dealers carry firearms or his specific statements about the gun he observed in this case qualify as expert testimony, the district court appropriately permitted Yott \u2014 who had served as a Detroit police officer for two years and as an ATF special agent for twenty years \u2014 to offer such testimony without first formally qualifying him as an expert. <em>See United States v. Cobb, </em>397 Fed.Appx. 128, 139 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201cIf a witness\u2019s qualifications are obvious, we have found that there is no need to formally qualify him as an expert.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1801, 179 L.Ed.2d 667 (2011); <em>United States v. Lopez-Medina, </em>461 F.3d 724, 742-43 (6th Cir.2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in district court\u2019s failure to qualify Drug Enforcement Administration agents before allowing their expert testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Relying on <em>Lopez-Medina, </em>Van argues that the district court\u2019s failure to issue a cautionary instruction informing the jury of Yott\u2019s dual role as an expert and fact witness both before he offered any opinion evidence and again before deliberations merits reversal. But <em>Lopez-Medina </em>does not require a district court to offer such instructions twice; it found error where the district court provided <em>neither </em>a cautionary jury instruction regarding the agents\u2019 dual roles <em>nor </em>a clear demarcation between their fact and expert testimony. 461 F.3d at 745. Here, the district court offered an expert-witness instruction and cautioned the jury that Yott testified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>two capacities. This instruction, moreover, addressed the \u201cparticular concerns\u201d that the <em>Lopez-Medina </em>court identified as arising when an officer gives expert testimony: it \u201cguard[ed] against a jury mistakenly weighing opinion testimony as if the opinion were fact,\u201d \u201cinstructed] the jury that they [were] free to reject the opinions given,\u201d and \u201caddress[ed] the additional risk of bias in forming expert conclusions regarding one\u2019s own investigation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 744; <em>see also United States v. Neeley, </em>308 Fed.Appx. 870, 878-79 (6th Cir.2009) (finding no plain error despite instruction designating witness as an expert because the trial court addressed the \u201cparticular concerns\u201d of <em>Lopez-Medina </em>by giving \u201ca general instruction on witness credibility as well as an expert witness instruction\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, Van claims that three other trial events compounded the court\u2019s supposed error in describing Yott as an \u201cexpert.\u201d Although he does not say so explicitly, Van presumably pairs the challenged jury instruction with these events to argue that the cumulative effect of these supposed errors amounted to a denial of his due process right to a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Cobleigh, </em>75 F.3d 242, 249-50 (6th Cir.1996). But none of the circumstances Van identifies converts the court\u2019s reference to Yott as an expert during jury instructions into reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Van first claims that the district court bolstered Yott\u2019s credibility and diminished defense counsel in front of the jury when it cut short counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Yott regarding the way he titled his investigation report and accused counsel of \u201cwasting the jury\u2019s time.\u201d But the law does not require the court to remain a silent observer, and this single incident did not improperly bolster Yott\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. Powers, </em>500 F.3d 500, 511-12 (6th Cir.2007) (noting that judge \u201cmay interject himself into the trial, speak to counsel, and question witnesses,\u201d and finding court \u201cwithin its discretion to move defense counsel along from a repetitive and irrelevant line of questioning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Nor does the witnesses\u2019 supposed violation of a sequestration order further Van\u2019s argument. At the conclusion of Yott\u2019s testimony, Yott spoke with defense counsel regarding the distinction between a snub-nose revolver and a .38-caliber revolver. During this conversation, two other witnesses, Officers Amos and Estrada, approached, and Yott asked how they would describe the gun. When defense counsel moved for a mistrial \u2014 a motion the district court denied \u2014 the government argued that Yott did not discuss the substance of his testimony with the officers. Defense counsel, moreover, cross-examined Amos on this issue, exposing any possible collusion to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">And Van\u2019s last claim \u2014 that the officers\u2019 failure to uncover a firearm during a search undermined Yott\u2019s testimony that Van carried a firearm during the third drug sale \u2014 also proves unavailing. Though Van testified that the officers searched him, one of the officers involved testified that he and his partner stopped Van solely to ask for identification and that he never searched Van or his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Because we reject all of the \u201cerrors\u201d Van identifies, we conclude that he was not denied his due process right to a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Swidan, </em>888 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>1076,1081 (6th Cir.1989) (\u201cThere can be no accumulation of errors when no errors are found.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Finally, Van claims the sentencing court erred procedurally by treating the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory and failing to resolve a dispute about the nature of the Guidelines in open court. We review the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445(2007)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A court commits procedural error by \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We normally \u201cpresume that the district court understood its [sentencing] discretion, absent clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>United States v. Santillana, </em>540 F.3d 428, 431 (6th Cir.2008). Here, however, the court sentenced Van in early 2008 \u2014 in the wake of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), two cases that clarified courts\u2019 authority to grant variances. In similar cases where the fluctuating legal landscape has given us reason to question whether the district court understood its discretion to vary from the Guidelines, we have instead reviewed the record for \u201csome indication of error\u201d and required the appellant to demonstrate more than \u201cmere conjecture\u201d that the court felt improperly constrained. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kosack, </em>366 Fed.Appx. 642, 647-49 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3339, 176 L.Ed.2d 1234 (2010); <em>United States v. Maye, </em>582 F.3d 622, 632-33 (6th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Guest, </em>564 F.3d 777, 779-81 (6th Cir.2009). We apply that standard here. Nevertheless, \u201cby now, the default assumption is that sentencing courts are aware of their authority to vary from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Borden, </em>365 Fed.Appx. 617, 621 (6th Cir.2010) (reviewing the record for a \u201cclear indication of error\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Castaneda-Comacho, </em>421 Fed.Appx. 604, 607 (6th Cir.2011) (\u201c[W]e presume that the district court understood its discretion [to grant a departure or variance], absent clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Ramirez-Soria, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 636, 637 (6th Cir.2011) (presuming the district court understood its authority to vary and, accordingly, requiring the defendant to \u201cadduc[e] clear evidence that the district judge erroneously believed he lacked discretion\u201d to vary from the Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Van points to the judge\u2019s adjournment of his initial sentencing hearing to reflect on the then-recent <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Gall </em>decisions, which the defense argued broadened the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion. In adjourning the proceedings, the judge noted that he felt \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d and that he \u201cwant[ed] to feel more certain ... that [he] ha[d] some idea of what [his] discretion [was] and how broad it [was] and some idea how [he] should use that discretion in this case.\u201d The judge sidestepped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the issue when the sentencing hearing later resumed, Van argues, failing to resolve the issue of its discretion or to acknowledge the advisory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The court committed no procedural error. In adjourning the sentencing, the court merely acknowledged Van\u2019s argument and committed to granting it serious consideration. <em>See United States v. Damra, </em>621 F.3d 474, 508 (6th Cir.2010) (recognizing court\u2019s obligation to consider defendant\u2019s nonfrivolous arguments), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2930, 180 L.Ed.2d 224 (2011). In the second hearing, moreover, the district court resolved the parties\u2019 dispute by recognizing its discretion to issue either a downward departure or a variance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">My strongest concern at the earlier date in December was whether the criminal history used in the calculation of the sentencing guideline range overrepresented the seriousness of Mr. Van\u2019s criminal history, or the likelihood that the Defendant will commit further crimes. Your sentencing memoranda, Mr. Van, <em>argued strongly and persuasively ... that this is a case for downivard departure or variance </em>because the criminal history is overstated. <em>I\u2019ve considered that a serious and heavy argument </em>in favor of moving the sentence to a lower level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The court further explained its reasons for not departing or varying, noting Van\u2019s \u201ccontinuing pattern of illegal behavior,\u201d including violating the conditions of his state parole by absconding twice in the previous five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The district court\u2019s discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors indicates that it understood that it must not rely on the Guidelines as reasonable or mandatory but rather must consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine an appropriate sentence based on the individual circumstances: \u201cI\u2019ve considered [the \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the life history of [Van], <em>I\u2019ve also considered whether or not the sentence arrived at by the sentencing guidelines properly reflects the [\u00a7 3553(a) factors].\u2019\u2019 Cf. United States v. Simpson, </em>346 Fed.Appx. 10, 16 (6th Cir.2009) (concluding that the totality of the record indicated that the district court misunderstood its authority despite the district court\u2019s multiple references to the advisory nature of the Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Contrary to Van\u2019s arguments, the record does not indicate that the district court misunderstood its sentencing authority when addressing his request for a variance based on his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">For the above reasons, we affirm Van\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\">. As the government acknowledged at oral argument, failure to renew a Rule 8(a) motion at the close of the evidence does not forfeit an improper-joinder claim. <em>See United States v. Chavis, </em>296 F.3d 450, 457-58 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. The government argues for plain-error review, claiming that, while Van objected to the disputed jury instruction below, he did so solely because Yott \"was never qualified as an expert in this case.\u201d But we need not determine whether Van sufficiently preserved the basis for his objection articulated here because his argument fails even abuse-of-discretion review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. Van also relies upon <em>United States v. Serafino, </em>281 F.3d 327 (1st Cir.2002), and <em>Scheldt v. Klein, </em>956 F.2d 963 (10th Cir.1992), two cases in which the district court instructed the jury regarding the evaluation of expert witness testimony. In both cases, the defendant <em>failed </em>to establish plain error. And the distinctions Van emphasizes do not compel us to find an abuse of discretion in his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. Abuse-of-discretion rather than plain-error review applies because the court failed to ask the parties if they had any unraised objections to the sentence. <em>See United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865, 872 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Gapinski, </em>561 F.3d 467, 473-74 (6th Cir.2009) (finding that merely asking whether counsel had \"[ajnything else for the record\u201d did not satisfy <em>Bostic </em>requirement (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
