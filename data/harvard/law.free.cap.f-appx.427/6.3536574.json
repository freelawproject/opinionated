R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of conviction be affirmed. Appellant has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in accepting his guilty plea or that any alleged errors implicated his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>587 F.3d 1122, 1130-31 (D.C.Cir.2009). The totality of circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s plea, including the district court\u2019s clear warnings about his likely deportation and appellant\u2019s acknowledgments of the same, indicate that the plea was voluntary and appellant understood the resulting immigration consequences. <em>See In re Sealed Case, </em>283 F.3d 349, 352 (D.C.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
