In March 2010, he sent a letter to the district court seeking a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court treated the letter as a motion seeking relief under Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for crack cocaine offenses, and denied it on the ground that Gray\u2019s sentence was not based on crack cocaine, but, rather, on 43 kilograms of cocaine powder. Gray now appeals the ruling, contending that the offense for which he was sentenced involved both crack cocaine <em>and </em>cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-18\">Amendment 706 provided a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 706. Amendment 706 became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission listed Amendment 706 in \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) on March 3, 2008, therefore making the amendment retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-19\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-20\">[I]n the ease of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-21\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission policy statement applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides that if a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range has \u201csubsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual list<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ed in [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) ], the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Amendment 706 had no effect on Gray\u2019s sentence. Gray pled guilty to participation in a conspiracy involving specified amounts of cocaine powder and crack cocaine, but the sentence the court imposed was based, as indicated above, only on 43 kilograms of cocaine powder. Moreover, there is no merit to Gray\u2019s argument that his post-conviction conduct warranted a reduction in his sentence. Because Gray was not entitled to resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not have authority to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cGiven that [defendant\u2019s] sentencing range did not change, the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence and that it did not need to examine the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
