Fryman maintains that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>state court sentence of 25 years to life for possession of 1.2 grams of cocaine base amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He also argues that prospective application of California\u2019s Proposition 36, a voter initiative mandating drug treatment instead of incarceration for nonviolent drug possession offenders, violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(2). Under AEDPA, an unreasonable application of law is not merely clearly erroneous; it is \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 75-76, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Under this highly deferential standard of review, neither of Fryman\u2019s claims entitles him to habeas relief. The state courts\u2019 conclusion that Fryman presented no viable constitutional claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
