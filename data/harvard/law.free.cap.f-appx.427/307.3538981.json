Espinosa was subject to a minimum mandatory sentence of life imprisonment due to his two previous felony drug convictions, but the district court downwardly departed to a 216-month sentence on account of Espinosa\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Espinosa argues that he is eligible for a reduction in his offense level based on the retroactive crack cocaine amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that any prohibition on application of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is in conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), as well as inconsistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s statutory obligations. He also asserts that a reduction in his sentence is appropriate considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Espinosa\u2019s guideline sentencing range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine for which he was held accountable; rather it was derived from the statutory mandatory minimum applicable to his offense, which was life imprisonment on account of his two previous felony drug convictions. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(a)(ii)(II). In view of the foregoing, Espinosa was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 1B1.10 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court did not err in denying relief. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-79 (5th Cir.2010). This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the district court downwardly departed from the mandatory minimum sentence due to Espinosa\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government. <em>See Carter, </em>595 F.3d at 579-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">To the extent Espinosa contends that he was entitled to reduction in his original sentence under the principles of <em>Booker, </em>his argument is without merit. \u201cA \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). <em>Booker </em>does not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
