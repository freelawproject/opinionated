Jesus Alvarez Lara (Alvarez) pleaded guilty to illegal reentry by a previously deported alien and was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He now appeals his sentence, which was based on a upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, arguing that the facts did not warrant an upward departure and that the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">We review Alvarez\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Reasonableness review, in the context of a guidelines departure, requires this court to evaluate both the decision to depart upward and the extent of the departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure is not an abuse of discretion if the reasons for the departure advance the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) and are justified by the particular facts of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Given Alvarez\u2019s extensive criminal record and the lack of deterrent effect from prior lenient sentences, the district court did not abuse its discretion by upwardly departing based upon its finding that Alvarez\u2019s criminal history under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood that he would recidivate. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 418 n. 24 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>9 F.3d 1116, 1118 (5th Cir.1993). Additionally, Alvarez has not shown that the district court erred in determining the extent of the departure. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48. Following the direction of \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B), because Alvarez was already in the highest criminal history category, the district court moved incrementally down the Sentencing Table from a total offense level of ten to an offense level of 14; a total offense level of 14 with a criminal history category of VI yielded a new advisory sentencing guidelines range of 37 to 46 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch.5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table. The district court determined that 46 months was the most appropriate and reasonable sentence for Alvarez. This 46-month sentence was 16 months greater than the high-end of the guidelines sentence range applicable without the upward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table. This court has affirmed similar and more substantial departures. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48; <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d 203, 205 n. 7, 206 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
