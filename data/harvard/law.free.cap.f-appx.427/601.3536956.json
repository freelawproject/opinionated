Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain our decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">The district court did not err in admitting Special Agent Schneider\u2019s testimony. As to the testimony to which Mancha objected at trial, the district court properly allowed interpretations of encoded drug jargon, and exercised its discretion in striking those portions that were clearly improper. <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>575 F.3d 900, 922-23 (9th Cir.2009). To the extent Special Agent Schneider interpreted the meaning of ambiguous terms, such testimony is admissible if it is based on the witness\u2019s knowledge of the particular case and defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 922. Moreover, when viewed in the context of the properly admitted testimony, any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Freeman, </em>498 F.3d 893, 905-06 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">As to the testimony to which Mancha did not object, there was no plain error. Even where the government concedes that Special Agent Schneider improperly interpreted clear statements, Mancha has not established that the testimony affected his \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d that is, that it \u201c\u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Puckett v.
