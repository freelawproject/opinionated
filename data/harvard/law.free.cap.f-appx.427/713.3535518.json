On appeal, Lomax argues that the district court erred in remanding her complaint because federal jurisdiction was proper and because her state claims asserting the Defendants\u2019 breach of landlord obligations were meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 842 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court \u201capplies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, ... makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous ... [or] applies] the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner.\u201d <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Although we show leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants, we will not serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel or \u201crewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010) (recognizing that <em>Iqbal </em>effectively overturned <em>GJR\u2019s </em>heightened pleading standard for certain 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1), a defendant may remove an action to federal court if it is brought \u201c[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in remanding Lomax\u2019s complaint to state court because, as the state court plaintiff, she was not entitled to remove the case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Based on a review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s remand of Lomax\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">. We have jurisdiction to review this action because Lomax filed a timely notice of appeal of her Rule 60(b) motion. Her Rule 60(b) motion was timely because that provision gives the litigant a year in which to file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-27\">.
