We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Palma failed to establish that he was or would be targeted on account of a protected ground in El Salvador. <em>See id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2004) (petitioner has the burden of showing a purported criminal investigation has no \u201cbona fide objective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Palma is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to establish it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in El Salvador. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">Palma\u2019s request to file a replacement brief is granted.
