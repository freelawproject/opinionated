Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). <em>See Watson v. Ricks, </em>No. 05 Civ. 7288, 2010 WL 2346614, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2010). The district court denied relief only after reviewing the record of a reconstruction hearing conducted pursuant to an earlier order of the district court. <em>See Watson v. Ricks, </em>No. 05 Civ. 7288, 2008 WL 490610 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.22, 2008). We review the denial of a habeas corpus petition <em>de novo. See Jones v. West, </em>555 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Objections to a peremptory challenge under <em>Batson </em>are subject to a familiar three-step review by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose. Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. Third, if a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-14\"><em>Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). On direct appellate review of a <em>Batson </em>ruling, we generally afford \u201cgreat deference\u201d to a district court\u2019s determination of discriminatory intent, <em>see, e.g., Jordan v. Lefevre, </em>206 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2000), because that question of fact often turns on the court\u2019s evaluation of witness credibility, <em>see Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 364, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. at 98 n. 21, 106 S.Ct. 1712. When a state trial court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>ruling is challenged under \u00a7 2254, our review is further limited by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), under which we will not identify constitutional error unless the record \u201ceompel[s] the conclusion that the trial court had no permissible alternative but to reject the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral justifications.\u201d <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. 333, 341, 126 S.Ct. 969, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006). Watson cannot satisfy this demanding standard simply by pointing to the fact that, at the same time the prosecutor denied discriminating against jurors of West Indian descent, she questioned whether West Indian descent qualified as an ethnic class triggering <em>Batson </em>review. Where, as in this case, a reconstruction hearing was conducted, petitioner must show that the record as a whole compelled the conclusion required by <em>Rice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>On appeal, Watson faults the trial court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>rulings at the reconstruction hearing with respect to two of the five challenged jurors of West Indian descent. Accordingly, we need not discuss the other three. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that when litigant raises issue before district court but does not raise it on appeal, it is deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">1. <em>Newman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">At the reconstruction hearing, the prosecutor testified that she struck prospective juror Newman based on Newman\u2019s volunteered comments that a relative with a prior arrest \u201chad been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Reconstruction Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27. The prosecutor reported concern that this indicated a predisposition to view the defendant as wrongly accused. Finding the rationale nondiscriminatory and crediting it being held in good faith, the trial court determined that Watson had not demonstrated that it was a pretext for illegal discrimination, a determination that the district court concluded was not unreasonable. <em>See Watson v. Ricks, </em>2010 WL 2346614, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In urging otherwise, Watson advances two arguments. First, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s justification relies upon a miseharacterization of Newman\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>testimony. <em>See Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 244, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). Specifically, Watson contends that Newman did not profess <em>his </em>belief that his relative was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d but stated only that police officers told him that his relative was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d The point merits little discussion. As Watson acknowledged at the reconstruction hearing, he offered a \u201cpossible reading\u201d of the juror\u2019s statement in contrast to the prosecutor\u2019s. Reconstruction Hr\u2019g Tr. at 51. This does not compel the conclusion that the trial court had \u201cno possible alternative\u201d but to accept Watson\u2019s interpretation, much less to dismiss the prosecutor\u2019s professed concern as a pretext for discrimination. <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. at 341, 126 S.Ct. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Second, Watson contends that the prosecutor misrepresented the <em>voir dire </em>record in distinguishing Newman from prospective juror Rosa, whose friend was also accused of a crime. Although the prosecutor testified that Rosa had reported not seeing his friend \u201cin around five years,\u201d Reconstruction Hr\u2019g Tr. at 57, Rosa stated that he had done so recently. Thus, Watson contends that the challenged <em>Batson </em>ruling as to Newman is based on a clear factual error. We are not persuaded. Notwithstanding Rosa\u2019s recent interaction with his friend, the five-year period without contact between the two permitted the prosecutor to conclude that the friend \u201cis somebody that [Rosa] obviously is not involved in,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 67, thereby providing a non-discriminatory reason for drawing a distinction between Newman and Rosa. Rosa\u2019s recent encounter with his friend does not undermine the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s main justification for excusing Newman \u2014 that Newman expressly empathized with his relative and \u00f3ffered his own judgment regarding the reason for his relative\u2019s arrest. Rosa, by contrast, expressed no opinion regarding the merits of his friend\u2019s arrest. In sum, even if \u201c[Reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree\u201d about how to view these considerations in evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s proffered justification, \u201con habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\u2019s credibility determination\u201d that the challenge to Newman was not based on discriminatory intent. <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. at 341-42, 126 S.Ct. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">2. <em>Miller</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">At the reconstruction hearing, the prosecutor proffered several justifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>for striking prospective juror Miller: (1) Miller knew an attorney from another country where laws would apply differently from in the United States; (2) Miller\u2019s work as a registered nurse might prompt her to substitute her own judgment for expert witnesses\u2019 regarding DNA evidence; and (3) Miller\u2019s recent civil jury service, and her description of that service, raised concern about her ability to serve on a criminal jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Watson concedes that \u201coccupation-based peremptory challenged are generally deemed non-pretextual,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 58, but contends that the occupation-based justification in this case could not reasonably be credited because it was preceded by a series of implausible justifications, <em>see Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. at 246, 125 S.Ct. 2317. We are not persuaded, however, that the trial court was compelled to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s other proffered justifications were implausible. Insofar as Watson submits that Miller\u2019s relationship with corrections officials was not a plausible ground for striking her in light of similarly situated jurors, the point warrants no discussion because the prosecutor explicitly did not offer that reason as a justification. Watson submits that the prosecutor\u2019s concern about Miller\u2019s relationship with a foreign lawyer was \u201cso lacking in reasoned analysis as to be virtually incoherent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 56. The question for consideration at the reconstruction hearing was not whether the concern might have been assuaged, for example, by securing the juror\u2019s assurance not to speak with the lawyer or anyone else about the case. Rather, the question was whether the prosecutor genuinely maintained this nondiscriminatory concern or advanced it only as a pretext for discrimination. The record here did not foreclose the former finding or compel the latter. Finally, Watson suggests that professed concern about Miller\u2019s description of her civil jury service was implausible because the prosecutor failed to question Miller further about that service. This was an argument for the trial court to consider, but did not compel a finding of pretext. Much less was such a finding compelled by the total record.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We have considered Watson\u2019s other arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
