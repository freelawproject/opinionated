At summary judgment, the district court found that McCoy\u2019s claims were frivolous and unsupported by the record. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">On appeal McCoy argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his due process and FMLA claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>summary judgment rulings and draws all inferences and reviews all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only \u2018if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">McCoy first argues that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on his due process claim. Specifically, McCoy argues that ADOC failed to comply with internal procedures for timely service of a notice of suspension. \u201c[T]he Constitution requires that the state provide fair procedures and an impartial decisionmaker before infringing on a person\u2019s interest in life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1561 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). \u201c[A] tenured employee is entitled to oral or -written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Thus, the employee is entitled to a pretermination hearing to determine \u201cwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">McCoy\u2019s procedural due pi'ocess claim lacks merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McCoy does not dispute that ADOC gave him written notice of his ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>mination and the reasons for it. Nor does McCoy dispute either that ADOC held a hearing before his termination or that after McCoy\u2019s termination, he had an additional administrative hearing before the Alabama Personnel Board. Moreover, McCoy waived his right to administrative hearings when ADOC provided written notice of all but one of his suspensions from work before his termination. When McCoy chose to exercise his right to an administrative hearing upon his fifteen-day suspension, ADOC afforded him a hearing and gave him a chance to tell his side of the story. In light of these facts, we cannot say that McCoy satisfied his burden to show a genuine issue of material fact on his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">McCoy next argues that genuine issues of material fact remain on his FMLA claim which preclude summary judgment. Specifically, McCoy argues that ADOC improperly failed to excuse his absences when he took time off from work to (1) attend his former legal guardian\u2019s funeral; (2) search for his wife when she was missing; and (3) have his mother involuntarily committed for mental health treatment. \u201cThe FMLA entitles an eligible employee to twelve work weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve-month period if [ ]he needs the leave in order \u2018to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C)). \u201cTo prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA.\u201d <em>Spokes v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>631 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">McCoy has failed to show that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Neither his absence to attend a funeral nor his absence to search for his missing wife involved caring for a relative with \u201ca serious health condition\u201d as required for coverage under the FMLA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C); <em>see also Scobey v. Nucor Steel-Arkansas, </em>580 F.3d 781, 788 (8th Cir.2009) (noting that attending a funeral is not protected activity under the FMLA); <em>Andonissamy v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>547 F.3d 841, 852 (7th Cir.2008) (same). Although McCoy\u2019s mother\u2019s mental illness may constitute \u201ca serious health condition,\u201d McCoy failed to establish before the district court that he requested leave or gave ADOC notice of his need for time off to care for her. \u201cThe FMLA requires employees to provide 30 days advance notice of the leave, when the need to take leave is foreseeable.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>428 F.3d at 1382; <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(e)(2)(B). If leave is not foreseeable, notice must be given \u201cas soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(a). The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment in favor of ADOC on McCoy\u2019s FMLA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of ADOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-14\">. McCoy's notice of appeal provides that he appeals the district court\u2019s \"order entered ... on the 11 [th] day of August 2010.\u201d In that order, the district court denied McCoy's mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tion to amend, alter or vacate the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) and 60(b)(1). We must, however, liberally construe the notice of appeal in favor of the appellant \"where the intent to appeal an unmentioned or mislabeled ruling is apparent and there is no prejudice to the adverse party.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Wainwright, </em>726 F.2d 702, 704 (11th Cir.1984). McCoy's initial brief makes clear his intent to appeal the district court\u2019s underlying order granting summary judgment in favor of ADOC. We therefore construe his notice of appeal as covering that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. McCoy has waived his challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his remaining claims by failing to brief these issues fully on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (recognizing that \"issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned\u201d); <em>see also Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that a party waives an issue by failing to make substantive arguments with respect to that issue in his brief on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-13\">. To the extent that McCoy raises a substantive due process claim, that claim is invalid in this context. \"[I]n non-legislative cases, only procedural due process claims are available to pretexlually terminated employees.\u201d <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556, 1560 (\"[Ajreas in which substantive rights are created only by state law (as is the case with tort law and employment law) are not subject to substantive due process protection under the Due Process Clause....\u201d). Because McCoy's termination stems from a non-legislative act, he may raise a procedural, but not a substantive, due process claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1557 n. 9. (\"The most common examples [of non-legislative acts] are employment terminations.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
