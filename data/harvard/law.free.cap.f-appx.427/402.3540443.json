The district court sentenced Medina to 30 months in prison, which was the term at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range of imprisonment. Medina\u2019s sentence reflected a 16-level increase in his offense level because of his previous Florida conviction for aggravated assault, which the district court found to be a crime of violence. On appeal, Medina argues that the district court erred in concluding that his aggravated assault conviction constituted a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The Government urges us to dismiss Medina\u2019s appeal, arguing that the appeal is barred by the appeal waiver provision in Medina\u2019s written plea agreement. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Medina waived his right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined on any ground set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3742. Although Medina acknowledges the appeal waiver provision in his plea agreement, he contends that he reserved his right to challenge the district court\u2019s characterization of his aggravated assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). A defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement if (1) the waiver is knowing and voluntary, a factor Medina does not challenge, and (2) the waiver \u201capplies to the circumstances at hand, based on the plain language of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). In determining whether an appeal waiver applies, we employ normal principles of contract interpretation, construing waivers narrowly and against the Government. <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir.2006). While \u201cany ambiguity must be construed in favor of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal,\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>434 F.3d 767, 770 (5th Cir.2005), we will not read ambiguity into an agreement in which none readily manifests itself, <em>Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The record reflects that Medina\u2019s plea agreement contains a factual summary indicating that Medina was deported \u201cafter having been convicted of the aggravated felony of Aggravated Assault.\u201d In response to that statement, defense counsel included a handwritten notation on the plea agreement that Medina \u201creserve[d] the right to dispute the characterization of \u2018Aggravated Felony' at sentencing.\u201d During Medina\u2019s rearraignment, the magistrate judge summarized the reservation as follows: \u201cYou will reserve your right to dispute the characterization of this as an aggravated felony at time of sentencing.\u201d Medina did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s statement. Medina\u2019s reservation failed to alter the plain language of the waiver. Instead, it merely clarified that he intended to challenge at sentencing the characterization of his aggravated assault conviction as an aggravated felony. <em>See Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 544-45; <em>Palmer, </em>456 F.3d at 488. Because Medina\u2019s appeal is barred by the appeal waiver, we do not address the merits of Medina\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. Sanchez Guerrero, </em>546 F.3d 328, 335 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
