In his complaint, Lawson alleged violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1, and the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 761.01,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that Lawson\u2019s professed beliefs in Orthodox Judaism were insincere, the district court dismissed the action as frivolous under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). On appeal, Lawson argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his suit as frivolous, inappropriately resolved disputed issues of fact about Lawson\u2019s sincerity, and failed to afford him adequate notice and an opportunity to present evidence before dismissing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>complaint. After a review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Lawson filed an amended complaint alleging that the DOC burdened his practice of Orthodox Judaism by, <em>inter alia, </em>denying him access to Kosher meals, denying access to daily and weekly religious services, and denying his right to observe Jewish holidays.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The DOC moved to dismiss the complaint as frivolous because Lawson\u2019s religious belief were not sincere. It also requested dismissal as a sanction against Lawson for filing a frivolous lawsuit. In support of the motion, the DOC submitted records of Lawson\u2019s canteen purchases, which included poor boy sandwiches, cheeseburgers, and numerous other non-Kosher items. The DOC submitted several affidavits as well, including ones from Sergeant Dean Bevis, Chaplain David Kyle Giddens, and inmate Joseph Wiley. Bevis stated that the prison meal program served three meals a day and that inmates were eligible for an alternative entree. Bevis noted that Lawson had chosen the regular meal option while housed in administrative and disciplinary confinement. Chaplain Giddens stated that, based on his interactions with Lawson, Lawson was not sincere in his religious beliefs. He noted that Lawson had not attended Jewish morning prayer services over the past year and had rejected an offer for a work proscription for Saturdays because he had \u201ctoo much legal work to do.\u201d Inmate Wiley, the canteen operator, stated that Kosher items were designated with a \u201cK\u201d on the canteen menu, he had sold non-Kosher items to Lawson, and he had seen Lawson eat non-Kosher foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In opposition to the motion to dismiss, Lawson filed a motion to strike the affidavits, disputed the content of the affidavits, and submitted affidavits of other inmates to establish that he had been deprived of the opportunity to practice his religion. He also submitted grievances and other documentation for the district court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">The magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous because there was evidence that Lawson\u2019s religious beliefs were not sincere.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over Lawson\u2019s objections, and after considering Lawson\u2019s motion, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">On appeal, Lawson first argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the action as frivolous. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e) (2)(B) (i). <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). We also review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to sanction pursuant to its inherent power. <em>Barnes v. Dalton, </em>158 F.3d 1212, 1214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>(11th Cir.1998). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>263 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Section 3(a) of RLUIPA prohibits the government from imposing a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the religious exercise of a prisoner, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person \u201c(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1. \u201cAlthough RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is \u2018central\u2019 to a prisoner\u2019s religion, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ec-5(7)(A), the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner\u2019s professed religiosity.\u201d <em>Cutter v. Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 725 n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). Thus, \u201cprison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner\u2019s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) provides that the district court shall dismiss the case of a prisoner proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>if the action is frivolous or malicious. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A claim is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)). \u201cThe PLRA accords judges not only the authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Additionally, a district court may dismiss a complaint as a sanction pursuant to either Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) or its inherent authority to manage its docket. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). Dismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction. <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, regardless of the source of the court\u2019s authority, the district court must find both that the party against whom the sanction is imposed engaged in a \u201cclear pattern of delay or willful contempt\u201d and that a lesser sanction would not suffice. <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">On review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Lawson\u2019s action as frivolous. Although Lawson argues that the district court impermissibly resolved disputed issues of fact, the district court was permitted to \u201cpierce the veil\u201d of Lawson\u2019s factual allegations to determine the authenticity of his religious beliefs. Based on Lawson\u2019s canteen purchases and on the affidavits submitted by the DOC, the district court found that Lawson repeatedly ate non-Kosher food, never attended Jewish prayer services, and refused a work proscription for the Sabbath because the proscription would \u201cmess up his lawsuit.\u201d We will not disturb these findings, which contain ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Although Lawson energetically denied and attempted to rebut these conclusions, Lawson\u2019s protracted failure to observe the most basic aspects of his faith was highly probative, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the action as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Lawson next argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the action without affording him ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>quate notice and an opportunity to present evidence to rebut the DOC\u2019s motion for sanctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Due process requires that a party have adequate notice of the consequences of the conduct for which he has been sanctioned. <em>See Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 632, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). But not every order entered without notice and a preliminary adversary hearing will offend due process. Rather, to determine the adequacy of the notice and hearing, this court will consider in large part whether the record shows that the party was aware of the consequences of his own conduct. <em>Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., Inc., </em>775 F.2d 1440, 1452 (11th Cir.1985) (citing Link).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Here, Lawson filed a motion to strike, objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and a memorandum of law. He included several affidavits, grievances, and other documentation for the district court\u2019s consideration. In granting the motion to dismiss, the district court expressly considered and rejected Lawson\u2019s argument and evidence. As the district court noted, during five years of litigation, Lawson \u201chas had an opportunity to respond to every allegation and motion, and has responded, often and at length. His responses included extensive factual recitation and legal citations.\u201d In sum, Lawson received adequate notice and opportunity to present evidence before the district court dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\">. Lawson initially filed his complaint <em>pro se. </em>After eighteen months of litigation, Lawson retained counsel, who filed an amended complaint. Counsel later withdrew. Lawson proceeds <em>pro se </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\">. He also requested an emergency preliminary injunction requiring the DOC to provide Kosher meals and to exempt him from the grooming code. The district court denied the preliminary injunction and Lawson does not appeal from that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\">. At the time of the magistrate judge's recommendation, Lawson had not filed a response to the motion for sanctions. Lawson had timely tendered his response to the prison mail system, but his objections were not docketed in the district court until after the magistrate judge\u2019s report. In any event, the district court considered Lawson's response and the evidence before adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">. Although Lawson objects that he was entitled to notice under Rule 11, the DOC moved for sanctions and dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), not under Rule 11. Additionally, although Lawson objects that the dis-positive motions deadline had expired and that the motion for sanctions was the functional equivalent of a motion for summary judgment, the DOC moved for sanctions not for summary judgment, and the district court expressly found that no party was prejudiced by the delay in the revelation of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
