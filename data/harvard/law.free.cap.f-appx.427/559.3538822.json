We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment against Marrero on his \u00a7 1983 claims. Marrero\u2019s equal protection claims fail because he did not tender any evidence of disparate treatment in adoptive and foster care proceedings. As the district court noted, Clark County approved his adoption request. Foster children were placed in his care and not removed. His foster parent license was never revoked. On appeal, Marrero neither challenges these facts nor states how he has suffered an equal protection violation cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Marrero\u2019s due process claims. Marrero has neither alleged nor established that he was deprived of \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Because Marrero did not tender triable issues of material fact as to whether the governmental defendants violated his constitutional or statutory rights, the district court properly granted summary judgment on his \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Marrero\u2019s claims under the Multiethnic Placement Act, which prohibits the consideration of the race of the prospective adoptive or foster parent or the race of the child in making placement decisions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1996b(1). Marrero cites no record evidence establishing a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendants delayed or denied his adoption request on account of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The district court also properly dismissed Marrero\u2019s claims against Jones. Marrero\u2019s complaint alleged only that Jones made racist remarks. Even assuming the truth of the allegation, his \u00a7 1983 claim fails because \u201c[vjerbal harassment or abuse ... is not sufficient to state a constitutional deprivation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oltarzewski v. Ruggiero, </em>830 F.2d 136, 139 (9th Cir.1987) (alteration in the original) (quoting <em>Collins v. Cundy, </em>603 F.2d 825, 827 (10th Cir.1979)) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">His \u00a7 1981 claim fails because Marrero\u2019s complaint does not allege \u201cintentional discrimination on account of race.\u201d <em>Evans v. McKay, </em>869 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir.1989). The only discrimination Marrero alleges regards adoptive and foster care placements, and under Nevada law Jones, as a state employee, had no authority to influence such placements. Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 432B.030 (delegating responsibilities for adoptive and foster care placements to county authorities in counties, such as Clark County, with populations in excess of 100,000). Marrero\u2019s MEPA claims against Jones fail for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">For these reasons, we conclude that the district court properly entered judgment against Marrero. Given our decision, we need not \u2014 and do not \u2014 reach any other issue argued by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b585-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
