R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-10\"><em> </em>The Honorable Gordon J. Quist, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court <em>for </em>Western Michigan, Grand Rapids, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b614-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Defendant, Vincent Edward Cantu, appeals the 162-month sentence he received after pleading guilty to two counts of armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and one count of brandishing a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">First, Defense counsel\u2019s vague objection that the prosecutor\u2019s reference at sentencing to Defendant\u2019s having robbed other banks as not \u201cappropriate\u201d was insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Cannel, </em>517 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2008). In addition, under the proffer agreement, the Government was free to use Defendant\u2019s proffer statements to refute his lawyer\u2019s sentencing brief that Defendant \u201chad no prior history of robberies or gun-related crimes.\u201d Furthermore, Cantu cannot establish prejudice. <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010). There is no indication that the district court even considered the other robberies in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Second, Defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court properly considered the Defendant\u2019s former occupation as a police officer both as a mitigating and as an aggravating factor. <em>See United States v. Autery, </em>555 F.3d 864, 874 (9th Cir.2009). The district court also properly explained its reasons for imposing the sentence it did and articulated that reasoning to a sufficient degree to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 516-517 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Third, Defendant was punished only <em>once </em>for brandishing a firearm with respect to each robbery \u2014 via a sentencing enhancement as to the first and via \u00a7 924(c) as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Finally, Defendant makes no affirmative allegation that he did not read the PSR; therefore he cannot show prejudice and any Rule 32(i)(l)(A) error is harmless. <em>See e.g., United States v. Soltero, </em>510 F.3d 858, 863-64 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Davilar-Escovedo, </em>36 F.3d 840, 844 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b614-26\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>cation and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
