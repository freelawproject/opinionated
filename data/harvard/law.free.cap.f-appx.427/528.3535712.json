He argues that the district court violated his right to due process by relying on an allegedly inaccurate assessment of the severity of his prior sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">In 2002 Nichols pleaded guilty to bank robbery. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range \u2014 33 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release \u2014 and ordered that the period of incarceration be served concurrent to a state prison sentence that Nichols received for committing six additional robberies. He was released from prison in 2007 and by 2008 had violated the terms of his supervised release: he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana use and committed two state felonies by falsely promising to provide home repairs to elderly homeowners. For the latter violations, an Illinois court sentenced Nichols to more than six years in prison for financially exploiting the elderly. <em>See </em>720 ILCS 5/16\u20141.3(a). While Nichols was in state custody, his federal probation officer petitioned to revoke his supervised release. When Nichols completed his state prison terms in 2010 (he served less than three years in state custody), state officials turned him over to federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">At the revocation hearing Nichols conceded that the guidelines imprisonment range was 6 to 12 months based on the severity of his supervised-release violations (Grade B) and his original criminal-history category (II). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Nichols nonetheless urged the district court to impose a term of reimprisonment of two months, emphasizing, among other things, that he had already served significant time in prison on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>exploitation offenses, was subject to state parole, and was denied the opportunity to have his federal reimprisonment run concurrent to his state sentences. He also contended that there was little information in the record about his state felonies besides the ages of the victims and the amounts he stole from them. For its part, the government recommended a 12-month term of reimprisonment, stressing the seriousness of Nichols\u2019s conduct and remarking that his original sentence seemed \u201cnot very long\u201d for a bank robbery (though the prosecutor acknowledged that Nichols\u2019s limited criminal history at the time was \u201cone of the primary reasons for that\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The district court revoked Nichols\u2019s supervised release and imposed a 12-month prison term. The court commented that Nichols had \u201cnot been dealt with harshly at all\u201d in the past because his prior sentences \u201cproved to be a very lenient treatment.\u201d The court continued: \u201cYou got out with a lot less time than most defendants would have. Everything has seemed to fall into place for you. And it\u2019s amazing how you pigeonhole each one of these things and you came out smelling like roses.\u201d Nichols \u201chad a pretty good darn deal so far\u201d and had \u201clucked out,\u201d \u25a0 the court added. Although he hadn\u2019t physically hurt anyone, the court noted, Nichols had quickly returned to his old ways after his release from prison by taking his elderly victims \u201cto the cleaners.\u201d Finally, the court warned Nichols that further crimes might land him in jail for \u201cone heck of a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Nichols now argues that the district court committed reversible error in relying on what he describes as inaccurate \u201cfactual findings\u201d about the severity of his past sentences. He does not contest the reasonableness of his term of reimprisonment, but instead insists that there is no reliable information in the record to support the court\u2019s opinion that he had received leniency-</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Nichols\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. Although he characterizes the district court\u2019s comments on the severity of his past sentences as factual findings, they are better understood \u2014 as the government suggests \u2014 as the court\u2019s subjective assessment that his prior sentences were too lenient to deter him from further crime. District courts have discretion to draw this type of assessment, as long as it is based on reliable evidence, not speculation. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>628 F.3d 394, 399-400 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. England, </em>555 F.3d 616, 622 (7th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 346, 178 L.Ed.2d 147 (2010). The court here had no need for speculation; Nichols\u2019s history is uncontested. He received a federal prison sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range for his bank robbery, served that sentence concurrently with a state prison term for multiple other robberies, committed two state felonies (and used illegal drugs) little more than a year after being released on supervised release, and served less than three years in state custody on those felonies. The court, therefore, in no way overstepped its bounds in concluding that Nichols had received leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
