The district court sentenced Castillo to thirty years for each of the production convictions and ten years for the possession conviction, to run con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>secutively, for a total sentence of 1,560 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Castillo argues on appeal that the district court plainly erred when it failed to inform him, at the plea colloquy, that the statutory maximum sentences for each count could run consecutively. Assuming there was an error, it is not \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that the district court\u2019s alleged error in failing to inform the defendant that his sentences must run consecutively is an error that is neither \u201cobvious\u201d nor \u201cclear under current law\u201d). In <em>Humphrey, </em>we expressly rejected the argument raised by Castillo \u2014 that <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>102 F.3d 477, 482 (11th Cir.1996) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 require an instruction on consecutively sentenced counts. <em>Id. </em>Since <em>Humphrey, </em>neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has held as much. Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error during the plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Castillo next argues that his 1,560-month sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. The sentence fell within the applicable guideline range of life imprisonment, and we ordinarily expect guideline sentences to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We find that Castillo\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The record shows that the district court correctly calculated the guideline range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and considered Castillo\u2019s mitigation arguments. In the end, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a sentence of 1,560 months was necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 Castillo pleaded guilty to engaging in sexually explicit conduct with a three-year-old girl, on multiple occasions, and filming it. His sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
