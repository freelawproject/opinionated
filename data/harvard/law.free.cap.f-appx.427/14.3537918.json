R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing and the \u201cmotion for petition to the Supreme Court,\u201d it is</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">ORDERED that the \u201cmotion for petition to the Supreme Court\u201d be denied. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed December 7, 2010, be affirmed. The district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The district courts of the United States are \u201ccourts of limited jurisdiction ... possessing] only that power authorized by Constitution and statute....\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (internal citations omitted). The district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions presenting a \u201cfederal question\u201d under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district courts also have jurisdiction in \u201cdiversity\u201d cases, when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the lawsuit is between citizens of different U.S. states or between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens or foreign states. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In this case, the appellant failed to establish the district court had either federal question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">Pursuant to D.C.

The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed.
