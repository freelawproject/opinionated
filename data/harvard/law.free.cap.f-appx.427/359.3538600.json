O\u2019Connor owns the land surrounding Melon Lake and either O\u2019Connor or the State of Texas owns the land underlying Melon Lake.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On four occasions between 2006 and 2008, Smith went to the location where he believes the ship is located. On his first trip, Smith used a boat to navigate into Melon Lake from waterways connected to the lake and then walked through shallow water along the perimeter of the lake to the location where he believes the ship is buried. On his second trip, Smith walked along the edge of the lake from a nearby public highway, and on his final trip, he traveled in an airboat through waterways connected to Lake Melon up to the location of the ship. On one of those trips, Smith took away a piece of wood that he found at the location, which he believed came from the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In 2007, Smith brought an <em>in rem </em>declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of Texas seeking title to the vessel. <em>See Smith v. Abandoned Vessel, </em>610 F.Supp.2d 739 (S.D.Tex.2009). O\u2019Connor intervened in that suit. <em>See id. </em>at 743 &amp; n. 4. The court found that Smith had not established any right to the vessel under the law of finds or the law of salvage and dismissed his suit. <em>Id. </em>at 756, 758, 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">While that case was pending, Smith proceeded with his goal to excavate the vessel. In April 2008, he applied to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cthe Army Corps\u201d) for a permit authorizing him to excavate the vessel. In June 2008, the Army Corps sent Smith a letter stating that in order for him to be eligible for an excavation permit, he needed to conduct a field survey, and that \u201c[pjrior to the field survey, a scope of work must be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ... and the Texas Historical Commission ... for approval.\u201d In February 2009, the Army Corps sent Smith another letter indicating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">[N]o scope of work for this survey or a draft report of field investigations has been submitted to our archaeologist for review. In addition, it does not appear that you possess the required property interest in order to access the property and have a survey performed. Corps regulations [33 C.F.R. \u00a7 325.1(d)(8) ] require that the \u2018applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application.\u2019 Without the required information and permission from the property owner, we are unable to evaluate your proposed project. Therefore, your application ... is withdrawn. This withdrawal is without prejudice to your right to reapply at a later date when you can provide the required information concerning the proposed work plan and cultural resource investigation, and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>established the requisite property interest to access the property and to perform the proposed work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In January 2010, Smith re-submitted his application to the Army Corps, and in February 2010, the Army Corps approved Smith\u2019s application to excavate the ship. The approval letter included a \u201cremind[er] of the following\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">A Department of the Army (DA) permit, including this [Nationwide Permit], does not convey any property rights, either in real estate or material, or any exclusive privileges. Furthermore, a DA permit does not authorize any injury to property or invasion of rights or any infringement of Federal, state, or local laws or regulations. The applicant\u2019s signature on an application is an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application [33 C.F.R. \u00a7 320.4(g)(6) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The approval letter also included three sheets reflecting Smith\u2019s plan. The third sheet, labeled \u201cProject Area Google Aerial Map,\u201d shows the southern portion of Melon Lake and a diamond-shaped area for Smith\u2019s planned work site, which includes part of Melon Lake and part of the land adjacent to the lake. The map includes notations for boring at eight separate locations in the land adjacent to Melon Lake as well as notations showing a path from the public highway to the work site, with markers on the land adjacent to the lake and a note that reads, \u201cwill walk along lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">On March 8, 2010, O\u2019Connor filed an application in state court for an injunction barring Smith from \u201ctrespassing on and damaging\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s property. The state court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Smith from entering O\u2019Connor\u2019s property. Smith subsequently removed the case to the Southern District of Texas, and on March 26, the district court entered a preliminary injunction barring Smith from boring holes in Melon Lake or entering O\u2019Connor\u2019s property to access the lake. On April 9, the district court granted a motion to intervene by the Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office (\u201cthe State\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and shortly thereafter, the State filed its intervenor complaint, seeking an injunction barring Smith \u201cfrom excavating, probing, or digging into the soil of land ... underlying the waters of Melon Lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">On June 29, 2010, O\u2019Connor filed a motion for summary judgment, and on July 16, the State filed its motion for summary judgment. O\u2019Connor and the State both asserted that they were entitled to a permanent injunction because Smith\u2019s January 2010 application with the Army Corps demonstrated that Smith intended to enter and bore holes on the land adjacent to and underlying Melon Lake; the undisputed evidence showed that O\u2019Connor owned the land surrounding Melon Lake and that either O\u2019Connor or the State owned the land underlying Melon Lake; and there was no dispute of material fact that by entering onto and boring holes in the land adjacent to and underlying Melon Lake, Smith would be trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Smith filed a motion under what was then Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>trict court deny the plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motions <em>or </em>grant a continuance to allow Smith time to conduct discovery. Smith contended that \u201c[discovery [was] necessary to determine the ownership of the land beneath Melon Lake.\u201d Smith also responded to the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, asserting that there was a genuine dispute of material fact regarding who owned the land underlying Melon Lake and that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that they were entitled to a permanent injunction as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and issued a permanent injunction against Smith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The coui't concluded that the plaintiffs had met their burden to show the absence of a genuine dispute of any material fact and that they were entitled to a permanent injunction as a matter of law: By entering and drilling holes in the land adjacent to or underlying Melon Lake, Smith would be trespassing, and therefore, the plaintiffs had shown actual success on the merits, and a substantial threat of an irreparable injury. The court also determined that the threatened injury outweighed any damage the injunction might cause Smith, and the injunction would not disserve the public interest. The court denied Smith\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion because it failed to show that any additional discovery would create a genuine dispute of material fact. Smith timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Smith contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs. \u201cA grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard on appeal that is applied by the district court.\u201d <em>Coliseum Square Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>465 F.3d 215, 244 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201c[S]ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine,\u2019 that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cAs to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201c[fjactual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn a diversity case such as this one, we apply state substantive law,\u201d here Texas law. <em>Moore v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>556 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Smith first contends that the district court misapplied the summary judgment standard by expressing skepticism over Smith\u2019s claims about the existence of the vessel, when it should have viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith as the non-moving party; and that it erred by \u201cfind[ing]\u201d that Smith had no right to excavate the vessel, which \u201cwas not the issue before the court.\u201d Smith\u2019s Br. at 16-17. However, Smith has not presented any argument as to why these \u201cerrors\u201d demonstrate that summary judgment for the plaintiffs was improper. Therefore, we consider these issues waived. <em>See, e.g., Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>376 F.3d 496, 499 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cFailure adequately to brief an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Smith\u2019s principal argument is that summary judgment was improper because the plaintiffs failed to establish the elements required for obtaining a permanent injunction and therefore, were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201cThe party seeking a permanent injunction must meet a four-part test. It must establish (1) success on the merits; (2) that a failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury; (3) that said injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\u201d <em>VRC LLC v. City of Dallas, </em>460 F.3d 607, 611 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Dresser-Rand Co. v. Virtual Automation Inc., </em>361 F.3d 831 (5th Cir.2004)). We \u201creview! ] the district court\u2019s grant ... of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>N. Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, Tex., </em>90 F.3d 910, 916\u201417 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Peaches Entm\u2019t Corp. v. Entm\u2019t Repertoire Assoc., </em>62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir.1995)). We conclude that the plaintiffs met the four-part test for a permanent injunction and the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">1. The undisputed summary judgment evidence shows that the plaintiffs established success on the merits of their substantive claim of trespass. Under Texas law, \u201c \u2018fejvery unauthorized entry upon land of another is a trespass even if no damage is done or the injury is slight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marcus Cable Assocs., L.P. v. Krohn, </em>90 S.W.3d 697, 703 (Tex.2002) (quoting <em>McDaniel Bros. v. Wilson, </em>70 S.W.2d 618, 621 (Tex.Civ.App.1934)). The plaintiffs introduced uncontroverted summary judgment evidence that O\u2019Connor owns the tracts of land on which Melon Lake is located, that O\u2019Connor or the State of Texas owns the land underlying Melon Lake, and that neither O\u2019Connor nor the State consented to Smith\u2019s entry onto their land. Therefore, the summary judgment evidence shows that Smith\u2019s entry onto the land surrounding and underlying Melon Lake is trespass because it is the \u201cunauthorized entry upon the land of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Smith contends that the plaintiffs failed to establish trespass because they did not establish whether O\u2019Connor or the State owns the land underlying Melon Lake. Smith asserts that \u201c[t]o prove trespass, the plaintiff must prove \u2018he owns or has a lawful right to possess real property.\u2019\u201d Smith\u2019s Br. 18 (quoting <em>Wilen v. Falkenstein, </em>191 S.W.3d 791, 798 (Tex.App.2006)). However, Smith relies on a narrow quote from <em>Wilen </em>and the remainder of the sentence from which Smith quotes belies its support for his position: <em>\u201cTo recover damages </em>for trespass to real property, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the plaintiff owns or has a lawful right to possess real property. ...\u201d <em>Wilen, </em>191 S.W.3d at 798 (emphasis added). The plaintiffs here are not seeking damages from past trespass, but an injunction to prevent further trespass. Under Texas law, \u201c[a] person who, without right, has entered on premises that are in the possession of another may not defend an action for trespass by showing that the plaintiff did not have title to the property or that the title asserted by the plaintiff was defective.\u201d 70 Tex. Jur.3d Trespass to Realty \u00a7 14 (2011) (internal footnote omitted) (citing <em>Forst v. Rothe, </em>66 S.W. 575 (Tex.Civ.App.1902) (holding that defendants were liable to plaintiffs for trespass when they entered land in plaintiffs\u2019 possession, despite defendant\u2019s contention that the land was state land: \u201cit was no justification that the land was state land, and, if it were, ... [it] does not matter in this action, so long as defendants exhibited no title\u201d)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Smith does not purport to have title to the land surrounding or underlying Melon Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Smith next argues that if the State of Texas owns the land underlying Melon Lake, there is a genuine dispute about whether the State consented to his entry. We disagree. A \u201cdispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine,\u2019 \u201d only \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. In opposing summary judgment on the grounds that there is a genuine dispute about whether the State consented to his entry onto the land underlying Melon Lake, Smith relies on the February 2011 Army Corps permit, which Smith claims was issued \u201cwith the apparent concurrence of the Texas Historical Commission\u201d (THC), and correspondence related to the permit. Smith Br. 21. However, the Army Corps specifically informed Smith by letter during the permitting process that \u201cit does not appear that you possess the required property interest in order to access the property and have a survey performed,\u201d and the Army Corps permit clearly stated that it \u201cd[id] not convey any property rights\u201d and was issued based on Smith\u2019s \u201caffirmation that [he] possessed] or will possess the requisite property interest\u201d to excavate the ship. Accordingly, evidence that the Army Corps consulted with THC officials during the Army Corps\u2019 permitting process, does not create a \u201cgenuine\u201d dispute that the State of Texas consented to Smith\u2019s entry on its land. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">2. The plaintiffs established that the failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury for which no adequate remedy at law exists. <em>See Dresser-Rand Co. v. Virtual Automation Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>361 F.3d 831, 847-48 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cIt is the established law in [Texas] that if one is in possession of certain premises, and thereby capable of using and enjoying them, and another wrongfully attempts to invade this possession or to destroy the use and enjoyment of such premises, he may resort to a court of equity and secure an injunction restraining the wrongdoer, for there is available to him no plain and adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>S. Pine Lumber Co. v. Smith, </em>183 S.W.2d 471, 472 (Tex.Civ.App.1944) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Smith does not dispute that he intends to enter and bore holes on land belonging to O\u2019Connor and/or the State of Texas. <em>See </em>Smith Br. 22. Smith failed to show a genuine dispute of material fact that entering the plaintiffs\u2019 land and boring holes in it will not constitute irreparable injury for which a remedy at law is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">3. The plaintiffs established that their injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause Smith. As just explained, the plaintiffs established that Smith\u2019s entry onto and boring holes in the land surrounding and underlying Melon Lake will cause them injury. Smith argues that the injunction will cause him damage because he \u201chas obtained and is seeking investors for the purpose of salvaging the abandoned vessel.\u201d Smith Br. 23. However, in support of his argument, Smith relies only on his lawyer\u2019s assertions before the district court during the hearing on the temporary restraining order: \u201c[Smith] is seeking investors at this point in time,\u201d and \u201cI talked to a number of people in California who want to invest in this project.\u201d These unsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)(1)(A); <em>see also Leggieri v. Mealo, </em>484 F.Supp. 719, 721 (E.D.Pa.1980) (\u201c[T]he assertion by an attorney ... \u2018that he has discovered witnesses who can and will testify,\u2019 is not itself evidence, nor may it substitute for the presentation of evidence, cognizable by the court in considering a motion for summary judgment.\u201d). Therefore, Smith failed to show a genuine dispute of material fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 injury outweighed any damage that the injunction would cause him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">4. The plaintiffs established that the injunction will not disserve the public interest. Clearly, it is not against the public interest to prevent further trespass in contravention of the state\u2019s laws. Smith\u2019s argument that there is a countervailing public interest in salvaging abandoned ships misses the mark. The earlier declaratory judgment action determined that Smith has no right to the abandoned ship, <em>see Smith, </em>610 F.Supp.2d 739, and Smith fails to show that any public interest in ensuring that abandoned vessels are salvaged overrides firmly-established trespass laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Accordingly, Smith has failed to show that the district court erred in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment. There was no genuine dispute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>any material fact, and the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because they established the necessary elements for a permanent injunction. It was within the district court\u2019s sound discretion to grant a permanent injunction, <em>see N. Alamo Water Supply Corp., </em>90 F.2d at 916-17, and it was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to grant the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">II. Denial of Smith\u2019s Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Smith next attacks the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 56(f) motion to postpone ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment in order to allow Smith to conduct discovery. \u201cWe review the denial of a Rule 56(f) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., </em>170 F.3d 518, 534 (5th Cir.1999). \u201c[T]o justify a continuance, the Rule 56(f) motion must demonstrate 1) why the movant needs additional discovery and 2) how the additional discovery will likely create a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534-35 (citing <em>Krim v. Banc-Texas Group, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 1435, 1442 (5th Cir.1993)). Smith presented one reason in his verified Rule 56(f) motion: that there was a genuine dispute over who owned the land underlying Melon Lake and further discovery was necessary to establish this fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As discussed above, whether O\u2019Connor or the State of Texas owns the land underlying Melon Lake is not a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact because it does not affect the outcome of this litigation. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">CONCLUSION .</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Smith makes a similar argument that summary judgment was improper because there was a genuine dispute about who owned the land underlying Melon Lake. However, whether O\u2019Connor or the State of Texas owns the land underlying Melon Lake does not affeet the outcome of this suit and therefore, it is not a \"material fact.\u201d <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (\"Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. <em>See also </em>70 Tex.

Smith argued in his response to the plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment that further discovery was necessary to determine if the State impliedly consented to his entry onto the land underlying Melon Lake by virtue of the THC's communications with the Army Corps during the permitting process. \"On appeal, we will not consider justifications for granting a continuance that were not presented with the original [Rule 56(f) ] motion.\" <em>Stearns Airport Equip.
