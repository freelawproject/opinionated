R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The district court did not address Gill\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">1. The district court erred in granting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c), the district court had jurisdiction to review the denial of Gill\u2019s application for naturalization. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>States v. Hovsepian, </em>359 F.3d 1144, 1162 (9th Cir.2004). Although the district court\u2019s review is limited to review of the specific basis of the denial of naturalization, <em>see De Lara Bellajaro v. Schiltgen, </em>378 F.3d 1042, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2004), as amended, it was error for the district court to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction entirely. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><em>2. </em>The district court dismissed the remainder of Gill\u2019s claims pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), without specifically resolving Gill\u2019s claim concerning the constitutionality of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.24. In failing to address this argument, the district court erred. The district court had jurisdiction over this issue, because the BIA is without authority to determine the constitutionality of regulations. <em>See Gete v. I.N.S., </em>121 F.3d 1285, 1291 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-24\">. The parties agreed that Gill's asylum claim is not before us at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">. Our recent decision in <em>Cabaccang v. USCIS, </em>627 F.3d 1313 (9th Cir.2010) does not compel a different result. As the panel in <em>Cabaccang </em>recognized, there is no statute authorizing judicial review of the denial of an adjustment of status, <em>see id. </em>at 1316-17. In contrast, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c) expressly provides for judicial review of the denial of a naturalization application. <em>See De Lara Bellajaro, </em>378 F.3d at 1046.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
