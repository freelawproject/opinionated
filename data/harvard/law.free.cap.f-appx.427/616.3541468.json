Peralta has failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title YII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (\u201c\u00a7 1981\u201d), and the Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d), because he has \u201cpresented no facts to indicate that others outside of his protected class were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Foss v. Thompson, </em>242 F.3d 1131, 1134 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">2. Peralta has failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation under the same statutes because his complaint to Senior Operating Manager George Louie about Britt\u2019s \u201cunprofessional\u201d conduct was not a protected activity \u2014 it did not protest an unlawful employment practice. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (defining \u201cunlawful employment practice\u201d as discriminating against an employee or taking action adversely affecting an employee\u2019s status \u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">3. Peralta\u2019s harassment claim under the FEHA fails because he has not provided evidence that the complained-about conduct by his supervisor was \u201con the basis of [his] race or national origin.\u201d <em>Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc., </em>21 Cal.4th 121, 129, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">4. Peralta\u2019s discrimination claim under article I, section 8 of California\u2019s constitution fails because he was not \u201cterminated, constructively discharged, or threatened with termination.\u201d <em>Strother v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., </em>79 F.3d 859, 872 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">5. The district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Peralta\u2019s objections to four of the documents attached to appellees\u2019 lawyer\u2019s affidavit in support of their motion for summary judgment because there is \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d <em>Orr v.
