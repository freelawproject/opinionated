Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Howard v. Winter, </em>446 F.3d 559, 565 (4th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">To establish his discrimination claim, Grange was first required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the burden-shifting framework adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Thus, Grange was required to show that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he applied and was qualified for a job for which Southeastern Mechanical was seeking applicants; (3) despite his qualification, he was rejected; and (4) after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We hold that Grange failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and, therefore, we need not proceed under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. Grange could not show that he was qualified and rejected despite his qualifications. In fact, the evidence showed that Southeastern Mechanical Services did not hire Grange as a welder because he failed his preemployment welding test.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Consequently, we deny Grange\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
