We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-28\">Turner contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the district court led him to believe erroneously that he could appeal the court\u2019s rulings on pre-plea motions. This contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-29\">Turner further contends that the district court procedurally erred at sentencing by failing to appreciate the significance of abuse he suffered while in prison and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>failing to address his susceptibility to future abuse. The record reflects that the district court did not procedurally err. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Finally, contrary to Turner\u2019s contention, the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
