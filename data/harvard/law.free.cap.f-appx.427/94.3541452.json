The BIA affirmed an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision, after a hearing in 2008, that Agust\u00edn was statutorily ineligible for relief under Section 203 of the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (\u201cNACARA\u201d). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2193-2201 (1997), <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644, 2644-45 (1997). The BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and discretionary cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">An application for special-rule cancellation of removal under NACARA is subject to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(13). <em>See </em>NACARA \u00a7 203(b), 111 Stat. 2160, 2198-99. However, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(13) does not prevent us from considering questions of law or constitutional claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Questions of law include \u201cnot only pure\u2019 issues of statutory interpretation, but also ... mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 856-57 (9th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir.2007) <em>(per </em>cudam)). Thus, we review Agustin\u2019s claims of legal and constitutional error for whether he has shown <em>pdma facie </em>eligibility for special-rule cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Where the BIA adopts the findings of the IJ and also comments on the sufficiency of the IJ\u2019s determinations, we review the decisions of the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Kaita v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>522 F.3d 288, 296 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>We grant the petition in regard to Agustin\u2019s NACARA claim, vacate, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Guatemalan nationals must meet three requirements to be <em>prima facie </em>eligible for relief under Section 203 of NACARA. An applicant must demonstrate that he or she (1) first entered the United States on or before October 1, 1990; (2) registered as an ABC class member<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on or before December 31, 1991; and (3) had not been apprehended at time of entry (or re-entry) after December 19, 1990. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(d)(2) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The IJ stated in his oral decision that \u201c[t]he real issue in this case was whether the respondent entered the United States on or before October 1, 1990.\u201d (IJ Op. at 3). Agustin\u2019s testimony, three corroborating affidavits, his 2007 interview with an asylum officer, and his NACARA and amended asylum applications, all state that he entered the United States in February 1990. Nevertheless, the IJ made a \u201cnegative credibility determination\u201d based on perceived inconsistencies regarding proof that Agust\u00edn entered the United States before October 1, 1990. (IJ Op. at 4). The IJ repeatedly stated, however, that Agust\u00edn would have been eligible for NA-CARA relief absent the credibility determination on \u201cthe [entry date] prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 (\u201cI do want to note that if the respondent is successful in an appeal on this issue I would have found him eligible under NACARA in terms of the merits.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The IJ\u2019s determination, as affirmed by the BIA, that Agust\u00edn did not make a <em>prima facie </em>case for cancellation of removal under NACARA has several problems. First, the IJ stated in his oral decision that \u201cthe economic opportunities in Guatemala ... are not as advantageous as here in the United States, which is why respondent would have left his country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Agust\u00edn left his country for \u201ceconomic opportunities\u201d as the IJ speculated, nor did the Government make such an argument at any time in these proceedings. We have held that, in administrative proceedings such as the one at issue here, an alien is entitled to due process. <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Sewak v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 667, 671 (3d Cir.1990)). \u201c[D]ue process requires ... (1) \u2018factfinding based on a record produced before the decisionmaker and disclosed to\u2019 him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549 (citing <em>Llanar-Castellon v. INS, </em>16 F.3d 1093, 1096 (10th Cir.1994)). Thus, it was legal error for the IJ to base a credibility determination, whether in whole or in part, on his own speculation rather than the record before him. <em>See, e.g., Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249 (3d Cir.2003) (an adverse credibility determination may not be \u201cbased on speculation or conjecture, rather than on evidence in the record\u201d) (internal citation omitted); <em>Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cwe will vacate\u201d an adverse credibility determination \u201cif it is based on flawed reasoning, such as speculation or conjecture, or an inappropriately stringent standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Second, it goes too far to conflate minor, non-dramatic inconsistencies with purposeful falsehoods. <em>Cf. Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 125 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that \u201can IJ may not rest an adverse credibility finding on non-dramatic putative contradictions or incongruities in an alien\u2019s narrative without first giving the applicant a chance to reconcile the testimony\u201d). The IJ stated that Agustin\u2019s \u201cown testimony is inconsistent today with the date given by his aunt, his uncle and his friend.\u201d (IJ Op. at 7). That characterization is at best an exaggeration of the record. For example, the IJ discredited the affidavit provided by Agustin\u2019s friend, Oscar Zepeda-Lueero, because of his description of whom Agust\u00edn lived with when he arrived in the United States. Agust\u00edn testified that he lived with his uncle Hermelindo upon arrival. According to the IJ, Zepeda-Lueero \u201csaid [Agust\u00edn] was living with a friend and did not say it was the uncle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Zepeda-Lucero\u2019s affidavit did correctly state that Agust\u00edn lived with \u201cHermelindo,\u201d although it described him as a friend rather than an uncle. Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) at 496. In an affidavit describing events that occurred more than 18 years earlier during a friend\u2019s life, this is the kind of \u201cnon-dramatic inconsistency\u201d that does not support an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">More important, the so-called \u201cinconsistent\u201d testimony and affidavits regarding the key issue of Agustin\u2019s date of entry encompass dates that span less than a two-week time period, all in early February 1990.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Perez Muniz v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>363 Fed.Appx. 973, 974 (3d Cir.2010) (accepting 1989 entry date of Guatemalan citizen even though his removal petition stated he entered the United States in 1991, after he amended his date of entry and he, his mother, and his sister testified that he entered in 1989). Other purported inconsistencies in the corroborating affidavits are similarly trivial or nonexistent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with the exception of the entry date provided in Agustin\u2019s 1994 asylum application discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Third, the IJ should not have factored the lack of a corroborating affidavit from Agustin\u2019s mother into his credibility determination. In so doing, the IJ erroneously conflated the lack of a specific piece of corroborating evidence, which relates to whether the evidence before the IJ is sufficient, with lack of credibility. We have made clear that insufficient evidence and a lack of credibility are not legally equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lent. <em>See, e.g., Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]t is clear that the BIA\u2019s own rule requires a credibility determination to be independent of an analysis of the sufficiency of an applicant\u2019s evidence.\u201d); <em>cf. Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 551 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cA failure of proof is <em>not </em>a proper ground per se for an adverse credibility determination.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Moreover, when the IJ questioned Agust\u00edn regarding why his mother was not at the hearing to testify, he explained that \u201cit was not asked of me.\u201d A.R. at 97.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, an affidavit from Agustin\u2019s mother would have been second-hand in nature regarding the critical issue of his entry date, as he consistently testified that his grandparents sent him to the U.S. from Guatemala and his uncle received him upon arrival in Los Angeles. The lack of an affidavit from Agustin\u2019s mother was not legally relevant to whether his testimony regarding his entry date was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Finally, the only inconsistent entry date, from Agustin\u2019s 1994 asylum application, should not have been given controlling weight merely because that application was signed \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d as the IJ repeatedly stressed. (IJ Op. at 6-7). Instead, it should have been given <em>diminished </em>weight for several reasons. Agust\u00edn was a minor when the application was filled out. As he testified before the IJ, a notary completed the application and Agust\u00edn had no legal guardian present. The notary filled out the form in English, which Agust\u00edn did not understand or read. Moreover, the notary did not read the form back to Agust\u00edn in Spanish. A.R. at 60-61. Agust\u00edn testified that he \u201chad no idea what was going on,\u201d that he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d the form, and that he was \u201cjust told to sign. I just signed it.\u201d A.R. at 77, 73. While the IJ stated that he would take Agustin\u2019s age into account, he does not appear to have taken notice that the law distinguishes between minors and adults in many ways, particularly in regard to their capacity to sign legal documents without parental supervision. <em>See, e.g., </em>3 <em>Pennsylvania Law Encyclopedia, Minors </em>\u00a7 3 (2007) (\u201cA minor\u2019s formal warrant of attorney is absolutely void, and cannot be ratified.\u201d); <em>Doe v. Banos, </em>713 F.Supp.2d 404, 410 (D.N.J.2010) (discussing \u201clegal difficulties surrounding a minor\u2019s entry into contractual relations\u201d); <em>Anspach v. City of Philadelphia, </em>630 F.Supp.2d 488, 489 (E.D.Pa.2008) (an unemancipated minor \u201cdoes not have the legal capacity to sign [forms regarding prescription medication]\u201d). Under these circumstances, the IJ gave undue weight to the fact that Agustin\u2019s 1994 asylum application was signed under penalty of perjury. <em>Cf. Gui Cun Liu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 529, 534 (3d Cir.2004) (reversing where an IJ did not explain why a \u201cpresumption\u201d that an adult would be \u201caware of the contents\u201d of an asylum form he signed was rebutted by other evidence).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>We conclude that there were multiple legal errors in the determination that Agust\u00edn did not establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for NACARA relief. If the proper legal standards had been followed, and, in turn, the proper evidence had been considered without speculation substituted for record evidence, an adverse credibility determination regarding Agustin\u2019s date of entry would not have been made. Noting the IJ\u2019s repeated statement that he would have found Agust\u00edn statutorily eligible for NACARA relief absent that determination, we grant the petition with regard to NA-CARA relief, vacate, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\">. Agust\u00edn submitted an asylum application to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\u201d) on September 24, 1994, when he was 17 years old. On June 12, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d) served him with a Notice to Appear, alleging his removability from the United States. He filed an amended asylum application on July 29, 2007. His NACARA petition was signed on September 24, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">. In a 1991 class-action settlement agreement, <em>American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, </em>760 F.Supp. 796 (N.D.Cal.1991) <em>(ABC), </em>the INS agreed not to deport Guatemalan and Salvadoran plaintiffs (\"ABC class members\u201d) and to provide new asylum interviews. NACARA streamlined the processing of many thousands of applications to the INS by ABC class members, who are eligible for special-rule cancellation of removal if they meet NACARA's statutory requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. The IJ later stated that \"if [Agust\u00edn] is able to overcome these credibility problems ... [,] I would have found that he would have been successful in his case for NACARA.\u201d (IJ Op. at 5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\">. The dates in Agustin\u2019s testimony and three corroborating affidavits range only from \"around February 2nd\u201d to February 10, 1990. Agustin\u2019s aunt and uncle both provided affidavits stating that Agust\u00edn entered the U.S. on February 10, 1990. A.R. at 493, 495. His friend Zepeda-Lucero\u2019s affidavit also gave an entry date of February 10, 1990. An asylum \"investigator here or whoever conducted the interview\u201d provided a hand-written entry date of February 15, 1990 in a May 2007 interview that the IJ stated he gave \"limited weight.\u201d (IJ Op. at 6). Agust\u00edn testified that he was \"not sure exactly\u201d what date he entered the U.S., although he thought it was \"around the 2nd of February\u201d of 1990. A.R. at 44. He stated several times that he knew he entered the U.S. before his 13th birthday, which was February 22, 1990. A.R. at 44-45, 70-72. His amended asylum application (signed in 2007) and his NACARA application also provide a February 1990 entry date. The only date outside this two-week period was in Agustin\u2019s 1994 asylum application that was prepared when he was a minor, without a guardian present, in a language he did not understand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">. Agustin's recounting of events during his childhood that led to his grandparents\u2019 decision to send him to the U.S. to escape the civil war was not internally inconsistent, although he described different aspects of the same series of events in his 1994 asylum application (that was filled out for hi m, in a language he did not speak, when he was a minor) and his amended 2007 application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\">.

In <em>Gui Cun Liu, </em>as here, the asylum form was filled out by a third-party preparer in English, which the applicant did not speak:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">The IJ relied heavily upon Mr. Liu's statement originally filed with his signed 1-589 form (and later retracted by him), in which it was claimed that he had been jailed and fined for failure to comply with the one-child policy. A.R. 71-72. The IJ noted that, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3, Mr. Liu\u2019s signature on the form gave rise to a presumption that he was aware of the contents of that application. But the IJ did not explain why this presumption had not been successfully rebutted by other evidence (most notably, the fact that the form is filled out in English, which Mr. Liu does not speak, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>without listing the name of a third-party preparer, as well as Mr. Liu\u2019s testimony regarding the explanation of the statement before the asylum officer: \"I said I didn\u2019t know what it is\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">372 F.3d at 534 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
