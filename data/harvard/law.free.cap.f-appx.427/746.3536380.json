Santiago-Morales was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for each of Counts 1 through 12, to run concurrently. For Count 13, the district court imposed a mandatory 24-month sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a), to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 34 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Santiago-Morales appeals his 10-month sentences for Counts 1 through 12, arguing that they are substantively unreasonable in light of the district court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory 24-month sentence for Count 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that he should have received a sentence of only 24 months total. However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(b)(3) expressly forbids a district court from compensating for the imposition of a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a) by reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence for a related felony conviction. Moreover, sentencing Santiago-Morales only to the mandatory 24-month term of imprisonment for Count 13 would have resulted in him receiving no sentence or punishment for Counts 1 through 12. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s imposition of 10-month sentences for Santiago-Morales\u2019s convictions on Counts 1 through 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Nor do we find reversible error in the district court\u2019s consideration of Santiago-Morales\u2019s history and characteristics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Santiago-Morales argues that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to his age, employment history and skills, lack of criminal record, and his impending deportation from the United States at the time of his release from prison. He argues that such circumstances warranted the imposition of a below-guidelines sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the district court considered Santiago-Morales\u2019s circumstances, and explicitly stated that they did not warrant a downward variance given the persistent and well-organized nature of the activities that gave rise to his convictions on Counts 1 through 12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Santiago-Morales disagrees with the weight given by the district court to his personal characteristics and background, we cannot say the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009) (\u201c[A] district court has \u2018considerable discretion\u2019 in deciding whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance and the extent of one that is appropriate.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Santiago-Morales\u2019s 10-month sentences, to run concurrently, for Counts 1 through 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. We review the reasonableness of a district court's sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">. Santiago-Morales\u2019s guidelines range for each of Counts 1 through 12 was 10-16 months, and thus Santiago-Morales was sentenced at the low end of his guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-16\">. Nor do we find reversible error in the district court\u2019s failure to specifically mention that it had considered Santiago-Morales\u2019s impending removal from the United States in its sentencing calculus, as the court is not required to discuss each statutory factor it considers in crafting a sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
