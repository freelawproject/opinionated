R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed February 25, 2011, and March 28, 2011, be affirmed. The district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s decision, which stated the District of Columbia\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act is not punitive, <em>see In re W.M., </em>851 A.2d 431, 434-35 (D.C.Cir.2004), and appellant does not have a liberty interest in convenience, <em>see Franklin v. District of Columbia, </em>163 F.3d 625, 631 (D.C.Cir.1999) (\u201cunless an individual is threatened with losing \u2018liberty\u2019 within the Fifth Amendment\u2019s meaning, it is of no constitutional moment whether the individual will receive \u2018due process of law\u2019 \u201d). The district court also properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and motion to recuse Judge Kollar-Kotelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
