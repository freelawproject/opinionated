According to undisputed portions of the presentence report, Huerta-Medina was driving his vehicle with his pregnant girlfriend and a young child as passengers, when law enforcement officers attempted to execute arrest warrants on him. Huerta-Medina then rammed his vehicle into a police car, drove off at high speed, struck a bystander\u2019s vehicle, drove into oncoming lanes of traffic, and ultimately collided with the victim-FBI agent\u2019s vehicle. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 70 months in prison. On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), seeking to withdraw and arguing that the District Court erred by (1) applying enhancements under both U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(6) and \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) and (2) applying an enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight based on the same conduct encompassed in the offense Guideline, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">We conclude that the District Court properly applied the Guidelines. See <em>United States v. Bates, </em>584 F.3d 1105, 1108 (8th Cir.2009) (standard of review). First, the Guidelines expressly required both a 2-level increase for Huerta-Medina\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>viction under section 111(b), see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(6), and an official-victim enhancement, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, comment. (n.4) (\u201cIf subsection (b)(6) applies, \u00a7 3A1.2 (Official Victim) also shall apply.\u201d). Second, we conclude that the reckless-endangerment enhancement was proper because Huerta-Medina endangered other motorists and his own passengers during the car chase and that conduct was not the same as his eventual assault of a federal officer. Cf. <em>United States v. Miner, </em>108 F.3d 967, 970 (8th Cir.1997) (approving Chapter Three adjustments both for official victim, based on defendant\u2019s ramming his car into police roadblock, and for reckless endangerment during flight, based on defendant\u2019s conduct during car chase that created risk of serious injury to other drivers and pedestrians), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 904, 118 S.Ct. 259, 139 L.Ed.2d 186 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Having independently reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw and we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-16\">.
