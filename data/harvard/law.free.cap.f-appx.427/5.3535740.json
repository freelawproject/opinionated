R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 340'). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-23\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-24\">In the order here under review, the Federal Labor Relations Authority properly upheld the arbitration award, concluding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Northwestern Division, did not violate either its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the United Power Trades Organization (Union) or the relevant provisions of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7102, 7114, 7131, when it refused to grant official time to a District Vice President of the Union to perform representational services. The FLRA reasoned there is no statutory entitlement to perform on official time the type of representational services here at issue, and we defer to the Authority\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the Statute. <em>See Am. Fed. of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA, </em>798 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>F.2d 1525, 1528 (D.C.Cir.1986) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). The FLRA also properly concluded the arbitration award did not fail to \u201cdraw its essence\u201d from the CBA because the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the CBA was plausible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7122(a)(2); <em>Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v. ICC, </em>920 F.2d 40, 45 (D.C.Cir.1990) (\u201carbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the [CBA] is entitled to extreme deference\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
