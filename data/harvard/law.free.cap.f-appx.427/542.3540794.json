Because the parties did not consent to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge, <em>cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (upon consent of parties, magistrate may conduct any or all proceedings in civil matter and order entry of judgment in the case); <em>Gleason v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>777 F.2d 1324, 1324 (8th Cir.1985) (magistrate\u2019s decision is final and directly appealable if issued under authority of \u00a7 636(c); \u00a7 636(c) requires clear and unambiguous statement in record of both parties\u2019 consent to magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction), Baccam is required to seek review of the order in the district court before this court has jurisdiction over an appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72 (party may within 10 days serve and file with district court written objections to nondispositive and dispositive matters decided by magistrate; if objection to nondispositive order is not timely made, party may not thereafter assign as error defect in magistrate\u2019s order); <em>LeGear v. Thalacker, </em>46 F.3d 36, 36-37 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (magistrate\u2019s decision issued absent consent requires initial review by district court; dismissing for lack of jurisdiction appeal of magistrate\u2019s denial of motion to reopen); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>350 F.3d 731, 733 (8th Cir.2003) (expressing \u201cconcerns\u201d that plaintiffs inaction in district court resulted in waiver of right to appeal magistrate\u2019s nondispositive order denying motion pursuant to Rule 72(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">.
