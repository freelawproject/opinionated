Believing that a man named Natividad Hernandez had murdered his brother, Romero-Calderon placed a telephone call from the United States to a radio station in Honduras identifying and denouncing Hernandez as the murderer. Romero-Calderon testified that acquaintances in Honduras informed him that Hernandez had threatened to kill him as a result. Romero-Calderon filed the instant application, asserting that he feared persecution by Hernandez and his associates if he were to return to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">In denying Romero-Calderon\u2019s application, the BIA found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Romero-Calderon failed to demonstrate the requisite nexus between his fear of persecution and a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). Substantial evidence supports that finding. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, the essence of Romero-Calderon\u2019s application is that Hernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>and his associates would kill him for exposing and denouncing Hernandez as his brother\u2019s murderer. Such personal retribution, however, is not a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Moreover, even assuming that Romero-Calderon was affiliated with his brother\u2019s farmers\u2019 rights organization (which could arguably constitute a protected ground), the record does not compel the conclusion that Hernandez or his associates sought to harm him on account of such affiliation. Accordingly, we deny Romero-Calderon\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-10\">. Romero-Calderon has abandoned on appeal his claim for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
