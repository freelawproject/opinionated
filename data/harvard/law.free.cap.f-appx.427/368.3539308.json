SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">Delfino Ramos pleaded guilty of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tion of controlled substances. He filed a motion to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was ineffective for allowing him to enter a guilty plea because (1) the conduct that he had admitted would not constitute money laundering in light of <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), and (2) his counsel should have anticipated the arguments made in <em>Santos </em>when advising Ramos to plead guilty. The district court denied all of Ramos\u2019s claims under \u00a7 2255 but issued a limited certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the ineffective-assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The federal money-laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, prohibits several activities involving criminal \u201cproceeds.\u201d In <em>Santos, </em>the Court considered whether \u201cproceeds\u201d in that statute means \u201creceipts\u201d or \u201cprofits.\u201d Justice Stevens stated in his controlling concurrence that the definition of \u201cproceeds\u201d depends on the underlying criminal activity and must be determined via a bifurcated analysis. <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 401 (5th Cir. 2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">First, a court must determine whether ... the defendant would face the \u201cmerger problem\u201d [which occurs when the statute criminalizing the underlying activity merges with the money-laundering statute]. If so, then ... the rule of lenity governs and \u201cproceeds\u201d must be defined as \u201cprofits\u201d; and the court need not proceed to the second step of Justice Stevens\u2019 analysis. However, if, instead, there is no \u201cmerger problem,\u201d Justice Stevens\u2019 analysis ... directs that a court must look to the legislative history of the money-laundering statute to determine how to define \u201cproceeds.\u201d A court does so with the default presumption that \u201cproceeds\u201d should be defined as \u201cgross receipts,\u201d unless the legislative history affirmatively supports interpreting \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Ramos argues that under <em>Santos, </em>the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for money laundering because the government did not prove that the charged financial transactions were conducted with the \u201cprofits\u201d rather than the \u201cgross receipts\u201d of the drug sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Ramos, however, has not shown that the merger problem would occur with regal\u2019d to drug trafficking, nor has he pointed to legislative history that supports interpreting \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits.\u201d The government therefore was not required to prove that the laundered money constituted \u201cprofits\u201d rather than \u201cgross receipts,\u201d so we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We decline to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>other issues Ramos raises in his brief, because they were not specified in the COA. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>588 F.3d 835, 836 n. 1 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. The government urges us to read <em>Santos </em>as holding that \"proceeds\u201d means \"profits\" only when the predicate offense is the operation of an illegal gambling business and thus that <em>Santos </em>is not applicable to other illegal activity, such as drug trafficking. In <em>Garland, </em>however, 615 F.3d at 403, we expressly rejected that interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\">. In <em>United States v. Huynh, </em>420 Fed.Appx. 309, 2011 WL 989825 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (unpublished), we reached the same conclusion but relied on what we believed to be the controlling opinion, Justice Stevens\u2019s concurrence, which stated that \u201d[a]s Justice Alito rightly argued, the legislative history of \u00a7 1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term 'proceeds' to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband.\" <em>Id. </em>at 319, 2011 WL 989825 at *7 (citing <em>Santos, </em>553 U.S. at 525-26, 128 S.Ct. 2020 (Stevens, J., concurring)). Although Justice Stevens's concurrence was controlling, <em>see Garland, </em>615 F.3d at 399, that statement was <em>dictum, </em>because the underlying criminal activity in <em>Santos </em>was an illegal lottery, not drug trafficking. Further, as the plurality opinion in <em>Santos </em>pointed out, 553 U.S. at 522 n. 8, 128 S.Ct. 2020, Justice Alito did not actually \"cite legislative history addressing the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>word \u2018proceeds\u2019 in cases specifically involving contraband.\u201d But because Ramos has not addressed the merger problem or relevant legislative history, and we operate under the presumption that \"proceeds\u201d means \"gross receipts,\u201d we decline to address whether the merger problem might arise in drug trafficking cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
