We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">Underwood pleaded guilty to drug and firearms offenses without the benefit of a plea agreement. His presentence investigation report provided a combined base offense level of 24. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1 (2009). The report stated that the Supreme Court had held in <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), that a district court may vary from the crack cocaine guidelines, but the report stated that a variance would not affect Underwood\u2019s sentence because he faced mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years for his drug crime, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), and of 5 years for possessing a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). The report also detailed Underwood\u2019s three prior convictions for selling and possessing illegal drugs and other criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">At his sentencing hearing, Undeiwood asked the district court to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines, but the district court rejected the request \u201cfor the reasons ... set[ ] forth\u201d in the presentence report. After the district court sentenced Underwood, he objected and argued that his sentence was unreasonable. The district court responded \u201cthat the minimum mandatory sentences [were] appropriate and fair\u201d based on Underwood\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">Undeiwood argues that he is \u201centitled\u201d to be sentenced according the Fair Sentencing Act, which was enacted while his appeal was pending, but this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1833, 179 L.Ed.2d 788 (2011). In <em>Gomes, </em>we held that the savings statute, \u201c1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109[,] bars the Act from affecting ... punishment\u201d for crimes committed before its enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 1346. Underwood also argues that his sentence to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment based on the 100 to 1 crack cocaine ratio violates his right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>tion, but we have held that this disparity is not unconstitutional, <em>United States v. King, </em>972 F.2d 1259, 1259-60 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Underwood\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
