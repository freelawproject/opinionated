On appeal the Defendants raise various challenges to them convictions on the conspiracy charges, and challenge their sentences. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM them convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In the mid-1980s Tipton formed Jackpot Charity Bingo (\u201cJackpot\u201d), a bingo gaming-facility in Waco, Kentucky. She owned and operated the business while her sister, Williams, worked for charities that held bingo sessions at Jackpot. In 1992, Tipton transferred ownership of Jackpot to her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">New efforts at regulating the Kentucky bingo industry took effect shortly thereafter, including a new state law requiring separation between bingo halls and the charitable organizations that hold bingo sessions at the bingo halls. <em>See </em>Ky.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 238.500. One provision required that immediate family members of the owners of bingo halls refrain from participation in any gaming activity. <em>See </em>Ky. Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 238.505(20); 238.555(3). The law also required that bingo halls maintain specific records and submit quarterly reports to the Office of Charitable Gaming (\u201cOCG\u201d), the administrative agency charged with overseeing charitable bingo operations. <em>See </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 238.550(7); 238.555(6); 238.510.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Though prohibited from involvement in charitable gaming activity due to her son\u2019s ownership of Jackpot, Tipton continued to participate in Jackpot operations. In February of 2000, the OCG began an investigation of Jackpot after receiving allegations that Tipton and members of her family, including Williams, were simultaneously operating both the bingo hall and the charities, engaging in \u201cunder the table\u201d gambling, and withholding profits from the charities for them own personal gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The investigation proceeded in three stages. First, a review of the bank records of charities holding bingo at Jackpot revealed that: Williams had signature authority for the charitable gaming bank accounts for charities holding bingo sessions at Jackpot; there was a commingling of funds between Jackpot and the charities; and Tipton and Williams had cashed checks drawn on Jackpot\u2019s account for personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Second, undercover surveillance of Jackpot operations in March of 2000 revealed that Williams and Tipton were engaged in the sale of gambling tickets known as \u201cpull-tab cards\u201d at Jackpot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite Kentucky Administrative Regulations requiring that pull-tab cards be purchased from state-licensed distributers in Kentucky, <em>see </em>820 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:032, OCG investigators found that Tipton enlisted her brother to travel to Ohio to purchase the illegal pull-tab cards. In addition, surveillance of Jackpot operations on one evening led OCG investigators to conclude that $2,439 in gaming funds were unaccounted for during that day\u2019s bingo session.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Third, OCG agents reviewed statements provided by various casinos detailing Tip-ton and Williams\u2019s wins and losses at their establishments, which revealed that the Defendants were wagering funds in excess of what the income as disclosed on their state tax returns would allow. The financial data concerning the Defendants\u2019 win/ loss records was based on the \u201cplayers club cards\u201d that Tipton and Williams inserted into slot machines as they wagered money at the casinos. The casinos reported that between 1998 and 2001, Tipton and Williams both lost thousands of dollars. Despite experiencing large financial losses at the casinos, Tipton and Williams reported little or no income from 1998 to 2001 on their state income tax returns. Tipton\u2019s tax returns reported only income of small amounts of interest and capital gains, and Williams\u2019s returns reported Social Security benefits and small amounts of interest and capital gains. Based on its findings, the OCG referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division in July of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The IRS then began its own investigation. IRS investigators started their inquiry by procuring the Defendants\u2019 federal tax returns. Next, a search of Tipton\u2019s curbside garbage was conducted, which uncovered: correspondence addressed to Jackpot; utility bills for Jackpot; pull-tab card sales records; correspondence addressed to a charity holding bingo sessions at Jackpot; and promotional material from various casinos. IRS investigators conducted video surveillance of Jackpot, and observed Tipton and Williams at Jackpot on eight out of the eleven nights that surveillance was conducted. Investigators also followed Tipton and Williams as they drove in separate vehicles to make a deposit at the bank where one of the charities maintained its gaming account.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On April 9, 2003, search warrants were executed at Tipton\u2019s and Williams\u2019s homes. When Tipton and Williams were interviewed, they acknowledged a penchant for gambling, but failed to report any type of employment or significant source of income. Tipton did not claim any alternative sources of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">An IRS investigator performed an investigative technique known as an \u201cexpenditure analysis\u201d in order to determine Tip-ton\u2019s and Williams\u2019s unreported taxable income and tax liability from 1998 through 2001. An expenditure analysis notes discrepancies between an individual\u2019s documented expenses and reported income. According to the investigator that testified at trial, \u201c[i]f [an individual] spend[s] more than [his or her] reported sources of income and [] non-taxable sources of income, then logically [there exists] another source [of income] that hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\u201d Based on this analysis, the IRS investigator concluded that Tipton had unreported income totaling $159,713.70 from 1998 through 2001, and owed $32,546 in unpaid taxes. The investigator also determined that Williams had $185,228.53 in unreported income during the same time period, and owed $48,856.75 in unpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On February 3, 2006, Tipton and Williams, as well as two other individuals, Cletis and Brenda Adams (\u201cthe Adams-es\u201d), were indicted for: (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; (2) tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and (3) mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The Adamses, who are not parties to this appeal, both pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion, and were sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment, and ordered to pay $61,663 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Tipton and Williams filed a joint motion to dismiss the conspiracy charges, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>that the alleged conspiracy should have been charged under the \u201coffense clause\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, with the substantive offense being tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The jury found Tipton and Williams guilty on all counts. The district court sentenced the Defendants to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the conspiracy and tax evasion counts and 68 months\u2019 imprisonment on the mail fraud counts, with the sentences to run concurrently. Tipton was ordered to pay $32,546 in restitution, and Williams was ordered to pay $48,865 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">A. Sufficiency of the Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Tipton and Williams first argue that the district court should have dismissed the indictment because they were improperly charged under the \u201cdefraud clause\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. We review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo. <em>United States v. Superior Growers Supply, Inc., </em>982 F.2d 173, 177 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The indictment charged the Defendants with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Section 371 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apq\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Section 371 prohibits two types of conspiracy: (1) conspiracy to commit a specific offense (\u201coffense clause conspiracy\u201d); and (2) conspiracy to defraud the United States (\u201cdefraud clause conspiracy\u201d). <em>United States v. Kraig, </em>99 F.3d 1361, 1366 (6th Cir.1996). The distinction is important because a conspiracy charged under the defraud clause does not require that the Government prove that \u201cthe conspirators were aware of the criminality of their objective.\u201d <em>United States v. Khalife, </em>106 F.3d 1300, 1303 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Collins, </em>78 F.3d 1021, 1038 (6th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">The Defendants were charged with defraud clause conspiracy, the indictment providing that the Defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV2\">unlawfully, willfully and knowingly conspire[d] and agree[d] together and with each other to defraud the United States for the purpose of impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful Government functions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the Treasury Department in the ascertainment, computation, assessment, and collection of revenue; to wit, income taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">In support of their contention that they should have been charged under the offense clause, the Defendants rely on <em>United States v. Minarik, </em>875 F.2d 1186 (6th Cir.1989), for the proposition that a defendant must be charged under the offense clause when a specific statute describes the entirety of the offense conduct alleged to have been involved in a conspiracy. The Defendants argue that they should have been charged under the offense clause because their only act alleged as violating \u00a7 371 was their individual under-reporting of personal income, as prohibited by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. In <em>Minarik, </em>this Court held that \u201cthe \u2018offense\u2019 and \u2018defraud\u2019 clauses as applied to the facts [in that] case are mutually exclusive,\u201d and that because the facts as alleged by the government only violated one specific statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(4), the defendants should have been prosecuted under the offense clause. <em>Minarik, </em>875 F.2d at 1187. Nonetheless, this Court has held that the hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ing of <em>Minarik </em>is confined to its facts. <em>See United States v. Sturman, </em>951 F.2d 1466, 1473-74 (6th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Mohney, </em>949 F.2d 899, 902-05 (6th Cir. 1991); <em>Kraig, </em>99 F.3d at 1367-68; <em>Khalife, </em>106 F.3d at 1305-06. In <em>Khalife, </em>this Court held that \u201cthe <em>Minarik </em>requirement of mutual exclusivity is dicta,\u201d that \u201cwe have subsequently confined <em>Minarik </em>to its facts,\u201d and that \u201cthe law in this circuit does not require ... that the conspiracy be charged only under the \u2018offense\u2019 clause of \u00a7 371.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><em>Minarik </em>is not controlling in this case. Minarik\u2019s holding that the defendants in that case should have been charged under the offense clause was based on three unique factual circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">First, [in Minarik;] there was a great deal of confusion resulting from the government\u2019s shifting theories of prosecution and failure to clearly define the intent element in the indictment. The one-count indictment in <em>Minarik </em>vaguely charged the defendants with conspiring \u201cto defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful functions of the Department of the Treasury.\u201d...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Second, the <em>Minarik </em>defendants\u2019 conduct consisted of one limited act of concealing the proceeds of a real estate transaction to prevent a levy upon the proceeds by the IRS. The breadth of the activity was not commensurate with the <em>Minarik </em>court\u2019s conception of a general conspiracy to defraud....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">Third, the <em>Minarik </em>defendants\u2019 duties were sufficiently technical to warrant more specific notice[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>Khalife, </em>106 F.3d at 1304 (citations omitted). In <em>Minarik, </em>those duties concerned the \u201ctechnical and difficult\u201d disclosure requirements regarding assets upon which an IRS levy may be authorized. <em>Minarik, </em>875 F.2d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The three factual circumstances found in <em>Minarik </em>are not present in this case. First, the indictment did not cause confusion as was the case in <em>Minarik </em>\u2014 where the Government \u201crepeatedly shifted its theory of the case\u201d and \u201cused the defraud clause in a way that created great confusion about the conduct claimed to be illegal.\u201d <em>United States v. Hurley, </em>957 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1992) (citation omitted). In the indictment and throughout trial, the Government never deviated from its theory that the Defendants\u2019 conspiracy consisted of obtaining and failing to disclose proceeds from Jackpot operations. Second, unlike the <em>Minarik </em>defendants\u2019 conduct, the conduct alleged of the Defendants was not an isolated act, but rather an elaborate operation lasting several years. The Defendants\u2019 tax returns from 1999 through 2001 reflected their disclosure of little to no income \u2014 in contradiction of their alleged earnings from Jackpot operations. And third, unlike the <em>Minarik </em>defendants\u2019 pre- and post-levy disclosure requirements at issue in <em>Minarik, </em>the duties of Tipton and Williams are neither difficult nor technical. As this Court remarked in <em>Mohney:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">Defendants clearly had a duty not to fail to file returns, not to file false returns, not to submit false statements and information, not to attempt to evade the assessment and payment of taxes, and not to generally conduct their business affairs in such a manner that the IRS would be impeded and impaired in its ascertainment, computation, assessment, and collection of revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\"><em>Mohney, </em>949 F.2d at 905. Because the unique circumstances found in Minarik do not apply here, we decline to depart from the general rule that the defraud and offense clauses are not mutually exclusive. <em>See Khalife, </em>106 F.3d at 1306. Accordingly, the Defendants were properly charged under the defraud clause of \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Defendants next argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for conspiracy to defraud the United States. Challenges to the sufficiency of evidence are also reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Seymour, </em>468 F.3d 378, 388 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraway, </em>411 F.3d 679, 682 (6th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). To prove conspiracy to defraud under \u00a7 371, the government must show \u201c(1) an agreement to accomplish an illegal objective against the United States; (2) one or more overt acts in furtherance of the illegal purpose; and (3) the intent to commit the substantive offense, i.e., to defraud the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>398 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Defendants argue that the Government failed to prove an agreement and the requisite intent to defraud the United States. With regard to the agreement, it \u201cneed not be explicit; rather, a \u2018tacit or mutual understanding among the parties will suffice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>492 F.3d 380, 395 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Ellzey, </em>874 F.2d 324, 328 (6th Cir.1989)). In interpreting the intent requirement of \u00a7 371, we have held that \u201c[t]he intent element of \u00a7 371 does not require the government to prove that the conspirators were aware of the criminality of them objective\u201d; rather, the Government must only \u201cshow that [the Defendants] knew of [them] liability for federal taxes.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>78 F.3d 1021, 1038 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Ingram v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 672, 678, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a rational juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the agreement and intent elements of conspiracy were proven. The indictment alleged that the Defendants obtained proceeds from Jackpot operations, which they, in turn, failed to disclose to the IRS. With regal\u2019d to the specific methods employed by the Defendants in obtaining and hiding their undisclosed income, the indictment alleged that the Defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">A. Purchas[ed] \u201cbootleg\u201d Bingo pull tabs from out-of-state vendors to avoid having those purchases reported to the OCG. These bootleg pull tabs were then sold along with reported pull tabs and the extra proceeds skimmed and not reported to the OCG.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">B. Pa[id] \u201chouse winners,\u201d [who] were inside affiliates of the defendants, to win rigged pull tabs and return the winnings to the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">C. [Sold] Bingo packets for amounts in excess of that reported to the OCG and pocket[ed] the excess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">D. Fail[ed] to deposit cash proceeds of Bingo games in the required bank account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">D. Deposited] personal checks of Bingo patrons, cashed at the Bingo Hall, into their personal accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The Government presented exhibits as well as lay and expert testimony to support these allegations. For instance, the Government presented the testimony of Joe Byrd, who testified that he accompanied Tipton\u2019s brother to Ohio on multiple occasions in order to purchase pull tab cards not registered by the state of Kentucky, and that Tipton purchased her brother a van for the purpose of making weekly trips to purchase pull-tab cards in Ohio. Nancy Jackson, an OCG investigator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>testified that during an evening while undercover surveillance was conducted, certain persons who had previously assisted in running bingo sessions at Jackpot were sitting together in front of the office door and were \u201cthe big winners of the night,\u201d and that on subsequent evenings, individuals sitting at this particular table constituted \u201ca large percentage of [the] winners.\u201d Leah Cooper, the Assistant Director of the Division of Licensing and Compliance for the OCG, testified as to various violations of Kentucky law by charities holding bingo sessions at Jackpot, including the use of pull-tab cards that were not purchased from licensed distributers, the failure to report their use, and the failure to deposit the proceeds from the deals into the charity\u2019s bank account. OCG investigators testified that bank records indicated Williams had signature authority on the bank accounts of charities holding bingo sessions at Jackpot, and that Williams wrote checks drawn on Jackpot\u2019s account to distributers of bingo supplies. Beverly Rogers, an OCG investigator, testified that while conducting undercover surveillance at Jackpot, she observed Williams \u201ccashing checks\u201d in the office. And an IRS investigator testified that both Tipton\u2019s and Williams\u2019s documented expenses far exceeded that which them income as disclosed on their federal tax returns would allow for.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The Defendants argue that the Government, at best, proved that \u201cthe Defendants independently under-reported their personal income on their individual tax returns,\u201d but not that \u201cthey were [even] aware of each other\u2019s alleged tax evasion.\u201d But an \u201cagreement[ ] may be inferred from circumstantial evidence concerning the relationship of the parties, their overt acts, and the totality of them conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Cueto, </em>151 F.3d 620, 635 (7th Cir.1998). Here, a jury could infer an agreement between the Defendants from the circumstantial evidence that the Defendants acted in concert while committing the allegations set forth in the indictment. And a jury could find that they were aware of their duty to report income to the IRS given that they filed signed tax returns for the years 1999 through 2001, which, according to the testimony of an IRS investigator, grossly understated them income. Contrary to the Defendants\u2019 assertion, a jury could infer that Tipton and Williams knew reached an agreement to defraud the United States based on their joint participation in efforts over a several year period to obtain and hide proceeds from Jackpot operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The Defendants next claim that the indictment was constructively amended such that it was possible that the jury convicted them of conspiracy to commit state bingo fraud, rather than conspiracy to defraud the United States. The Defendants further contend that a prosecution under \u00a7 371 requires \u201ca finding of intent and purpose to defraud the <em>IRS, </em>\u201d objecting that the jury instructions did not mention the IRS. The Defendants\u2019 arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\u201cA constructive amendment to the indictment occurs when \u2018the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of an offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Manning, </em>142 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Hathaway, </em>798 F.2d 902, 910 (6th Cir.1986)). A defendant bears the burden of proof on this issue. <em>United States v. Rashid, </em>274 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir.2001). \u201cA constructive amendment to the indictment consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>tutes a per se violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s grand jury clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Syme, </em>276 F.3d 131, 148 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The district court essentially followed the language set forth in Sixth Circuit Criminal Patteni Jury Instructions, Instruction 3.01A-Conspiracy to Commit an Offense-Basic Elements, in instructing the jury of the elements comprising conspiracy to defraud the United States. The district court was not required to admonish the jury that the Defendants intended to defraud the IRS specifically, because the district court correctly instructed the jury multiple times that the substantive offense was \u201cconspiracy to commit fraud against the United States.\u201d Of course, the IRS is an administrative subdivision of the United States. \u201c[T]he district court\u2019s instruction was a correct statement of the law and Defendant has not pointed to any authority suggesting otherwise.\u201d <em>United States v. Bucheit, </em>134 Fed.Appx. 842, 857 (6th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the district court committed no error in its instruction as to the charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">D. Exclusion of Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The Defendants raise two challenges to the district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations, including those involving expert testimony, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>Apponi v. Sunshine Biscuits, Inc., </em>809 F.2d 1210, 1218 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">First, the Defendants argue that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of Troy Farthing and Patsy Woolum, who would have testified as to the legitimacy of the charities that held bingo sessions at Jackpot. The Defendants mistake the record, which reflects that these witnesses were not precluded from testifying to the legitimacy of the charities. The record reflects that, with regard to testimony of Troy Farthing, the district court sustained the Government\u2019s objection under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) with regard to the admissibility of his testimony concerning bad acts of Roger Alexander, a Government witness. The district court did not bar other testimony. The Defendants, on appeal, do not raise any claim with regard to the district court\u2019s Rule 404(b) ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The district court record also reflects that Patsy Woolum was also not precluded from testifying as to the legitimacy of charities that held bingo sessions at Jackpot, and, in fact, actually testified regarding this matter. The Defendants presented Woolum, the former president of the Waco Ladies Auxiliary, who testified that the mam source of funding for the charity was from bingo proceeds, and that the charity gave money to people in financial need, helped send children to camps, and purchased school supplies for school systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Second, the Defendants challenge the district court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of William Farmer, an enrolled agent for the IRS authorized to represent people before the IRS in tax matters. He performed a \u201cnet worth/expenditure method analysis\u201d to determine the taxes owed by the Defendants from 1999 through 2001. During a Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) hearing, Farmer explained that his analysis depended on information provided by the Defendants regarding the amount of money they possessed. His analysis was based upon the Defendants\u2019 claim to possession of a cash hoard of $55,000, the existence of which Farmer did not verify.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 702, an expert may offer an opinion \u201cif (1) the testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d The Government argues that the district court did not err because Farmer was a \u201cconduit\u201d for the admission of inadmissible hearsay. An expert may, however, rely on hearsay in forming an opinion. <em>See Kingsley Assocs., Inc. v. Del-Met, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1277, 1286-87 (6th Cir.1990) (interpreting Fed.R.Evid. 703). We do not find an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s exclusion of Farmer\u2019s testimony. The district court has an \u201cobligation to ensure that the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion is both reliable and reasonable.\u201d <em>Trepel v. Roadway Exp., Inc., </em>194 F.3d 708, 720 (6th Cir.1999) (Suhrheinrich, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Farmer\u2019s proposed testimony was unreliable due to his failure to verify the facts upon which he based his calculations of the Defendants\u2019 tax liability. His opinions were based solely on the Defendants\u2019 self-serving statements regarding their assets. It appears likely in this case that the defense was simply attempting to use Farmer as a \u201cconduit\u201d for the admission of the Defendants\u2019 otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements regarding their assets. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>222 F.R.D. 334, 341 (E.D.Tenn.2004). Lacking any indicia of reliability, the district court did not err in excluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">E. Calculation of Fraud Loss</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The Defendants argue that the district court erred in its calculation of \u201closs\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, namely that its estimate \u201cwas unreasonable, excessive, inaccurate and founded solely on unsupportable statistical speculation.\u201d Both of the Defendants\u2019 respective presentence investigation reports recommended applying a 16-level enhancement because the actual loss was more than $1,000,000 but less than $2,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\u201cUnder the Guidelines, the district court is to determine the amount of loss by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court\u2019s findings are not to be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Triana, </em>468 F.3d 308, 321 (6th Cir.2006). But \u201cwhether those facts as determined by the district court warrant the application of a particular guideline provision is purely a legal question and is reviewed de novo by this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Section 2B1.1 of the Guidelines is used in determining \u201closs\u201d in fraud cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this section, the district court may estimate the amount of the fraud loss. In situations where the losses occasioned by financial frauds are not easy to quantify, the district court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss ... based on available information.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. 3(C). And such estimates \u201cneed not be determined with precision.\u201d <em>Triana, </em>468 F.3d at 320 (quoting <em>United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 503 (4th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The district court estimated a fraud loss of $1.4 million by extrapolating an average of the estimated amount of money made from the sale of unreported pull-tab cards on four nights in March of 2000 over a three-year period \u2014 from June of 1998 until June of 2001, at which time the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ment admitted there was no longer evidence of the sale of unreported pull-tab cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">An extrapolation method for estimating fraud loss best suits cases such as this, where the fraud occurred over a long period of time, and a precise calculation of the loss is simply not feasible. As the Tenth Circuit has explained, \u201c[requiring precise calculations which entail the gathering of documents that are diffuse and/or difficult to obtain would reward a defendant whose tax fraud was particularly complex and/or spanned a significant period of time.\u201d <em>United States v. Spencer, </em>178 F.3d 1365, 1368 (10th Cir.1999) (applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1, which provides for the computation of tax loss for tax evasion, failing to file a tax return, and filing a false return). Therefore, courts have approved of extrapolation methods for estimating fraud loss. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bryant, </em>128 F.3d 74, 76 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201c[I]t is permissible for the sentencing court, in calculating a defendant\u2019s offense level, to estimate the loss resulting from his offenses by extrapolating the average amount of loss from known data and applying that average to transactions where the exact amount of loss is unknown.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Defendants contend that the figure used to extrapolate the total loss \u2014 the average daily profit from unreported pull-tab cards over a four-day period in March of 2000 \u2014 was unreasonable because it was \u201csuch a small sample.\u201d They insist that the sample was \u201csmall\u201d because it consisted of estimated profits from four out of 756 nights, or about 0.53 percent of the period in question. Operating under the premise that smaller sample sizes yield less reliable estimates, the Defendants argue that the extrapolated amount of total loss was inherently unreasonable. But we know of no case holding that a percentage below a specific statistical floor yields a calculation that is per se unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 950 (9th Cir.1999) (rejecting the proposition that \u201cany percentage below twenty is inherently unreliable\u201d). Rather, as the Commentary to the Guidelines notes, \u201c[t]he estimate of the loss shall be based upon <em>available </em>information,\u201d and the sentencing court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, n. 3(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The district court did just that in this case, and its estimate was supported by the evidence. The Government presented the testimony of OCG Inspector Nicole Creech, who testified that she was able to calculate the profits generated from the sale of unregistered pull-tab cards at Jackpot Charity Bingo during the undercover operations in March 2000 by multiplying the number of pull-tab cards played by the expected profit. According to Creech, the sale of unregistered pull-tab cards yielded an average profit of $40,000 per month. In accordance with the Guidelines\u2019 admonishment that the estimate take into account \u201cfactors [] such as the scope and duration of the offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, n. 3(C)(v), the district court used this figure to calculate a total loss over a two-year period of $1.4 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">As the Government correctly notes, the conservative method of extrapolation method used by the district court should weigh against our finding it unreasonable. The calculation is favorable to the Defendants in that the figure extrapolated to calculate the total loss was based solely on the unreported pull-tab cards. This figure did not take into account other methods employed by the Defendants to obtain and hide income, which included skimming bingo proceeds utilizing house players during bingo sessions. Also, the figure extrapolated to calculate the total loss was artificially low, as it took account of the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>night of the OCG investigation. On this night, the OCG inspection was overt. OCG investigator Beverly Rogers testified that \u201csales went down drastically\u201d on this night, and that OCG agents \u201chad observed on the other nights [that the Defendants] sold lots and lots of pull-tabs, and [on] that night very few pull tabs were sold\u201d after OCG inspector Dell Jones arrived at Jackpot to conduct an inspection. So proceeds from pull-tab cards detected on this night were presumably much less than normal. Given the sample\u2019s account of time during which the Defendants were on notice of governmental surveillance, the overall estimate of the fraud loss was likely lower than a more precise estimate of the fraud loss. As a result, it cannot be said to be unreasonable on grounds that the district court\u2019s method of calculating loss <em>overestimated </em>the amount of the loss. We accordingly find no error in the district court\u2019s loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">F. Disparity in Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Defendants argue that the district court penalized them for exercising them constitutional right to plead not guilty and go to trial. In support, they point to the disparity in their sentences and the sentences of the Adamses, their co-conspirators who pleaded guilty. While the Defendants were sentenced to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, the Adamses were sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">First, because the Defendants\u2019 sentences are within the Guidelines, they are presumptively reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that a federal appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Second, legitimate reasons exist for the disparity between the Defendants\u2019 and the Adamses\u2019 sentences. The Defendants were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States, tax evasion, and mail fraud. The Adamses pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion. The Defendants received an enhancement for perjury while the Adamses received a deduction for acceptance of responsibility. Thus, it cannot be said that the Defendants and the Adamses are \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>240 Fed.Appx. 699, 713 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that where defendant went to trial while two co-defendants \u201caccepted responsibility for their actions and pleaded guilty,\u201d the \u201cthree were not similarly situated,\u201d so \u201cthe district court had no basis for sentencing them similarly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In any event, this Court has squarely held that sentencing disparities between co-conspirators are reasonable when the \u201cco-conspirators chose to plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Dexta, </em>470 F.3d 612, 616 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Valentin, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 674, 678 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[I]t is well established that the availability of a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility cannot be interpreted as a punishment of defendants who maintain their innocence, nor does it otherwise derogate their rights.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Parker, </em>903 F.2d 91, 105-06 (2d Cir. 1990)); <em>cf. United States v. Hamid, </em>227 Fed.Appx. 475, 480 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that a great disparity was still reasonable even where the co-conspirators <em>did not </em>plead guilty, because there was no evidence that \u201c[co-conspirators] were as or more culpable than [the defendant] or had as serious criminal histories as did [the defendant]\u201d). We accordingly find no error in the Defendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the Defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">.
