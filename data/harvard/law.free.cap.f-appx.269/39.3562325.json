DeFonzo denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. <em>In re Tabsirou Ly, </em>No. A96 257 407 (B.I.A. Apr. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 257 407 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">As an initial matter, we deem Chen\u2019s asylum and CAT claims abandoned, as he has failed to raise those claims in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, we proceed to review only his challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Ly was not credible. The BIA found \u201c[o]f particular significance\u201d that while Ly testified to having been beaten by Mauritanian guards in 1989, neither his asylum application nor the addendum makes any mention of a beating. When asked why the beating was not included in his application, he explained that the preparer of the application did not elicit such details from him. The IJ declined to credit that explanation, pointing out that there was no evidence that the asylum application and addendum were prepared negligently, and that the information in the addendum regarding the 1989 incident was quite detailed but yet omitted any reference to a beating. We cannot conclude that a reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept Ly\u2019s explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The BIA also noted that Ly\u2019s testimony regarding the 1995 incident was internally inconsistent. Ly testified on direct examination that when the police arrived, they \u201cbeat us.\u201d However, on cross-examination, Ly asserted that he was not beaten during this incident. When the IJ asked Ly why he testified that the police \u201cbeat us,\u201d Ly replied, \u201cBeing that my father, he gave it to me and my brother we are siblings so if they are beaten, it looks \u2014 it feels like we all of us were beaten.\u201d The IJ properly declined to credit Ly\u2019s proffered explanation, as a reasonable fact-finder would not have been compelled to do so. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">These material inconsistencies went to the heart of Ly\u2019s claims for relief, as the beatings comprised a significant portion of Ly\u2019s claim that he had been persecuted by the Mauritanian government. <em>Cf. Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (finding that inconsistencies that do not involve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>heart of the asylum claim are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility determination). Accordingly, they provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and his denial of Ly\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
