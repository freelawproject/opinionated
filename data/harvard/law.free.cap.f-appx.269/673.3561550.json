We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We reject as foreclosed the government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because Trujillo did not obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See Rosas v. Nielsen, </em>428 F.3d 1229, 1231-32 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Trujillo contends that his prison disciplinary proceedings, which resulted in a loss of good time credits, violated due process because the investigative employee assigned to Trujillo failed to assist him. We conclude that the state courts\u2019 denial of relief was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 570, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (extending a due process right to assistance during disciplinary proceedings only where an inmate is \u201cilliterate\u201d or where \u201cthe complexity of the issue makes it unlikely that the inmate will be able to collect and present the evidence necessary for an adequate comprehension of the case\u201d). Contrary to Trujillo\u2019s contention, the assignment of an investigative employee under Cal.Code Regs. tit. 15 \u00a7 3315(d)(1) does not equate to a determination that he had a federal due process right to such assistance pursuant to <em>Wolff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Trujillo further contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for an evidentiary hearing. However, because Trujillo failed to set forth a colorable claim for relief, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Earp v. Ornoski, </em>431 F.3d 1158, 1166\u2014 67 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
