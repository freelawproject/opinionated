Straus\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of Ponta-Garca\u2019s motion to terminate removal proceedings and secure a sixth continuance of his removal proceedings. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-25\">Ponta-Garca argues: (1) that the IJ abused his discretion in denying Ponta-Garca\u2019s request for a continuance to allow him to pursue his application for adjustment of status and (2) that he was denied due process of law when the IJ determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>that he did not have jurisdiction to oversee the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (\u201cDHS\u201d) adjudication of Ponta-Garca\u2019s wife\u2019s application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The denial of a continuance in removal proceedings is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ considered, and denied, Ponta-Garca\u2019s continuance request in the context of a proceeding in which Ponta-Garca (1) had already requested and received five continuances; (2) conceded that he was removable and was, at the time of the request for continuance, ineligible for adjustment of status, the only relief he requested and (3) requested a continuance to present an argument \u2014 estoppel based on the DHS\u2019s failure to timely adjudicate Ponta-Garca\u2019s wife\u2019s application for adjustment of status \u2014 that the IJ had no jurisdiction to consider. Given these circumstances, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Ponta-Garca\u2019s request for a sixth continuance of his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Ponta-Garca further argues that he was denied due process by the IJ\u2019s determination that he lacked jurisdiction to oversee the DHS\u2019s adjudication of Ponta-Garca\u2019s wife\u2019s application for adjustment of status. We do not have jurisdiction over this claim. This Court possesses jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, and the DHS\u2019s decision on Mrs. Ponta-Garca\u2019s adjustment application does not constitute such an order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), (b); see <em>also Colato v. INS, </em>531 F.2d 678, 679-80 (2d Cir.1976). As a result, this portion of Ponta-Garea\u2019s petition for review must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. Having completed our review, Ponta-Garca\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
