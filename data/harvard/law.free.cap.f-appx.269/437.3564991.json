In a prior appeal to this court, Aragon argued that his prior conviction was improperly characterized as an aggravated felony in calculating his guidelines range sentence, and the Government agreed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, we agreed with the parties, vacated Aragon\u2019s sentence, and remanded the case to the district court. On remand, Aragon\u2019s revised guidelines range was calculated as twenty-one to twenty-seven months of imprisonment, and the district court resentenced Aragon to sixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Aragon contends that his above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cignored\u201d the recalculated recommendation under the Guidelines and because the distinct court gave too much weight to Aragon\u2019s criminal history when that same criminal history had already been factored into the guidelines range. Because the district court here did not indicate that it was upwardly departing or reference a Guidelines upward departure provision, we treat the sentence as a nonguidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d 352, 358 n. 5 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Aragon\u2019s claim that the district court \u201cignored\u201d the Guidelines on remand is belied by the court\u2019s detailed explanation of the above-guidelines sentence. The district court adopted a four-page order explaining its decision to impose a sentence above the guidelines range. In addition, the court expressly noted that the Guidelines were advisory, and it used the range it had calculated as a frame of reference. The court properly considered aspects of Aragon\u2019s criminal history that were undervalued or not reflected in his guidelines calculation, especially his multiple arrests for various crimes and the pace of his criminal activity in such a short time span during his unlawful presence in the United States. The district court, citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), found that a sixty-month term of imprisonment was necessary, \u201cconsidering the nature and circumstances of this defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d and \u201chis complete disregard for the laws of the United States, to afford adequate deterrence to his criminal activity and protect the public from this defendant\u2019s further conduct.\u201d In light of the district court\u2019s detailed justification for its above-guidelines sentence and Aragon\u2019s criminal history, we affirm the sixty-month sentence imposed as reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-601, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Aragon challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v.
