We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Blueford v. Prunty, </em>108 F.3d 251, 255 (9th Cir.1997). We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tritchler v. County of Lake, </em>358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Crane\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated by disciplinary proceedings that resulted in the loss of good time credits because Crane failed to show that the results of the disciplinary hearings were invalidated. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (holding prisoner must demonstrate conviction or sentence has been successfully overturned before challenging validity of the conviction or sentence); <em>Blueford, </em>108 F.3d at 255 (affirming dismissal without prejudice under <em>Heck </em>of damages claims relating to disciplinary proceedings where good time credits involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Officer Fannon\u2019s testimony at trial because it was based on his personal observations and his direct participation in the search of Crane\u2019s cell. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting a copy of the rules violation report as relevant to show that the disciplinary action was not retaliatory but reasonably advanced a legitimate penological interest. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403; <em>see also Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (preserving institutional order, discipline, and security are legitimate penological goals).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting a copy of the cell search receipt under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 803(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Crane\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Crane\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
