Jan. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 305 456 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 25, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see, <em>e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum applicant has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that his asylum application was filed within one year of his arrival pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding that an applicant failed to show either changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Notwithstanding that provision, however, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Gegaj\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application raises a question of law, namely, that the IJ \u201capplied an inappropriately high and arbitrarily determined evidentiary standard\u201d in determining that he failed to establish his date of entry to the United States, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review that argument. <em>See Ilyas Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 721 (2d Cir.2007). Nevertheless, we conclude that Gegaj\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As the BIA properly found, the inconsistencies in the testimonies of Gegaj and his witnesses provided ample support for the IJ\u2019s finding. Both the BIA and the IJ noted that Gegaj testified inconsistently about when his brother came to pick him up. In addition, the IJ noted that Pal\u2019s description of where he picked up Gegaj was inconsistent with the affidavit that he submitted. The IJ also properly noted that Pal\u2019s testimony that he and Gegaj drove directly to his apartment from Michigan was inconsistent with the testimony of Gegaj and Lena, who both asserted that they drove to his uncle\u2019s home first. Moreover, the IJ provided Gegaj the opportunity to rehabilitate the inconsistent testimony and asked him to produce evidence to corroborate his date of entry. Because the IJ believed that the records would \u201cgo a long way to resolving this in favor of the respondent,\u201d she adjourned Gegaj\u2019s hearing to a later date so that he could obtain them. However, as the IJ noted, Gegaj was unable to submit the requested documents, nor did he submit any other corroboration of his date of entry, namely, \u201cplane tickets, a boarding pass, gas, or food receipts.\u201d In light of the foregoing, we cannot find that the IJ applied a more stringent standard than the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, Gegaj\u2019s argument is without merit, and we leave undisturbed the IJ\u2019s pretermission of Gegaj\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">II. Withholding of Removal and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We further conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Gegaj was not credible, as the IJ properly relied on omissions in the record that involve material aspects of his claim of persecution. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). The IJ properly found that while Gegaj testified that he was arrested and detained for three days in March 1991, his amended affidavit omitted that assertion. While Gegaj tried to explain that he had been \u201cvery, very nervous and very upset\u201d when he was preparing the document, the IJ properly declined to credit that explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In addition, the BIA and IJ also properly found that while Gegaj testified that he was arrested \u201cmaybe twenty times a year\u201d between 1991 and 1997, his amended asylum application and affidavit did not assert that he was arrested at all. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>IJ properly found that Gegaj was unable to provide details regarding his \u201c20 arrests,\u201d and was unable to recall specific incidents aside from the March 1991 arrest. As the IJ properly found, Gegaj\u2019s failure to provide details about his alleged arrests, in addition to the omissions from his amended affidavit, go to the heart of his claim that he has been persecuted in the past, as they reasonably led the IJ to conclude that \u201cnone of these 20 arrests happened.\u201d <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. Accordingly, they provide support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Because of the inconsistencies identified above, it was reasonable for the IJ to require corroboration of Gegaj\u2019s claims so that he might rehabilitate his questionable credibility. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000). However, the IJ found that Gegaj failed to submit a copy of his Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d) membership card, an affidavit from his cousin, medical records detailing his treatment for a bullet wound, or a copy of an arrest record, and was unable to explain the absence of these documents. The IJ also did not err in declining to credit the affidavit of Gegaj\u2019s father because it did not mention that the authorities searched for Gegaj at his family home, as he testified. Indeed, none of the documents that Gegaj submitted provide any support for his assertions that he had been active in the DP, that he had been arrested for his DP activity, or that he had been shot by a Socialist Party (\u201cSP\u201d) supporter. Thus, Gegaj\u2019s failure to corroborate his claim provided further support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In addition, the IJ also found that Gegaj was \u201cvague or non-responsive\u201d at several points in his testimony. For example, the IJ found that when asked for the details of his \u201c20 arrests,\u201d he said that he could not remember any of the dates, \u201csimply repeating non-responsively that he participated in all Democratic Party activities when asked by the Court or the Government counsel for specifics on the 20 arrests.\u201d Such assessments of an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor are afforded substantial deference, particularly where they are supported by specific examples. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 81 n. 1; <em>see also Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">While the agency\u2019s decision is not without error,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> remand is not warranted here because this Court can confidently predict that the agency would still find that Gegaj was not credible, even absent the en\u2019oneous finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006). The omissions and inconsistencies identified above, in addition to the IJ\u2019s properly-made demeanor and corroboration findings, provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. Because the only evidence that Gegaj was likely to be tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\">. We find unavailing Gegaj's argument that the manner in which the IJ conducted his hearing prejudiced the outcome of his case. As the BIA found, while the IJ did question Gegaj and his witnesses \"extensively\u201d throughout the course of his hearings, the record does not indicate that Gegaj was denied a full and fair hearing or that the IJ's questioning went beyond the scope of her duty to develop the record. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l); <em>see also Islam v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. In particular, we find error in the BIA's determination that the information provided in Gegaj's statement regarding his arrest in 1991 was inconsistent with his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
