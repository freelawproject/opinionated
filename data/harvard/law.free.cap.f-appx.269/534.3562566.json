Also challenged is the bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to allow this same party to amend its pleadings to ask for sanctions. The district court was presented these same issues and affirmed. In reviewing the errors alleged in the appeal here, we find no basis to disturb that judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>I. Interpreting the Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In 2003, Barnett Marine, Inc. (\u201cBarnett\u201d) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Thereafter, Bankruptcy Trading &amp; Investments, L.L.C. (\u201cBTI\u201d) acquired eighteen unsecured claims in Barnett and became one of Barnett\u2019s largest unsecured creditors. BTI and Barnett filed competing reorganization plans. Ultimately, the two parties reached a settlement agreement regarding the treatment of BTI\u2019s claims under the plan of reorganization. The settlement agreement facilitated confirmation of Barnett\u2019s proposed plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Under the agreement, BTI would vote its unsecured claims in favor of the Plan in exchange for Barnett\u2019s promise to allow a substantial contribution claim and to treat all of BTI\u2019s unsecured claims as \u201callowed\u201d claims under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">BTI alleges that, after the Plan was confirmed, Barnett breached the settlement agreement by objecting to several of BTI\u2019s unsecured claims. BTI successfully litigated this matter before the bankruptcy court. However, the bankruptcy court refused to award attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by BTI in litigating the unsecured claims because the Plan provided that \u201c \u2018[cjlaim\u2019 shall mean a duly listed or timely filed claim which is allowed in this proceeding, excluding interest, attorney\u2019s fees, late charges, and other similar charges.\u201d The bankruptcy court and the district court both found that this language barred the attorneys\u2019 fees award sought by BTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">BTI argues that, although an unsecured creditor, it is entitled to collect attorneys\u2019 fees incurred while litigating the validity of its claims against Barnett \u2014 a solvent debtor \u2014 under <em>In re Continental, </em>110 B.R. 276 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.1989). As the district court noted, the <em>In re Continental </em>court was not faced with a reorganization plan that excluded attorneys\u2019 fees from the definition of \u201cclaim.\u201d BTI responds that the language of the Plan excludes only <em>pre-petition </em>attorneys\u2019 fees and BTI is seeking <em>post-petition </em>attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of Barnett\u2019s post-petition breach of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The bankruptcy court and the district court found that the Plan\u2019s language clearly excluded all claims for attorneys\u2019 fees, regardless of whether those fees were incurred pre-or post-petition. In the past, this Court has usually reviewed the interpretation of a confirmed plan <em>de novo, </em>employing traditional tools of contract interpretation. <em>In re Advisory Comm. of Major Funding Corp., </em>109 F.3d 219, 222 (5th Cir.1997). The Court has also noted that a bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of a reorganization plan that it has confirmed is \u201centitled to deference.\u201d <em>In re O\u2019Connor, </em>258 F.3d 392, 401 (5th Cir.2001). For purposes of this appeal, we employ the more stringent <em>de novo </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The bankruptcy and district courts\u2019 interpretation of the Plan is reasonable. The plain language of the Plan excludes attorneys\u2019 fees from the definition of \u201cclaim.\u201d Nothing in the remaining portions of the Plan would render this definition ambiguous. We are not persuaded by BTI that the modifiers \u201cduly listed\u201d and \u201ctimely filed\u201d render the definition ambiguous. Rather than reading these phrases to create an implied dichotomy between pre-and post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees, the more natural reading of this language merely conforms the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cclaim\u201d with the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s definition of \u201cclaim.\u201d <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a) and Fed. R. Bankr.P. 1007 (relating to scheduling or \u201clisting\u201d of claims); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 3003(c) (relating to timely filing of claims). Even if BTI\u2019s claims for attorneys\u2019 fees would have been permitted under the Code and <em>In re Continental, </em>they are barred by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\n<em>II. The Motion to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s interpretation of the Plan did not leave Barnett free to act with impunity in regard to post-confirmation matters. The bankruptcy rules provide for sanctions against parties who raise frivolous claims or defenses. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9011(b)-(c). Sanctions may include reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of a violation of Bankruptcy Rule 9011. <em>Id. </em>The imposition of sanctions is permissible only after a party has complied with certain procedural safeguards, particularly the separate motion and 21-day \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirements. <em>See Elliott v. Tilton, </em>64 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.1995) (compliance with procedural prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 is \u201cmandatory\u201d and failure to comply precludes award of attorneys\u2019 fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">BTI never complied with Bankruptcy Rule 9011, but argues that the issue of whether Barnett had any nonfrivolous basis for objecting to its unsecured claims was tried by consent in motions filed and hearings held before the bankruptcy court. As such, BTI suggests that justice required the bankruptcy court to grant leave to amend its pleadings to conform them to the evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). The bankruptcy court rejected BTI\u2019s motion to amend because BTI failed to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 9011\u2019s procedural safeguards and BTI never urged a violation of the rule or requested an imposition of sanctions during proceedings before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\u201cWhether leave to amend should be granted is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court, and that court\u2019s ruling is reversible only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wimm v. Jack Eckerd Corp., </em>3 F.3d 137, 139 (5th Cir.1993). Though the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit \u201cliberal amendment,\u201d a court may deny a motion to amend where there is a \u201cvalid justification.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Fort James Corp., </em>470 F.3d 1171, 1175 (5th Cir.2006). Amendments under Rule 15 should not be permitted where parties would be surprised by the inclusion of new issues. 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Mary Kay Lane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1491 (2d ed.1990). Permitting an amendment under Rule 15 to include a retroactive request for sanctions would surprise a party that is relying on the benefit of notice by separate motion and a \u201csafe harbor\u201d period before being subjected to sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9011(c)(1)(A). This is a \u201cvalid justification\u201d for denying BTI\u2019s motion to amend its pleadings. There was no abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
