We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Romero contends that the district court improperly relied on his citizenship, multicultural background and bilingual ability during sentencing and that the district court had no basis for concluding that \u201cstatistically, he\u2019s the kind of person that would engage in this kind of conduct in the future.\u201d We conclude that the district court abused its discretion by considering Romero\u2019s race and national origin in contravention of U.S.S.G \u00a7 5H1.10, which states that such factors are not relevant in the determination of a sentence. We further conclude that the district court erred by relying on unfounded assumptions as to Romero\u2019s statistical likelihood of recidivism. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Borrero-Isaza, </em>887 F.2d 1349, 1352 (9th Cir.1989) (concluding that the district court may not consider improper, inaccurate or mistaken information, and may not make unfounded assumptions in imposing sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
