The district court sentenced Simmons to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Simmons contends the district court erred by treating the advisory Guideline sentence as presumptively reasonable, failing to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining an appropriate sentence, and imposing an unreasonable sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">We will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review focuses on whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). A sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error of law or fact can render a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). Assuming the sentence contains no significant procedural errors, we may presume a sentence falling within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">When sentencing a defendant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the Guideline range; (2) allow the parties to argue for the sentence they deem appropriate and determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentences requested by the parties; and (3) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. The sentencing court may not presume that the applicable Guidelines range is reasonable, but should explain any deviation from that range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553 or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within the Guideline range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir. 2006). One reason that a sentence within an advisory range may be presumed to be reasonable is that the most salient \u00a7 3553(a) factors are already incorporated into the Guideline determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 342-43; <em>see also Rita v. United </em>States,U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cwhere judge and Commission <em>both </em>determine that\u201d a Guideline sentence is appropriate, \u201cthat sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). A district court\u2019s consideration of pertinent factors may also be implicit in its ultimate ruling. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-20\">The district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and the potentially meritorious arguments raised by the parties at sentencing. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. \u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCircumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has found that the case before him is typical.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Simmons challenges the district court\u2019s consideration of the Guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as the sentence that it ultimately imposed. We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court adequately considered the advisory nature of the Guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to Simmons\u2019 case, and reasonably imposed a sentence that was at the bottom of the Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
