At sentencing, Pan-key argued that she was eligible for a sentence below the Sentencing Guidelines because the 100-to-l crack cocaine to powder cocaine sentencing disparity was not applicable to her situation. The district court believed it was constrained to defer to the guidelines and sentenced Pankey to the low end of the properly calculated guidelines range of imprisonment. On appeal, we affirmed her sentence, noting her challenge to the sentencing disparity was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio could not be used as basis for variance), <em>vacated</em>, \u2014 - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008). <em>See United States v. Pankey, </em>195 Fed.Appx. 130 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). On January 7, 2008, the Supreme Court granted Pankey\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>Pankey v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 856, 169 L.Ed.2d 708 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-26\">The Supreme Court decided in <em>Kimbrough </em>that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the erack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>thus abrogated <em>Eura. </em>Because <em>Kimbrough </em>relieves the court of being constrained by the guidelines when considering the crack/powder disparity, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-27\">Thus, we vacate Pankey\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-28\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
