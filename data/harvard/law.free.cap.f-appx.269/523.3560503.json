(\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d) foreclosed on Appellant Wayne E. Williams\u2019 property, Williams filed a <em>pro se </em>lawsuit alleging violation of numerous consumer protection statutes. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-19\">Williams argues on appeal that the party that authorized the foreclosure sale lacked authority to do so. As the sole basis for this argument, Williams contends that there are contradictions in Defendants\u2019 summary judgment documents, namely one document that correctly shows that the loan was owned by Vendee Mortgage Trust 1995-3 and other documents that reference Deutsche Bank as trustee for Vendee Mortgage Trust 1994-2 (rather than 1995-3). Williams contends that the district court erred in finding that the incorrect numbers in Defendants\u2019 documents were mere clerical or typographical errors that did not prevent Deutsche Bank from lawfully foreclosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-20\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. United States v. Lawrence, </em>276 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.2001). The district court noted uncontradicted evidence that Deutsche Bank was the trustee for both Vendee Mortgage Trust 1995-3 and Vendee Mortgage Trust 1994-2. The typographical errors did not change the fact that Deutsche Bank was the trustee with power to foreclose on Williams\u2019 property, and it was Deutsche Bank that authorized the foreclosure sale. The district court found that the foreclosure notice and sale were not defective and held that the apparent clerical or typographical errors in the foreclosure documents did not deprive Williams of the due process afforded to debtors under the Texas Property Code. Williams has cited to no evidence or authority that the incorrect numbers were anything other than typographical errors, that the errors harmed him, or made any difference whatsoever in the foreclosure process, or that this type of error entitles him to any legal relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
