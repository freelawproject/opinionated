Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, silting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Leroy Creasey appeals from a February 23, 2007 order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stanton, J.) denying his Motion to Reopen Litigation. Although not perfectly clear, Creasey\u2019s motion sought an order vacating the Special Board of Adjustment\u2019s (the \u201cBoard\u201d) January 16, 1992 decision upholding its earlier decision to deny Creasey reinstatement to his position as a locomotive-engineer trainee after Creasey failed to appear at a scheduled drug test. The Board\u2019s decision to sustain Creasey\u2019s discharge was previously affirmed by this Court in <em>Creasey v. Metro-North Com. Rail, </em>993 F.2d 1534 (2d Cir. 1993) (unpublished summary order). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Creasey argues that: (1) the Board did not cite the applicable collective-bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) in its original award and, as a result, the Board exceeded its jurisdiction; (2) the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by not adopting his union\u2019s dissent; and (3) the district court \u201ccoached\u201d the Board in its remand order, thereby violating his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">To establish that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction, Creasey must show that it failed to construe the CBA. <em>See CSX Transp., Inc. v. United Transp. Union, </em>950 F.2d 872, 877 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201c[Wjhere fraud is not an issue, we ask only whether the arbitrators did the job they were told to do .... \u201d) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Cjollective-bargaining agreements may include implied, as well as express, terms.\u201d <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>491 U.S. 299, 311, 109 S.Ct. 2477, 105 L.Ed.2d 250 (1989). It is also \u201cwell established that the parties\u2019 practice, usage and custom is of significance in interpreting their agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). In its original award, the Board cited \u201cestablished and uncontested company policy\u201d as the basis for return-to-duty physical examinations. Thus, the Board construed the CBA and did not exceed its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Creasey\u2019s argument that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by not adopting his union\u2019s dissent similarly lacks merit. It is recognized that Board members will sometimes disagree and, as a result, the statute provides that a majority is \u201ccompetent\u201d to issue an award. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(n). Although the majority and dissenting opinions represent a disagreement over the proper construction of the original award, Creasey cannot establish that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Creasey\u2019s due process argument also fails. The district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201ccoach\u201d the Board to violate Creasey\u2019s due process rights. To the contrary, the district court found that the Board had not considered all of the documentation relevant to Creasey\u2019s claimed illness and remanded for the Board to consider the full record Creasey offered to support his excuse. Only after the Board complied and upheld its prior dismissal did the district court dismiss Creasey\u2019s petition. Thus, Creasey\u2019s due process rights were protected, not violated, by the district court\u2019s remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Although this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the district court\u2019s order, Creasey\u2019s arguments fail to bring this case within the narrow grounds to which judicial review of an adjustment board\u2019s decision is limited. <em>See Union Pacific R.R. Co. v. Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. 89, 93, 99 S.Ct. 399, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978) (review of National Railroad Adjustment Board orders is limited to three grounds: (1) violation of the Railway Labor Act; (2) the Board exceeding its jurisdiction; and (3) fraud or corruption); <em>see also Shafii v. PLC British Airways, </em>22 F.3d 59, 64 (2d Cir.1994) (Board orders are also reviewable on due process grounds). Thus, the district court\u2019s order denying Creasey\u2019s Motion to Reopen Litigation was entirely proper. And, as Creasey\u2019s motion to reopen litigation lacks merit, his motion for default judgment similarly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We have considered all of Creasey\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and Petitioner\u2019s motion for default judgment is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
