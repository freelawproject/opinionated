R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Robert Edward Ruiz appeals from the 197-month sentence imposed following his jury-trial conviction for possession of equipment which may be used to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(a)(6); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">Ruiz contends that his above Guidelines range sentence violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that it was greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The record shows, however, that the district court considered the factors under \u00a7 3553(a), heard arguments from both parties, and clearly stated its reasons for imposing the sentence. The district court articulated its reasoning to the degree required for meaningful appellate review. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 516-17 (9th Cir.2008). Therefore, we cannot say that Ruiz\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">Ruiz also contends that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) when it failed to state in writing \u201cwith specificity\u201d in the judgment and commitment order its reasons for imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range. Because those reasons are on the record and we have not determined that the sentence is too high, we may affirm the sentence. <em>See United States v. Daychild, </em>357 F.3d 1082, 1107-08 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-20\">Ruiz further contends that because his sentence exceeded the calculated Guidelines range, the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment and the ex post facto principles of the Due Process Clause. These contentions are foreclosed. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 919-21 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Finally, Ruiz contends that the district court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) when it imposed a three-level enhancement based on facts not admitted or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This contention is without merit. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 230-32,125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
