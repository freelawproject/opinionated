Vargas argues that the district court erred in upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., based on the underrepresentation of his criminal history. He also challenges the extent of the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">We review the decision of the district court to depart and the extent of the departure for an abuse of discretion, ultimately determining whether the sentence is reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 918, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). <em>See also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[T]he abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions \u2014 whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart was based on the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including Vargas\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by Vargas. The district court relied, in part, on the short time frame in which Vargas had accumulated eight prior convictions for driving while intoxicated (mostly with probated sentences), as well as his two prior illegal reentry offenses, and found that it was likely that Vargas would return to the United States illegally<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and might cause serious injury or kill someone while driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also noted that several of Vargas\u2019s prior convictions had not been included in his criminal history score pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c). Because the upward departure advanced the objectives in \u00a7 3553(a) and is justified by the facts of the case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in upwardly departing from the advisory guidelines range. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In challenging the extent of the district court\u2019s departure, Vargas also as-serfs that his sentence must be vacated because the district court did not specifically address each intervening offense level when determining that a departure to criminal history category VI and offense level 15 was warranted. The district court explicitly stated that it had considered the intervening offense levels in reaching the extent of its departure but that the increase was appropriate due to the extent and nature of Vargas\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood of his recidivism. The court was not required to do more. <em>See United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663-64 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc) (holding a district court need not mechanically discuss every level it rejects where its reasons are implicit). Given the facts of this case and the district court\u2019s reasons for departing, Vargas has not shown that the court abused its discretion in the extent of its departure. <em>See Lee, </em>358 F.3d at 328-29; Zu<em>niga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Vargas argues for the first time on appeal that the district court improperly relied on his prior arrests when sentencing him. This argument is without merit as the district court necessarily was relying on Vargas\u2019s prior convictions because (as the PSR reflected) Vargas had no prior arrests for which he was not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Vargas challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ments of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pinedas-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
