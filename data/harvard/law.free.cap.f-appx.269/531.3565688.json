Muhammad appeals the sentences imposed by the district court on remand. Muhammad argues on appeal that his plea was involuntary and that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss. Because Muhammad could have raised these issues in his first appeal but he failed to do so, he has waived it. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>179 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.1999), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-22\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.
