After the district court initially sentenced Morales-Uribe to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, we vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Morales-Uribe, </em>470 F.3d 1282 (8th Cir. 2006). We vacated the sentence because some of the factors that the district court relied upon in sentencing Morales-Uribe to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, while appropriate, were not sufficient to support the substantial, 48-month variance from the bottom of the advisory sentencing guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">At resentencing, the district court adhered to our previous requirement that extraordinary variances required extraordinary circumstances. The Supreme Court now has \u201crejected \u2018an appellate rule that requires \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. McGhee, </em>512 F.3d 1050, 1051-52 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201c[W]e understand the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gall </em>also to preclude a requirement of \u2018extraordinai-y circumstances\u2019 to justify an \u2018extraordinary variance,\u2019 for that was the only type of sentence outside the guidelines range to which this court had applied an \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1052. Therefore, we vacate Morales-Uribe\u2019s sentence of 90 months\u2019 imprisonment and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Gall.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
