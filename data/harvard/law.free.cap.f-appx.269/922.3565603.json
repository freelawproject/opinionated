Sinibaldi (\u201cSinibaldi\u201d), Joseph Cuciniello (\u201cCuciniello\u201d), and Gene A. Tyrrell (\u201cTyrrell\u201d), were part of a conspiracy group which sold false and unregistered security offerings through the Millenium and Stonehedge Groups and caused great losses to many elderly individuals. Appellants were convicted on specific charges of securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, selling of unregistered securities, and conspiracy. Sinibaldi, Cuciniello, and Tyrrell raise numerous issues<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 234challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>evidentiary rulings, legal rulings, their convictions, and the sentences imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Millennium Investment, Inc. (\u201cMil\u201d) was created for the alleged purpose of helping new businesses become publicly traded companies. Defendants Danny Wey (\u201cWey\u201d) and Gregory G. Schultz (\u201cSchultz\u201d) served as officers and directors of Mil. Shortly thereafter, Millennium Investment, Inc. Trust (\u201cMIIT\u201d) was created to market and sell unregistered notes. The funds raised by MIIT were remitted to Mil. Schultz\u2019s duties included serving as legal counsel to the Millenium entities, drafting MIIT offering documents, and directing MIIT\u2019s fund-raising efforts. Wey\u2019s duties included identifying the investments in which MIIT could place its funds. Although Wey had a criminal background which included a federal conviction of felony fraud offenses, MIIT investors were not so advised despite MIIT disclosure documents with experience profiles for both Wey and Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Once MIIT commenced its operations, Schultz informed Wey that MIIT notes which matured in less than nine months were exempt from state and federal registration requirements under the \u201ccommercial note exemption.\u201d Also, several of the notes MIIT issued included a \u201cbanker\u2019s acceptance\u201d provision stating that the Bank of Bermuda Limited, which is one of the largest banks in the Carribean, would guarantee the notes in the event of default. As was ultimately discovered, this bank had never issued a \u201cbanker\u2019s acceptance\u201d or any other guarantee to MIIT. In fact, neither the bank nor any of its subsidiaries had ever had a relationship with MIIT, its officials or entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Sinibaldi was the top seller at MIIT. For six months, he was involved in fifty-eight MIIT transactions, valued at $1,655,235.68, that purported to be secured by the banker\u2019s acceptance provision. He assured investors that MIIT notes were fully secured by the Bank of Bermuda and were a completely safe investment. At first, Sinibaldi received a commission of up to ten percent of any MIIT investments he secured, but in order to evade securities laws, Schultz determined that this compensation should be characterized as \u201cconsulting or advisory payments,\u201d even though Sinibaldi never offered any marketing or consulting services to the Millenium entities. Over a two year period, Sinibaldi and his company, Delta Financial Services, Inc., received a total of $465,234.47 in cash payments and additional securities from Mil (which were sold for about $85,000). From October 1996 to July 1999, individuals invested more than $6 million in MIIT securities; however, by July 1999, MIIT had more than $1 million in past-due notes. Furthermore, despite the fact that MIIT had defaulted on its obligations in October 1998, defendants falsely informed new investors that MIIT notes offered \u201cgood security.\u201d By mid-1999, MIIT stopped raising funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Defendants then formed the Stonehedge entities. Securities from these entities were marketed through individuals in the financial or insurance business, allegedly to provide funding to companies that were about to make public stock offerings. The Stonehedge offering material stated that \u201cStonehedge invests their portfolio in a company called Millenium as its vehicle for making the investments.\u201d Stonehedge also advised investors that Millennium principals had over 40 years of experience in taking companies public.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">From August 1998 to November 1999, Cueiniello incorporated eight Stonehedge entities in Florida. Then in September and October 1999, despite being aware of an ongoing investigation of defendants\u2019 fraudulent activities by the Florida Department of Banking and Finance (\u201cDBF\u201d), Cueiniello incorporated another seven Stonehedge entities in New York. Cueiniello served as an officer of several Stonehedge entities, was an authorized signator for ten Stonehedge-related bank accounts, and participated in seminars to train others to market Stonehedge securities. Between March 1998 and April 2001, Cueiniello and his family received more than $850,000 from Stonehedge entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">From March 1998 through November 2000, more than $12.5 million was invested in the Stonehedge offerings. Only about twenty percent of this money was invested as represented in the Stonehedge offering materials. However, up to thirty-three percent of these invested funds were paid out as commissions to those involved in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In January 1998, Cueiniello brought co-defendant Robert Phillips (\u201cPhillips\u201d) to the Stonehedge program. At a meeting held in Clearwater, Florida, Schultz provided further detail to Phillips about the program. Phillips then agreed to market the Stonehedge program through his network of insurance agents, West Coast Distributors, Inc. (\u201cWest Coast\u201d). Out of every Stonehedge investment placed by Phillips\u2019s agents, West Coast would receive a commission of up to twenty-seven percent. In order to evade state and federal securities laws, Schultz told Phillips that these payments must be characterized as \u201creferral fees\u201d rather than \u201ccommissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">In the fall of 1998, Phillips recruited Tyrrell to sell Stonehedge securities. After Tyrrell\u2019s involvement in the Stone-hedge securities, the funds invested increased dramatically, from approximately $30,000 to $100,000 per month to as much as $1,000,000 per month. His sales organization was the largest of all the sales organizations engaged in the Stonehedge marketing effort. Tyrrell participated in and created a training manual for seminars to train new agents to market Stone-hedge securities. Also, Tyrrell was the president, secretary, treasurer, and sole shareholder of one of the entities \u2014 The Stonehedge Group, Inc.-X, and thus executed the shares of stock issued in connection with this entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">From March through July 1999, DBF served investigative subpoenas for testimony and documents on MIIT, Sinibaldi, Global Research International, Inc., and many of the Stonehedge entities. Before responding to the subpoenas, defendants tried to conceal them fraudulent activities by supplementing MIIT investor files with backdated correspondence, and modifying and supplementing Stonehedge investor files to give them the appearance of conforming to applicable state and federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">In October 1999, DBF filed a civil action in Pinellas County, Florida, seeking an injunction and appointment of a receiver for Mil, MIIT, various Stonehedge entities, and First Dominion Venture Capital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Inc., and named as \u201crelief defendants\u201d Schultz, Wey, Cueiniello, and Sinibaldi. The state circuit court granted DBF\u2019s requests, entered an injunction, and appointed attorney Gary Lipson as receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The defendants ceased using the Millennium and Florida based Stonehedge entities and turned all of their attention to the New York-based Stonehedge offerings. There they raised more than $3.2 million from November 1999 through November 2000. Despite the millions of dollars raised through the sale of these unregistered securities, Millenium investors lost more than $5.3 million and Stonehedge investors lost more than $11.4 million. Sinibaldi, Cueiniello, and Tyrrell invested none of their money in any of these entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">After the state circuit court made its rulings, Cueiniello convinced Phillips that the injunction did not prevent him from marketing Stonehedge securities outside of Florida. Thereafter, the Stonehedge sales that Phillips and his agents made were processed through Tyrrell\u2019s Arizona-based company, Innovative Financial Concepts, LLC (\u201cIFC\u201d). About seven weeks after the injunction was entered, Phillips withdrew from the Stonehedge program.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Before Lipson\u2019s appointment, Tyrrell received his commissions from West Coast, through IFC. After the appointment, Tyrrell began to receive his commissions from the New York-based Stonehedge XII entity through another Arizona-based company recently registered by his wife\u2014 TMT Consulting. Payments to TMT Consulting were typically remitted to IFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The jury convicted Sinibaldi on the overarching conspiracy count, two counts of securities fraud, three counts of selling unregistered securities, four counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, eight counts of engaging in illegal monetary transactions, and seven counts of money laundering. Cueiniello was convicted on the overarching conspiracy count, one count of securities fraud, three counts of selling unregistered securities, eight counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, seven counts of engaging in illegal monetary transactions, and seven counts of money laundering. Tyrrell was convicted on the overarching conspiracy count, one count of securities fraud, seven counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and seven counts of money laundering. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">I. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motions for Mistrial after Severance and Challenge to Standby Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Schultz originally represented himself <em>pro se, </em>but due to apparent health problems, he suffered a blackout and collapsed in court. Because of Schultz\u2019s illness and admittance to a hospital, the court appointed stand-by counsel on his behalf. The court explained this change to the jury. On March 16, 2005, because Schultz continued to suffer tremendous pain and had difficulty concentrating, the district court severed his ease and granted him a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">Appellants first challenge their motion for a mistrial based upon the severance of Schultz from the remainder of the trial. The basis of this argument was the prejudicial effect of the jury\u2019s observation of Schultz\u2019s apparent health problems. Sinibaldi also challenges the district court\u2019s appointment of standby counsel for Schultz. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that none of these arguments provide any basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a severance for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1297 n. 3 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Cir.2005). First, the district court was correct in initially denying a severance because \u201cthe general rule is that defendants who are jointly indicted should be tried together, particularly in conspiracy cases.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1236 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>U.S. v. Pedrick, </em>181 F.3d 1264, 1272 (11th Cir.1999)). Next, Sinibaldi has no standing to challenge the district court\u2019s appointment of Schultz\u2019s standby counsel, only Schultz has such standing. The jury observed Schultz\u2019s health problems before the appointment of counsel and the court properly explained the appointment to them. The jury was fully instructed to draw no inferences from such. Thus, Sinibaldi\u2019s arguments that the jury would have interpreted the appointment as an indication of guilt is without merit and there was no abuse of discretion. Sinibaldi also argues that Schultz\u2019s ultimate severance from the trial deprived the remaining defendants of Schultz\u2019s assistance in them joint defense. We find this argument frivolous. Schultz was available as a witness, but was never called by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Sinibaldi argues that the defendants were prejudiced because evidence of events in which only Schultz had been involved was introduced at trial. Because this case involves a conspiracy, all defendants involved in the conspiracy are liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the conspiracy including the acts of co-conspirators. <em>See U.S. v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1335 (11th Cir.2005); <em>U.S. v. Alas, </em>196 F.3d 1250, 1251 (11th Cir.1999); <em>U.S. v. Mothersill, </em>87 F.3d 1214, 1218 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cHence, a court need not assess the individual culpability of a particular conspirator provided the substantive crime was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court gave the jury clear detailed instructions designed to eliminate any confusion of \u201cprejudicial spillover.\u201d The jury was carefully instructed to consider each defendant separately as to each count in the indictment. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">II. <em>Defendants\u2019 Challenge to the District Comi\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">A. <em>Miscellaneous Business Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The documents at issue are GX 115-1A \u2014 (a copy of the outside cover of a MIIT file concerning investor Jack Over-mire), GXs 112G, 115-1-G \u2014 (exhibits containing investor correspondence), and GX 35 \u2014 (past-due MIIT notes pertaining to several investors). According to Wey\u2019s testimony, these and a series of other MIIT documents had been created and maintained by the defendants in the ordinary course of them business. Thus because \u201ca trial judge has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of [business record] evidence[,]\u201d the court properly admitted these documents as business records pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). <em>U.S. v. Bueno-Sierra, </em>99 F.3d 375, 378 (11th Cir.1996). These business records do not violate the Confrontation Clause because none of them are testimonial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">B. <em>Abel Flores Reyes\u2019 Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Sinibaldi argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the former mayor of San Lorenzo, Nicaragua, Abel Flores Reyes, to testify over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the defendants\u2019 objections, regarding a conversation he had before executing an agreement which purported to establish a business relationship between the government of San Lorenzo and the Millennium and Stonehedge entities. Reyes stated that during this conversation, Claudia Garcia told him that attorneys in Miami, Florida, would provide money to build housing for the impoverished in San Lorenzo if he would execute the agreement at issue. According to Sinibaldi, this testimony was inadmissible hearsay and a violation of the Confrontation Clause. We disagree. Reyes\u2019 testimony established that no business relationship existed between the government of San Lorenzo and the Millennium and Stonehedge entities. Furthermore, Reyes\u2019 testimony about the conversation that prompted him to execute the agreement explained why Reyes had signed it. This challenged testimony was not offered to prove the truth of any matter asserted and therefore it is not hearsay under Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). <em>See Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1373 n. 15 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d but evidence that is not offered or admitted for its truth is not hearsay) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, it was offered to show his mental state and why he signed the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">C. <em>The testimony of Albert Melehoir and Expert Witness Charles Stutts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Sinibaldi further argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Albert Melehoir, an Assistant General Counsel for the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation, who was primarily responsible for dealing in cases involving securities, to answer questions advanced by Schultz on cross-examination in an \u201cover responsive\u201d manner. Melehoir explained why DBF had sought <em>ex parte </em>injunctive relief in October 1999. He stated that as a result of his investigation, he \u201cwas certain that Stonehedge had raised about $3 million and were continuing to sell unregistered securities through unregistered agents.\u201d The defendants have never disputed that the Stonehedge offerings were unregistered. They had always maintained that they were exempt from registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Sinibaldi next argues that Charles Stutts, the United States\u2019 securities expert, gave impermissible legal opinions during his testimony. The record convinces us that the district court properly limited the scope of Stuff\u2019s testimony, gave the jury appropriate limiting instructions, instructed the jury on applicable securities law, explained the role of an expert witness, and committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">D. <em>The Testimony of Receiver Gary Lipson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Sinibaldi argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing Gary Lip-son, the receiver appointed by DBF, to make \u201cimproper commentary,\u201d citing comments from Lipson\u2019s four days of trial testimony. The district court properly sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the \u201cimproper commentary\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant objected to. We assume they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>E. <em>Sinibaldi\u2019s \u201cRIA\u201d Certification Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Sinibaldi argues that the district court should have excluded as propensity evidence a 1998 Lee County yellow pages advertisement, a 1999 brochure advertising an estate planning seminar, and a business card, in which he falsely held himself out to the public as a registered investment advisor or \u201cRIA.\u201d Sinibaldi argues this evidence is inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). However, this evidence demonstrated how Sinibaldi had conducted his fraudulent marketing activities during the charged conspiracies. Furthermore, this evidence was \u201cinextricably intertwined with the evidence of the charged offense[s],\u201d <em>U.S. v. Herre, </em>930 F.2d 836, 837 (11th Cir.1991), and thus Rule 404(b) does not apply. <em>See U.S. v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 989-90 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that testimony of defendant\u2019s unauthorized use of embassy letterhead to market forged financial instruments was \u201cadmissible as intrinsic evidence\u201d of the charged scheme to defraud). Even though none of the Government\u2019s witnesses indicated that they had placed particular reliance on this specific misrepresentation in deciding whether to invest in MIIT notes, this intrinsic evidence remains relevant and admissible. Specific reliance is not required under the federal fraud statutes. <em>See Neder v. U.S., </em>527 U.S. 1, 24-25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1841, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). A scheme to defraud must include a material misrepresentation, that is, \u201cone having a natural tendency to influence, or capable of influencing, the decision maker to whom it is addressed.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1271 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1056, 124 S.Ct. 2195, 158 L.Ed.2d 755 (2004). Sinibaldi misrepresented that he was a registered RIA, when in actuality, he did not even have a high school diploma. This misrepresentation gave the false impression that he possessed a high level of professional expertise and experience capable of influencing potential investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">III. <em>Whether the District Cowit Erred in Declining to Substitute Juror Bennet</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Sinibaldi argues that the district court abused its discretion in declining to substitute an alternate for juror Bennett. Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c), \u201ca trial court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, substitute an alternate juror for a regular juror who has become unable or disqualified to perform h[er] duties.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Holder, </em>652 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir. Unit B Aug.1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-11\">In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is ... deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during the trial, with full knowledge of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-12\"><em>Remmer v. U.S., </em>347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 451, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). \u201cA juror\u2019s exposure to extraneous material or influence requires a new trial if the exposure poses a reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1291 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations marks omitted). To make a such a showing, \u201ca defendant must establish that an extrinsic contact with a jury, in fact, occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once this showing is made, \u201cthe burden shifts to the government to prove that the extrinsic contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe factual determination of whether consideration of extrinsic evidence caused the defendant prejudice is committed to the trial court\u2019s \u2018large discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>BankAtlantic v. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., </em>955 F.2d 1467, 1472 (11th Cir.1992). It must be noted that even though the juror states in her testimony \u201cthat the extrinsic information was harmless, [it] is not controlling.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Bolinger, </em>837 F.2d 436, 440 (11th Cir.1988). \u201cThe district court may consider such testimony, but it must also consider other factors such as the nature of the extrinsic evidence and the strength of the evidence properly presented by the government against the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>U.S. v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Juror Bennett\u2019s concern was a result of the lunch break on March 8, 2005. Jurors Williams, Glandt, and Bennett were sitting at a table eating when the defense attorneys arrived and sat at the table next to them. One of the lawyer\u2019s chan- rubbed against the back of juror Bennett\u2019s chair. The jurors then quickly finished their lunch and returned to the courthouse. Immediately thereafter, the court informed the defense that juror Williams had told the bailiff that she had a concern about members of the defense who sat near her during the lunch break. During <em>voir dire, </em>the district court properly questioned whether any of the jurors had overheard anything said by the attorneys or anyone else at them table in the restaurant. They all responded in the negative. The court then prohibited the parties, counsel, and witnesses from eating lunch in a portion of the area surrounding the courthouse and separated them from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The next day, juror Bennett addressed the district court stating that she did not hear what the attorneys were talking about in the restaurant. The jurors were already eating when the defense attorneys chose to sit next to them. She further stated that her stress was because she had been instructed that jurors were not supposed to be close to the attorneys on the case and that the attorneys in the restaurant were \u201ctoo close for comfort.\u201d She had the utmost respect for the court and wanted \u201cto do the right thing\u201d for everyone by reporting what had happened. Juror Bennett further explained that she was stressed due to physical exhaustion from commuting to and from the courthouse and performing her regular job responsibilities after trial each day. Consequently, the court accommodated her by allowing her to stay in a Tampa hotel any night she wanted to rest. The court then assured juror Bennett that the restaurant incident would not be repeated, and that if in the future she felt that she could not continue with her demands as a juror, she should immediately tell the court. Juror Bennett affirmed that she felt better about the situation. We believe these measures immediately resolved the situation. Based on the foregoing, the district court committed no error by allowing juror Bennett to remain on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">IV. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motion for Acquittal on Mail Fraud and Other Challenged Counts of Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. <em>U.S. v. Byrd, </em>403 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">\u201cTo prove mail fraud, the Government must show that the defendant (1) intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud and (2) used the mails to execute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Suba, </em>132 F.3d 662, 673 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe Government must establish only that the fraudulent scheme existed\u201d and circumstantial evidence of criminal intent can be sufficient. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[p]roof of a routine practice of using the mail to accomplish a business end is sufficient to support a jury\u2019s determination that mailing occurred in a particular instance.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Waymer, </em>55 F.3d 564, 571 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We find that there is sufficient evidence to prove use of the mails as to mail fraud counts ten and twelve on which Sinibaldi was convicted. These two counts concern MIIT investor Bernard Freund (\u201cFreund\u201d). Robert Freund, Freund\u2019s grandson, testified that the election form included with the letter that is the subject of count ten had been completed by Freund, and also both that letter and the letter that is the subject of count twelve had Freund\u2019s home address at the time. The form and substance of these letters is sufficient evidence to support the inference that they were mailed. Furthermore, there is evidence that Millennium entities typically had communicated with investors through the mail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Sinibaldi further argues that the Government did not prove numerous overt acts alleged in count one concerning the investment returns Sinibaldi falsely had advised Millennium investors they could anticipate. However, for a defendant to be convicted of a conspiracy to defraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government was only required to prove \u201can\u201d overt act, not every overt act alleged. <em>See U.S. v. Ellington, </em>348 F.3d 984, 989 (11th Cir.2003). There is direct evidence of overt acts alleged in the paragraphs Sinibaldi is not now challenging. The record also discloses circumstantial evidence supporting the overt acts in question. The testimony of several investors made clear that Sinibaldi had falsely represented that their MIIT notes would produce a twelve percent profit plus a five percent bonus. This argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">V. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motion for Acquittal on the Conspiracy Charged in Count One</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">This Court narrowly reviews an argument that the evidence failed to prove a single, overarching conspiracy and \u201cmay reverse a jury\u2019s finding that a single conspiracy existed only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, could not permit reasonable jurors to have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a single conspiracy.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Anderson, </em>326 F.3d 1319, 1327 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>U.S. v. Taylor, </em>17 F.3d 333, 337 (11th Cir.1994)). Sinibaldi argues that Millenium and Stonehedge offerings evidenced two separate conspiracies, rather than a single, overarching conspiracy. \u201cThree relevant factors determine whether a single conspiracy existed: (1) whether there was a common goal, (2) the nature of the scheme, and (3) the overlap of the participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the proof shows the defendant knew the essential objective of the conspiracy, it does not matter that he did not know all its details or played a very minor role in the overall scheme.\u201d <em>Suba, </em>132 F.3d at 672. Furthermore, \u201c[a] single conspiracy may be found where there is a \u2018key man\u2019 who directs the illegal activities, while various combinations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>other people exert individual efforts toward the common goal.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>17 F.3d at 337 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Gonzalez, </em>940 F.2d 1413,1422 (11th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">All of these factors are satisfied here. Among other things, the defendants marketed an array of Millennium and Stone-hedge offerings, whose common goal was raising funds through the sale of unregistered securities that allegedly would pay interest or other periodic monetary distributions. Furthermore, examples of overlapping included the \u201cDue-Diligence Worksheet\u201d provided to Stonehedge investors, which portrayed MIIT and Schultz as responsible for \u201chelping] selected companies go public\u201d and Phillips, Tyrrell, and their respective companies, as responsible for marketing the Stonehedge offerings. Finally, the district court properly instructed the jury on single versus multiple conspiracies. There is ample support for the jury\u2019s finding that Millenium and Stonehedge offerings were part of a single, unified conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">VI. <em>Defendant\u2019s Claim of a Cumulative Effect of Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We review any errors preserved for appeal, as well as any plain errors, to determine whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected. <em>See U.S. v. Adams, </em>74 F.3d 1093, 1099-1100 (11th Cir.1996). Sinibaldi argues that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the errors he has alleged on appeal warrants a new trial. \u201cWe have held that the cumulative effect of multiple errors may so prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial that a new trial is required, even if the errors considered individually are non-reversible.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Thomas, </em>62 F.3d 1332, 1343 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, the district court did not err as Sinibaldi contends; therefore, no cumulative errors exist. <em>See U.S. v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">VII. <em>Whether the District Court Emd in its Calculation of Loss Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Sinibaldi contends that the district court erred in its calculation of the $5,333,374 loss attributed to him and its order of restitution of the same amount. We agree with the district court in holding Sinibaldi responsible for all of the losses attributed to the conspiracy. <em>See U.S. v. Odom, </em>252 F.3d 1289, 1299 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that in calculating restitution, \u201ca defendant convicted of participation in a conspiracy is liable not only for her own acts, but also those reasonably foreseeable acts of others committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d 1071, 1081 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe calculation of loss for purposes of section 2F1.1 is not an exact science. [Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 cmt., n. 8 (1994) ] The loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>. The evidence supports the calculation made in this regard and, indeed the sum could have been much larger.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">VIII. <em>Cuciniello\u2019s Motions for Judgments of Acquittal or a New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Cuciniello specifically argues that at the close of the evidence in the Government\u2019s case-in-ehief, prosecutors had failed to establish ill will, or criminal intent on the part of Appellant. This argument is without merit. \u201cThe Government need not produce direct proof of scienter in a mail fraud case ... circumstantial evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>criminal intent can suffice.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1496 (11th Cir.1990). In fact, \u201c[g]uilty knowledge can rarely be established by direct evidence, especially in respect to fraud crimes which, by their very nature, often yield little in the way of direct proof.\u201d <em>Suba, </em>132 F.3d at 673. Among other things, Cuciniello incorporated eight of the sixteen Stonehedge entities, was an officer in many of these entities, including being President of the Stonehege Group, Inc., was an authorized signator for ten separate Stonehedge-related bank accounts, was a cardholder of two Stone-hedge-related American Express accounts, recruited co-defendant Robert Phillips into the defendants\u2019 scheme providing him with guidance after DBF initiated its investigation into the defendants\u2019 Florida-based operations, and profited from the sale of MIIT securities without ever investing his own money into any securities. Because the evidence established that Cuciniello actively participated in the organization and operation of the defendants\u2019 fraudulent investment scheme, the district court was correct in denying Cuciniello\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">IX. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Based on Prosecutorial Vindictiveness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment based on alleged prosecutorial vindictiveness for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Banter, </em>441 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir. 2006). In May 2001, the United States sent Cuciniello and his co-defendants letters informing them that they were targets of a pending grand jury investigation. On October 29, 2002, Schultz began a civil class action lawsuit seeking more than $300,000,000 in damages against several of the state and federal agencies and individuals involved in the investigation of the defendants\u2019 fraudulent investment scheme, including one of the federal prosecutors assigned to handle this case. Then, on December 10, 2002, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment, adding charges and defendants, including Cuciniello, to the existing indictment. Cuciniello then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for prosecutorial vindictiveness because the United States had allegedly sought the superseding indictment in retaliation for the civil action Schultz had filed. Because \u201c[a]s a general rule, the courts are not free to interfere with the prosecuting officer\u2019s discretionary decision to prosecute crime,\u201d <em>U.S. v. Spence, </em>719 F.2d 358, 361 (11th Cir.1983), and because it is clear in the record that the grand jury investigation that resulted in the indictment in this case was begun before Schultz filed his class action lawsuit, <em>see U.S. v. Corona, </em>849 F.2d 562, 567-68 (11th Cir.1988) (prosecutorial vindictiveness claim fails when government\u2019s investigation preceded defendant\u2019s exercise of procedural rights), there is no evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">X. <em>Cuciniello\u2019s challenge to the guidelines-range sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">\u201cWe review the length of a sentence for reasonableness in light of the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s case reflecting the sentencing considerations in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>U.S. v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>see U.S. v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). This review for reasonableness is deferential and the weight accorded to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor is up to the discretion of the district court. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. Cuciniello argues that the massive sentence imposed by the district court was not necessary. The party who challenges the sentence has both the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable and the initial bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>den of establishing that the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 1361. When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, this Court must evaluate whether the sentence achieves the purposes of sentencing set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C). <em>Id. </em>Here, Cuciniello has not identified a section 3553 factor that would support a lesser sentence. Furthermore, because among other things, Cuciniello violated the terms of his pretrial supervised release by attempting to market another investment scheme while on pretrial release, and after a review of the entire record, Cueiniello\u2019s 210-month sentence was not unreasonable. The sentence was required to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d and to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">XI. <em>Arguments waived because they were not properly raised-and supported-in Cuciniello\u2019s brief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Cuciniello concludes his brief as follows: \u201cCuciniello reasserts here any and all objections made at trial, including, but not limited to the basis for his mistrial, severance, and new trial motions, as stated at the district court level.\u201d Because Cuciniello has failed to identify and support these putative arguments in his brief (other than by incorporating by reference the entire record in this case), he has waived them. <em>See Kelliher v. Veneman, </em>313 F.3d 1270, 1274 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">XII. <em>Tyrrell\u2019s Motions for Judgments of Acquittal or a Neiv Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal <em>de novo. See U.S. v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2001). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Motion for a New Trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Ward, </em>274 F.3d 1320 (11th Cir.2001). Tyrrell argues that his Motion for Acquittal \u201cwas premised on the Government\u2019s failure to prove scienter in support of the various conspiracy claims raised against him.\u201d Tyrrell also argues that \u201c[t]he evidence adduced at Trial did not include any direct or circumstantial evidence of Mr. Tyirell\u2019s knowing participation in an agreement' to defraud.\u201d Because an abundance of evidence adduced at trial proved Tyrrell\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the charged conspiracies and because the existence of a conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence, <em>see U.S. v. Guerra, </em>293 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2002), we hold that the district court correctly denied Tyrrell\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the challenged convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-11\">.
