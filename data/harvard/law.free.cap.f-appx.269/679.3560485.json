We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Falcon Caniche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review in part, grant in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Because the IJ did not make an adverse credibility determination, we accept Gukutu\u2019s testimony as true. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 933 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Gukutu has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not he will be persecuted if returned to Zimbabwe. <em>See id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Gukutu did not establish that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Zimbabwe. <em>See Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1043, 1055-56 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the single incident of physical harm that Gukutu endured did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">However, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Gukutu failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in the Movement for Democratic Change (\u201cMDC\u201d). <em>See Lim, </em>224 F.3d at 935. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Gukutu was not singled out for harm while in Zimbabwe is contradicted by Gukutu\u2019s testimony that ruling party supporters attacked him with a machete at an MDC rally, and that his name was put on a list of MDC supporters. Additionally, Gukutu testified that individuals searched for him at his former residence while he was in hiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">Furthermore, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Gukutu\u2019s well-founded fear is undermined by his family\u2019s safe presence in Zimbabwe is not supported because Gukutu\u2019s family is not similarly situated to him. <em>See id. </em>at 935. Contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, Gukutu\u2019s ability to obtain a passport and enter and exit Zimbabwe does not diminish his well-founded fear. <em>See Khup v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 898, 905 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1082, 1091-92 (9th Cir.2005). Finally, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the IJ\u2019s reliance on MDC\u2019s representation in parliament, MDC members are routinely targeted for persecution by the ruling party. <em>See Kaiser v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Gukutu is eligible for asylum. We remand for a discretionary determination of whether Gukutu should be granted asylum. <em>See Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1079 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
