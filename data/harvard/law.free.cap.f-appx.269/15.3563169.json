He asserts three errors by the district court: first, that his motion for a new trial, on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, was improperly denied; second, that hearsay evidence was improperly admitted against him at trial; and third, that the district court unconstitutionally amended the indictment and improperly charged the jury. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">In order successfully to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must make two showings. First, he must prove \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If that showing is successfully made, the defendant still must demonstrate \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that trial counsel was in some ways defective, as the district court found (for example, in an opening statement that mentioned inadmissible inculpatory hearsay), we do not see how the second <em>Strickland </em>requirement, a showing of prejudice, is met here, given the mass of evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt. We believe it sufficiently clear that Appellant did not receive prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel that we decide the issue here, rather than dismissing it to be raised on a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Cf. Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (expressing our general preference to address ineffective assistance of counsel claims on \u00a7 2255 motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Appellant\u2019s hearsay claim was not raised below, and we therefore review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Logan, </em>419 F.3d 172, 177 (2d Cir.2005). The recorded statements introduced at trial were not hearsay, either because they were not offered for their truth, <em>United States v. Logan, </em>419 F.3d 172, 177-78 (2d Cir.2005), or because they were statements by eoconspirators in furtherance of a conspiracy, <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 181-84, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987); Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), or because they were party admissions, Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). It is possible that some of the testimony by Government agents about those recordings did constitute hearsay, but even if that were the case, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting those statements, because them admission did not have \u201ca serious effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Logan, </em>419 F.3d at 177 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Finally, the indictment was not unconstitutionally amended, because its scope was narrowed, not broadened. <em>United States v. Roshko, </em>969 F.2d 1, 5 (2d Cir.1992). And Judge Korman\u2019s jury charge made it clear that the jury was required to find the drug weight be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimously. This was a correct statement of the law, and there was therefore no error in the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s other claims, and we find them to be with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>out merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
