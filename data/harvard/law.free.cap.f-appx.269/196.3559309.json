Flores-Santos appeals, arguing that the District Court erred in precluding his justification defense and in sentencing him to an unreasonable term of imprisonment in light of his diminished mental capacity. He further contends that there is a possibility that the sentence may be in violation of the statutory mandatory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a)(1)(B). For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-18\">Flores-Santos, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered deported from the United States on November 18, 1992, and April 25, 1996. (App. 32, 40). He did not apply for relief from either order, and was deported on both occasions. After his 1996 deportation, Flores-Santos illegally reentered the United States in March, 1997. Thereafter, from November of 2000 to February of 2001, Flores-Santos was arrested on three occasions. On March 8, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sent Flores-Santos a notice of intent to reinstate his prior order of deportation pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (App. 43). That September, however, Flores-Santos was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eighteen months to three years after pleading guilty to attempted sexual abuse, and was incarcerated until February 6, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">Just prior to his release, on January 29, 2004, the INS reinstated Flores-Santos\u2019s prior order of deportation. (App. 43). In March Flores-Santos was taken to the Consulate of El Salvador to process his deportation order. There, he refused to sign and fingerprint a travel document to effectuate his deportation to El Salvador, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and verbally expressed refusal to cooperate. On February 9, 2005, Flores-Santos was indicted on one count of hindering removal from the United States, and was subsequently tried and convicted. The District Court sentenced him to seventy-seven months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Flores-Santos challenges the District Court\u2019s decision precluding him from presenting a justification defense at trial. Flores-Santos sought to offer the affirmative defense that he was justified in hindering his removal to El Salvador because he subjectively feared being killed by \u201cwandering gangs that the government cannot or will not control.\u201d (App. 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The government, at a pre-trial conference, argued that Flores-Santos could not support prong one or three of the justification defense set forth in <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>which requires that a defendant show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">(1) that the defendant or someone else was under unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) that the defendant did not recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (3) that the defendant had no reasonable legal alternative that would avoid both the criminal conduct and the threatened death or injury; and (4) that there was a direct causal relationship between the criminal act and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\"><em>United States v. Dodd, </em>225 F.3d 340, 342 (3d Cir.2000)(reciting the requirements of a justification defense for a defendant charged as a felon in possession). The trial court agreed with the Government and found that the evidence was insufficient to support a justification defense. It thus precluded Flores-Santos from raising this defense at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\u201cA court may rule on a pretrial motion to preclude a defendant from presenting [an affirmative] defense where the government contends that the evidence in support of that position would be legally insufficient.\u201d <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>59 F.3d 417, 421 n. 1 (3d Cir.1995) (barring duress defense pretrial when defendant lacked evidence to support such a defense).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Flores-Santos did not present any evidence in support of his subjective fear of returning to El Salvador, either pretrial or on appeal. Thus, the District Court did not err in barring the justification defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Flores-Santos next contends that his sentence is unreasonable because, in considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the District Court did not give adequate weight to the argument that his brain damage, caused by alcoholism, left him \u201cwith little or no ability to judge his actions.\u201d We review the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>(2007). This review is limited to determining whether the sentence imposed was \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327 (3d Cir.2006). A sentence within the guideline range may be presumed reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Appellant bears the burden of proving the unreasonableness of a sentence. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The District Court, faced with a guideline range of seventy-seven to ninety-six months, sentenced Flores-Santos to a term of seventy-seven months. After adopting the pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) over Flores-Santos\u2019s objections, the Court considered the mental capacity argument at the sentencing hearing. It heard Flores-Santos\u2019s argument on his history of severe alcoholism, which included discussion of Dr. Hume\u2019s report.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It discussed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically acknowledging that in sentencing Flores-Santos to the lowest end of the guideline range, it considered his \u201cmental problems\u201d and the findings in Dr. Hume\u2019s report. (App. 239). The record is clear that, contrary to Flores-Santos\u2019s contention, the District Court gave more than \u201clip service\u201d to his capacity argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of the evidence and the arguments presented both pretrial and at sentencing, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Lastly, Flores-Santos notes for the first time that his conviction <em>may </em>violate the four-year statutory maximum sentence set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a)(1). This section also contains a ten-year maximum \u201cif the alien is a member of any of the classes described in paragraph (1)(E), (2), (3), or (4) of section 1227(a) of this title[.]\u201d Flores-Santos does not present a proper legal argument for this Court to review. He states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">[cjounsel would also note that on review of the statute of conviction there does appear to be an issue of whether Mr. Flores-Santos is subject to a four (4) or ten (10) year maximum. If the four (4) year maximum applies, the sentence of seventy-seven months is illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">(Flores-Santos Br. 19). He concedes that it is \u201cprobable\u201d that he is subject to the ten-year maximum, but suggests that it would be \u201cprudent for this Court to remand this case to determine if, perhaps, the four (4) year maximum applies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Because Flores-Santos merely calls attention to a possible issue at the close of his brief, we have no moment to address it. <em>See Simmons v. Philadelphia, </em>947 F.2d 1042, 1065-66 (3d Cir.l991)(\u201ca passing reference to an issue in a brief will not suffice to bring that issue before this court on appeal.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of conviction of the Middle District of Pennsylvania will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\">. On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist, and its functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.No. 107-296, 110 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-14\">. <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5); 8 C.F.R. 241.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-15\">. After his release from imprisonment, Flores-Santos attempted to seek asylum and withholding of removal, asserting that he feared harm by roving gangs in El Salvador. According to the Government, the following events occurred thereafter. In September of 2004, immigration authorities interviewed Flores-Santos. On October 8, 2004, an asylum prescreening officer determined that his fear was not reasonable. This determination was approved by a supervisor on October 13, 2004, and affirmed again by an immigration judge on November 1, 2004. (App. 83-4). Flores-Santos did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. We have plenary review over whether Flores-Santos presented sufficient evidence to the District Court to support a justification defense. <em>See United States v. Paolello, </em>951 F.2d 537, 539 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. <em>See also United States v. Naovasaisri, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 170, 175 (3d Cir.2005) (affirming the District Court's precluding Naovasaisri \"from presenting a defense of duress at trial because he failed to establish a prima facie case of duress.\u201d); <em>cf United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 416, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (where \"an affirmative defense consists of several elements and testimony supporting one element is insufficient to sustain it even if believed, the trial court and jury need not be burdened with testimony supporting other elements of the defense.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. Due to defense counsel's concern about Flores-Santos\u2019s mental state before trial, the District Court ordered a mental status examination and appointed Dr. John M. Hume, M.D., J.D., to perform the examination and prepare a report of his findings. Dr. Hume opined that Flores-Santos has organic brain damage, \"which most likely has arisen from past alcohol abuse,\u201d adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressive features, and alcohol dependence with \"possible mild Kosakoff symptoms (difficulty with memory, resulting in confabulation).\" (Hume Rpt. 4-5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">. In addition to considering the capacity argument, the District Court addressed and ultimately rejected each of Flores-Santos\u2019s other grounds for requesting a sentence reduction. It rejected Flores-Santos's objections to the PSR's criminal history findings after a probation officer confirmed that, despite Flores-Santos's contentions, he was, in fact, convicted of the crimes listed in the PSR. (App. 223-24). It rejected his request for a reduction due to his alleged cooperation because such motion must come from the government. (App. 233). It further found that Flores-Santos was a recidivist, due to his two prior deportations and the current crime of hampering removal, and that \"substantial deterrence is necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b228-16\">. Moreover, the issue appears to be unmerilorious. As Flores-Santos essentially admits, he falls within a class of individuals covered by the ten-year statutory maximum; namely, the class of aliens who have committed crimes involving moral turpitude that meet the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(2). He has a lengthy criminal history that includes attempted sexual abuse in 2001. Flores-Santos pled guilty and served a term of imprisonment for this crime, which his counsel notes is likely a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
