We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b116-22\">We begin with Lagasse\u2019s claim under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174. Lagasse is correct that the first two counts of the superseding indictment inherited the speedy trial clock of the initial indictment, <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>45 F.3d 45, 48 (2d Cir. 1995), and that his waiver or consent to reset the clock for those counts is ineffective under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 489, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 1985-87, 164 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>749 (2006). Furthermore, based on the circumstances in which the parties agreed that the clock would restart, we find no merit in the government\u2019s argument that Lagasse is \u201cjudicially estopped\u201d irom asserting a Speedy Trial Act claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1987-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">However, we reject Lagasse\u2019s argument that the district court did not make the appropriate \u201cends of justice\u201d findings excluding numerous delays from speedy-trial calculations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8). Admittedly, the district court did not always record its \u201cends of justice\u201d findings at the time it granted a continuance, and its failure to do so was not the \u201cbest practice.\u201d <em>Zedner, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1989 n. 7. But we conclude that Judge Sessions made those findings, \u201cif only in [his] mind,\u201d before granting the continuances, and that he put those findings on the record when he denied Lagasse\u2019s motion to dismiss on August 5, 2005, as <em>Zedner </em>requires. <em>Id. </em>at 1989. We note that <em>Zedner </em>was decided after Lagasse was convicted, and the district court\u2019s failure to be more explicit is understandable in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Our speedy-trial calculations are as follows. There is no dispute that the speedy-trial clock ran for 13 days from October 9 through October 22, 2003. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). The clock was stopped on October 23 by the court\u2019s 90-day pretrial order, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A), and remained stopped while Lagasse\u2019s December 23 motion to suppress was pending, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). At the conclusion of the April 2, 2004, suppression hearing, the district court reserved decision on one of the suppression issues, stopping the clock for an additional 30 days. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(l)(J). The clock resumed on May 3 and ran 17 days until the filing of a superseding indictment on May 20, 2004, which stopped the clock until arraignment on May 27. <em>See Kelly, </em>45 F.3d at 48. The clock remained stopped through November 23, 2004, pursuant to the court\u2019s 90-day pretrial order and 30-day extension, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A), and while Lagasse\u2019s second motion to suppress was pending, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). The clock resumed on November 24 and ran 28 days until Lagasse filed a motion to continue on December 22, 2004. The clock was stopped between December 22 and December 27, while that motion was pending. <em>See id. </em>Although the district court granted the motion to continue on December 27, its order did not provide for an \u201cends of justice\u201d exclusion of time until the date on which trial was previously scheduled to begin, January 4, 2005. The clock thus ran again for 7 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the speedy-trial clock ran for a total of 65 days on counts one and two and 35 days on counts three through thirteen. Because not more than 70 days of nonexcludable time had elapsed, the district court did not err in denying Lagasse\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3161(c)(1). Although the speedy-trial clock ran for an additional ten days between the court\u2019s denial of Lagasse\u2019s motion to dismiss on August 5, 2005, and the start of trial on August 16, Lagasse waived any resulting Speedy Trial Act claim by failing to renew his motion to dismiss. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3162(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">In the alternative, Lagasse asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated. We reject this claim, as there were a variety of reasons for pretrial delay, not least of -which was Lagasse\u2019s decision twice to discharge his counsel. Further, Lagasse points to no prejudice apart from anxiety that normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges. Accordingly, Lagasse\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>speedy trial rights under the Sixth Amendment were not violated. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972) (establishing that constitutional speedy trial claims are governed by four factors: \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We decline to address the merits of Lagasse\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The facts relevant to the ineffectiveness claim are best developed in collateral habeas proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, should Lagasse wish to institute them. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>365 F.3d 150, 152-55 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Accordingly, we dismiss Lagasse\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim without prejudice to his ability to pursue it in a section 2255 motion properly filed in district court. <em>See United States v. Cimino, </em>381 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">With respect to Lagasse\u2019s claims regarding jury instructions and defense counsel\u2019s potential conflict of interest, any error by the district court was harmless. As for his challenge based on insufficiency of the evidence, we have reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence fully supports the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
