Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2258(a), and, because Prado-Jimenez has failed to meet the standards for issuance of a COA, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Prado-Jimenez pleaded guilty to a single count of illegal re-entry by a removed alien, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2), and the district court sentenced him to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. On direct appeal, we affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Prado-Jimenez, </em>223 Fed. Appx. 818 (10th Cir.2007). On August 2, 2007, Prado-Jimenez filed his pro se motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In his motion, Prado-Jimenez argued that because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, the statute under which he was convicted, lacked implementing regulations, the United States district court had no jurisdiction and he should have been tried in an immigration court. Prado-Jimenez also claimed ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to recognize this alleged jurisdictional defect; prosecutorial misconduct because there was no jurisdiction for his prosecution; and a violation of his due process rights by all officers of the court who were involved in this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The district court denied Prado-Jimenez\u2019s motion on August 8, 2007. Prado-Jimenez filed a motion for reconsideration on November 2, 2007, arguing that he should have been given discovery and an evidentiary hearing on this matter, which the district court also denied. The district court subsequently denied Prado-Jimenez a COA. Prado-Jimenez has now renewed his request for a COA with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. A prisoner may appeal from the denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to make that showing, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">After reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude that Prado-Jimenez is unable to make the requisite showing for the issuance of a COA. We agree with the district court that he has failed to demonstrate the denial of a constitutional right. There is no requirement that criminal statutes have implementing regulations. <em>United States v. Alden, </em>141 Fed.Appx. 562, 563 (9th Cir. 2005). Further, the fact that Prado-Jimenez\u2019s conviction arose out of an immigration violation did not mean that he should have been tried in an immigration court rather than a United States district court. \u201cThe district courts of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>shall have jurisdiction of all causes, civil and criminal, brought by the United States that arise under\u201d the immigration laws. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329. No discovery or evidentiary hearing was necessary for the district court to reach this legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The request for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-13\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
