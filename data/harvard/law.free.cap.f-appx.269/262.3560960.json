We dismiss in part and deny in part Kodjo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (West 2005), this court has no jurisdiction to review an administrative decision to grant or deny cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229b(b). <em>See Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 479-80 (4th Cir. 2006) (holding that, under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (D), court has no jurisdiction over any aspects of denial of relief under \u00a7 1229b except constitutional claims or questions of law); <em>Obioha v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 400, 405 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is quite clear that the gatekeeper provision bars our jurisdiction to review a decision of the B[oard] to actually deny a petition for cancellation of removal or the other enumerated forms of discretionary relief.\u201d). Whether an alien has proved the requisite degree of hardship under \u00a7 1229b is not a constitutional claim or question of law. <em>Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 38-40 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Martinez-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 679, 682 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). In fact, it is the precise discretionary decision that Congress has shielded from review. <em>Zacarias-Velasquez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 429, 434 (8th Cir.2007); <em>Meraz-Reyes v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 842, 843 (8th Cir.2006). Therefore, we must dismiss Kodjo\u2019s petition for review to the extent that it challenges this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we do have jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law. Kodjo asserts that he was denied due process of law because his counsel before the immigration judge rendered ineffective assistance. We find that Kodjo cannot state a colorable due process violation because he has no property or liberty interest in his request for cancellation of removal. <em>See Dekoladenu v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 500, 508 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cNo property or liberty interest can exist when the relief sought is discretionary.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>75 U.S.L.W. 3530 (U.S. Mar. 22, 2007) (No. 06-1285); <em>Smith v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 425, 430 (4th Cir.2002) (holding absence of liberty or property interest in the discretionary relief of waiver of deportation is \u201cfatal to [an alien\u2019s] due process claim\u201d). Can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>eellation of removal clearly is a form of discretionary relief, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Jean, </em>435 F.3d at 479, 482, and therefore, will not support a due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss Kodjo\u2019s petition for review to the extent it challenges the Board\u2019s discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. We deny the petition for review as to Kodjo\u2019s due process claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
