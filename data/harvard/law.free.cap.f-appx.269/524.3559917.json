He first argues that this court should reconsider its jurisprudence regarding the statute\u2019s constitutionality in light of <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). Rylander\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-23\">Rylander also challenges as plainly erroneous the district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition of his supervised release that he \u201cnot ingest any artificial stimulants,\u201d contending that the condition is vague and overbroad. The Government concedes the error and requests that the special condition be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-24\">We agree that the district court\u2019s imposition of this special condition, which could be interpreted to prohibit Rylander\u2019s use of a broad range of legal substances, including soft drinks, cough syrup, and tobacco, was plain error. The district court made no findings regarding Rylander\u2019s use of \u201cartificial stimulants.\u201d The condition is unrelated to his firearms-possession offense and involves a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to deter criminal conduct and protect the public. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>369 F.3d 847, 853-54 (5th Cir.2004). And although Rylander has a history of drug possession, the district court adequately addressed the concerns this history raises by prohibiting him from possessing or using controlled substances and requiring him to submit to periodic drug tests during the term of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Accordingly, the special condition of supervised release that Rylander not ingest any artificial stimulants is VACATED. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 878 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201c[W]e need not waste judicial resources by remanding for what [ ] would be a rote re-sentencing.\u201d). The district court\u2019s judgment is otherwise AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
