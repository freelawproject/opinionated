We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding and CAT, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000) and we review for abuse of discretion the IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to continue proceedings, <em>Nakamoto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 883 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand and review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Cruz-Aguilar failed to establish that the harassment she suffered amounted to past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003) (noting \u201cit is significant that the [petitioner] never suffered any significant physical violence\u201d). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Cruz-Aguilar does not have a well-founded fear of persecution because she failed to demonstrate internal relocation was not reasonable. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(i). Further, Cruz-Aguilar failed to establish her claim for asylum is based on a protected ground. <em>See Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Cruz-Aguilar\u2019s motion for a continuance. <em>See Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996) (a decision to grant a motion for continuance will only be overturned upon a showing of an abuse of discretion). Contrary to Cruz-Aguilar\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-17\">We agree with the BIA that the performance of Cruzr-Aguilar\u2019s two prior attorneys did not result in prejudice, and thus her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-90 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>claim, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b770-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
