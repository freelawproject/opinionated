(\u201cWa-KuL\u201d) and against Ericsson, Inc. The district court granted WaKuL\u2019s motion to confirm the Arbitrator\u2019s award and concurrently denied Ericsson\u2019s motion to vacate the award. After considering the parties\u2019 written and oral arguments, we AFFIRM for the reasons assigned by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">1. The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by awarding damages to WaKuL in excess of the Master Purchase Agreement (\u201cMPA\u201d)\u2019s limitation of liability provision because he determined that the limitation of liability provision was void due to fraudulent inducement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">2. To succeed on its argument that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded Texas law when it determined that the MPA\u2019s merger clause did not preclude WaKuL\u2019s fraudulent inducement claim, Ericsson had to show \u201cthe existence of a clearly governing principle\u201d that is \u201cwell defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\u201d <em>See Brabham v. A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., </em>376 F.3d 377, 381-82 (5th Cir.2004). It failed to do so. This court has not read <em>Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson, </em>959 S.W.2d 171 (Tex.1997), and its progeny as standing for the principle that, under Texas law, the presence of a merger clause categorically bars a fraudulent inducement claim under the contract, as Ericsson contends. <em>See Dunbar Med. Sys., Inc. v. Gammex Inc., </em>216 F.3d 441, 449 &amp; n. 11 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Gen. Retail </em>Servs., <em>Inc. v. Wireless Toyz Franchise, L.L.C., </em>255 Fed.Appx. 775, 789-90 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished). Rather, <em>Scldumberger </em>and its progeny make clear that the proper inquiry into whether the presence of a merger clause bars a fraudulent inducement claim is a fact-specific one, precisely of the kind engaged in by the Arbitrator here. Accordingly, the Arbitrator did not manifestly disregard Texas law on merger clauses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">3. The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by awarding WaKuL attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the MPA\u2019s arbitration provision. The arbitration provision plainly provided the Arbitrator with the authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. <em>See </em>MPA, at U 17 (\u201cArbitration ... shall include an award of attorneys\u2019 fees (and the amount of such fees) to the prevailing party.\u201d). Moreover, both parties requested attorneys\u2019 fees while this matter was before the Arbitrator, thereby permitting the Arbitrator to award attorneys\u2019 fees under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>See </em>Commercial Arbitration Rule R-43(d)(ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
