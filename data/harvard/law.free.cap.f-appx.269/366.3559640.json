He argues that the statute of limitations should be tolled because the defendants fraudulently concealed their actions, preventing him from timely learning the facts underlying his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">Scott states that he learned the factual basis underlying his claims in January 2000. Therefore, barring tolling, he had until January 2002 to file a timely \u00a7 1983 complaint. Scott\u2019s allegations of fraudulent concealment are not a basis for tolling of the limitations period because they relate to actions occurring prior to January 2000. Accordingly, Scott\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, filed in July 2005, is barred by the statute of limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of Scott\u2019s action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>108 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Scott is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
