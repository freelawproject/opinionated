To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s finding of removability, <em>Nakamoto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 882 (9th Cir.2004), and we review de novo petitioner\u2019s due process challenge, <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 923 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Garibay-Romo was removable for alien smuggling where the record contains Garibay-Romo\u2019s sworn statement admitting that he knew the passenger in his car was attempting to enter the United States with a fraudulent document and that he was assisting her. <em>See Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 595 (9th Cir.2005). Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to credit the sworn statement over petitioner\u2019s inconsistent and implausible testimony concerning whether he knew the unlawful alien status of the passenger in his car. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1258-59 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that inconsistencies and implausibilities in testimonial and documentary evidence went to the heart of applicant\u2019s claim and supported IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Garibay-Romo\u2019s due process argument is unavailing. <em>See Falcon-Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the BIA does not violate due process by summarily affirming an IJ decision.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Garibay-Romo\u2019s contentions regarding the issuance of the notice to appear and his eligibility for cancellation of removal, as he failed to raise those issues to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Garibay-Romo\u2019s remaining contentions are rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b773-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
