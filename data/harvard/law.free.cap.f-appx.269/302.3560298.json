Joy Tech., Inc., </em>455 F.Supp.2d 522 (2006) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Kennedy contends on appeal that the court erred in excluding from evidence a portion of the accident investigation report made by the Mine Safety and Health Administration concerning her husband\u2019s death (the \u201cMSHA Report\u201d), and in excluding the opinions of her causation expert.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As explained below, we affirm the court\u2019s ruling on the expert, reverse its ruling on the MSHA Report, vacate the summary judgment award, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">At approximately 10 a.m. on October 22, 2003, Gregory Kennedy, a forty-one-year-old coal miner, was operating a continuous miner (the \u201cmining machine\u201d) with a remote control device (the \u201cremote controller\u201d) in an underground mining operation in Paramount Coal Company\u2019s No. 7 mine, in Dickenson County, Virginia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Joy sold the remote controller under its name as a component of the mining machine, Matric had manufactured the remote controller under contract with Joy. The remote controller contained two levers, each of which controlled one of the mining machine\u2019s two tracks, generally referred to as \u201ctrams,\u201d on its right and left sides. By utilizing the remote controller\u2019s tw7o levers, the operator controlled the trams and thus the direction of the mining machine. In his work, Mr. Kennedy walked alongside the mining machine during its operations and wore the remote controller on a harness strapped to his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On the morning of October 22, 2003, Mr. Kennedy was engaged in a process called \u201cretreat\u201d mining (also knowi as \u201cpillaring\u201d), and was backing the mining machine out of a cut it had made in a pillar of coal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Kennedy backed the mining machine through an intersection of two mine entries (underground tunnels within a coal mine), preparing to make the next cut into the pillar. At the time, two other coal miners, Anthony Blackburn and Willie Mullins, were nearby hanging a ventilation curtain, with their backs to Mr. Kennedy. After noticing a change in the sound of the mining machine, Blackburn turned and observed that Mr. Kennedy was no longer moving. He immediately illuminated Mr. Kennedy and the mining machine with a light, and saw that Kennedy was slumped over with blood flowing from his nose and mouth. Blackburn promptly approached Mr. Kennedy and discovered that he was stuck between the mining machine and the corner of the coal rib (the wall of the mine) around which the machine had been maneuvering. At that time, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s back was against the coal rib and the mining machine was pressed against his abdomen. Although the mining machine\u2019s left tram was spinning, Blackburn observed that the levers on the remote controller were not depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Blackburn promptly hit the emergency stop button on the remote controller, deenergizing the mining machine and stopping the left tram from spinning. While other miners hurriedly sought emergency assistance, Blackburn tried to move the mining machine away from Mr. Kennedy\u2019s body by using the remote controller. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>though Blackburn cut the remote controller from Mr. Kennedy\u2019s body, he was unable to get it to function. Finally, after removing the power cord from another unit and attaching it to the remote controller, Blackburn was able to move the machine away from Mr. Kennedy\u2019s body. Mr. Kennedy was then airlifted to the emergency room of St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Norton, Virginia, where he was declared dead at 10:55 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The state agency responsible for mine safety in Virginia, the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy (\u201cDMME\u201d), was notified of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s fatal accident within twenty minutes. A few minutes later, MSHA also received such notification, and representatives of both agencies arrived at the coal mine about mid-day to begin a joint investigation. The MSHA investigatory team included an electrical engineer, a mining engineer, a mine inspection supervisor, and a mine safety and health inspector. The MSHA team, working with DMME, collected relevant information, questioned company personnel, and examined and photographed the accident scene, beginning them work within two or three hours of the accident. The investigation proceeded thereafter over several months with an expanded investigative team, including, inter alia, the district manager and assistant district manager of MSHA\u2019s regional office. From this effort, the MSHA team developed precise drawings of the accident scene. The team conducted extensive interviews with those having knowledge of the accident and tested the mining machine to assess whether it had been functioning properly at the time of the fatality. It also tested the remote controller, along with its various power sources and components, in a laboratory setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">MSHA\u2019s investigative efforts culminated in its detailed MSHA Report, which fully described the accident investigation and included appendices on MSHA\u2019s examination and testing of the mining machine and remote controller. After describing Mr. Kennedy\u2019s activities prior to the accident, the MSHA Report detailed the tragic event, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">Kennedy was located close to the inby, left corner of the outby block when the machine pivoted to the right. He was crushed between the machine\u2019s motor compartment of the ripper head and the coal rib. He was standing with his back against the coal rib and the machine against his abdomen. The bottom of the remote controller was against the right portion of Kennedy\u2019s abdomen. The controls of the remote controller were not depressed by any means. Neither his hands nor any other objects were on the controls. The left side track on the machine was still spinning in the forward direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">J.A. 627. The MSHA Report observed that there were no eye witnesses to the accident, \u201c[n]o one stated the continuous mining machine would make unexpected movements prior to the accident,\u201d and \u201c[n]o one stated Kennedy had been previously observed within the turning radius of the machine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680. Importantly, the \u201cOverview\u201d section of the Report concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">The most likely explanation for this continued operation is a build up of debris in the left side track operating lever\u2019s socket, located on the remote controller, which prevented the lever from returning to its neutral position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\"><em>Id, </em>at 623. The MSHA Report listed \u201ccausal factors\u201d in its \u201cRoot Cause Analysis\u201d section, concluding that the \u201cprimary cause was the victim\u2019s position within the turning radius of the continuous mining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>machine while it was being trammed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. The Report also specified another \u201ccausal factor,\u201d concluding that \u201c[t]he remote control transmitter could have caused the left tram drive to continue after the machine operator released the tram lever due to debris lodged between the tram lever and the plate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. In its \u201cConclusion\u201d section, the Report determined, in language similar to that used in its Overview, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">The left side track of the machine apparently continued to move due to a fouled tram lever on the remote controller. Debris accumulated in the lever\u2019s socket prevented the lever from returning to its neutral position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><em>Id. </em>In its Appendix C, the MSHA Report indicated that \u201cthe socket for the left tram lever was nearly full of dust and dirt, restricting its free travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On July 7, 2005, Mrs. Kennedy, for her husband\u2019s estate, filed suit against the defendants in the Western District of Virginia, asserting that his death was caused by a defective mining machine and its associated defective remote controller. Specifically, Mrs. Kennedy alleged two negligence claims plus a products liability claim, contending that the defendants had negligently designed the mining machine and remote controller and negligently failed to warn of their dangers. In her products liability claim, Mrs. Kennedy contended that the defendants had breached implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose because the mining machine and remote controller were defectively designed, manufactured, and marketed. These allegations are spelled out in the Amended Complaint filed by Mrs. Kennedy on September 29, 2005, which sought both compensatory and punitive damages. On August 11, 2006, Mrs. Kennedy abandoned her negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">On September 5, 2006, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the products liability claim, asserting that Mrs. Kennedy was unable to prove that their products were defective. Defendant Matric also contended that Mrs. Kennedy could not prove that any defect in its remote controller caused the death of Mr. Kennedy. In support of them contentions, the defendants argued alternate causes of the fatal accident, through expert testimony and other evidence \u2014 first, that Mr. Kennedy had committed user error, based in part on his alleged position within the \u201cred zone,\u201d or turning radius of the mining machine, at the time of the accident; and, second, that Paramount Coal had made unauthorized alterations to the remote controller that allowed excessive dust and debris to accumulate in its tram levers.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">When they sought summary judgment, the defendants also moved to exclude the evidence of Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s expert witnesses, Dr. Thomas Butler and Dr. Farhad Booeshaghi. In response to the exclusion motion, Mrs. Kennedy withdrew Dr. Booeshaghi as an expert, but opposed the motion to exclude Dr. Butler. In opposition to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment and exclusion motions, Mrs. Kennedy filed, inter alia, the expert report and testimony of Dr. Butler, the MSHA Report, and various documents illustrating the problems that defendant Joy had experienced earlier with debris accumulation in its remote con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>trailers and the resulting unplanned movements of its mining machines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The district court conducted a motions hearing on October 4, 2006, and issued its Opinion the next day, granting summary judgment to the defendants and excluding the opinions of Dr. Butler. By its Opinion, the court concluded that \u201c[a]fter a careful review of the summary judgment record, ... the plaintiff is unable to prove causation in this case, an essential element of her claim of breach of warranty.\u201d Opinion 5. The court went on to relate that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">[wjhile it is certainly possible that this tragic accident was caused by the excessive accumulation of coal fines and debris in the control sockets, the evidence is equally strong that the unplanned movement of the left-hand tram resulted from other causes \u2014 for example, an electronic malfunction (as suggested by one of the plaintiffs former experts) or an inadvertent error on the operator\u2019s part (as suggested by a defense expert).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><em>Id. </em>After observing that, in a products liability action, proof of causation must ordinarily be supported by expert testimony, the court considered the issue of whether the opinions of Dr. Butler were admissible. <em>Id. </em>In so doing, the court recognized that Dr. Butler had \u201copine[d] in his report that the accident was caused by accumulated debris in a tram control lever socket,\u201d but noted that Dr. Butler \u201cdid no testing,\u201d failed to \u201cperform[ ] any calculations regarding the accident and admitted that there could be alternative explanations,\u201d and that his testimony relied primarily on the MSHA Report. Accordingly, the court granted the defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to exclude Butler\u2019s testimony on this point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The district court \u2014 acting sua sponte<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014 then determined that \u201cthe MSHA report\u2019s opinion that \u2018the most likely explanation\u2019 for the accident is debris in the lever socket of the 3-X remote [controller] is likewise entirely speculative and thus inadmissible under [Federal Rule of Evidence] 803(8)(C).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff is unable to prove an essential element of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>case \u2014 causation\u2014and thus her suit must fail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so ruling, the court pointed out that defendant Joy \u201cdid not directly assert insufficient causation evidence as a ground\u201d for summary judgment, but that defendant Matrie had argued this proposition. The court thus observed that its ruling would not come as a surprise to Mrs. Kennedy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Two weeks later, on October 20, 2006, Mrs. Kennedy sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), requesting the district court to reconsider its summary judgment award to the defendants on the products liability claim. The court denied reconsideration on November 13, 2006, and Mrs. Kennedy filed her notice of appeal on December 12, 2006. We possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, viewing the facts and all inferences drawn properly therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). An award of summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact is one \u201cthat might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In opposing a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party is entitled to have the \u201ccredibility of his evidence as forecast assumed, his version of all that is in dispute accepted, [and] all internal conflicts in it resolved favorably to him.\u201d <em>Charbonnages de France v. Smith, </em>597 F.2d 406, 414 (4th Cir.1979). In assessing a summary judgment motion, a court is entitled to consider only the evidence that would be admissible at trial. <em>See Maryland, Highways Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. State of Maryland, </em>933 F.2d 1246, 1251 (4th Cir. 1991) (noting that \u201chearsay evidence, which is inadmissible at trial, cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">A district court possesses broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, including expert opinions, and we are unable to overturn evidentiary rulings with respect to relevance and reliability absent a finding that the presiding court abused its discretion. <em>See GE v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141-42, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). A district court has abused its discretion if its evidentiary ruling was guided by erroneous legal principles, or rested upon a clearly erroneous factual finding. <em>See Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi, A.B., </em>178 F.3d 257, 261 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">In considering this appeal, we first assess Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion on the cause of her husband\u2019s fatal accident, as being \u201centirely speculative and thus inadmissible under [Federal Rule of Evidence] 803(8)(C).\u201d Opinion 7. As noted, a team of MSHA officials and investigators arrived on the accident scene shortly after it occurred on October 22, 2003. The MSHA team, comprised of engineers, safety inspectors, and other experts, worked jointly with the DMME to secure the relevant information, question witnesses, and examine and photograph the accident scene, beginning their effort within a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>hours of the accident. During the investigation, MSHA tested the mining machine and remote controller, seeking to ascertain whether they had been functioning properly at the time of the fatality.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">When the MSHA Report was finalized, its \u201cOverview\u201d section concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">The most likely explanation for this continued operation is a build up of debris in the left side track operating lever\u2019s socket, located on the remote controller, which prevented the lever from returning to its neutral position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">JA. 623. In its summary judgment ruling, however, the Opinion determined that \u201cthe MSHA report\u2019s opinion that \u2018the most likely explanation\u2019 for the accident is debris in the lever socket of the 3-X remote [controller] is likewise entirely speculative and thus inadmissible under Rule 803(8)(C).\u201d Opinion 7. Mrs. Kennedy challenges this adverse admissibility determination, contending that consideration of this aspect of the MSHA Report is proper with respect to the summary judgment issue, and that such consideration will compel the denial of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s appellate contention on the admissibility of the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion implicates the provisions of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C). That hearsay exception specifically addresses the use in evidence of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 803(8)(C).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It specifies that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness ... (8) ... Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... (C) [when used] in civil actions and proceedings ... factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Under Rule 803(8)(C), the evidentiary admissibility of public records and reports is deemed to be presumed, based on the policy determination that such admissibility is warranted \u201cbecause of the reliability of the public agencies usually conducting the investigation, and their lack of motive for conducting the studies other than to inform the public fairly and adequately.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Int\u2019l Playtex, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 292, 300 (4th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cportions of investigatory reports otherwise admissible under Rule 803(8)(C) are not inadmissible merely because they state a conclusion or opinion.\u201d <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, </em>488 U.S. 153, 170, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988). When the trustworthiness of such an investigative report has been challenged, a court should assess and weigh factors such as: (1) the timeliness of the investigation; (2) the special skill or experience of the investigators; and (3) any possible motivation problems. <em>Ellis, </em>745 F.2d at 300-01. We have also identified other factors that may, in the proper circumstances, be appropriate to such an evidentiary assessment, including \u201cunreliability, inadequate investigation, inadequate foundation for conclusions, [and] invasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the jury\u2019s province.\u201d <em>Distaff, Inc. v. Springfield Contracting Carp., </em>984 F.2d 108, 111 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In light of the foregoing, the district court necessarily abused its discretion in excluding the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion from its summary judgment assessment. First and foremost, the court failed to recognize and apply a presumption of admissibility to the MSHA Report. As we recognized in <em>Zeus Enterprises, Inc. v. Alphin Aircraft, Inc., </em>\u201c[t]he admissibility of a public record specified in the rule is assumed as a matter of course, unless there are sufficient negative factors to indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\u201d 190 F.3d 238, 241 (4th Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, the party opposing the admission of such a report bears the burden of establishing its unreliability. <em>Ellis, </em>745 F.2d at 301. Thus, Rule 803(8)(C) \u201cis not a rule of exclusion, but rather is a rule of admissibility,\u201d so long as the proffered report satisfies the requirements of the rule. <em>Zeus, </em>190 F.3d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In this situation, the district court excluded the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion from its summary judgment assessment without identifying or explaining any \u201cnegative factors [that] indicate a lack of trustworthiness,\u201d sufficient to overcome the presumption of admissibility. <em>Id. </em>at 241. Although the court observed that the Report\u2019s conclusion was speculative, it failed to identify any deficiencies in the MSHA investigation or in MSHA\u2019s testing on the mining machine and remote controller. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Beech Aircraft, </em>if an investigatory report is otherwise admissible under Rule 803(8)(C), portions of that report are not rendered inadmissible simply because they state a conclusion or opinion. 488 U.S. at 170, 109 S.Ct. 439. Accordingly, the rule of presumptive admissibility created by Rule 803(8)(C) was applicable to both the data and the conclusions spelled out in the MSHA Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Moreover, the district court failed to assess the reliability of the MSHA report\u2019s conclusion by use of the various factors recognized by our precedent. And, these factors plainly weighed in favor of the admissibility of the Report, i.e., \u2014 MSHA had investigated the fatal accident over several months, beginning immediately after it occurred; the MSHA investigators possessed special skills and experience; and the defendants have not suggested any \u201cmotivational problems\u201d relating to either the investigation or the Report. <em>Ellis, </em>745 F.2d at 300-01 (determining that court should assess admissibility of investigatory report by examining timeliness of investigation, special skill or experience of officials, and possible motivation problems).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Mrs. Kennedy also emphasizes on appeal that the court should not have ruled sua sponte on the admissibility of the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion. She argues that, despite extensive briefing on the summary judgment issues, the defendants had never challenged the admissibility of the Report. As a result, Mrs. Kennedy relied on the Report\u2019s unchallenged and unassailed contents as being admissible in their entirety, and she contends that the Report was central to her opposition to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment request.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Although a trial court possesses broad discretion in addressing evidentiary issues in any pending case, the defendants bore the burden of proof on this issue, and they raised no \u201cnegative factors to indicate a lack of trustworthiness\u201d of the Report. <em>Zeus, </em>190 F.3d at 241; <em>see also Ellis, </em>745 F.2d at 301 (concluding that \u201cburden is on the party opposing admission to demonstrate that the report is not reliable\u201d and determining that this is so because \u201cit is far more equitable to place that burden on the party seeking to demonstrate why a time tested and carefully considered presumption is not appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In these circumstances, the district court erred, as a matter of law, in failing to accord a presumption of admissibility to the conclusions of the MSHA Report. It also erred in failing to apply the various factors recognized by our precedent for assessing the reliability of such a report, and in presumably placing the burden on Mrs. Kennedy to establish that the Report\u2019s conclusions were admissible \u2014 rather than on the moving defendants to show they were inadmissible. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in excluding the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion from its summary judgment consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We thus reverse the court\u2019s ruling as to the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Finally, Mrs. Kennedy asserts that the district court erred in excluding her proffered expert, Dr. Thomas Butler. According to Mrs. Kennedy, the court abused its discretion when it excluded Dr. Butler\u2019s opinions, premised on its determination that Butler had failed to perform any independent testing, and relied solely on the MSHA Report. The defendants, in contrast, contend that Butler\u2019s qualifications were highly questionable and that he based his opinion on a single line in the MSHA report\u2019s \u201cOverview.\u201d After acknowledging that Dr. Butler had opined that the accident was caused by accumulated debris in a tram control lever socket, the court determined that \u201cDr. Butler\u2019s deposition, part of the summary judgment record, clearly shows that this opinion is mere supposition on his part, based primarily on his reading of the report of the investigation of the accident by [MSHA].\u201d Opinion 6. Because \u201cDr. Butler did no testing nor performed any calculations regarding the accident and admitted that there could be alternative explanations for the accident that were beyond his expertise,\u201d the court excluded Dr. Butler\u2019s testimony \u201con this point.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">We review a district court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony for abuse of discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and we do \u201cnot overturn <em>Daub&amp;rt </em>evidentiary rulings with respect to relevance and reliability absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Bryte v. Am. Household, Inc., </em>429 F.3d 469, 475 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Daubert v. Meirell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)). A district court is afforded \u201cconsiderable leeway in deciding in a particular case how to go about determining whether particular expert testimony is reliable.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). The rules of evidence provide that \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 702. And, as the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Dr. Butler\u2019s report indicates that he was \u201casked to review the available documents and other materials and to determine, if possible, the cause of the accident.\u201d J.A. 795. The documents and materials that Dr. Butler reviewed in the preparation of his report included: the complaint, answer, and certain other pleadings; photographs and videotapes of the scene of the accident; the DMME report, the MSHA Report and data; audio cassettes of interviews with those who witnessed relevant events on October 22, 2003; documents produced by Joy; and deposition testimony. Although Dr. Butler\u2019s report provides a helpful summary of the deposition testimony, the MSHA Report, and the documents produced by Joy, it does not do so with any specific scientific gloss or expertise. Furthermore, most of the conclusions of his report were apparently adopted from the MSHA Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho Tire, </em>read together, mandate the trial courts to serve as gatekeepers on expert evidence, and to \u201censure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>see also Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167. In this case, Dr. Butler\u2019s report does not demonstrate any particular scientific expertise that can be assessed for reliability or that would ultimately assist the finder of fact. The Report merely summarizes the evidence of record, without providing any specialized analysis to support its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In according the district court the deference to which its challenged ruling is entitled, we are therefore unable to disturb its exclusion of Dr. Butler\u2019s opinions. We thus affirm that aspect of this appeal, but authorize the court to revisit it on remand if it sees fit so to do \u2014 -in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on the expert witness, reverse its ruling on the MSHA Report, vacate the summary judgment award, and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">.

The Report also related that the MSHA investigation team had learned of a subsequent incident that occurred six months after Mr. Kennedy\u2019s fatal accident.

The district court raised the issue of admissibility of the MSHA Report at the motions hearing, asking Mrs. Kennedy's counsel, \"does the plaintiff contend that the MSHA report, including its finding that you read to me, is admissible?\u201d J.A. 1232. After Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s counsel responded in the affirmative, the court asked the defendants for their position. Not having previously raised an issue concerning the admissibility of the Report, the defendants simply responded that, if the court intended to admit the conclusions of the MSHA Report, they must meet evidentiary standards of reliability. From this record, it is clear that the defendants had not contemplated the possibility that the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusions might be deemed inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\">.

On appeal, the defendants now seek to raise issues on the trustworthiness of the MSHA Report. Specifically, they contend that the Report was \"rife with contradictions.\u201d Br. of Appellees 46. Their contention in this regard is premised on the fact that portions of the Report conclude that a stuck switch could have caused the accident, whereas other portions are more certain of this result. The defendants now argue that the Report is unreliable because it does not indicate whether the investigators were quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>fied or whether they ruled out operator error as a possible cause, and because the Report conflicts with the DMME's conclusion. The defendants, of course, should have presented these contentions in the district court, rather than in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">.

In light of our disposition of the MSHA Report issue, we need not address Mrs. Kennedy's contention that the district court erroneously awarded summary judgment to the defendants after weighing the evidence on causation and determining that it was \u201cequally strong\u201d on both sides. Opinion 5. On remand, the evidence of causation should be revisited and include the MSHA Report\u2019s conclusion. We note, however, our concern with the apparent consideration of material initially presented by Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s withdrawn expert witness, and observe that she is entitled to have her evidence viewed in the proper light. <em>See, e.g., Charbonnages de France v.
