To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-21\">The IJ properly denied Singh\u2019s motion to reopen where Singh did not demonstrate that he exercised diligence in discovering his prior counsel\u2019s errors. <em>See id. </em>at 897 (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who establishes deception, fraud, or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review Singh\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated because he failed to raise his contention before the BIA and accordingly, did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review procedural due process claims not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
