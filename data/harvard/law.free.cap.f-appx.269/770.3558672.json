We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen was numerically barred, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (permitting one motion to reopen to be filed), where Petitioners failed to demonstrate materially changed circumstances in Indonesia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the numerical limitations, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945 (requiring circumstances to \u201chave changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s order is \u201ccursory\u201d is unavailing because the order reflects that the BIA considered the evidence presented and states the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying the motion. <em>See Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 983-984 (9th Cir.2005) (recognizing that the BIA must show consideration of all factors and articulate its reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
