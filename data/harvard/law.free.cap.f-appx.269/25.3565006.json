Kaplan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">Petitioner National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) filed a petition, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Section 160(e), in this Court on September 15, 2006 seeking enforcement of its May 31, 2006 Decision and Order (\u201cthe Order\u201d) finding that Respondent CNP Mechanical, Inc. (\u201cCNP\u201d) had violated provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. Section 151 <em>et seq. </em>CNP timely filed objections to the enforcement of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">CNP, a plumbing contractor based in Hilton, New York, is managed and owned by Charles Natalello. Allegations that CNP had violated provisions of the Act were filed with the NLRB in 2002 by Local 13 of the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (\u201cLocal 13\u201d), which had been attempting to organize CNP\u2019s workforce for a number of years. At all relevant times, Local 13\u2019s \u201cbusiness representative\u201d \u2014 the official who leads its organizing efforts \u2014 has been James Caternolo.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">In the first half of 2002, Local 13 attempted to organize CNP by sending several of its members to apply for employment with the company. Local 13 alleged before the NLRB that eleven of its members, including Caternolo himself, were denied employment at CNP in the first three weeks of April 2002, and that three months later CNP discharged two employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>were union members because of their organizing efforts at a CNP job site. Local 13 also alleged that Natalello and his administrative assistant, Lisa Legler, took a number of actions indicative of CNP\u2019s desire to maintain an open shop. In its answer to Local 13\u2019s complaint, CNP countered that, at all relevant times, it \u201chad no need to supplement its work force and was not hiring new employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">A three-day hearing on Local 13\u2019s allegations was conducted on February 3-5, 2003 by Administrative Law Judge Margaret M. Kern. In her Decision, dated June 24, 2004, ALJ Kern found in favor of Local 13 on all of its allegations, save for the firing of one of the two union members. That is, ALJ Kern found that CNP had violated the Act by: (1) making statements indicative of a company policy to refuse to hire union members; (2) making threats of discharge to CNP employees for actions relating to Local 13\u2019s organizing efforts; (3) failing to hire the eleven union member applicants at a time when it had hired nonunion applicants; and (4) firing one employee who was a union member for engaging in organizing efforts protected under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">It is particularly relevant to the instant appeal that ALJ Kern recognized that her judgment rested upon \u201cmajor credibility issues\u201d regarding the testimony of witnesses for CNP and Local 13. She found Local 13\u2019s witnesses to be credible based upon their demeanor and their consistent testimony throughout the proceedings. By contrast, she evaluated Natalello\u2019s credibility in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">... I found Natalello to be a generally incredible witness. He is possessed of an undisguised dislike for the union and for what he perceives as Caternolo\u2019s interference with his attempts to obtain jobs. His bias was manifestly obvious during his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">As a remedy, ALJ Kern ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>that CNP cease and desist from all further illegal acts taken against Local 13\u2019s efforts to unionize the firm and that employment be offered to those union members named in the complaint whom CNP had refused to hire. A three-member appellate panel adopted ALJ Kern\u2019s findings in all respects, but modified the relief granted by her such that CNP was directed to offer employment to only three of the eleven union members who had been denied employment. Further, the panel stated that it had \u201ccarefully examined the record and found no basis for reversing the findings.\u201d One member, however, declared that he would \u201cnot rely on the judge\u2019s reference to CNP President Natalello\u2019s \u2018undisguised dislike for the Union\u2019 and for Union Organizer Caternolo as a basis for discrediting Natalillo, but [found] the judge\u2019s credibility resolutions supportable on the record as a whole.\u201d CNP now urges us to reject the petition for enforcement for essentially four reasons, none of which we find persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">1. Natalello\u2019s Credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u201cWhen the Board\u2019s findings are based on the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses, they will not be overturned unless the testimony is hopelessly incredible or the findings flatly contradict either the law of nature or the undisputed documentary testimony.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Thalbo Corp., </em>171 F.3d 102, 112 (2d Cir.1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). CNP nevertheless argues that ALJ Kern erred in her determination that Natalello was \u201ca generally incredible witness.\u201d In CNP\u2019s view, ALJ Kern \u201cfound CNP\u2019s president \u2018generally incredible\u2019 <em>solely </em>because of his \u2018undisguised dislike for the union and for what he perceives as [the union organizer\u2019s] interference with his attempts to obtain jobs.\u2019 \u201d But, CNP asserts, \u201cit is simply illogical to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>a person is \u2018generally incredible\u2019 solely because he dislikes a particular union or even unions in general.\u201d What CNP appears to mean by illogic is that, as stated in its objections to the enforcement of the Order, \u201cfindings concerning employer witness credibility ... based solely upon expressions of opinion concerning \u2018the union\u2019 or its leadership, were made in disregard and/or in violation of 29 U.S.C. Section 158(c) and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">CNP is correct that \u201c \u2018an employer\u2019s free speech right to communicate his views to his employees is firmly established and cannot be infringed by \u00e1 union or by the Board.\u2019 Section 8(a)(1) [of the Act] leaves an employer ... free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not contain a threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d <em>Kinney Drugs, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>74 F.3d 1419, 1427-28 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 617-18, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969)). An employer\u2019s opinions about a union organizing drive are therefore protected to the extent that they are not couched within \u201cthreats of discharge in retaliation for union activity, grants or promises to grant benefits to discourage employee support for a union, ... [or] coercive interrogations of employees concerning their union activity....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1427 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, in the case upon which CNP primarily relies, this Court found that unadorned management statements to the effect that it wished that its employees would not select a particular union to represent them could not serve as the basis for \u201ca finding of unlawful, anti-union animus\u201d because this would \u201cviolat[e] the congressional command that noneoereive expressions of views, argument, or opinion shall not be \u2018evidence of an unfair labor practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holo-Krome Co. v. NLRB, </em>907 F.2d 1343, 1346 (2d Cir.1990) (quoting-29 U.S.C. Section 159(c)). CNP rightly admits, however, that <em>Holo-Krome </em>had nothing to do with a credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The problem for CNP is that it points to no specific protected statement of Natalello\u2019s upon which ALJ Kern relied as a basis for her findings that CNP had engaged in violations of the Act. <em>Compare Kinney Drugs, Inc., </em>74 F.3d at 1429 (NLRB could not base finding that Act was violated upon employer statements regarding \u201cwhat it believes will be the likely economic consequences of unionization\u201d because employer \u201chad the right\u201d to make such assessments). There is a simple explanation for this: ALJ Kern did not find any violations of the Act based upon Natalello\u2019s general anti-union comments. She found violations based upon the credible testimony of numerous witnesses who attributed multiple statements to Natalello that clearly constituted threats of reprisal for protected activity or had a tendency to interfere with employees\u2019 exercise of their rights. 29 U.S.C. Section 158(a). ALJ Kern was entitled to credit this testimony, as against Natalello\u2019s denials, because it \u201cwas not \u2018hopelessly incredible\u2019 and did not contradict either the \u2018law of nature\u2019 or the documentary evidence.\u201d <em>Thalbo Corp., </em>171 F.3d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">At most, Natalello\u2019s general anti-union animus was a factor in ALJ\u2019s finding that he was an incredible witness. While general anti-union sentiment may not be the basis for finding a violation of the Act, there is nothing improper in considering such sentiment in determining credibility. Indeed, a case upon which CNP heavily relies confirms that evidence of an employer\u2019s attitude towards unions \u201cis often\u201d material in judging credibility. <em>NLRB v. Colvert Dairy Prods. Co., </em>317 F.2d 44, 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(10th Cir.1963); <em>see also Darlington Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, </em>397 F.2d 760, 769 (4th Cir. 1968) (permitting the \u201cuse of protected statements to draw the background of the controversy and place other nonverbal acts in proper perspective\u201d); <em>I\u2019ntl Union, United Auto., Aerospace and Agr. Implement Workers of America, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>363 F.2d 702, 707 (D.C.Cir.1966) (permitting protected statement to be considered in placing the acts in context, including credibility of witness). Therefore, we find the ALJ\u2019s credibility decision firmly rooted in the record and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">2. Legler as CNP\u2019s Agent. It is undisputed that the record contains numerous statements attributed to Legler that are indicative of CNP\u2019s desire to thwart any effort by Local 13 to organize the firm\u2019s workforce. CNP argues, however, that \u201cthey could not be attributed to CNP since she was not shown to have been an agent of the employer.\u201d We disagree. Whether Legler was acting as CNP\u2019s agent depends upon whether \u201cunder all the circumstances\u201d a prospective employee \u201cwould reasonably believe that [Legler] was speaking for management and reflecting company policy.\u201d <em>Blaylock Elec. v. NLRB, </em>121 F.3d 1230, 1234 (9th Cir.1997). The testimony here established that Legler answered the phone, responded to job inquiries, told the union applicants that no jobs were open, and noted on a message to Natalello that an applicant was \u201cnot union!\u201d Agency has been found in similar circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 1234 (finding agency where employee \u201cresponded to inquiries about job openings, [and] made a statement indicating that, had she known that these applicants were union supporters, she would have told them that [the employer] was not accepting applications\u201d); <em>Greg Murrieta d/b/a GM Electrics, </em>323 NLRB 125, 125-26 (1997) (finding apparent authority where secretary was assigned to distribute and collect job applications, and would talk to prospective employees and relate company\u2019s hiring needs); <em>Diehl Equipment Co., </em>297 NLRB 504, 504 n. 2 (1989) (secretary had apparent authority where her job \u201croutinely involved\u201d distributing and receiving job applications, as well as answering inquiries regarding applications). Accordingly, we conclude that ALJ Kern\u2019s finding that Legler\u2019s statements could be attributed to CNP was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">3. The Testimony of McDermott and Battaglia. CNP contends that ALJ Kern erred by engaging in a \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d of the testimony of two of its supervisory employees, Andy McDermott and Paul Battaglia. It fails, however, to cite any specific testimony of these two witnesses which serves to refute any of ALJ Kern\u2019s findings. Our review of them testimony leads us to conclude that they had nothing of consequence to say beyond them uncontradicted assertions that they had no authority to make decisions regarding hiring or firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">4. Sufficiency of Evidence. The NLRB\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence standard. 29 U.S.C. Section 160(e); <em>see also NLRB v. Yonkers Associates, 94 L.P., </em>416 F.3d 119, 121-22 (2d Cir.2005). We may not set aside these findings unless we are \u201cleft with the impression that no rational trier of fact could reach the conclusion drawn by the Board.\u201d <em>NLRB v. G&amp;T Terminal Packaging Co., Inc., </em>246 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). We have reviewed CNP\u2019s various claims that the evidence before ALJ Kern was not sufficient to support her conclusions, and we find them to be without merit under this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>For the reasons stated above, the petition of the National Labor Relations Board is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
