Because Schoonover has failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny her request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Schoonover was convicted in 2003 of first-degree child abuse murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) affirmed Schoonover\u2019s conviction and sentence on September 8, 2004. There is no indication in the record that Schoonover sought certiorari review with the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">On September 30, 2005, Schoonover filed an application for state post-conviction relief. The state trial court denied the application on November 9, 2005, and a journal entry memorializing that denial was filed on December 2, 2005. On January 3, 2006, Schoonover\u2019s husband attempted to appeal the state trial court\u2019s ruling by filing with the OCCA on Schoonover\u2019s behalf a pleading entitled \u201cPetition in Error/Brief in Support.\u201d On April 10, 2006, the OCCA dismissed the pleading on the grounds that it \u201cha[d] not been signed and filed by\u201d Schoonover \u201cor by a licensed attorney on her behalf,\u201d as required by the OCCA\u2019s rules. ROA, Doc. 8, Exh. 2 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">On May 22, 2006, Schoonover, again represented by her husband, filed an application for writ of mandamus with the Oklahoma Supreme Court (OSC). The OSC denied the application on June 12, 2006. Although Schoonover sought reconsideration of the denial, the OSC denied that request on June 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">On July 3, 2006, Schoonover and her husband jointly filed with the state trial court a pleading entitled \u201cMotion to Exhume the Truth.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. 4. In essence that pleading sought exhumation of the body of Schoonover\u2019s deceased son in order to support Schoonover\u2019s claim that she was wrongfully convicted of his murder. The state trial court denied the motion via minute order on October 25, 2006. <em>Id., </em>Exh. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-18\">On May 14, 2007, Schoonover filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 asserting approximately thirteen grounds for relief. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>moved to dismiss Schoonover\u2019s petition, arguing that she \u201cfailed to file her petition within the one-year statute of limitations\u201d provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). <em>Id., </em>Doc. 8 at 1. On November 5, 2007, the district court granted respondent\u2019s motion and dismissed Schoonover\u2019s petition as time-barred. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 12. In doing so, the district court reached the following conclusions regarding when the one-year limitations period began running and when it expired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">\u2022 Schoonover\u2019s conviction became final, and the one-year limitations period for filing a federal habeas petition began running, on December 7, 2004, after the ninety-day time period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court had lapsed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">\u2022 Schoonover\u2019s application for state post-conviction relief was filed sixty-eight days prior to the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u2022 because Schoonover\u2019s appeal from the denial of state post-conviction relief failed to comply with the OCCA\u2019s procedural rules, her appeal was not properly filed, and thus did not serve to toll the running of the limitations period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">\u2022 the limitations period began running thirty days after the state trial court denied post-conviction relief, or approximately January 2, 2006; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">\u2022 the one-year limitations period expired on or about March 13, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">In light of these conclusions, the district court found it unnecessary to determine whether Schoonover\u2019s writ of mandamus and \u201cMotion to Exhume the Truth\u201d should be considered post-conviction proceedings for tolling purposes. Lastly, the district court concluded that Schoonover was not entitled to equitable tolling because she had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that her inability to file her habeas petition within the one-year period was due to circumstances beyond her control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Schoonover subsequently filed a notice of intent to appeal and an application for COA. The district court denied her request for a COA. Schoonover has since renewed her request for a COA with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In other words, a state prisoner may appeal from the denial of federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(2). In order to make that showing, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the district court denied the \u201chabeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim,\u201d the prisoner must, in order to obtain a COA, demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">The district court in this case correctly outlined the controlling standards for assessing the timeliness of a federal habeas petition. As it noted, Congress has \u201cestablished a one-year period of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>for habeas petitions.\u201d <em>Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir.1998) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)). The one-year limitations period generally starts running from \u201cthe date on which the [state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year limitations period is, however, tolled by \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post conviction relief ... is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). Finally, the limitations period may also, in rare circumstances, \u201cbe subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Equitable tolling \u201cis only available when an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">After reviewing the record on appeal, we fully agree with the district court that Schoonover\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely filed, and we conclude that no reasonable jurist could find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. Although Schoonover takes issue with the district court\u2019s conclusion that her state post-conviction appeal was not properly filed, we find no merit to her arguments in this regard. Rule 1.6(B) of the Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals plainly provides that \u201c[o]nly pro se Appellants/Petitioners and licensed attorneys may sign and file pleadings with the Clerk of this Court.\u201d Because Schoonover\u2019s appeal was signed only by her husband, who is not a licensed attorney, the OCCA dismissed her appeal pursuant to Rule 1.6(B). Thus, Schoonover\u2019s appeal cannot be considered to have been \u201cproperly filed\u201d for purposes of tolling the one-year limitations period for filing a federal habeas petition. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 805 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that all \u201ccircuits agree that state procedural law should determine whether an application is \u2018properly filed\u2019 \u201d). Schoonover also takes issue with the district court\u2019s conclusion that she was not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. But again, based on our review of the record, we find no flaws in the district court\u2019s reasoning. In sum, the record firmly establishes that responsibility for the failure to timely file the federal habeas petition rests on Schoonover\u2019s shoulders, and was not due to circumstances beyond her control.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Accordingly, the request for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
