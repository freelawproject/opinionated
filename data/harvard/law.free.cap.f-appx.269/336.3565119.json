In a prior opinion, we concluded that McGee\u2019s claim was barred by our decision in <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio cannot be the basis of a variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). However, subsequent to our decision, the Supreme Court issued <em>Kimbrough, v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which abrogated <em>Eura </em>and held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve [18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2007) ]\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">McGee has filed a petition for rehearing, raising <em>Kimbrough. </em>We grant the petition and dispense with further briefing and argument. To give the district court an opportunity to reconsider McGee\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we vacate McGee\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. The parties\u2019 joint motion to remand is denied as moot. We express no opinion on the appropriateness of a variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
