We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">Gonsalez-Reyes contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court placed undue emphasis on the nature and circumstance of his offense and failed to adequately consider other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to avoid sentencing disparities under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The record, however, shows that the district court considered and properly applied the factors in imposing a below-the-Guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (a)(2); <em>United States v. Knows His Gun, </em>438 F.3d 913, 918 (9th Cir.2006) (noting that the requirement to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cdoes not necessitate a specific articulation of each factor separately, but rather a showing that the district court considered the statutorily-designated factors in imposing a sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Gonsalez-Reyes also contends that the district court failed to consider his lack of a prior criminal history. We disagree. The district specifically discussed and commended Gonsalez-Reyes for his lack of a prior criminal history. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Gonsalez-Reyes further contends that the district court did not adequately explain the reasons for the sentence. This is belied by the record. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
