To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Membreno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">The BIA properly concluded that Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen, filed nearly two years after the BIA issued its final order, was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2002) (recognizing that motions to reopen to adjust status must be filed no later than ninety days after the BIA issues its final decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">Furthermore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Kaur failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-18\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Kaur\u2019s contention that the immigration judge did not advise Kaur of the relief available to her because she failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (recognizing that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b807-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
