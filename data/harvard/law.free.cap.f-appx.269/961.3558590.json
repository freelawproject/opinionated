Nicholson, </em>04-1693, 2005 WL 3591005 (Dec. 22, 2005). Joseph R. Wineman has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">The Secretary appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, challenging that court\u2019s ruling that the Secretary had the burden of establishing that a 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) notification error was not prejudicial. In <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), this court held that any section 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891. Under these circumstances, summary affirmance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b989-21\">(1) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The ease is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-22\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
