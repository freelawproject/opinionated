He entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor and remained here after his visa expired. After he was served with a Notice to Appear, Kwee admitted removability and requested relief in the form of asylum, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>holding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Following a hearing, Immigration Judge (IJ) Charles M. Honeyman denied Kwee\u2019s requests for relief, finding his asylum claim time-barred and that Kwee had failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Chinese ethnicity or his Catholic faith. The IJ also found that Kwee failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On appeal, the BIA adopted and affirmed the findings of the IJ in a <em>-per curiam </em>opinion. Kwee then filed a motion to reconsider in which he submitted the Department of State\u2019s recently-released 2005 country condition reports for Indonesia. The BIA denied the motion and Kwee timely appealed the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal and its denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the findings of the IJ with additional comment, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>He Chun Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir. 2004). We must uphold findings of fact \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider under an abuse of discretion standard, under which the denial is reversed only if arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">We first consider Kwee\u2019s withholding of removal claim, which requires an applicant to demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d that, upon removal, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Kwee argues that he faces a clear probability of future persecution because there exists a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution\u201d of similarly situated individuals in Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(i). In support of this claim, Kwee submitted the Department of State\u2019s 2003 and 2004 country condition reports for Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">In denying Kwee\u2019s \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim, the IJ initially noted that we rejected an analogous claim based upon the Department of State\u2019s 1999 country condition reports for Indonesia in <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530 (3d Cir.2005). The IJ then found that there was nothing in the more recent reports submitted by Kwee that would change that conclusion. Indeed, we note that the 2003 and 2004 reports suggest that the treatment of Chinese Christians in Indonesia has improved since 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Athough Kwee also argues that anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence in Indonesia is cyclical in nature \u2014 suggesting that \u201cviolence and large-scale riots have occurred every decade since the 1940\u2019s\u201d and that \u201cit is more likely than not that another explosion will occur soon\u201d \u2014 such speculative arguments cannot form the basis of a viable pattern or practice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>As substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Kwee did not establish a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution,\u201d we conclude that the IJ did not err in denying Kwee\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">After the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of his requests for relief, Kwee filed a motion for reconsideration upon release of the 2005 country condition reports. But Kwee states in his motion that the 2005 reports \u201cprovide an almost identical assessment as the 2004 reports.\u201d Because the 2005 reports shed no new light on Kwee\u2019s pattern or practice claim, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kwee\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Kwee\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\">. For example, die 2004 report notes that \"[i]nstances of discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese Indonesians declined compared with previous years.\u201d Moreover, the 2002 report indicates that attacks on churches \"were much less frequent than in previous years\u201d and that in areas of historical tension between Muslims and Christians \u201d[t]he number of serious abuses ... declined sharply from the previous year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
