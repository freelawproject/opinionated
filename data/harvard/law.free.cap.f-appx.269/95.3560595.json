Nelson denying Siswoyo\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Winoto Siswoyo, </em>No. A98 690 726 (B.I.A. Apr. 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 690 726 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 20, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As an initial matter, because Siswoyo failed to exhaust his challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for relief under the CAT, we are without jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Be<em>harry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir.2003)). We dismiss the petition for review to that extent and review only Siswoyo\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, although the IJ made an adverse credibility determination, the BIA did not address that finding, apparently assuming Siswoyo\u2019s credibility for purposes of its analysis. Thus we too assume, without determining, Siswoyo\u2019s credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). We will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Throughout his proceedings, Siswoyo has claimed that he is eligible for relief because he has shown \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d of persecution against Chinese Christians in Indonesia and proven that he is a member of this group. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). The agency never addressed Siswoyo\u2019s pattern or practice argument, save for its inconclusive reference to the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of AM-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737 (B.I.A.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>we considered a similar case in which the agency ignored the petitioner\u2019s argument that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against Christians in Indonesia. 508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007). We concluded that the BIA\u2019s failure to address the petitioner\u2019s pattern or practice claim was error requiring remand. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. Here, as in <em>Mufied, </em>we find that <em>Matter of A-M-</em>does not provide sufficient guidance for this Court to evaluate a pattern or practice claim. Thus, in light of <em>Mufied </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cordinary remand rule,\u201d <em>see Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006), we grant the petition for review to the extent that it challenges the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal, and remand to the agency so that it may consider Siswoyo\u2019s pattern or practice argument in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and GRANTED, in part. The decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
