We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-22\">Roberts contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006) (stating that we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness). Procedurally, Roberts argues that the district court erred by failing to consider adequately each of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by placing too much emphasis on general deterrence. The record shows, however, that the district judge did consider each of the relevant factors, and the weight it gave to deterrence of similar crimes was well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>within its discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 30 (\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d 145, 158 (2d Cir.2006) (stating that \u201cthe weight to be given any \u00a7 3553(a) faetor[ ] is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Substantively, Roberts argues that the district court unreasonably sentenced him to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence was at the bottom of the Guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Giving due respect to the district court\u2019s reasoned judgment, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-96, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was an abuse of discretion given the seriousness of Roberts\u2019 crime and the need to afford adequate deterrence to similar conduct, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
