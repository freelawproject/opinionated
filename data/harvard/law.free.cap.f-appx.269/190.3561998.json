Appellants argue that the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred by refusing to consolidate their petitions and by determining that they did not meet the standard for withholding. We will deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Torres and Motta are Colombian natives. They are HIV-positive gay men who entered the United States on 1-94 visas in 1999. Although they registered as partners under the New Jersey Domestic Partnership Act of 2003, neither man applied for asylum. In separate oral opinions dated August 8, 2005, the IJ denied their petitions for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture protection. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decisions in identical per curiam opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Because the BIA not only adopted the IJ\u2019s decisions but also expanded upon them, our review encompasses both decisions. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Appellants first argue that, because they are a \u201cfamily unit,\u201d the IJ erred in refusing to consolidate their petitions. An IJ may consolidate the cases of different petitioners to promote administrative efficiency as long as hearing the cases together does not deny the petitioners the right to fully litigate their claims. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.1(a)(iv); <em>Matter of Taerghodsi, </em>16 I &amp; N Dec. 260, 262-63 (BIA 1977). Typically, consolidation is used where a family member claims derivative asylum status through another family member, or where two petitions rely on the same events. <em>See, e.g., Segura v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>240 Fed. Appx. 347, 348-49 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Jabba v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>195 Fed.Appx. 883, 884 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006). Consolidation is not required, however, and is generally disfavored because of its potential to deprive petitioners of procedural due process rights. <em>See United States v. Barraza-Leon, </em>575 F.2d 218, 220 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Taerghodsi, </em>16 I &amp; N Dec. at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">In the case at bar, the IJ did not abuse her discretion when she decided to hear Appellants\u2019 petitions separately. First, even if Appellants constitute a \u201cfamily unit,\u201d there is no derivative status for family members under the withholding of removal statute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 780, 782 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005). Second, Appellants\u2019 petitions do not rely exclusively on the same incidents of alleged persecution. Finally, Appellants were not prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s refusal to consolidate because that did not prevent Torres or Motta from testifying at each other\u2019s hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-17\">Appellants next argue that the agency\u2019s denials of their petitions were not supported by substantial evidence as required by <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). Appellants were obligated to show that it was more likely than not that their \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d upon them return to Colombia \u201cbecause of their race, religion, nationality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b); <em>Amanfi v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 719, 725 (3d Cir.2003). The threat of persecution must be \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cdoes not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We assume without deciding that Appellants are members of a particular social group. <em>See Amanfi, </em>328 F.3d at 730; <em>Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 819, 822 (BIA 1990). Nevertheless, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Appellants failed to carry their burden of demonstrating a clear probability that they would be persecuted in Colombia. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Torres testified that he was fired from a job because a secretary discovered his relationship with Motta. Motta testified that he was arrested and briefly detained during a police raid on a discotheque. Although these incidents are evidence that Torres and Motta were harassed and discriminated against, they do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Fatin, </em>12 F.3d at 1240; <em>Ahmed, v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 214, 218 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Kibinda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>477 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Nor does the documentary evidence in the record compel the conclusion that Appellants face a clear probability of future persecution, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2), because it shows increasing tolerance of homosexuals in Colombia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Appellants are not entitled to withholding of removal. For the foregoing reasons, Appellants\u2019 petitions for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-20\">.
