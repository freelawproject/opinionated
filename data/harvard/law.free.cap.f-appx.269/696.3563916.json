To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">In his opening brief, Yuan fails to address, and thereby waives any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s grounds for denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Yuan\u2019s appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision to deny asylum and withholding of removal because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Membreno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
