We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), and the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mohamed\u2019s motion to reconsider, because the motion did not identify an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior order dismissing Mohamed\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mohamed\u2019s motion to remand for consideration of his new asylum application, based on his fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia, because Mohamed failed to explain why this claim could not have been presented at his previous hearing before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>Lainez-Ortiz v. I.N.S., </em>96 F.3d 393, 396 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
