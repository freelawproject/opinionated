We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-23\">Contrary to Mendoza-Segundo\u2019s contention, his participation in alien smuggling renders him inadmissible as an applicant for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1255(a)(2) (alien may adjust status only if admissible); 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae (\u201cAny alien who at any time knowingly ... assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible\u201d). He is not eligible for a waiver because the persons he assisted were not his \u201cspouse, parent, son, or daughter.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(ii). Moreover, the waiver provision of Immigration and Nationality Act section 212(h) is not applicable to him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-24\">Mendoza-Segundo\u2019s contention that the BIA issued an improperly cursory order is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b772-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
