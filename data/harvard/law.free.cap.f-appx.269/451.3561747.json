Aside from eonclusional allegations that his complaint was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Charter, and Article VI of the United States Constitution, Ruiz does not address the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claims and personal jurisdiction over the defendants. Ruiz\u2019s attempt to incorporate by reference the arguments set forth in his notice of appeal is an insufficient means of raising those arguments in this court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, Ruiz has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint by failing to raise the issues in his brief. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Ruiz\u2019s motions for a temporary restraining order (stay of deportation), a transfer or relocation to another facility, a picture of the district court judge, and newspaper reports concerning the appellants are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
