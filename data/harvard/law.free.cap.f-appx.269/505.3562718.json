He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in departing upward to a term of 192 months. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We review upward departures for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir.2005). A sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to make an upward departure when its reasons for doing so (1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); and (2) are justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Zunigar-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 918, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). The Guidelines expressly authorize a district court to depart upward based on a finding that the criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal past or the likelihood that he will commit other crimes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Perry argues that the district court erred because the court relied upon improper prior offenses to support its conclusion that his criminal history score was not appropriately representative of his \u201ctrue criminality.\u201d Perry argues that the offenses and charges considered were either too old, were dismissed when he pleaded guilty to other charges, were dismissed for lack of evidence, were based on arrests which were never prosecuted, or were non-significant misdemeanor offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Perry raised mostly generalized objections to the upward departure before the district court, and did not specifically argue several of the claims he makes here. For these claims, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005). For the claims Perry actually preserved with objections, we examine whether error occurred and, if so, whether that error was harmless. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). For reasons explained below, we need not specify which standard applies to each of Perry\u2019s individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The district court explained its decision to make the upward departure by noting at the sentencing hearing the following considerations, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">[Perry\u2019s] likelihood of recidivism is not sufficiently addressed by placement in a Criminal-History Category [V]. The defendant has been sent to state prison, the county jail, fined and been on probation and parole. To date none of these sanctions have had any meaningful impact on deterring him from a dedicated and very motivated criminal lifestyle. And it is, therefore, remarkably unlikely that he will be deterred in the future without a more serious punishment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">The district court then calculated Perry\u2019s sentence based upon a criminal history category of VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">A finding that a criminal history category does not sufficiently account for the likelihood of recidivism is by itself an appropriate basis for a departure. <em>See United States v. McDowell, </em>109 F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>Background Note to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (noting that the Guideline-produced criminal history score may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>not accurately reflect risk of recidivism in defendants who may have received more lenient treatment for past offenses due to youth). Further, our review of the record finds the district court\u2019s decision to be justified. For example, Perry was given deferred adjudication for a prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Upon violating the conditions of his supervision, he received a ten-year suspended sentence and was placed in an alternative incarceration program. He again violated his probation terms and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We need not evaluate Perry\u2019s claim that the district court improperly relied on other conduct described in the presentence report to conclude that Perry\u2019s score did not represent his \u201ctrue criminality.\u201d Even if Perry is correct, his sentence will be upheld because the district court\u2019s recidivism-based enhancement is proper. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 438 (5th Cir.2006) (mistaken application of Guidelines does not require remand where it is not reasonably probable that the defendant would have received a lesser sentence on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In sum, the record supports the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
