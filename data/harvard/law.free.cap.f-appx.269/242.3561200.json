The district court sentenced Gadson to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment for the armed bank robbery conviction and to the statutory minimum of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutive to any other term of imprisonment, for the firearm conviction. Gadson noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-22\">On appeal, counsel filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Nevertheless, he raises the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in finding Gadson was competent to face the charges against him; (2) whether the district court erred in accepting Gadson\u2019s guilty plea; (3) whether Gadson\u2019s sentence is reasonable; and (4) whether Gadson received ineffective assistance of counsel. Gadson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">Counsel first questions the district court\u2019s determination that Gadson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>competent to face the charges against him. After receiving Gadson\u2019s mental health evaluation and the psychologist\u2019s recommendation that Gadson was competent, the district court further questioned Gadson. Based on this information, it determined Gadson was competent to face the charges against him. We find no clear error in this ruling. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 856 (4th Cir.2005) (stating standard of review and providing standard for competency determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Counsel further questions the validity of Gadson\u2019s guilty plea. Because Gadson did not move in the district court to withdraw his plea, this court reviews the challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Prior to accepting a guilty plea, the trial court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him, the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences, and other various rights, so it is clear that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily entering his plea. The court must also determine whether there is a factual basis for the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1), (3); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 120 (4th Cir. 1991). Counsel does not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiry, and our review of the plea hearing transcript reveals that the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy that assured Gadson\u2019s plea was made both knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Counsel also raises the issue of the reasonableness of Gadson\u2019s sentence. We will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review focuses on whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). A sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. <em>Id. </em>An error of law or fact can render a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) . We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). Assuming the sentence contains no significant procedural errors, we may presume a sentence falling within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 472-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">When sentencing a defendant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the Guideline range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of the arguments presented by the parties; (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) . The sentencing court may not presume that the applicable Guidelines range is reasonable, but should explain any deviation from that range, providing correspondingly stronger justification in relation to the degree of variance from the Guidelines range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553 or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). One reason that a sentence within an advisory range may be presumed to be reasonable is that the most salient \u00a7 3553(a) factors are already incorporated into the Guideline determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 342-43; <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cwhere judge and Commission <em>both </em>determine that\u201d a Guideline sentence is appropriate, \u201cthat sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). A district court\u2019s consideration of pertinent factors may also be implicit in its ultimate ruling. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as to the defendant and the potentially meritorious arguments raised by the parties at sentencing. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. \u201cCircumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the judge has found that the case before him is typical.\u201d M</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Our review of the record reveals no procedural errors in the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range and its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Gadson\u2019s 188-month sentence for the armed robbery conviction is at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum. Gadson\u2019s sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment for his \u00a7 924(c) conviction is the mandatory minimum statutory sentence because Gad-son had previously been convicted under that statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i). Therefore, under the standard articulated above, we find that his sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Lastly, counsel questions whether Gad-son received effective assistance of counsel during the proceedings in district court. Claims of ineffective assistance are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes it. <em>United. States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the record does not conclusively establish that Gadson received ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-15\">. <em>Anders v.
