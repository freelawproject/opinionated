To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 894. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Galvez De Ramirez\u2019s motion to reopen because she failed to state any new facts or present any new evidence to demonstrate the requisite physical presence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Galvez De Ramirez contends the immigration judge (\u201cU\u201d) violated due process by not allowing her to clarify her entry date. However, Galvez De Ramirez made no showing that additional testimony may have affected the outcome of the proceedings where the record indicates that when she appealed the IJ\u2019s decision, she reiterated her August 1991 entry date. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Galvez De Ramirez\u2019s direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision denying cancellation of removal because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
