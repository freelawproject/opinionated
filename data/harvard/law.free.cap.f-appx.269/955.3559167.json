Nicholson, </em>No. 04-2461. Robert E. Thompson has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">In September of 2004, the Board of Veterans Appeals denied Thompson\u2019s claim for service connection for a heart condition and nervous condition and a total disability rating based on individual unemployability.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">Thompson appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cCAVC\u201d), arguing that the regional office did not comply with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) because it failed to inform him who would be responsible for obtaining additional evidence to substantiate his claim, and misled him regarding the time within which he was required to submit this evidence. The CAVC affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, concluding that under \u00a7 5103, the Board was not clearly erroneous in finding that the regional office provided Thompson with adequate notice in finding that the regional office properly informed him of the time within which to submit evidence. Thompson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-23\">The Secretary moves to summarily affirm the CAVC\u2019s decision, arguing that pursuant to <em>Garrison v. Nicholson, </em>494 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007), the CAVC correctly applied the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in concluding that the regional office complied with the notice provisions of \u00a7 5103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-24\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir.1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary affirmance is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-25\">In <em>Garrison, </em>the court affirmed the CAVC\u2019s application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review when reviewing the Board\u2019s finding that the Secretary had complied with his \u00a7 5103(a) notification requirements. <em>Gamson, </em>494 F.3d at 1370. In light of <em>Garrison, </em>it is clear that the CAVC\u2019s decision was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-26\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b983-27\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b983-28\">(1) The motion to summarily affirm is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-29\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
