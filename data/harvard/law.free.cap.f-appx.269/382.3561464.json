In its Unopposed Motion to Modify the Judgment and Dismiss the Appeal, the government concedes that the district court\u2019s sentence exceeds the maximum term of supervised release permitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). The government asks that we modify the district court judgment by reducing Bugg\u2019s supervised release term by one day and then dismiss Bugg\u2019s appeal; Bugg agrees that such a disposition would satisfactorily resolve his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Despite the parties\u2019 agreement, we are mindful that determining the proper sentence for a criminal defendant is a discretionary matter reserved to the district court. <em>See United States v. Levario-Quiroz, </em>161 F.3d 903, 908-09 (5th Cir.1998). Because the term of supervised release imposed in this case exceeds the statutory maximum, we VACATE Bugg\u2019s supervised release sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">In light of our decision to vacate and remand, the government\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Modify the Judgment and Dismiss the Appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
