Principi, </em>02-1087, 2004 WL 1575551 (July 7, 2004). Jerome F. Leavell has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-27\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any section 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>The Secretary concedes that the issue raised in this appeal is identical to the issue decided in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Simmons. </em>Under these circumstances, summary affirmance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">(2) The judgment of the CAVC is summarily affirmed.
