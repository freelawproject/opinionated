Craig appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of Craig\u2019s application for Supplemental Security Income. \u201cWe review the district court[\u2019]s decision <em>de novo </em>and therefore must independently determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision (1) is free of legal error and (2) is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The Commissioner\u2019s denial was based on the decision of an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who found that Craig\u2019s impairments \u2014 carpal-tunnel syndrome and back pain \u2014 were severe, but that they did not prevent her from working as a telemarketer. Craig argues that, in making those findings, the ALJ (1) deprived her of a fair hearing by \u201cforeclosing\u201d her testimony, (2) erroneously concluded that her subjective complaints of pain and the side effects of her medication were \u201conly partially credible,\u201d and (3) erroneously relied on the testimony of a vocational expert that conflicted with the <em>Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(\u201cSCO\u201d). We agree with the second contention and, consequently, need not address the others. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">In evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain, an ALJ must consider the factors listed in SSR 88-13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-15\">1. The nature, location, onset, duration, frequency, radiation, and intensity of any pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-16\">2. Precipitating and aggravating factors (e.g., movement, activity, environmental conditions);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-17\">3. Type, dosage, effectiveness, and adverse side-effects of any pain medication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-18\">4. Treatment, other than medication, for relief of pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-19\">5. Functional restrictions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-20\">6. The claimant\u2019s daily activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-21\"><em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1284. The ALJ may also consider \u201cunexplained or inadequately explained failure to seek treatment or to follow a prescribed course of treatment,\u201d as well as \u201cordinary techniques of credibility evaluation, such as the claimant\u2019s reputation for lying, prior inconsistent statements concerning the symptoms, and other testimony by the claimant that appears less than candid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, the claimant has produced objective medical evidence of an impairment or impairments that could reasonably be expected to produce some degree of particular symptoms, and there is no evidence of malingering, \u201cthe ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The ALJ assessed Craig\u2019s allegations of pain as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">The medical record does not support the claimant\u2019s assertions that she cannot work because of disabling pain and the side effects of her pain medication. No examining or treating source concluded that the claimant could not work. Indeed, Dr. Altman [a consulting examiner] concluded that the claimant could do work at the medium exertional level. Dr. Papa [a treating chiropractor], moreover, opined that she could not return to her fast food job because she could not lift 50 pounds, but that she could work elsewhere if given vocational rehabilitation.... The claimant notes that she treats herself with heating pads and hand braces.... She asserts that her pain medication makes her too drowsy to work, but this allegation is not mentioned in evidence. Indeed in her pain questionnaire, she stated that her pain medication produced no side effects .... She acknowledges that she drives, but she says that she cannot shop and clean her house.... In light of her conflicted statements and the absence of evidence supporting her allegations of disability, I find that the claimant [is] only partially credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We conclude that this assessment does not satisfy the <em>Smolen </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">First, the ALJ erred in relying on the lack of medical evidence regarding the severity of Craig\u2019s pain. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cOnce the claimant produces medical evidence of an underlying impairment, the Commissioner may not discredit the claimant\u2019s testimony as to the severity of symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective medical evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Second, the opinion evidence cited by the ALJ is not inconsistent with Craig\u2019s testimony. Dr. Altman\u2019s opinion, which was significantly more optimistic than those of the other physicians who examined Craig, was based on an examination that took place one day after Craig had received a round of palliative epidural injections. Dr. Papa\u2019s opinion was explicitly conditioned on Craig\u2019s obtaining vocational rehabilitation, which she never received because her claim for worker\u2019s compensation was denied. Moreover, elsewhere in her decision, the ALJ rejected Dr. Papa\u2019s opinion regarding Craig\u2019s ability to sit and stand, in part because chiropractors are not acceptable medical sources under the Commissioner\u2019s regulations; the ALJ offered no reason why Papa\u2019s opinion was persuasive in one regard, but not the other. Cf<em>., e.g., Robinson v. Barnhart, </em>366 F.3d 1078, 1083 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe ALJ is not entitled to pick and choose from a medical opinion, using only those parts that are favorable to a finding of nondisability.\u201d); Swi<em>tzer v. Heckler, </em>742 F.2d 382, 385-86 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]he Secretary\u2019s attempt to use only the portions [of a report] favorable to her position, while ignoring other parts, is improper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Finally, we disagree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Craig\u2019s testimony is internally inconsistent. Although Craig testified that she used heating pads and hand braces, there is no evidence regarding the efficacy of those treatments or whether their use would interfere with Craig\u2019s ability to perform work-related tasks. The record further reflects that Craig\u2019s driving is limited to a maximum of 30 minutes twice a week for doctor visits, and that Craig must sometimes rely on family members to drive her. Craig\u2019s failure to mention side effects on her pain questionnaire is easily explained by the fact that Craig began taking additional medications after completing the questionnaire; the ALJ made no attempt to evaluate the side effects of the new medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Overall, we find the ALJ\u2019s reasons for deeming Craig\u2019s testimony \u201conly partially credible\u201d unconvincing. We therefore remand for a reassessment of Craig\u2019s credibility; we do not remand solely for a calculation of benefits because the record does not convince us that the ALJ was required to accept Craig\u2019s assertion that pain and the side effects of her medication prevented her from doing any work at all. <em>Cf. Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1292 (\u201cIn the past, we have credited evidence and remanded for an award of benefits where (1) the ALJ has failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting such evidence, (2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made, and (3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Because the ALJ\u2019s faulty assessment of Craig\u2019s credibility requires remand, we need not address her remaining arguments. However, we call the Commissioner\u2019s attention to our recent observation that SSR 00-4p \u201cexplicitly requir[es] that the ALJ determine whether [a vocational] expert\u2019s testimony deviates from the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>[\u201cDOT\u201d] and whether there is a reasonable explanation for any deviation.\u201d <em>Massachi v. Astrue, </em>486 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, we trust that, on remand, the ALJ will afford Craig a full and fair opportunity to testify if she chooses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*****\">\n<p id=\"b739-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
