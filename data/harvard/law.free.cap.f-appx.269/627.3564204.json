(\u201cMHC\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the County of San Diego (\u201cCounty\u201d) and County Supervisor Dianne Jacob on a variety of grounds. In a concurrently filed opinion, we reverse in part the district court order granting defendants\u2019 motion to strike MHC\u2019s state tort law claims. <em>See Manufactured Home Communities, Inc., v. County of San Diego, </em>Nos. 05-56401 &amp; 05-56559, - F.3d. -, 2008 WL 600974 (filed March 6, 2008). The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties and are repeated herein only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the County on MHC\u2019s claims brought under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), for failure to establish that any alleged injury was the result of an official policy or custom by the County. The district court rightly concluded that the plaintiff could adduce no legal authority for its claim that Jacob had final policy-making-authority for the County. Contrary to MHC\u2019s claims, this is a decision for the judge alone, not a jury. <em>Lytle v. Carl, </em>382 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">MHC\u2019s argument that by adopting legislation proposed by Jacob the Board of Supervisors \u201cratified\u201d the actions giving-rise to this complaint is without merit. MHC can point to no ratification of specific decisions undertaken under that policy at Jacob\u2019s discretion. <em>See Hammond v. County of Madera, </em>859 F.2d 797 (1988). Indeed, nothing like the \u201cactive participation\u201d by authorized policymakers found in <em>Hammond </em>is alleged here, let alone approval of \u201ca subordinate\u2019s decision and the basis for it.\u201d 859 F.2d at 802-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">Similarly, MHC\u2019s claim to have suffered a violation of Equal Protection as a \u201cclass of one\u201d demonstrates that any injury it suffered here could not have been an instance of a long-standing custom constituting \u201cthe standard operating procedure of the local government entity.\u201d <em>Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>491 U.S. 701, 737, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The district court did not err in concluding that Jacob\u2019s allegedly retaliatory actions were not taken in order to chill MHC\u2019s First Amendment expressive conduct. In the case at bar, it is difficult to conclude that the residents would not have complained, or that Jacob would not have responded, if MHC had merely raised rent rather than also expressing its \u201cviews about rent control and the county housing market.\u201d <em>See McKinley v. City of Eloy, </em>705 F.2d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe discharge in this case could have been justified had defendant demonstrated that plaintiff would have been terminated regardless of his constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d). Under <em>McKinley, </em>although the motivation to chill speech need not be the exclusive reason for the challenged conduct, it must be a necessary reason. <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court concluded that overwhelming evidence supported the conclusion that the rent increases themselves, not the letters announcing the increases, gave rise to the residents\u2019 complaints and to Jacob\u2019s conduct. MHC has not raised more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence that Jacob\u2019s aim was to silence MHC\u2019s protected First Amendment activity. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Thus the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
