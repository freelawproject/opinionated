Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Louis L. McDuffy\u2019s appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>McDuffy v. Mansfield, </em>06-0481, for lack of jurisdiction. McDuffy opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">McDuffy sought review by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims of a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision that denied him service connection and secondary service connection for a heart disorder, and denied an award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, stating that the Board\u2019s determinations were not clearly erroneous. McDuffy appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">In his informal brief, McDuffy asserts that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims made factual errors and violated his constitutional rights. However, a mere assertion of a constitutional claim does not confer jurisdiction on this court. <em>See Heilfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332 (Fed.Cir.1999). McDuffy does not raise a true constitutional claim. Thus, McDuffy fails to raise an issue within our jurisdiction and we must dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-21\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b990-23\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-24\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
