We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in pai\u2019t the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lai\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than six years after the BIA\u2019s February 25, 1999 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, Lai failed to provide sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to establish that he now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Lai\u2019s motion to reopen to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture because Lai did not meet the June 21, 1999 filing deadline, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(b)(2), and failed to establish country conditions in India that would warrant reopening, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
