King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 660, 169 L.Ed.2d 511 (2007). \u201cA post-judgment motion may be treated as made pursuant to either [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 59 or 60-re-gardless of how the motion is styled by the movant-depending on the type of relief sought.\u201d <em>Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>122 F.3d 43, 46 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cRule 59 applies to motions for reconsideration of matters encompassed in a decision on the merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>Wright v. Preferred Research, Inc., </em>891 F.2d 886, 889 (11th Cir.1990). However, Rule 59(e) cannot be used \u201cto relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005). By way of contrast, \u201cthe purpose of a Rule 60(b) motion is to permit the trial judge to reconsider matters so that he can correct obvious errors or injustices and so perhaps obviate the laborious process of appeal.\u201d <em>Carter By and Through Carter v. U.S., </em>780 F.2d 925, 928 (11th Cir.1986) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Shaarbay\u2019s various post-judgment pleadings essentially constituted a request for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint under Rule 59(e). However, Shaai\u2019bay merely restated his challenges to his underlying conviction that the district court had already rejected. As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his requests for reconsideration, because a party cannot use a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cto relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>See Michael Linet, Inc., </em>408 F.3d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
