Jun. 14, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 682 697 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 5, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">When the BIA adopts and affirms the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting section 1252(b)(4)(B); internal quotation marks omitted). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ noted that Zheng\u2019s testimony \u201chad a highly scripted quality to it,\u201d that \u201c[h]e kept looking up as though he was faying to remember how he was supposed to answer the questions, and it seemed even on direct examination that he wasn\u2019t able to answer questions unless they were asked of him in a very specific way.\u201d Zheng argues that this finding was speculative, unsupported by the record, and influenced by errors in translation. It is well-settled, however, that this Court will afford significant deference to the fact-finder\u2019s assessment of demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Indeed, an IJ \u201cwho assesses testimony together with witness demeanor is in the best position to discern, often at a glance, whether a question that may appear poorly worded on a printed page was, in fact, confusing or well understood by those who heard it; whether a witness who hesitated in a response was nevertheless attempting truthfully to recount what he recalled of key events or struggling to remember the lines of a carefully crafted \u2018script\u2019; and whether inconsistent responses are the product of innocent error or intentional falsehood.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>ovemded in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Here, although the IJ did not provide specific examples of when Zheng\u2019s testimony sounded scripted \u2014 indeed, it may well have seemed to her scripted in its entirety \u2014 or when he was unresponsive, we have no basis for declining to defer to her overall assessment of Zheng\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The IJ also properly relied on an inconsistent statement in Zheng\u2019s testimony. The IJ noted that despite his testimony that \u201cChinese police officers came to [his] house to arrest [him],\u201d he claimed that he did not know whether the Chinese government knew he practiced Falun Gong. To form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). In this case, whether the Chinese government knew about Zheng\u2019s practice of Falun Gong is plainly a \u201csubstantial\u201d issue. We conclude that this discrepancy, when considered together with the demeanor finding especially when combined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Zheng\u2019s failure to rehabilitate his testimony with reliable corroborative evidence, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006), constitutes substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Inasmuch as Zheng based his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, and the IJ properly found that this evidence lacked credibility, his withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail. <em>See, e.g., Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
