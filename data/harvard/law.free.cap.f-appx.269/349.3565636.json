Priestley argues that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) based on the finding that he used or possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense. Priestley does not dispute that, contemporaneously with his possession of the prohibited firearm, he committed the state jail felony of evading arrest. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 38.04(a), (b)(1) (Vernon 2001). He argues, however, that the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) sentence enhancement is plain error because he did not use or brandish the firearm in connection with his attempt to evade arrest. As the presence of a loaded firearm in Priestley\u2019s car during his flight from police had the potential of facilitating his attempt to evade arrest, the district court did not plainly err by enhancing his offense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 14)(A); <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 510-13 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Priestly further argues that the district court plainly erred in finding that the facts stipulated in connection with his plea established that he possessed the weapon \u201cin or affecting interstate commerce\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) or that he knowingly committed the offense; however, he correctly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81 (5th Cir.1988). Priestley also challenges as plain error the district court\u2019s order that he serve his federal sentence consecutively to a pending state sentence for burglary of a habitation, but he properly concedes that this issue has been resolved against him. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 474-74 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
