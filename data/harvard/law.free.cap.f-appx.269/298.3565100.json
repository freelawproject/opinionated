In appeal No. 07-7728, David Michael Jordan filed a motion for a certificate of appealability seeking to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court\u2019s orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the records and conclude that neither Marion Wayne Jordan nor David Michael Jordan has made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny David Michael Jordan\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, deny a certificate of appealability in No. 07-7410, and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
