To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Martinez-Duran has waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Martinez-Duran\u2019s evidence regarding the birth of her daughter, her son\u2019s worsening asthma condition and her parents\u2019 relocation to the United States from Mexico, presented with Martinez-Duran\u2019s motion to reopen, concerned the same basic hardship grounds as her application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir. 2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">We deny Martinez-Duran\u2019s motion to augment the record with evidence of the birth of her fourth child. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\u201c[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
