Ehm, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his pro <em>se </em>civil rights action for lack of standing. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Ehm, a taxpaying resident of San Antonio, Texas (\u201cCity\u201d), alleges that the San Antonio City Council (\u201cCity Council\u201d) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and various provisions of the Texas Constitution. He contends that the City Council acted unconstitutionally by enacting an ordinance on January 5, 2006, that approved an amended agreement for services in lieu of annexation between the City and Lumberman\u2019s Investment Corporation (\u201cLumberman\u2019s\u201d). The City agreed not to annex almost 3,000 acres of land that Lumberman\u2019s owned and intended to develop into a master-planned community with golf courses and hotels. In return, Lumberman\u2019s agreed to impose certain wage standards on the planned hotels and golf courses. Ehm alleges that \u201cthe non-annexation agreement prevents the City from collecting any sort of municipal tax\u201d on Lumberman\u2019s land. He claims that this forfeiture of municipal taxes violates both the federal and Texas constitutions because, <em>inter alia, </em>it reduces the City\u2019s potential tax revenue. The district court concluded that Ehm lacked standing to bring his claim; thus, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">Standing is a jurisdictional question, and thus a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo </em>by this court. <em>See James v. City of Dallas, </em>254 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[Bjefore a federal court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person seeking to invoke jurisdiction of the court must establish the requisite standing to sue.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 154, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Ehm argues that he has standing as a municipal taxpayer to challenge the City Council\u2019s ordinance. The Supreme Court has generally denied <em>federal </em>and <em>state </em>taxpayers standing under Article III to object to particular expenditures of federal or state funds simply because they are taxpayers. <em>See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </em>547 U.S. 332, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 1862-64, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). But the Court has \u201cnoted with approval the standing of municipal residents to enjoin the \u2018illegal use of the moneys of a municipal corporation,\u2019 relying on \u2018the peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation\u2019 to distinguish such a case from the general bar on taxpayer suits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1865 (quoting <em>Frothinghwrit, v. Mellon, </em>262 U.S. 447, 486-87, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923)); <em>see also ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, </em>490 U.S. 605, 613-14, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (recognizing distinction between federal and state taxpayer standing and municipal taxpayer standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">To establish standing under Article III, \u201c[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (discussing the injury, causation, and redressability requirements of standing). A plaintiff meets the \u201cinjury\u201d requirement of municipal taxpayer standing if he shows that \u201che pays taxes to the relevant entity\u201d and \u201ctax revenues are expended on the disputed practice.\u201d <em>See Doe v. Duncanville Independent School Dist., </em>70 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir. 1995) (municipal taxpayers lack standing to challenge school district\u2019s policy of permitting private group to distribute Bibles to students when there is no evidence that district expended any funds on distribution); Cam<em>mack v. Waihee, </em>932 F.2d 765, 770 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201c[Mjunicipal taxpayer standing is only available when there is an expenditure of municipal funds alleged.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other circuits have indicated that municipal taxpayer standing may also be available when there is a potential loss of public revenue from municipal dispositions of government property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ehm has failed to allege either an unlawful expenditure of municipal funds or a potential loss of revenue from the disposition of government property. Therefore, he lacks standing as a municipal taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
