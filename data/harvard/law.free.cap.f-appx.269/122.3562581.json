May 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 215 498 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting section 1252(B)(4)(b); internal quotation marks omitted). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Island v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">We conclude that the record supports the agency\u2019s determination that Ouyang failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. In addition to showing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, asylum eligibility requires that the persecution alleged be on account of the applicant\u2019s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">In his application and during his testimony, Ouyang described an incident in which government officials attempted to arrest him after he gathered a group of his friends to confront the officials who failed to bring his fatally injured uncle to the hospital. He testified that in addition to the verbal altercation that took place, there was also physical contact between Ouyang\u2019s group and the officials. The agency found that the arrest based upon \u201ccombined physical and verbal altercations\u201d bore no nexus to Ouyang\u2019s political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">We conclude that the record provides ample support for the agency\u2019s finding in that regard. Ouyang was therefore not entitled to the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. And because Ouyang was unable to establish his eligibility for asylum, he was also unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Because Ouyang has not challenged the denial of his application for CAT relief before this Court, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
