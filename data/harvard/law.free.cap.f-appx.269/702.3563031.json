R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b730-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">Betty Lou Lewis appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">Lewis contends that the district court\u2019s failure to submit the issue of drug quantity to the jury for its determination by proof beyond a reasonable doubt deprived her of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Lewis also contends that the district court violated her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by admitting, over her objection, a newspaper article from the <em>Modesto Bee, </em>in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-24\">Lewis\u2019 <em>Blakely </em>claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>423 F.3d 1119, 1121 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies retroactively to cases on collateral review). Likewise, Lewis\u2019 confrontation argument is foreclosed by <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) (holding that <em>Crawford </em>has no application to cases on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We also conclude that the district court correctly determined that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation as the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Lewis\u2019 motion requesting that her appeal of the denial of her \u00a7 2255 motion petition be heard and determined, filed on April 26, 2007, is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b730-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
