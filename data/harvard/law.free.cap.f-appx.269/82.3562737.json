Jankun denying petitioner\u2019s application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Shi, Sai Yan, </em>No. A77-927-785 (B.I.A. June 3, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77-927-785 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 23, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-19\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact <em>de novo. Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Shi failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. \u201cTo establish eligibility for protection under the CAT, an applicant bears the burden of proving that \u2018it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Neither Shi\u2019s testimony nor the Country Profile (submitted by the Government) indicates that Shi will more likely than not be tortured upon return to China. According to the Country Profile, individuals prosecuted for illegal exit are \u201cgenerally fined anywhere between $600 and $6,000\u201d and \u201c[m]any are also subjected to lengthy administrative detention or reeducation through labor camps.\u201d Shi\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged detention of her cousin and a neighbor does not indicate that returnees are more likely than not to be tortured. <em>See id. </em>at 160. As we have held, a petitioner\u2019s CAT claim based solely on membership in \u201cthe large class of persons who have illegally departed China\u201d is insufficient to establish entitlement to CAT protection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">To the extent Shi argues that the IJ erred in failing to develop the record, this claim is without merit, as Shi bore the burden of establishing her eligibility for CAT relief. <em>Id. </em>at 159. To the extent that Shi argues that the IJ relied on outdated Country Reports, this argument too lacks merit. The IJ chiefly relied on Shi\u2019s testimony and lack of supporting evidence. Further, to the extent that Shi appears to be alleging ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to her prior attorney, that claim was not exhausted before the agency, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). <em>See Twum,, </em>411 F.3d at 59. Because Shi provided no documentary evidence or testimony indicating that someone in her particular circumstances is likely to be tortured, the record is simply devoid of evidence supporting her claim. <em>Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 158-59. Thus, the IJ\u2019s denial of Shi\u2019s application for CAT relief was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
