Sept. 11, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Zhuang seeks to challenge the BIA\u2019s December 2002 decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his first motion to reopen, we must limit our review to the BIA\u2019s September 2007 order denying Zhuang\u2019s second motion to reopen, as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Zhuang\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where it was filed almost six years after the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (an alien may file only one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the final administrative decision). The BIA properly found that Zhuang failed to present material evidence of \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality\u201d sufficient to excuse the untimely filing of his motion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). As the BIA observed, Zhuang failed to present any evidence indicating that conditions in China have changed since the time of his hearing. The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in finding that the birth of Zhuang\u2019s children did not excuse the untimely filing of his motion to reopen. This Court has explicitly rejected the argument that the birth of children in the United States constitutes changed country conditions as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Zhuang failed to establish <em>pyima facie </em>eligibility for the relief he sought. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005). The BIA properly found that the letter from Zhuang\u2019s parents and the notice from the family planning authorities establish at most only a speculative fear of future persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Finally, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Zhuang\u2019s proceedings <em>sua sponte, </em>because such a decision is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>See Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Zhuang\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\">. Although Zhuang seeks to reopen \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings in which he was denied relief <em>in absentia, </em>as opposed to removal proceedings resulting in an order of removal, this Court nonetheless has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134-35 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. In its September 2007 order, the BIA properly declined to reconsider its December 2002 order affirming the denial of Zhuang's first motion to reopen because he did not file a timely motion to reconsider that decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2) (a motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the BIA\u2019s decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
