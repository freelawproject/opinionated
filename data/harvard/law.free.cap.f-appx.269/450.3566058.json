Livingston contended that Linnell used excessive force in arresting him and that Prickett did nothing to stop it. The officers moved for summary judgment, arguing that qualified immunity shielded them from suit. The district court denied the motion, and the officers filed this interlocutory appeal of that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">1. Linnell contends that the district court erred by its legal decision in denying that all of the evidence entitles him to qualified immunity. This court has jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 347 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Linnell\u2019s argument, however, fails on the merits. The district court determined that whether Elliot resisted arrest and how his head collided with Linnell\u2019s were both disputed material facts. Those facts are material because they bear on whether Linnell\u2019s response of pushing Elliot\u2019s face into his squad car was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d given the facts and circumstances he faced and under existing law. <em>See Mace v. City of Palestine, </em>333 F.3d 621, 624 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">2. As for Prickett, the district court treated him as a participant in the same conduct as that of Linnell. What is said above then applies to Prickett. If the evidence should prove that Prickett was only a bystander, he would be liable only if he did \u201cnot take reasonable measures to protect\u201d Elliott from Linnell, if Linnell used excessive force. <em>Hale v. Townley, </em>45 F.3d 914, 919 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
