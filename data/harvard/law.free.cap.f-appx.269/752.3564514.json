We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, </em>485 F.3d 463, 470 (9th Cir.2007), and we may affirm for any reason supported by the record, <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1994). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Although the district court failed to apply the two-step test outlined in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), it correctly determined that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Under <em>Saucier, </em>courts \u201cmust examine first whether the [officers] violated [the plaintiff\u2019s] constitutional rights on the facts alleged and, second, if there was a violation, whether the constitutional rights were clearly established.\u201d <em>Desyllas v. Bernstine, </em>351 F.3d 934, 939 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to Carter, <em>see Blankenhorn, </em>485 F.3d at 470, the facts here may well support a Fourth Amendment violation, <em>see Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. However, the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances alleged was not clearly established at the time of the incident involving Carter. <em>See id. </em>at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (holding that for purposes of qualified immunity, \u201c[t]he contours of [a] right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d); <em>United States v. Dorais, </em>241 F.3d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir.2001) (clarifying that, despite the \u201cgeneral rule [that] a defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in a hotel room expires at checkout time[,]\u201d \u201cthe policies and practices of a hotel may result in the extension past checkout time of a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d). Carter\u2019s reliance on post-incident case law is unavailing. <em>See Osolinski v. Kane, </em>92 F.3d 934, 936 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cGenerally, courts do not look to post-incident cases to determine whether the law was clearly established at the time of the incident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Carter\u2019s remaining contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
