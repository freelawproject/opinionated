Plaintiffs-Appellants Olga De Leon, Daurys Bladimil De Leon, Rafaela De Leon, Franklin Roa, Jose Guerrero Marte, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Cristian Encarnaci\u00f3n (\u201cPlaintiffs-Appellants\u201d) are either surviving stowaways or hems of the decedent stowaways. They initiated this admiralty and maritime tort action seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by the Stowaways. Shih Wei Navigation Company, Limited (\u201cShih Wei\u201d) and Dong Lien Maritime S.A., Panama (\u201cDong Lien\u201d) (collectively \u201cDefendants-Appellees\u201d) are the only remaining defendants in this action. They are alleged to represent the owner\u2019s interest of the MW WELL PESCADORES. Plaintiffs-Appellants appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of them action for lack of personal jurisdiction over Defendants-Appellees. Convinced that the district court correctly determined that Defendants-Appellees lack the requisite minimum contacts with the United States to confer general personal jurisdiction on the courts of this country, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In March 2003, the Stowaways covertly boarded the WELL PESCADORES \u2014 a Panama-flagged cargo ship whose master was from Taiwan and whose crew was from the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2014 while it was calling on Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; them apparent intent being to stow away aboard the ship until it reached its destination, Houston, Texas. While the vessel was in international waters <em>en route </em>to Houston, the Stowaways were discovered by the vessel\u2019s crew and then either left voluntarily on a raft or were forcibly thrown overboard by the crew, depending on whose version of the story is true. Two of the Stowaways, William De Leon and Franklin De Leon, died.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Plaintiffs-Appellants filed this suit against the vessel\u2019s owners and charterers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They allege that Defendants-Appellees represent the vessel owner\u2019s interest, and as such were responsible for the actions of the vessel\u2019s crew under the charter party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shih Wei was indisputably the manager of the vessel for the voyage that gave rise to this action, and Dong Lien, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shih Wei, acted as Shih Wei\u2019s agent and executed the charter party as owner with the charterer, BHBP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Both Defendants-Appellees are foreign corporations: Dong Lien was incorporated under the laws of Panama, and Shih Wei was incorporated under the laws of Taiwan. Each corporation has its principal place of business in Taipei, Taiwan. Defendants-Appellees filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, asserting that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. The district court granted the motion, concluding that it could not exercise either specific jurisdiction or general jurisdiction over Shih Wei or Dong Lien. Plaintiffs-Appellants timely filed a notice of appeal. On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>they insist that Defendants-Appellees had sufficient contacts with the United States to support the district court\u2019s exercise of general personal jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question whether personal jurisdiction may be exercised over a defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the basis impersonal jurisdiction is challenged and the district court grants the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need only make a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>showing of the facts on which jurisdiction is predicated\u201d on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant attaches only when a defendant is amenable to service of process under the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute and the exercise of jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the [Fjourteenth [Ajmendment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Alternatively, when a claim arises under federal law, as is the case here, personal jurisdiction may be exercised only if doing so would be proper under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201cThe due process inquiry likewise has two parts. For personal jurisdiction to exist the nonresident defendant purposefully must have established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the forum state such that he</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">invoked the benefits and protections of the forum\u2019s laws and thus reasonably could anticipate being haled into court there. In addition, circumstances must be such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fan- play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry may be further subdivided into contacts that give rise to either specific jurisdiction or general jurisdiction. \u201cWhen a cause of action arises out of a defendant\u2019s purposeful contacts with the forum, minimum contacts are found to exist and the court may exercise its \u2018specific\u2019 jurisdiction. Even a single, substantial act directed toward the forum can support specific jurisdiction. Where a cause of action does not arise out of a foreign defendant\u2019s purposeful contacts with the forum, however, due process requires that the defendant have engaged in \u2018continuous and systematic contacts\u2019 in the forum to support the exercise of \u2018general\u2019 jurisdiction over that defendant ... [Cjontacts of a more extensive quality and nature are required.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">Plaintiffs-Appellants do not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that it could not exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendants-Appellees; instead, they assert that the 48 to 45 calls<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> made on U.S. ports by vessels owned or managed by DefendantsAppellees during the three years preceding the incident in question support that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>court\u2019s exercise of general jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, Plaintiffs-Appellants insist that if the district court had properly applied our precedent in <em>Asarco, Inc. v. Glenara, Ltd,.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the Rule 4(k)(2) context by considering Defendants-Appellees\u2019 contacts with the United States <em>as a whole, </em>it would have recognized that Defendants-Appellees had \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with the forum, based on their repeated calls on U.S. ports. Having reviewed the record on appeal, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable case law, we are convinced that the district court properly considered and applied <em>Asarco </em>in light of Rule 4(k)(2). Moreover, we agree with the district court that the requisite \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to support the exercise of general personal jurisdiction are lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In <em>Asarco, </em>ASARCO, Inc. (\u201cASARCO\u201d) sought to recover damages for cargo lost when the vessel carrying the cargo sank by filing suit in federal district court in Louisiana against the owner of the vessel, Glenara, Ltd., as well as the manager of the vessel, Anglo-Eastern Management Services Limited (\u201cAnglo-Eastern\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> ASARCO insisted that Anglo-Eastern had sufficient contacts with Louisiana to support the exercise of general personal jurisdiction based solely on 20 calls made by Anglo-Eastern-managed vessels to various ports in the State of Louisiana in the five years preceding the accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We concluded that such contacts were \u201cbetter characterized as sporadic than continuous and systematic,\u201d and that they were \u201cinsufficient to cause Anglo-Eastern reasonably to anticipate the possibility of being haled into court in Louisiana.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, we emphasized that Anglo-Eastern\u2019s vessels were under charter when they called on Louisiana ports, and that the respective charterers controlled the vessels\u2019 destinations and dictated the ports on which the vessels called. Accordingly, we concluded that Anglo-Eastern could not \u201cbe held to have availed itself of the benefits and protections of doing business in Louisiana by virtue of its sporadic operational management of vessels sent to Louisiana by others.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Similar to Anglo-Eastern, DefendantsAppellees\u2019 sole contacts with the forum were calls made on forum ports in the years preceding the incident at issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendants-Appellees are not licensed or authorized to do business in the United States; they have never advertised or solicited any business in the United States; they do not maintain a place of business or office in the United States; they have no employees or agents located in the United States; they have never maintained a telephone number or mailing address in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>United States; and they have never owned, leased, or possessed any interest in property in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">At the time of the voyage at issue, Dong Lien owned three vessels and Shih Wei managed 22 vessels, which in combination made between 43 to 45 calls to various ports around the United States during the three years at issue.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, on average, each vessel called on a U.S. port about 0.68 times per year, or roughly twice every three years. Neither is there any discern-able pattern with respect to the timing and location of these calls: Defendants-Appellees\u2019 vessels did not call on the same U.S. ports with any regularity or consistency. In addition, almost every time one of the vessels did call on a U.S. port, it was under charter; and, pursuant to these charter parties, each vessel was under the commercial direction and control of its charterer. Accordingly, the charterers directed the vessels\u2019 movements, and DefendantsAppellees had no control over the vessels\u2019 destinations or the ports on which they called.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">We reject Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 assertion that the crew\u2019s discovery of the Stowaways returned operational control of the WELL PESCADORES and its destination to Defendants-Appellees in accordance with Clause 40(b)(1) of the charter party. Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 contention is based on an incorrect interpretation of the term \u201coff-hire.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the charterer or sub-charterer retained operational control of the WELL PESCA-DORES at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">When we consider the isolated and sporadic nature of the calls made on U.S. ports by Defendants-Appellees\u2019 vessels, the lack of control Defendants-Appellees\u2019 possessed over these calls, and the absence of any other contacts with the United States in the framework of <em>Aaarco, </em>we conclude that Defendants-Appellees lack the requisite \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with the forum to support the exercise of general personal jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of this action for lack of personal jurisdiction is</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

As is common, the owners of the WELL PESCADORES had chartered the ship for the voyage to another entity, BHP Billiton Transport and Logistics Pty., Ltd.
