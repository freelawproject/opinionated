Collier appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-24\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>McQuillion v. Duncan, </em>306 F.3d 895, 899 (9th Cir.2002). Because the state court denied Collier\u2019s petition without explanation, we \u201cmust conduct an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>review of the record to determine whether the state court\u2019s decision was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1127 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We reject as foreclosed the State\u2019s contentions that there is no federally protected interest in parole release in California, and that Collier was afforded all the due process that he was entitled to under clearly established federal law because he was given an opportunity to be heard at the parole board hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28. We also reject the State\u2019s contention that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard is not clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, in the parole context. <em>See id. </em>at 1128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Collier contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (\u201cthe Board\u201d) 2003 decision to deny him parole violated his due process rights. This contention fails because some evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to deny parole, which was based in part on the \u201csenselessness\u201d of Collier\u2019s violent commitment offense. <em>See id.; see also </em>Cal.Code Regs. tit. 15 \u00a7 2402(c)(1)(E). Accordingly, Collier has failed to demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision denying this claim \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d or \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Collier\u2019s contention that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment also fails because the sentence is not grossly disproportionate. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 77, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Van Winrow, </em>951 F.2d 1069, 1071 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that life without possibility of parole for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute did not violate Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Finally, Collier fails to raise a federal question with his assertion that his constitutional rights were violated because the Board did not apply a sentencing matrix to set a fixed term sentence. <em>See Langford v. Day, </em>110 F.3d 1380, 1389 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b700-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
