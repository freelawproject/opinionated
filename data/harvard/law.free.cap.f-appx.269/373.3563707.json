The IJ granted Tran\u2019s request for voluntary departure and this court granted a stay of deportation pending the BIA\u2019s resolution of his petition for review. We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 (governing judicial review of final orders of removal). Where, as here, the BIA has adopted the analysis and conclusions of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Tran challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, arguing that the numerous inconsistencies between Tran\u2019s live testimony, his affidavit, his asylum application, and witnesses\u2019 testimony cited by the IJ are not material to his claims. A review of the record establishes that the IJ\u2019s finding that Tran\u2019s testimony is not credible is substantially supported by the record. Tran seeks to minimize the importance of these inconsistencies, but none of his arguments compel this court to substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d); <em>see also Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 905 (\u201cThe panel cannot replace the Board or IJ\u2019s determinations concerning witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with its own determinations.\u201d). Because the denial of Tran\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and for relief under the CAT are based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, they may not be reviewed by this court. <em>See Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78) (\u201cWe have emphatically ruled that \u2018we will not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge\u2019s assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u2019 \u201d)\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Tran did not exhaust his claim for asylum relief to the BIA and thus this court may not consider this claim. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
