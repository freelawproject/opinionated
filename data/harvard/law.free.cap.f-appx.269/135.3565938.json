June 25, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 375 105 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Feb. 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As an initial matter, we consider Mbang\u2019s due process arguments, which we review <em>de novo. See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We have held that to establish a violation of due process, an alien must show \u201cthat she was denied a full and fan- opportunity to present her claims or that the IJ or BIA otherwise deprived her of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007)(internal quotation marks omitted). Further, an IJ is not required to remain a passive bystander to the proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l) (providing that an \u201cimmigration judge shall administer oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses\u201d); <em>Islam v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A]n IJ is not merely the fact finder and adjudicator, but also has an obligation to establish and develop the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Here, Mbang claims that the IJ violated her right to due process by pressuring her to withdraw her application, engaging in \u201coff-the-record discussions\u201d about whether she had filed a frivolous application, and being \u201coverly aggressive and hostile.\u201d As to the first two allegations, Mbang fails to explain how she was denied a full and fair opportunity to present her claims or how the fundamental fairness of the proceedings were affected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Burger, </em>498 F.3d at 134. As to the third allegation, we find nothing in the record to suggest that the IJ was biased against Mbang, prevented her from testifying, or otherwise deprived her of the right to be heard. <em>Cf. Islam, </em>469 F.3d at 55; <em>Guo-Le Huang v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 142, 150 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">We now turn to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which we review under the substantial evidence standard, treating it as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin, v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported primarily by inconsistencies between Mbang\u2019s testimony and the sworn statement and documentary evidence she provided to corroborate her claims. In particular, the IJ identified two significant inconsistencies: 1) Mbang\u2019s testimony that she was arrested for the first time in November 1999 contradicted her sworn statement that her first arrest occurred in March 1998; and 2) her testimony that she was beaten, and not arrested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>by police on March 10, 2000, was inconsistent with a medical record she submitted, stating that she was treated for injuries that she claimed occurred when she was \u201cbeaten in a cell following a political rally on 20-3-2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">These inconsistencies went to the heart of Mbang\u2019s claim because they cast doubt on whether she was ever arrested or abused on account of her political activity in Cameroon. As such, they provide substantial evidence in support of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Mbang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case is dispositive of both Mbang\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, which share the same factual predicate. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275-76 (2d Cir.2003)(per curiam). We do not reach the agency\u2019s determination with respect to CAT relief because Mbang does not contest it in her brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">. We note that Mbang provides no examples (and we see none in the record) of how she was \"pressured\u201d to withdraw her application. Similarly, we are unable to find a due process violation with respect to the alleged \"off-the-record discussions\" where the IJ never made a frivolousness finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
