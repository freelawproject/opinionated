Mar. 5, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 660 570 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case. In her petition, Zhuo argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination on the basis of minor discrepancies in her testimony; that the BIA and IJ erred in relying upon discrepancies between her testimony before the IJ and her airport interview; and that she has demonstrated her eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-20\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions of that decision not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-21\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Shu Wen Sun, v. BIA </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007). An IJ may properly use minor inconsistencies to support an adverse credibility determination where the IJ\u2019s findings already placed into doubt a petitioner\u2019s credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). As petitioner\u2019s counsel observed at oral argument, the IJ did not, in fact, rely upon discrepancies between her testimony before the IJ and her airport interview. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on numerous inconsistencies in petitioner\u2019s testimony as well as the IJ\u2019s own assessment of petitioner\u2019s demeanor. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The IJ further found that even if Zhuo were credible she failed to establish eligibility for asylum because she had not established past persecution during her brief detention or a well-founded fear of future persecution because her Christian parents remained in China without harm and she was able to use her own passport to leave the country without interference from officials. Additionally, the IJ found that Zhuo would be able to relocate because it appeared that only local officials had allegedly persecuted her. Accordingly, we can confidently predict that the same determination and resulting denial of relief \u201cwould be made in the absence of the [alleged] deficiencies.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-22\">. The parties agree that the IJ\u2019s denial of relief in this case is equivalent, for the purposes of our jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), to a final order of removal. <em>See also Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 133-35 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
