To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and claims of constitutional violations, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Contrary to Delgado\u2019s contention, the agency did not err in finding his participation in alien smuggling rendered him inadmissible as an applicant for adjustment of status, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1255(a)(2); 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) (\u201cAny alien who at any time knowingly ... assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible\u201d), and ineligible for a waiver because the person he assisted was not his \u201cspouse, parent, son or daughter,\u201d <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Moreover, Delgado\u2019s due process rights were not violated by the IJ admitting and relying on the 1-213 form, where Delgado failed to follow the IJ\u2019s instruction to file an objection in writing prior to the hearing and where there was no demonstration of coercion underlying the form. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c) (authorizing the immigration judge to set time limits for submission of documents); <em>Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995) (an 1-213 is presumed to be reliable, and \u201c[t]he burden of establishing a basis for exclusion of evidence from a government record falls on the opponent of the evidence\u201d). Nor did the IJ violate Delgado\u2019s due process rights by precluding a witness\u2019s testimony, where Delgado did not comply with the court\u2019s local rules requiring submission of a witness list pxior to the hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.40 (authoxizing immigration courts to establish local operating px'ocedures). In the absence of a valid excuse for failure to submit the written objection or witness list, the IJ\u2019s decisions were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">To the extent Delgado contests his eligibility for cancellation of removal, the IJ did not ex\u2019r in finding he lacked sufficient physical presence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">We lack jurisdiction to x\u2019eview Delgado\u2019s contentions regarding the G-166 form because he did not raise them before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
