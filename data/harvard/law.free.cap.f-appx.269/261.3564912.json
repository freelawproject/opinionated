She does not challenge the Board\u2019s ruling that, regardless of whether she suffered past persecution, \u201c[tjhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d in Liberia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) (2007). We conclude that the Board\u2019s denial of relief based on this provision is not manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (West 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">Zoe also argues that she was entitled to humanitarian relief under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(iii)(A) (2007). Our precedent reserves eligibility for this type of asylum \u201cfor the most atrocious abuse,\u201d \u201cwhere past persecution is so severe that it would be inhumane to return the alien even in the absence of any risk of further persecution.\u201d <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999). As the court observed in <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 488 (4th Cir.2006), \u201c[o]ur decisions have been true to this narrow construction,\u201d citing <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189-91 (4th Cir.2004) (alien interrogated under threat of death, held for a week in a dark cement cell flooded at intervals with cold water, and imprisoned for months in solitary confinement did not qualify); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 318, 325 (4th Cir.2002) (alien interrogated, assaulted and tortured by means including removal of his teeth with pliers and a screwdriver did not qualify). The court in <em>Ngarurih, </em>371 F.3d at 190, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cited with approval the decision in <em>Bucur v. INS, </em>109 F.3d 399, 405 (7th Cir.1997), which described the humanitarian asylum regulation as \u201cdesigned for the case of the German Jews, the victims of the Chinese \u2018Cultural Revolution,\u2019 survivors of the Cambodian genocide, and a few other such extreme cases.\u201d The abuse described by Zoe, though deplorable, does not reach this level. Therefore, the Board did not err in denying asylum under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We deny Zoe\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-18\"> Zoe\u2019s brief does not challenge the denial of withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, she has waived the issues on appeal. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999) (noting that issues not briefed or argued are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
