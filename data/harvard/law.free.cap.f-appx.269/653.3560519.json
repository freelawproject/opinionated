We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Jose-Gonzalez contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction because the prior conviction was neither admitted or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This contention is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Zepeda-Martinez, </em>470 F.3d 909, 912 (9th Cir.2006). To the extent that Jose-Gonzalez contends that there was no proof of his prior conviction, this is belied by the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R. of Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Jose-Gonzalez further contends that the district court failed to appropriately apply the Guidelines and gave excessive weight to the prior conviction. We conclude that the district court applied the appropriate legal standard and properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 516-17 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 6. We further conclude that Jose-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
