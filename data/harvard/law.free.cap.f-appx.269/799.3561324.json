ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b827-22\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Peter James Brush was convicted, following a jury trial, of driving under the influence after a former conviction, possession of a controlled dangerous substance after a former conviction, attempted escape from a lawful arrest, and possession of drug paraphernalia, for which he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment on the first count, fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the second count, thirty days on the third count, and one year on the fourth count, all to run consecutively. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed Brush\u2019s convictions and sentences in August 2004, and Brush did not seek certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Brush filed a motion for post-conviction relief, which was denied in September 2005. He thereafter filed a number of motions, including several mandamus actions and further post-conviction applications, all of which were denied on procedural or jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Brush then filed this petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He alleged that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance, that he is actually and factually innocent of the possession of a controlled and dangerous substance conviction, and that he was denied due process in connection with his state post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who determined that Brush\u2019s habeas petition was untimely under the limitations period established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). After further concluding that Brush could not establish any ground for statutory or equitable tolling of the limitations period, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the petition as untimely. The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and dismissed Brush\u2019s petition as untimely. The district court also denied Brush\u2019s request for a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the dismissal of his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">We have carefully reviewed Brush\u2019s submissions, as well as the record. For substantially the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation dated November 16, 2007, and the district court\u2019s Order dated December 5, 2007, 2007 WL 4287615, we conclude that Brush has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e), and we deny his request for a COA and dismiss this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b827-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. We further deny Brush's request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
