We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">The record does not compel the conclusion that the untimely filing of the asylum application should be excused. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). Even assuming that the asylum application was timely, substantial evidence supports the finding that Villeda-Moran failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted, or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Because Villeda-Moran failed to meet the lower standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to show that he is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Substantial evidence supports the determination that Villeda-Moran was ineligible for CAT relief, because he failed to establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured should he return to El Salvador. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
