Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision, and we affirm. <em>See L\u00f3pez de Hincapi\u00e9 v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 213, 218-220 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Ndreka cannot qualify as a refugee unless she was persecuted based on a protected ground. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 428, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Although Ndreka argues she was subject to persecution based on her political opinion, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Ndreka was targeted by criminals interested in using her for sex trafficking and not because of her political opinion. Thus, she is not entitled to asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). Because Ndreka failed to show that she was persecuted based on a protected ground for asylum eligibility purposes, she likewise fails in her application for withholding of removal. <em>See L\u00f3pez de Hincapi\u00e9, </em>494 F.3d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Ndreka has not shown it is more likely than not that she would be tortured by or at the acquiescence of a government official upon her return to Albania, and the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture was therefore appropriate. <em>See Xue Deng Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Therefore, Ndreka\u2019s petition for review is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
