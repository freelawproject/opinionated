To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000) and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding, in light of changed country conditions in Guatemala and the generalized nature of Sosa\u2019s fear, that Sosa did not establish a well founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Because Sosa failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Sosa failed to show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Guatemala. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Sosa failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003). Sosa\u2019s contention that the agency deprived him of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of his case and by disregarding their evidence of hardship is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
