Brooks (\u201cBrooks\u201d) was charged with one count of possession of material depicting the sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). He pled guilty on August 5, 2005,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, on August 11, 2006, the District Court sentenced Brooks to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Brooks was also ordered to pay a special assessment of $100. Brooks filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), requesting permission to withdraw because he is unable to identify any non-frivolous issues for appeal after a conscientious review of the record. Brooks was given notice of his counsel\u2019s intent to withdraw and has not filed a <em>pro se </em>brief in response. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). For the reasons stated below, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">Evaluation of an <em>Anders </em>brief requires a twofold inquiry: (1) whether counsel has thoroughly examined the record for appealable issues and has explained why any such issues are frivolous; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). Where the <em>Anders </em>brief appears adequate on its face, our review is limited to the portions of the record identified in the brief, along with any issues raised by an appellant in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 301. We conclude that the brief in this case is adequate, and thus, it will guide our independent review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Pursuant to his obligation under the first prong of our analysis, counsel has identified several potential, but frivolous, issues. By entering an unconditional guilty plea, Brooks waived all claims for appellate relief with the exception of claims that (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to accept the plea, (2) the plea was invalid under applicable statutory and constitutional standards, and (3) the sentence is illegal. <em>See United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">First, the District Court clearly had jurisdiction to enter a conviction and impose a sentence for Brooks\u2019s violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), a federal crime over which Congress has granted United States district courts jurisdiction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Although any objection as to improper venue has been waived by Brooks at this point, venue was indeed proper and is therefore not an appropriate ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Second, although Brooks\u2019s counsel and the Government have identified several technical deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s plea colloquy with Brooks, none of the deficiencies meet the plain error standard that applies to this appeal. Moreover, as Brooks has declined to file a <em>pro se </em>brief opposing his counsel\u2019s representations, we can hardly conclude that he has met his burden of establishing a reasonable probability that he would not have entered a guilty plea had the deficiencies been corrected. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (\u201c[A] defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Finally, as to the lawfulness of Brooks\u2019s sentence, the record is clear that the District Court carefully analyzed the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and ultimately imposed a reasonable sentence at the very bottom of the advisory Guidelines range. The only argument raised by Brooks prior to sentencing that the District Court did not directly address was his contention that federal sentences for child pornography offenses are much stiffer than those imposed in state court, thereby yielding unwarranted sentencing disparities. This argument fails, however, as \u00a7 3553(a)(6) focuses on the need to avoid unwarranted disparities among sentences imposed by federal courts for violations of federal law, not disparities between state and federal defendants. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>434 F.3d 684, 687 (4th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cThe sole concern of section 3553(a)(6) is with sentencing dispaiities among federal, defendants.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)); <em>United, States v. Jeremiah, </em>446 F.3d 805, 808 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cUnwarranted sentencing disparities among federal defendants remains the only consideration under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) \u2014 both before and after <em>Booker.\u201d)-, United States v. Branson, </em>463 F.3d 1110, 1112 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cAdjusting federal sentences to conform to those imposed by the states where the offenses occurred would not serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(6), but, rather, would create disparities within the federal system, which is what \u00a7 3553(a)(6) is designed to discourage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Our independent review of the record yields no other non-frivolous arguments that could possibly support an appeal and we are satisfied that all the requirements of <em>Anders </em>have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court and, in a separate order, GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-19\">. Prior to this appeal, Brooks did not object to the District Court's compliance with Rule 11 during his plea hearing, nor did he move to withdraw his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
