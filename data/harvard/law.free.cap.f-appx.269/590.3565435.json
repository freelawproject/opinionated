In his complaint Golliher demanded his release as well as compensation for the damaged property and his time spent in prison. The district court screened the complaint, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and, relying on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), dismissed without prejudice all but the claim for the damage to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on that claim on September 29, 2006, 2006 WL 2855174. This order was a final decision because \u201cit resolved all outstanding claims and made clear that [the] suit was at an end.\u201d <em>Head v. Chi. Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., </em>225 F.3d 794, 800 (7th Cir.2000). Thus, it was immediately appealable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Borrero v. City of Chi., </em>456 F.3d 698, 699-700 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Otis v. City of Chi., </em>29 F.3d 1159, 1165 (7th Cir.1994). But the court did not set out its judgment on a separate document, <em>see </em>Fed.R.CivP. 58(a), so it was not deemed to be entered until February 26, 2007,150 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>court\u2019s order was entered on the docket. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2)(B); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii); <em>Borren, </em>456 F.3d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In the 150 days after the district court entered its final decision, Golliher filed two motions to amend his complaint, a motion for reconsideration, and a \u201cmotion to clarify judgment.\u201d Although these motions were made before judgment was entered, the latter two tolled the period for filing a notice of appeal just as if they had been made within 10 days after entry of judgment under Rule 58. <em>See Borren, </em>456 F.3d at 701. On March 12, 2007, the district court denied all of the motions except the \u201cmotion to clarify judgment,\u201d which the court granted to the extent of explaining that at summary judgment it had considered only the evidence relating to Golliher\u2019s property-damage claim and not evidence relating to the validity of the search. With this order, the clock began to run on Golliher\u2019s deadline to appeal the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). But Golliher let 30 days lapse without filing a notice of appeal, so he lost the ability to appeal the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we do not consider Golliher\u2019s arguments that the district court improperly dismissed his wrongful-incarceration claim and erred in granting summary judgment on the property-damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Four months later, in July 2007, Golliher filed a \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Golliher argued that the district court should set aside its judgment because, he asserted, he had been transferred to a different prison during discovery so he could not respond adequately to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. He also argued that the district court\u2019s order failed to address one of his claims. The court denied the motion, reasoning that Golliher offered no special circumstances that justified setting aside the judgment and that all of Golliher\u2019s arguments either could have been raised earlier or already had been raised and decided. This time Golliher timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Golliher\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Harrington v. City of Chi, </em>433 F.3d 542, 546 (7th Cir.2006). None of Golliher\u2019s arguments convinces us that he is entitled to the \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d Rule 60(b) provides. <em>See Provident Sav. Bank v. Popovich, </em>71 F.3d 696, 698 (7th Cir.1995). He primarily argues that the judgment should be set aside because, he insists, the court\u2019s rulings contained legal errors. But as we already have said, it is too late for Golliher to attack the basis for the court\u2019s underlying judgment. He cannot use a Rule 60(b) motion to make an end run around his failure to raise these arguments in a timely appeal from the judgment. <em>See Bell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>214 F.3d 798, 801 (7th Cir.2000). In any event, legal error is not a valid reason to grant a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Gleash v. Yuswak, </em>308 F.3d 758, 761 (7th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
