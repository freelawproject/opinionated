Martinelli asserts various trial errors and argues that the District Court erred in granting PMIC summary judgment on her hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here. Martinelli first claims that the District Court erred when it precluded testimony from one of Martinelli\u2019s former coworkers, Roseanna Klim, who allegedly suffered disparate treatment while employed at PMIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u201c[A]s a general rule, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior discriminatory treatment of a plaintiff or other employees is relevant and admissible ... to establish whether a defendant\u2019s employment action against an employee was motivated by invidious discrimination.\u201d <em>Becker v. ARCO Chemical Co., </em>207 F.3d 176, 194 n. 8 (3d Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted). But such evidence must have a proper purpose and be admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 401-403. <em>Ansell v. Green Acres Contracting Co., </em>347 F.3d 515, 520 (3d Cir.2003). The proponent of such evidence \u201cmust be able to articulate a way in which the tendered evidence logically tends to establish or refute a material fact in issue, and that chain of logic must include no link involving an inference that a bad person is disposed to do bad acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520-21 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Here, Klim would have testified that she performed the functions of an underwriter but was not paid as such. The District Court found that this testimony had little probative value in establishing PMIC\u2019s intent to discriminate because the discriminatory nature of the past conduct was unclear and it was dissimilar to Martinelli\u2019s situation. We find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in so holding. <em>See Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dep\u2019t., </em>174 F.3d 95, 110 (3d Cir.1999). As the District Court aptly noted, evidence of prior acts is admissible where \u201cthe inference of the employer\u2019s discriminatory attitude came from the nature of the prior acts themselves,\u201d but not where the evidence is offered merely for \u201cthe purpose of establishing the fact that the employer engaged in any particular act or course of conduct in connection with the plaintiffs termination.\u201d <em>Becker, </em>207 F.3d at 194 n. 8. It was no abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that Klim\u2019s circumstances were not sufficiently similar to Martinelli\u2019s to allow an appropriate inference about PMIC\u2019s state of mind in this case to be drawn from Klim\u2019s experience. At most, Klim\u2019s testimony tended to show that PMIC underpaid employees who were doing underwriting work, and that it was mistreating Martinelli in the same fashion as it had previously mistreated Klim. This evidence becomes even less probative in light of the District Court\u2019s observation that Martinelli and Klim had different job titles and focused on entirely different sectors of PMIC\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The difference in circumstances between Martinelli and Klim also precludes any suggestion that Klim\u2019s testimony should have been admitted as evidence of a pattern or plan to underpay women who performed underwriting work. To be admissible as pattern or plan evidence, the two acts \u201cmust be connected, mutually dependent, and interlocking\u201d and must \u201cconsist of incidents [that] were sufficiently similar to earmark them as the handiwork of the same actor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197 (internal citation omitted); <em>See also J &amp; R Ice Cream Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>v. Cal. Smoothie Licensing Corp., </em>31 F.3d 1259, 1269 (3d Cir.1994). Klim\u2019s testimony falls well short of this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded by Martinelli\u2019s suggestion that the District Court erred by instructing the jury that \u201cthis case is to be decided, solely, on the employer\u2019s treatment of Ms. Martinelli, it has nothing to do with any other employees.\u201d This was nothing more than an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We also agree with the District Court that Martinelli was not prejudiced by the limitations initially placed on the testimony of a former PMIC Assistant Underwriter, Ann Bedwiek pertaining to the claims she made. The District Court initially held that Bedwiek could not testify that she was considered an underwriter by the insurance agents and brokers with whom she dealt. It also prohibited her from testifying that a male employee, Barry Corrigan, had been suspended but not terminated for failing to keep track of certain insurance forms. Yet Bedwiek subsequently testified, without objection, that \u201c[t]he agents and brokers that I worked with, they considered me an Underwriter, they didn\u2019t know I was still an Assistant Underwriter.\u201d Furthermore, PMIC\u2019s Vice-President of Agribusiness Underwriting, Harold Roberts, testified about Corrigan\u2019s probation in some detail, and indicated that PMIC had not ultimately terminated Corrigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Martinelli next argues that the District Court erred when it excluded the EEOC\u2019s written determination that PMIC\u2019s treatment of Martinelli had violated Title VII. In <em>Coleman v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>306 F.3d 1333 (3d Cir.2002), we held that \u201cthe decision of whether or not an EEOC Letter of Determination is more probative than prejudicial is within the discretion of the trial court, and to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345 (internal citations omitted). We stressed that \u201cconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence, which are often necessary to counter an EEOC report,\u201d were particularly salient in this context. <em>Id. </em>Here, the District Court concluded that the letter\u2019s claim to be a \u201cdetermination as to the merits,\u201d coupled with the fact that it originated from an authoritative government agency, could confuse and mislead the jury and unfairly prejudice PMIC. The District Court also concluded that the letter would provoke needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Because these concerns were entirely consistent with Rule 403 and our holding in <em>Coleman, </em>we hold that the decision to exclude the EEOC letter was well within the discretion of the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Martinelli also claims that an unfairly prejudicial comment by PMIC\u2019s counsel required the District Court to declare a mistrial. Our review of a district court\u2019s decision regarding the grant of a new trial for prejudicial conduct by counsel is deferential. <em>Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., </em>980 F.2d 171, 207 (3d Cir.1992). Because a district court \u201cis in a far better position than we to appraise the effect of the improper argument of counsel,\u201d <em>Reed v. Philadelphia, Bethlehem &amp; New England R.R. Co., </em>939 F.2d 128, 133 (3d Cir. 1991), we defer to its assessment of the prejudicial impact and whether its curative instructions to the jury are sufficient to expunge the prejudicial impact of counsel\u2019s statements. <em>Fineman, </em>980 F.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Here, PMIC\u2019s counsel asserted during his opening statement that Martinelli had failed to exclude from an insurance policy an insured with a history of drunk driving, which resulted in a $1 million loss to PMIC when that driver was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>involved in a fatal car accident while intoxicated. We agree with the District Court that counsel\u2019s reference to intoxication, while perhaps improper, was not so prejudicial as to deny Martinelli a fail' trial, particularly in light of the District Court\u2019s curative instruction and the isolated nature of counsel\u2019s remarks. <em>See Salas v. Wang, </em>846 F.2d 897, 908 (3d Cir.1988) (finding \u201cone isolated statement\u201d to jury insufficient to warrant new trial). Martinelli\u2019s claim that PMIC was able \u201cto emphasize over and over the One Million Dollar payment and the fact that the driver was drunk at the time of the fatality\u201d is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Martinelli\u2019s final assignment of error is that the District Court erred in granting partial summary judgment to PMIC on her hostile work environment claim. Although the parties focus much of them argument on the question of pretext, we will affirm for the same reasons stated by the District Court: no reasonable juror could find that the alleged scrutiny of Martinelli\u2019s work was objectively hostile or abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">This conclusion is not altered by our suggestion in <em>Moore v. City of Philadelphia, </em>461 F.3d 331 (3d Cir.2006), that employees claiming retaliation by workplace harassment are no longer required to show that the harassment was severe or pervasive enough to constitute a violation of Title VII\u2019s anti-discrimination provision. <em>Id. </em>at 341-42 (discussing implication of <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)). It is true that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burlington Northern </em>broadened the definition of retaliatory conduct, but the Court also emphasized that Title VII was not intended to permit employees complaining of discrimination to immunize themselves from the \u201cpetty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work\u201d simply by complaining of discrimination. <em>Burlington Northern, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2415. PMIC\u2019s scrutiny of Martinelli\u2019s work, while unpleasant and annoying, did not create the sort of hostile work environment that would satisfy Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. Martinelli can point to only one similar remark by counsel during the entire trial. During his summation, PMIC\u2019s counsel referenced the accident and stated \u201cthat\u2019s the fatality which, ultimately, cost the company a million dollars, and there\u2019s no dispute, the company paid that money.\u201d Counsel then read from Martinelli\u2019s note to a broker which referenced the specific circumstances of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
