Gordon-Uruakpa, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Li Ping Zheng, </em>No. A95 673 356 (B.I.A. Apr. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 673 356 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, while rejecting two of the IJ\u2019s specific findings; accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s decision in light of those modifications. We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). While we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed, <em>see Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 395, 406 (2d Cir. 2005), that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">1. <em>Administrative Exhaustion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">As an initial matter, the Government correctly asserts that, on appeal to the BIA, Zheng failed to challenge (1) the reliability of her airport and credible fear interviews and (2) the accuracy of the translation of the asylum hearing. We decline to review those issues. <em>See Lin Zhong v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cConsistent with the strong prudential rationale for requiring all issues raised on appeal to have been presented below, our circuit applies an issue exhaustion doctrine to petitions for review from the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">2. <em>Adverse Credibility Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the IJ identified a material inconsistency between Zheng\u2019s application for asylum, which alleged persecution on account of her practice of Falun Gong in China, and her air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>port interview, in which Zheng stated that she came to the United States \u201cto find a job to earn money to help [her] father and family,\u201d notably omitting any mention of Falun Gong. When the IJ asked Zheng to explain the omission, petitioner stated that she had been afraid and nervous at the airport interview. The IJ rejected this explanation, and we cannot conclude that the record compelled otherwise. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Indeed, the IJ\u2019s conclusion found further support in the fact that Zheng failed to mention Falun Gong in her credible fear interview. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was also informed by Zheng\u2019s failure to corroborate her claim that she practiced Falun Gong every day during her year in the United States. This court has held that an applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility, particularly when, as in this case, the absence of corroboration precludes rehabilitation of testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Inasmuch as Zheng based her claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same evidence as her asylum claim, and the IJ properly found that this evidence lacked credibility, these claims necessarily also fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
