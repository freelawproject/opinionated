We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">Hernandez-Hernandez contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because his underlying deportation was invalid. We conclude that Hernandez-Hernandez has not demonstrated a plausible ground for relief from deportation, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>See United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (9th Cir.2001). Although Hernandez-Hernandez contends that his deportation is causing extreme hardship to his father, a lawful permanent resident, his contention is belied by the fact that his father previously lived in the United States for at least twelve years before his arrival. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
