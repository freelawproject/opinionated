The Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) denied her request because he determined, through an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), that she was not disabled and was able to perform jobs that exist in a significant number in the national and Texas economies. She appealed to the district court, which affirmed the ALJ. She timely appealed. Our review is governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); we are to determine whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard and whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-23\">Nichols first argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not based on substantial evidence because it did not give sufficient weight to certain statements in the reports of Drs. Trimble and Sabater. But the ALJ reviewed the entire record, including other statements in the reports from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>doctors, reports from other doctors and experts, and Nichols\u2019s own admissions. The ALJ need not give the treating physician\u2019s legal conclusions \u2014 such as statements that the claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d \u2014 any special weight or significance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Nichols also argues that the jobs the ALJ determined she could perform conflict with the limitations the ALJ himself determined that Nichols had. Specifically, Nichols argues that her limitation to jobs requiring \u201cno more than superficial contact with the public\u201d prevents her from performing the jobs of small products assembler, motel cleaner, or storage facility rental clerk. Nichols does not cite any authority demonstrating that those jobs require more than \u201csuperficial contact with the public\u201d within the meaning of her limitations. The Commissioner concedes the job of storage facility rental clerk requires interaction with the public, but argues that the other two jobs do not. The ALJ relied upon the testimony of the vocational expert that Nichols was capable of performing the limited interaction with co-workers, supervisors, and the public required for the jobs of small products assembler or motel cleaner. The ALJ was entitled to rely upon the vocational expert\u2019s knowledge of job requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the ALJ\u2019s decision that Nichols could perform the jobs of small products assembler or motel cleaner was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
