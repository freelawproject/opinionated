We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-26\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 7, 2005. The notice of appeal was filed on September 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2006.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the notice of appeal, Strassini stated that he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion until August 25, 2006, and the district court determined that his appeal was therefore timely. Under Rule 4(a)(6), however, the district court may only reopen an appeal period if the motion to reopen is filed within the earlier of 180 days after the entry of the order appealed, or within seven days after the appellant\u2019s receipt of notice of the entry of the order. In this case, Strassini\u2019s notice of appeal, construed as a motion to reopen the appeal period, was not filed within 180 days of the entry of the district court\u2019s order, and was filed nine days after Strassini received notice of that order. The district court therefore incorrectly concluded that Strassini\u2019s notice of appeal was timely, as the court did not have authority to reopen the appeal period. Because Strassini failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
