Duesler appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terns, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-24\">We reject as foreclosed the State\u2019s contentions that there is no federally protected liberty interest in parole release in California, and that Duesler was afforded all the due process that he was entitled to under clearly established federal law because he was given an opportunity to be heard at the parole board hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28. We also reject the State\u2019s contention that the some evidence standard is not clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, in the parole context. <em>See id. </em>at 1128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-25\">Duesler contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (\u201cthe Board\u201d) 2004 decision to deny him parole violated his due process rights. We conclude that there was no due process violation because \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1129; <em>see also, Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 852-53 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Duesler has failed to demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision denying this claim was contrary to, or involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Duesler\u2019s contentions that the Board erred by not applying a proportionality matrix to determine his sentence and by issuing a multi-year parole denial fail because claims that the Board failed to follow state law are not cognizable on federal habeas review. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We reject Duesler\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated on account of the Board\u2019s systematic bias. <em>See Stivers v. Pierce, </em>71 F.3d 732, 741 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We also reject Duesler\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s denial of parole violated his rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) or <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) because the Board did not increase Duesler\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum of life imprisonment for his crime of second degree murder. <em>Cf. United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Finally, because Duesler has failed to establish a colorable claim for relief, he is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Earp v. Omoski, </em>431 F.3d 1158, 1167 (9th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
