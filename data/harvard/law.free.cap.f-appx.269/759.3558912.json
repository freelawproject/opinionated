To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Baltazar-Zuniga was removable and that his actions constituted alien smuggling as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), because he \u201cprovided some form of affirmative assistance to the illegally entering alien.\u201d <em>Altamirano, </em>427 F.3d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Baltazar-Zuniga\u2019s application for cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003) (stating the court lacks jurisdiction to consider \u201call discretionary decisions involved in the cancellation of removal context, including the ultimate discretionary decision to deny relief.\u201d); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 654-55 (9th Cir. 2007) (absent a legal or constitutional question, the court lacks jurisdiction to review agency discretionary determinations).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b788-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
