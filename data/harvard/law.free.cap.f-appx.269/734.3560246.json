To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or to reconsider for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Nammo failed to establish an error of fact or law in its March 1, 2006 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Nammo was provided an opportunity to explain the basis for the IJ\u2019s finding that Nammo submitted a frivolous asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.20; <em>cf. Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157-58 (9th Cir.2003) (setting forth criteria for finding an application frivolous). We lack jurisdiction to review Nammo\u2019s contention that the IJ \u201cintimidated and mentally punished\u201d Nammo because he did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Camposeco-Montejo v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 814, 821 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Nammo\u2019s motion to reopen because the state department report he introduced did not demonstrate a well-founded fear that he personally would be persecuted in Iraq. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that evidence introduced in support of motion to reopen was \u201ctoo general\u201d to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">To the extent Nammo challenges the BIA\u2019s March 1, 2006 order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, we lack jurisdiction because this petition is not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
