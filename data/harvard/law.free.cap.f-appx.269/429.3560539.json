Ronquillo argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because counsel failed to argue relevant facts, circumstances, and law relative to a downward adjustment based on Ronquillo\u2019s role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">There is some question as to whether the appeal waiver in Ronquillo\u2019s plea agreement prevents him from bringing a direct appeal regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. However, because, at rearraignment, Ronquillo was informed that the waiver does not bar ineffective assistance of counsel claims and because the Government has not sought in its brief to enforce the appeal waiver, we turn to the merits of Ronquillo\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are resolved on direct appeal only when the record allows this court \u201c \u2018to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>504 F.3d 561, 575-76 (5th Cir.2007). The record in the instant case presents such a scenario. The record belies Ronquillo\u2019s argument that counsel did not argue facts that would support an adjustment in his offense level for a minor role in the offense. Counsel objected to the probation officer\u2019s decision not to include such an adjustment. He also argued at sentencing that Ronquillo made no money from his offense and that he was a minor participant. Moreover, the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, authorizes only an adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jeter, </em>329 F.3d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.2003) (citing to First, Third, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits). Ronquillo\u2019s argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that he was entitled to an adjustment for his minor role lacks bases in fact and in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
