Perez-Cepeda argues that the district court erred by denying his request for an additional one-level reduction to his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. The Government did not move for such a reduction. Consequently, the district court did not err by denying this request. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Perez-Cepeda also argues that his sentence, which was within the pertinent guidelines range, was unreasonable. Our review of the record shows no error in connection with Perez-Cepeda\u2019s sentence. The district court committed no procedural error at sentencing, and the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
