To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Oh. v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir. 2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Dong\u2019s motion to reconsider because she failed to show an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying her second motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Her second motion to reopen was untimely, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and the birth of her two children in the United States was insufficient to establish changed circumstances in China, <em>see He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that the birth of children outside the country of origin is a change in personal circumstances that is not sufficient to establish changed circumstances in the country of origin under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b792-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
