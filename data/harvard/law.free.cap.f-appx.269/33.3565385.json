Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-11\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Defendant-appellant Luis Alberto Salas-Ortiz appeals from a November 15, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Burns, <em>J.) </em>sentencing him to 68 months\u2019 imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to being a previously deported alien who was unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">For purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history category, prior sentences are counted separately if they were imposed in \u201cunrelated cases,\u201d but are generally treated as one sentence if they were imposed in \u201crelated cases.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rivers, </em>50 F.3d 1126, 1128 (2d Cir.1995). Offenses that are consolidated for sentencing are generally deemed related unless separated by an intervening arrest. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">Salas-Ortiz argues that the district court committed plain error when it separately counted his consolidated Connecticut Superior Court convictions for larceny and failure to appear \u201cFTA\u201d in calculating his criminal history category. In making his claim, Salas-Ortiz relies on a clerical error in the Presentenee Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that incorrectly lists the arrest date for the FTA offense as identical to the arrest date for the underlying larceny conviction. In his own sentencing memorandum, however, Salas-Ortiz explicitly consented to the criminal history category employed by the district court and stated that he \u201cpreviously submitted an objection to probation\u2019s calculation of his criminal history. He now withdraws that objection.\u201d Because Salas-Ortiz explicitly withdrew his objection to the relevant criminal history category, he has waived any challenge to that finding on appeal. <em>See United States v. Yu-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Leung, </em>51 F.3d 1116, 1122 (2d Cir.1995) (when a \u201cparty consciously refrains from objecting as a tactical matter ... that action constitutes a true waiver, which will negate even plain error review\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Salas-Ortiz\u2019s argument also lacks merit. He bases his claim entirely on the fact that the PSR recited that he was arrested for both the larceny and FTA offenses on the same date. This argument fails for two reasons. First, when viewed in its totality, the record demonstrates that the date listed in the PSR for the larceny arrest was a clerical error. The district court properly relied on the parties\u2019 uniform (and accurate) understanding that the two offenses stem from two separate arrests, notwithstanding the existence of the clerical error in the PSR. Second, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record to include a certified copy of the relevant convictions which establishes that the FTA offense occurred at a time subsequent to Salas-Ortiz\u2019s initial arrest for larceny. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2)(B) (authorizing district court to supplement the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Salas-Ortiz further argues that the district court\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence of 68 months\u2019 imprisonment was substantively unreasonable. The district court considered all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and weighed, <em>inter alia, </em>Salas-Ortiz\u2019s claims for mitigation, his personal history, his substantial criminal record, and the facts relating to his latest conviction. As a result, the district court\u2019s imposition of the below-Guidelines sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We have considered all of Salas-Ortiz\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
