Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b58-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b58-20\">Jeane Sarlo appeals from an October 27, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Casey, J.) sentencing her to thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 supervised release after she pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Sarlo conspired to obstruct justice and to make false statements to officials in connection with the submission of a false bail package on behalf of Cesar Agramonte, a defendant in a narcotics prosecution in the Eastern District of New York, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503 and 1001. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-21\">Sarlo argues that the district court erred in applying the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l) to calculate her advisory sentencing range. She principally claims that the district court should have <em>sua sponte </em>ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine the scope of her knowledge regarding Agramonte\u2019s narcotics conspiracy. In the alternative, Sarlo insists that her guidelines should have instead been calculated with reference to \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(2), which governs \u201csubstantial interference with the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-22\">Sarlo\u2019s first argument fails because \u00a7\u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l) and 2X3.1 do not incorporate a specific knowledge element. Instead, the criminal offense \u201cin respect to\u201d which the obstruction was undertaken is an objective fact that lacks a scienter requirement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l). Thus, Sarlo\u2019s knowledge regarding the scope of Agramonte\u2019s drug conspiracy would only be relevant had the Government sought to increase the base offense level by \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>applicable specific offense characteristics that were known, or reasonably should have been known, to the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2X3.1 cmt. n. 1. That was not the ease here.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Sarlo\u2019s second argument lacks merit because \u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l) plainly states that the cross-reference should be applied \u201cif the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l). Moreover, \u201capplication of the \u00a7 2X3.1 cross-reference provision [is] mandatory,\u201d and is not a matter within the discretion of the sentencing court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kimble, </em>305 F.3d 480, 486 (6th Cir.2002). Thus, the district court properly concluded that the cross-reference provision of \u00a7 2J1.2(c)(l) applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Sarlo further argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. A defendant seeking to attack her conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel must: (1) show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d and (2) \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice\u201d by demonstrating that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-89, 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Sarlo\u2019s ineffective assistance claims fail to meet this demanding standard: none of them suggest unreasonableness on the part of counsel below, nor any reasonable probability of a better result had they been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Finally, Sarlo argues that her thirty-six month sentence' \u2014 ten months lower than the minimum prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 is substantively unreasonable due to its severity. \u201cThe courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Substantive reasonableness review considers whether the length of the sentence is reasonable in light of the applicable Guidelines range and the other factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005). In explaining his sentence, Judge Casey stated that he had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reaching his decision to impose a below-Guidelines sentence. He noted Sarlo\u2019s age, health problems, charitable acts and involvement with her church. Judge Casey also noted, however, that any further reduction in sentence would be inappropriate in light of the seriousness of Sarlo\u2019s criminal conduct, which included perjuring herself on two separate occasions in two different courts to obtain the release on bail of criminals engaged in ongoing crimes. Given these circumstances, there is no basis to conclude that Sarlo\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
