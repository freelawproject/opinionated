We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-23\">At the time of its order, the BIA did not have the benefit of regulatory guidance regarding U Visas or of our decision in <em>Ramirez Sanchez v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1254 (9th Cir.2007). The regulations make clear that the BIA has the authority to continue proceedings at the request of a petitioner who has applied for a U Visa or to terminate proceedings without prejudice at the joint request of the petitioner and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14(c)(l)(i); <em>see also </em>72 Fed.Reg. 53022 n. 10 (\u201cWhile this rule specifically addresses joint motions to terminate, it does not preclude the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>from requesting a continuance of the proceedings.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14(c)(l)(ii) (providing that a U Visa petitioner who is subject to a final removal order may request a stay of removal). We remand to the BIA to consider Singh\u2019s request for reopening in light of the new U Visa regulations as a request for a continuance, or to consider any joint motion for a stay or termination. On remand, Singh may submit to the BIA any additional evidence that he may have with respect to his application for a U Visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b800-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
