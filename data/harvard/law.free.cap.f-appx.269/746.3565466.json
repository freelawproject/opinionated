We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s continuous physical presence determination for substantial evidence. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2006). We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir. 2001). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to continue. <em>Barapind v. Reno, </em>225 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Martinez-Garcia did not meet the continuous physical presence requirement where the record shows he departed the United States on October 19, 1998 and returned on February 12, 1999. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2) (departure of greater than 90 days breaks continuous physical presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Martinez-Garcia contends the IJ violated due process by declining to hear him testify about his departure to Mexico. However, Martinez-Garcia made no showing that the absence of this testimony may have affected the outcome of the proeeedings. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying a continuance where Martinez-Garcia did not demonstrate good cause. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (an immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
