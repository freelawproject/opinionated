Purnell makes several challenges to Counts Four and Fifteen. Because there was insufficient evidence supporting the two convictions, we vacate the convictions and sentences. As a result, we will not address the other arguments Purnell raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-27\">With respect to Counts Four and Fifteen, the jury found Purnell guilty of using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. Purnell was found to have used and carried the firearms at issue because he traded crack cocaine for the firearms. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, Purnell moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts, arguing that bartering drugs for firearms does not constitute using or carrying a firearm under \u00a7 924(c). The court denied Purnell\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 216. This court \u201ccan reverse a conviction on insufficiency grounds only when the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 452, 166 L.Ed.2d 321 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">While this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court issued <em>Watson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 579, 169 L.Ed.2d 472 (2007). <em>In Watson, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for use of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, which was predicated on the defendant\u2019s receipt of a firearm in exchange for drugs. <em>Watson, </em>128 S.Ct. at 582, 586. Building on the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), and <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), the Court ruled that \u201ca person does not \u2018use\u2019 a firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>128 S.Ct. at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Because of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Watson, </em>we must find the evidence supporting Counts Four and Fifteen was insufficient. Accordingly, while we affirm the convictions and sentences for Counts One, Two, Three, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen and Sixteen, we vacate the convictions and sentences for Counts Four and Fifteen. We remand to the district court to enter an amended judgment consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
