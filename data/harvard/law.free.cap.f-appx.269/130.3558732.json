May 25, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-23\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the [BIAj\u2019s decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Zhu\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34. As the BIA noted, Zhu contends that his prior counsel was ineffective in failing to submit his witness list to the IJ within the time limit provided, thereby preventing him from having witnesses testify on his behalf. Zhu asserts that the prejudice caused by his inability to present his brother as a witness is \u201cclear,\u201d because he repeatedly emphasized that his claim was \u201cextremely similar\u201d to that of his brother who had received asylum. As the BIA observed, however, the IJ found Zhu\u2019s testimony not credible based on inconsistencies between his testimony and written statements regarding why and when the police sought to arrest him in China, as well as Zhu\u2019s failure to mention his claim of past persecution based on his religion in either his airport or credible fear interview. The BIA properly found that Zhu failed to specify how the testimony of his witnesses would have overcome these discrepancies. In the absence of such a showing, the BIA properly concluded that Zhu did not present evidence that the result of his case would have been different if the witnesses he identified had testified on his behalf. <em>See Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993). Zhu thus failed to demonstrate that his prior counsel\u2019s failure to submit a witness list prejudiced the outcome of his case. See id We therefore decline to reach the BIA\u2019s additional finding concerning whether Zhu could have or should have raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his brief on appeal to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Finally, we note that contrary to Zhu\u2019s assertion that he was prevented from presenting his witnesses, the record reflects that the IJ fully anticipated the testimony of Zhu\u2019s brother based on representations made during the course of the proceedings. However, in addition to the fact that Zhu\u2019s counsel failed to submit a witness list, Zhu\u2019s brother failed to appear on the date of the merits hearing. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for Zhu\u2019s assertion that he was \u201cprevented\u201d from presenting his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the pending motion for a stay of removal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
