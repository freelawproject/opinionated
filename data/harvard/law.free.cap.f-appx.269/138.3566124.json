Sept. 9, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Huang\u2019s motion when he did not file a petition for review challenging the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination in the first instance. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 234 (finding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen due, in part, to his failure to rebut the adverse credibility determination that provided the basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of his underlying asylum claim). In that regard, even though Huang\u2019s claim that he was married and had two children was not in dispute, he failed to credibly establish to the IJ\u2019s satisfaction that his wife suffered a forcible sterilization. Further, even if, as Huang asserts, the evidence he submitted in support of his motion was \u201cmaterial,\u201d in that it corroborated the plausibility of his assertion that his wife was forcibly sterilized, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not premised on a lack of corroboration alone. Rather, in finding Huang\u2019s testimony not credible, the IJ also relied on his demeanor, lack of specificity, and the omission from his written application of his mother\u2019s lengthy detention, to support his decision. Because Huang failed to challenge the remaining aspects of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, he was unable to overcome that determination. As such, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion was not arbitrary or capricious where that motion rested on the same factual predicate found not credible below. <em>See id. </em>at 233-34. Accordingly, we need not reach Huang\u2019s argument that the BIA used an inappropriate standard in evaluating his evidence, or the Government\u2019s argument that Huang cannot establish eligibility based solely on his wife\u2019s sterilization. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
