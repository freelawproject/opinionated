Following a jury trial, Wellington was convicted of carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119, 2 (\u201cCount One\u201d); and use of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (\u201cCount Two\u201d). At a resentencing hearing, the district court imposed a 128-month term of imprisonment on Count One, to be followed by a 60-month term on Count Two, or a total custodial term of 188-months. Before the district court, Wellington argued that his total sentence should be reduced retroactively pursuant to Amendment 599 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court declined to do so, and we liberally construe Wellington\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief to challenge this on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.2000) (discussing that <em>pro se </em>filings are entitled to liberal construction). Wellington further argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to modify because his trial counsel was ineffective, or because his sentences violated his due process and Eighth Amendments rights, the Double Jeopardy clause of the Constitution, and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">We generally review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). However, where the issue presented involves a purely legal interpretation of a sentencing guideline, our review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">A district court ordinarily lacks subject matter jurisdiction to modify a term of imprisonment once imposed. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 creates an exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAW\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The Sentencing Commission, through the Sentencing. Guidelines, has stated that \u201c[w]here a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Amendment 599, which became effective in November 2000, after Wellington was resentenced, is listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1179. This amendment \u201cwas enacted in order to clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may properly be applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also been convicted for the use or possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">As amended by Amendment 599, Application Note 4 to \u00a7 2K2.4 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>If a sentence under this guideline [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4] is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-4\">In a few cases ... the offense level for the underlying offense ... may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) ] ... produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under ... \u00a7 924(c).... In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under ... \u00a7 924(c) ... does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under \u00a7 924(c)[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, app. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error. The district court properly denied Wellington\u2019s motion to modify his sentences pursuant to Amendment 599. The district court, in calculating Wellington\u2019s adjusted offense level for Count One at the resentencing hearing, did not apply a specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, using, or discharging a firearm, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). To the contrary, the district court applied a six-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C), because the victim sustained permanent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Moreover, while the district court applied an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 (1993 amendments), it complied fully with that guideline\u2019s requirement that an upward departure not exceed the maximum of the sentencing range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under \u00a7 924(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the court imposed a total resentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, which would have been the very top of Wellington\u2019s sentencing range had he not been convicted of Count Two (the \u00a7 924(e) offense), given that his adjusted offense level would have been 34 (based on the 29 points described in the PSI and a maximum of 5 additional points for discharging a firearm),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and his criminal history category was I.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Thus, because Amendment 599 was not applicable, the district court properly denied Wellington\u2019s present \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We also conclude that Wellington\u2019s other constitutional, <em>Booker, </em>and ineffective assistance claims lack merit. First, Wellington did not include an Eighth Amendment or ineffective assistance claim in his \u00a7 3582 motion, but only raised them in his \u201cMotion to Issue C.O.A. or Make Alternative Finding,\u201d which was attached to his notice of appeal. Second, even if these two claims were raised below or are otherwise properly preserved on appeal, neither of them, nor his other constitutional or <em>Booker </em>claims, involves a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission, and so they fall outside the scope of \u00a7 3582, and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See, e.g., Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions\u201d). Finally, as discussed previously, Wellington\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion cannot be liberally construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, since he had unsuccessfully sought habeas relief previously, and had not received permission from this Court to file a successive motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">. We reject the government's argument on appeal that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because Wellington filed his motion to modify under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Wellington explicitly requested in his present motion that the district court \u2018\u2018modify his sentence under Title 18 [U.S.C.] \u00a7 3582(c)(2),\u201d and he asserted that the court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over his case pursuant to that statute. Moreover, he did not mention Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) in his present motion to modify. Thus, we conclude that Wellington properly filed his modification motion according to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-15\">. A second exception \u2014 involving motions to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u2014 is not applicable here because the district court denied such a motion by Wellington, on the merits, in April 2001, and he did not obtain leave from us to file a successive motion, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>cross-referencing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (as amended).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, cmt. n. 2, provided, in relevant part, that \"[i]n a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense ... may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)] ... produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under ... \u00a7 924(c)....
