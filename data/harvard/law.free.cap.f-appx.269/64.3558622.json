Straus denying Petitioner\u2019s application for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and granting Petitioner\u2019s application for voluntary departure. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">Petitioner contends that, in holding that he had not demonstrated \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a qualifying relative, the BIA erred in its consideration of evidence presented regarding the medical condition of his step-son. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2), this Court lacks jurisdiction to review discretionary judgments in the cancellation of removal context, but possesses jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d We have said that the latter category of reviewable questions includes threshold eligibility is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sues, such as whether the petitioner has met the continuous presence requirement or whether a relative qualifies as a \u201cchild.\u201d <em>See Sepulveda v. Gonzales, </em>407 F.3d 59, 63 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1141 (9th Cir. 2002)). In contrast, we have consistently held that \u201chardship determinations are discretionary judgments and ... may not be reviewed.\u201d <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). Petitioner argues that the BIA\u2019s failure to consider medical evidence or identify any standards for that consideration amounts to a denial of Due Process and Equal Protection. Yet, his complaints are \u201cmerely quarrels over the ... justification for the discretionary choice[ ],\u201d and judicial review may not be secured by cloaking a discretionary choice in constitutional terms. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329-30 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the petition is DISMISSED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-17\">. Section 1229b(b)(l) provides that the Attorney General \"may cancel removal of, and adjust the status of ... an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States\u201d if the alien: (A) has been continuously physically present in the United States for at least ten years; (B) has been a person of good moral character; (C) has not been convicted of certain criminal offenses; and (D) \"establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien's spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
