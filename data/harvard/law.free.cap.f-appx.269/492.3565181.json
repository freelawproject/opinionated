The district court dismissed Gober\u2019s suit as barred by the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine on January 29, 2007. <em>See Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>268 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). More than three months later, Gober filed a motion to reopen the time to file an appeal, claiming that he did not receive notice of the judgment until May 7, 2007. The district court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) permits a district court to reopen the time to file an appeal only if the court finds, among other things, \u201cthat the moving party did not receive notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry.\u201d As the district court\u2019s records reflect that notice of the judgment was timely mailed to Gober\u2019s home address, the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that he failed to satisfy this requirement of Rule 4(a)(6). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Gober\u2019s motion to reopen the time to file an appeal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
