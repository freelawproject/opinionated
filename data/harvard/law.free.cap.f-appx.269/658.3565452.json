We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">W.J.A. contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Fed. R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(F) motion requesting disclosure of information concerning a Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) laboratory test. This contentions lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">The government complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(F) by disclosing the test itself and stipulating that W.J.A.\u2019s DNA was not found in the results. The additional requested information concerning FBI protocols and testing procedures was beyond the scope of information required to be disclosed. <em>See United States v. Iglesias, </em>881 F.2d 1519, 1523 (9th Cir.1989). Moreover, W.J.A. has not borne his burden of showing how this information was material to his defense or that his substantial rights were prejudiced. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>46 F.3d 885, 894 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">The government\u2019s unopposed motion to correct the record to include the FBI laboratory test is granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
