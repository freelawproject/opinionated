June 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 956 426 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 19, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). Here, because the IJ found that Qiu was credible and the BIA did not disturb that finding, we assume his credibility. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">I. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Qiu argues that the agency erred in finding that he failed to establish that the persecution he suffered and continues to fear bears a nexus to a protected ground. Qiu\u2019s claim was based upon his actions in exposing an embezzlement scheme at his place of employment. He contends that his actions amounted to an expression of political opinion that merits protection under the INA. That argument, however, is unavailing. We have found that opposition to corruption may form the basis of an asylum claim \u201c[wjhere the dispute is such that the asylum seeker did not merely seek economic advantage but mounted a challenge to the legitimacy and authority of the ruling regime itself, and where the applicant can show that this \u2018political threat\u2019 is the motive for the persecution perpetrated or feared.\u201d <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 547 (2d Cir.2005). While Qiu may indeed have been motivated by a desire to challenge Tan\u2019s corrupt practices when he informed the authorities about them, he failed to establish that the authorities engaged in those corrupt practices themselves. Qiu testified that although Tan was found to have violated \u201cthe regulation,\u201d Tan\u2019s activity was not deemed illegal, and the authorities instead accused Qiu of embezzling 70,000 yuan from company accounts. Nothing in the record, however, suggests that the authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ties focused their attention on Qiu for improper reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cPunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d <em>Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). In determining whether prosecution for an offense may be a pretext for punishing an individual for his political opinion, the BIA has concluded that \u201c[e]vidence that punishment for a politically related act would be disproportionate to the crime would indicate persecution on grounds of political opinion rather than prosecution.\u201d <em>In re S-P-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 486, 493 (BIA 1996). As the government points out, Qiu admitted to his complicity in Tan\u2019s embezzlement scheme. Qiu knew that \u201cthis whole thing was illegal,\u201d yet he assisted Tan by establishing a special account under his name from which Tan withdrew the funds that he embezzled. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government\u2019s interest in interrogating Qiu was understandable. While Qiu was detained for three days, during which time he was interrogated and not allowed to sleep, his testimony does not suggest that such treatment was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the crime of which he was accused. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, he points to nothing in the record indicating that the Chinese government improperly singled him out when they investigated his role in the embezzlement scheme. See <em>Saleh, </em>962 F.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Qiu\u2019s failure to establish that the harm he fears is \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground is fatal to his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">II. CAT Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The IJ also properly concluded that while Qiu may be the subject of a criminal prosecution and consequently could be convicted and jailed, he is ineligible for CAT relief because he failed to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured by the Chinese government. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). In order to establish eligibility for CAT relief, Qiu was required to show that the Chinese government specifically intends to torture him. <em>See Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118 (2d Cir.2007). Qiu identifies nothing in the record to support this assertion. Without more, Qiu has not shown that the possible arrest and detention he faces in China is disproportionate to the offenses with which he may be charged, i.e., illegal departure or embezzlement. <em>See Saleh, </em>962 F.2d at 239; <em>see also Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 359 (BIA 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
