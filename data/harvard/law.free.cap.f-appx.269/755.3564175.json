We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Morrison v. Hall, </em>261 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Cano\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Cano\u2019s conelusory allegations of inadequate medical treatment were insufficient to controvert defendants\u2019 evidence that Cano\u2019s condition was monitored appropriately and additional tests and treatment had been administered as warranted. <em>See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 922 (9th Cir.2001) (holding conelusory allegations unsupported by factual data are insufficient to defeat motion for summary judgment). Cano failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether any of the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834-35, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (holding Eighth Amendment claim requires prison official to have a sufficiently culpable state of mind).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cano\u2019s request for a continuance under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) because Cano failed to show that \u201cadditional discovery would have revealed specific facts precluding summary judgment.\u201d <em>Tatum v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>441 F.3d 1090, 1101 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cano\u2019s untimely request to amend his complaint because Cano did not demonstrate good cause. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b); <em>Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 604, 609 (9th Cir.1992) (holding Rule 16 \u201cgood cause\u201d standard controls after scheduling order establishes pleading timetable); <em>Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>232 F.3d 1271, 1295 (9th Cir.2000) (reviewing for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The district court properly denied Cano\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Cano did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The district court properly denied Cano\u2019s motion for the appointment of an expert under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 because Cano\u2019s action did not involve technical evidence or complex issues. <em>See Walker v. Am. Home Shield Long Term, Disability Plan, </em>180 F.3d 1065, 1071 (9th Cir.1999) (reviewing appointment of an expert under abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">We do not consider Cano\u2019s contentions regarding the validity of prior strikes against him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 because he raises this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Allen v. Ornoski, </em>435 F.3d 946, 960 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1136, 126 S.Ct. 1140, 163 L.Ed.2d 944 (2006) (explaining that the court will not review issues not raised in district court except in special circumstances such as to prevent manifest injustice).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Cano\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b783-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
