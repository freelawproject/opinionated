The district court imposed a 24-month sentence, which was above the advisory guidelines maximum sentence of 10 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Stafford contends that the amount of loss was miscalculated and should not have included insurance payments for legitimate claims arising from the accident. The district court was entitled to rely on the loss amount calculated in the presentence report because Stafford presented no evidence that any claim was legitimate. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Fisk, </em>233 Fed.Appx. 371, 373 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Stafford contends that the restitution order was erroneous because the loss amount was miscalculated. Because the loss was correctly calculated, the restitution order was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Stafford contends that he was \u201cimproperly\u201d sentenced above the guidelines range. The sentence was reasonable as either an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a) or as a non-guidelines sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court based the sentence on numerous repeat DWI offenses that were not counted in Stafford\u2019s criminal history score, and the court clearly explained that the enhanced sentence was needed for deterrence and protection of the public under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>published and is not precedent except under ' the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
