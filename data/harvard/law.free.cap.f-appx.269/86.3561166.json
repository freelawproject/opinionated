Newkirk, </em>2006 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 85288 (W.D.N.Y. 2006). The order followed a June 21, 2006 summary order of this Court affirming Newkirk\u2019s conviction and remanding his case pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), to determine whether resentencing was necessary. <em>United States v. Newkirk, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 116 (2d Cir.2006). On remand, the district court denied the defendant\u2019s request for resentencing, leaving in place the original sentence of 112 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">Newkirk argues that his sentence is both proeedurally and substantively unreasonable for several reasons, and that the district court therefore erred in declining to resentence him on the <em>Crosby </em>remand. First, he argues that the district court failed to consider adequately the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the district court\u2019s general reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, using standard language and without parsing each factor, is not an \u201cinsufficient demonstration\u201d of the required consideration. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>496 F.3d 209, 213 (2d Cir.2007). Nor is there any indication that the district court failed to consider the requirements of the parsimony clause in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>477 (2d Cir.2007) (declining to order a second <em>Crosby </em>remand simply because the district court did not specifically reference the parsimony clause). Here, because the district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3558(a) factors in determining that re-sentencing was not necessary, and because there is no record evidence to suggest otherwise, <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged [his or] her duty to consider the statutory factors\u201d), the district court\u2019s denial of resentencing was not proeedurally unreasonable. In addition, to the extent Newkirk contends that the district court should have considered post-sentencing rehabilitation in deciding whether to resentence him, \u201cwe have repeatedly held that a district court is not to consider such evidence on a <em>[Crosby </em>] remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferrell, </em>485 F.3d 687, 688 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Appellant also argues that the length of the sentence is substantively unreasonable because \u201cthe offense conduct was not the most heinous or aggravated type of felon in possession offense.\u201d Newkirk\u2019s sentence of 112 months\u2019 imprisonment was two months higher than the minimum sentence for the Guidelines range calculated by the district court, and eight months less than the maximum. The district court found that a sentence at the very lowest end of the range would not be appropriate because it would \u201csend out ... the wrong signal,\u201d and that the Guidelines range appropriately reflected the seriousness of the offense. Giving due respect to the district court\u2019s reasoned judgment, <em>see Gall v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-96, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we cannot conclude that the sentence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
