Jankun denying Moustapha\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>In re Moustapha, </em>No. A95 369 707 (B.I.A. Jan. 24, 2006), <em>aff'g In re Moustapha, </em>No. A95 369 707 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 19, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">A petition for review of a final order of removal \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The BIA\u2019s decision in this case was issued on January 24, 2006, and Moustapha\u2019s petition for review was thus due to this Court on February 23, 2006. Even though Moustapha\u2019s petition for review is dated February 23, 2006, the Court did not actually receive it until February 27, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition was thus filed beyond the 30-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>We have held that compliance with the 30-day time limit for filing a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order is a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 102, 117-20 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Malvoisin v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir.2001). Because Moustapha\u2019s petition was filed out of time, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-25\">. We express no view on whether Moustapha\u2019s counsel's failure to meet the filing dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>line could give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
