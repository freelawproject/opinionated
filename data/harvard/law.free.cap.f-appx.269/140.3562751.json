June 13, 2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005)(per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Su\u2019s motion as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA accurately noted that, whereas a timely motion to reopen would have been due in October 2003, Su did not file his motion until October 2006, well beyond the 90-day filing deadline. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Further, the BIA properly determined that Su was not eligible for an exception to the time limitation for motions to reopen because he failed to submit any evidence establishing a change in country conditions in China. <em>See Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Su relies on <em>Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149 (2d Cir.2005), for the proposition that an affidavit is sufficient to serve as \u201cnew evidence\u201d for a motion to reopen. That argument is without merit. In <em>Li Yong Cao, </em>the petitioner filed a motion to remand based on new evidence to support his prior claim that his wife had undergone a forced abortion in China. <em>Id. </em>at 152. In that case, the IJ had found the petitioner not credible in part due to a lack of reliable corroborative evidence. <em>Id. </em>In moving to remand, the petitioner submitted evidence tending to support his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 157. This Court held that the BIA erred in denying Cao\u2019s motion where he had submitted \u201cclearly material\u201d evidence. <em>Id. </em>In contrast to that case, Su filed an untimely motion to reopen, not a motion to remand. Thus, in order to prevail, he needed to demonstrate changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In support of his motion, Su submitted only his own affidavit asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the founder of the \u201cChinese Democratic Federal Republic\u201d movement, who had stayed with him in New York, was arrested by agents of the Communist government of China and sentenced to a life term; (2) Su\u2019s brother had informed him that officials from the National Security Office in China had inquired about Su; and (3) one Chinese official had spread rumors indicating that Su would be killed and dismembered. Instead of demonstrating in his motion that country conditions in China have changed, he asserted that the Chinese government \u201ccontinues to pursue him,\u201d thus indicating that circumstances in his native country have remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">To the extent Su attempts to challenge the IJ\u2019s prior adverse credibility finding and the competence of the court interpreter, such arguments are beyond the scope of our review. We may review only the BIA\u2019s June 2007 order denying Su\u2019s motion to reopen, as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 153 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Finally, because the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen Su\u2019s proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) was entirely discretionary, we are without jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>pleted our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
