Thompson was sentenced to thirty-seven months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Thompson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-27\">Thompson argues that the district court erred in applying, over his timely objection, a sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The enhancement was based on the district court\u2019s determination that Thompson\u2019s prior Florida conviction for aggravated battery was a crime of violence. Thompson does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>argue that he was not charged with a crime of violence. Indeed, we have held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045(l)(a)l and 2 is a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 347-49 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2926, 168 L.Ed.2d 255 (2007). Thompson argues, however, that the information charging him with aggravated battery with great bodily harm pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045(l)(a)l was insufficient to prove that he was convicted under that same subsection of the statute. Thompson does not argue here, nor did he so argue in the district court, that he was actually convicted of any crime other than the specific crime alleged in the information. Absent such a claim, the information was sufficient to support the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Torres-Diaz, </em>438 F.3d 529 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1012, 126 S.Ct. 1487, 164 L.Ed.2d 264 (2006). The district court\u2019s determination was further supported by a \u201cFinding of Guilt and Order Withholding Adjudication and Special Conditions,\u201d which specified that Thompson pleaded guilty to aggravated battery with great bodily harm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although this document does not bear a judge\u2019s signature, it has a sufficient indicia of reliability to allow its use as evidence of Thompson\u2019s prior conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045(l)(a)l. <em>See United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir.2007). Nothing in the record suggests that it is not in fact a copy of the judgment of conviction (with signature on missing second page). The district court did not err in applying the enhancement under section 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Thompson challenges the constitutionality of section 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has stated that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-5\">. Thompson, in his brief in this court, also seems to suggest that he might theoretically have been convicted of violating \u00a7 784.045(l)(b) which provides that \"aggravated battery\" includes any battery on a pregnant person (whom the defendant knows or should know is pregnant). Nothing in the record even remotely suggests this and certainly defendant never suggested below that he was actually convicted under \u00a7 784.045(l)(b). Moreover, not only does the information cite only \u00a7 784.045(1 )(a) \u2014 and <em>not </em>(l)(b) \u2014 but it also contains no allegation or inference that the victim was pregnant (or even female), and hence the information did not state, <em>or include, </em>any charge under \u00a7 784.045(l)(b). Thompson\u2019s contentions in this respect are meritless, even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that a \u00a7 784.045(l)(b) offense were <em>not </em>a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
