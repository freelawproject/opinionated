Karim contends that the BIA erred in rejecting his claim of U.S. citizenship and his claims of violations of procedural due process in his immigration proceedings. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s decisions under the \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard, which means we will uphold the decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 This is a deferential standard, and we will reverse the BIA only if the evidence compels that result.\u201d <em>Attia v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Karim\u2019s central claim is that the IJ and BIA improperly shifted the burden of proving alienage to him and relied upon evidence that was obtained as a result of the government\u2019s alleged \u201cegregious\u201d and unconstitutional conduct in searching his home. The record reveals, however, that the IJ properly relied upon Karim\u2019s pleading, submitted in September 2005, in which he (through counsel) admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear (NTA), including the allegation that he was not a United States citizen. The pleading satisfied the government\u2019s burden. \u201c[T]he government need only establish the [individual\u2019s] identity and alienage to meet its burden on deportation. The burden then shifts to the [individual] to show the time, place, and manner of entry in order to defeat deportation.\u201d <em>Navarro-Chalan v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">Karim argues that he should be permitted to withdraw the concession in his pleading because he never specifically authorized his attorney to concede the facts alleged in the NTA. However, Karim has not alleged that he did not authorize Attorney Macarius to represent him at the September 29, 2005 hearing, in which Karim participated via televideo conferencing and at which time the pleading was submitted without objection. \u201c[A]ll that is required for an attorney\u2019s concession to be binding on an alien is the authorization of representation.\u201d <em>Pietrzak v. Mukasey, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 337, 340 (2d Cir.2008). Nor has Karim shown that his attorney engaged in the kind of \u201cegregious\u201d conduct that might warrant releasing Karim from his attorney\u2019s concessions. <em>See id. </em>Karim himself contends that he only became aware that he was a United States citizen two months before his February 8, 2007 hearing, long after the pleading was submitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He has otherwise failed to allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>that the pleading contained false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In all events, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Karim, after claiming U.S. citizenship for the first time in January 2007, provided \u201cno evidence that he was born in the United States.\u201d The additional evidence submitted to the BIA on appeal, consisted only of the passport and death certificate for Ruth Schaffner, without explanation of Karim\u2019s relationship to Schaffner or the effect of that relationship upon his citizenship status. Therefore, we conclude that the BIA supportably found that such evidence did \u201cnot require a remand for its consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The BIA\u2019s rulings on Karim\u2019s remaining claims are fully supported by the record. Karim argues that the IJ erred in re-calendaring his ease without conforming to the regulations that govern re-opening of an immigration case. The record establishes that the case was \u201cadministratively closed\u201d in October 2005, and \u201cre-calendared\u201d in November 2006. \u201cAdministrative closure is a procedural convenience that may be granted if both parties to the removal proceedings agree, but it does not constitute a final order ... Rather, administrative closure of a case <em>temporarily </em>removes a case from an immigration judge\u2019s calendar or from the Board\u2019s docket.\u201d <em>Lopez-Reyes v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 20, 21 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasis added). The BIA properly found that the Department of Homeland Security \u201cwas not required to meet the requirements of a motion to reopen.\u201d And because the administrative closure did not constitute a final order, Karim\u2019s res judicata and double jeopardy claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The BIA properly ruled that the IJ did not err in determining that Karim\u2019s applications for relief from removal were abandoned after he failed to meet the extended deadline for filing them. The only explanation Karim gave for his failure to conform with the deadline was his claim of U.S. citizenship. He requested a continuance to obtain documents to present to the court. But he did not specify that the documents related to applications for relief from removal. In the absence of a showing by Karim of good cause, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in failing to grant another continuance. <em>See Alsamhouri v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 117, 122 (1st Cir.2007). As the BIA properly found, Karim has never explained what evidence he would have presented in support of his applications for relief. Therefore, he has failed to show prejudice from the IJ\u2019s determination that the applications were abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Karim\u2019s remaining claims relating to evidentiary rulings during his immigration proceedings are without merit. \u201cThe Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in [immigration] proceedings, but the less rigid constraints of due process impose outer limits based upon considerations of fairness and reliability.\u201d <em>Yongo v. INS, </em>355 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.2004). Karim has not explained how being provided in advance with copies of documents submitted into evidence by the government would have made a difference in the outcome of his case. \u201cIt is beyond peradventure that before a petitioner in an immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\u201d <em>Lattab v. Ashcroft, </em>384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir.2004). As discussed above, the IJ appropriately relied upon Karim\u2019s concession to the facts alleged in the NTA in determining that he was removable as charged. To the extent that the IJ relied upon Karim\u2019s conviction for marriage fraud, it was only in denying his request for voluntary departure. \u201c[B]y statute, this court lacks authority to review a refusal to allow voluntary departure.\u201d <em>Karim v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 109, 112 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Finally, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that there was \u201cno evidence of improper conduct on the part of counsel [for the government]\u201d in Karim\u2019s immigration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The decision of the BIA dismissing Karim\u2019s appeal is <em>affirmed </em>and the petition for review is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-12\">. In light of Karim's pleading admitting alien-age, it is unnecessary to consider his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>that reliance upon his passport, visa and other documents seized during the search of his apartment violated his Fourth Amendment and due process rights. <em>See Kandamar v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir.2006) (holding that any error that occurred from allegedly unconstitutional seizure would be harmless in light of untainted evidence of petitioner's removability).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
