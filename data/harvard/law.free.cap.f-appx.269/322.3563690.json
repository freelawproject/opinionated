Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">During an Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigation of trafficking of child pornography via the Internet in 2005, agents obtained and executed search warrants at Stacy\u2019s home and workplace. Forensic examination of the items seized revealed 838 images and 74 video files depicting child pornography of male and female children between the ages of 8 months and 14 years. The investigation also revealed a large number of graphic, explicit, and obscene conversations via an Internet instant message system between Stacy and a variety of individuals that discussed Stacy\u2019s desire and attempts to sexually abuse minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">The Court found within those electronic communications, language constituting substantial steps toward the commission of the underlying offense and as a result determined that Stacy attempted to engage in two or more acts involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">At sentencing the district court therefore imposed, over Stacy\u2019s objection, a five-point enhancement for engaging in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor pursuant to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">We review sentencing enhancements on a mixed standard of review: the findings of fact are subject to a clearly erroneous standard, and the court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>308 F.3d 425, 427 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">If a defendant is engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a five-point enhancement to the base level offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5). The enhancement applies if the district court finds a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d, which the Sentencing Guidelines define as two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 cmt. n. 1. Stacy concedes one instance of sexual exploitation of a minor toward the enhancement, as Stacy admits to sending a pornographic photograph over the Internet to a sixteen year old. Accordingly, only one more instance of such conduct is required for the five-point enhancement. Stacy argues, however, that his Internet instant messaging conversations, where the district court found further conduct constituting a pattern of activity, were mere bragging and idle Internet chatter, and therefore insufficient to support the sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The district court disagreed and found that several of these conversations constituted attempts to engage in sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor. Attempt requires a culpable intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards its commission. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>78 F.3d 901, 906 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In one particular instant message conversation between Stacy and an individual who called himself \u201cuncutdaddy32\u201d, Stacy set up a meeting with \u201cuncutdaddy32\u201d who agreed to bring his 12 year old daughter, who has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair, to Stacy so that Stacy could sexually abuse her. Stacy organized the meeting at a specific Cracker Barrel restaurant at 5:00 p.m. on a specific date, described the type of car he drove, obtained the description of the vehicle \u201cuncutdaddy32\u201d drove so that they could identify each other, and planned the sexual abuse of \u201cuncutdaddy32\u201d \u2019s 12 year old wheelchair bound disabled child. Further, a subsequent instant message conversation supports the Government\u2019s position that this planned encounter actually occurred. This conduct goes far beyond the mere Internet chat room banter Stacy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The record also contains instant messaging conversations between Stacy and other individuals where Stacy and the individuals discuss the location of their homes, the distance between them, whether they are able to travel, and possible locations to meet so that Stacy could sexually abuse these individual\u2019s minor children. The district court correctly found that several of these instant message conversations constituted attempts to engage in unlawful conduct. (Joint App. Vol. I at 104-12; 118-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its fact-finding and that the facts of record support the district court\u2019s imposition of the five-point sentencing enhancement. This holding is consistent with the holdings of several of our sister circuits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In light of the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s imposition of a five-point enhancement for engaging in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor. Accordingly, Stacy\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-11\">. Stacy\u2019s adjusted offense level was a 42, comprised of a base offense level of 22, 23 levels of enhancements, less a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Stacy was a criminal history category I, therefore the applicable guideline custody range was 360 months to life in prison. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, introductory cmt. (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-21\">.
