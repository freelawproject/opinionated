On September 16, 2004, Bradford suffered a heart attack that required a brief hospitalization and several weeks of recovery time. After exhausting leave available under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), Bradford attempted to return to work in December 2004, but his doctor\u2019s note did not clear him for work until Bradford\u2019s next medical appointment in February 2005. Cellxion officials offered Bradford an additional thirty days of leave for him to return to his doctor and attempt to obtain a work release. Bradford, however, rejected the offer. Cellxion then terminated Bradford\u2019s employment on December 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">Bradford filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, alleging discrimination on the basis of disability (coronary artery disease). After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Bradford \u2014 acting <em>pro se </em>\u2014 filed the present suit, alleging that he was denied a reasonable accommodation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">Bradford and Cellxion thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Bradford\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Cellxion\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court found that Bradford had failed to produce any evidence to demonstrate that he was a qualified individual under the ADA. Specifically, the district court found that Bradford\u2019s impairment did not substantially limit any major life activity for more than the ordinary reeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>peration time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, Bradford\u2019s claim failed because he was not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA. Bradford now appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Bradford, however, wholly fails to argue how the district court\u2019s determination that he is not \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA is erroneous. Bradford does not make legal arguments but only conclusory assertions that he produced sufficient evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact and that the district court erred. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(4) requires that \u201cappellant\u2019s argument contain the <em>reasons </em>he deserves the requested relief with <em>citation to </em>the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Puckett, </em>896 F.2d 126, 128 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added). \u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel, <em>pro se </em>parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (footnote omitted). Because Bradford makes no argument as to <em>why </em>the summary judgment evidence creates a genuine issue of fact regarding the impact of his impairment on his major life activities, Bradford has abandoned this argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that issues not argued are abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Bradford does argue that he need not have an impairment that substantially limits major life activities because the ADA also protects those who are \u201cregarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(C). Bradford, however, never claimed that Cellxion regarded him as disabled or presented this claim to the district court, and he cannot raise it now for the first time on appeal. <em>FDIC v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.3d 1314, 1327 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cIf an argument is not raised to such a degree that the district court has an opportunity to rule on it, we will not address it on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Furthermore, on appeal, Bradford seeks to assert claims under Title VII and the FMLA. Bradford attempted to amend his pleadings before the district court to include these claims. The district court denied Bradford\u2019s motion to amend for failure to exhaust administrative remedies \u2014 -for his Title VII claim \u2014 and for failure to allege sufficient facts to state a claim \u2014 for his FMLA claim. Bradford has not appealed that ruling to this Court, and these claims are, therefore, not properly before us. <em>Fiess v. State Farm Lloyds, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>392 F.3d 802, 806-07 &amp; n. 12 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Finally, Bradford\u2019s convoluted reply brief asserts new arguments regarding the alleged failure of the district court to strike an unsigned admission and bad faith by Celbdon for failing to send him a copy of a filing. This Court, however, \u201cwill not consider ... new claim[s] raised for the first time in an appellate reply brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-5\">. The ADA defines disability as \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he impairment\u2019s impact must ... be permanent or long term.\" <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002). The district court found that within several weeks or a few months after his heart attack, Bradford was able to participate in major life activities such as completing household chores, working as a busboy at a restaurant, driving, fishing, and hunting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\"><em>. </em>The district court also granted Cellxion summary judgment on its counterclaim for money it loaned to Bradford. Bradford does not appeal this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\">. The closest Bradford comes to making an actual argument is when Bradford cites evidence that his manual tasks are limited to 50 pounds. The district court, however, considered this evidence and determined that this limitation did not limit any of Bradford's major life activities. In his appeal, Bradford simply repeats this limitation but wholly fails to explain <em>how </em>this limitation impairs any major life activity. Such an \"argument\u201d is simply insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
