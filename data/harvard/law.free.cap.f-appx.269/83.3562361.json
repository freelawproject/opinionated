Kuhlman, </em>No. 97 Civ. 2914, 2005 WL 2063817, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18277 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">O\u2019Connor contends that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel because his attorney: (1) failed to provide the state appeals court with the transcript of a hearing on the admissibility of O\u2019Connor\u2019s prior convictions and (2) neglected to raise O\u2019Connor\u2019s absence from a portion of that hearing, purportedly a material stage of the trial, on direct appeal. O\u2019Connor pressed these grounds for finding ineffective assistance of counsel on two error coram nobis petitions, which were denied by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, on October 4, 1988 and March 18, 2004. While the Appellate Division did not provide an explanation of its grounds for denying the petitions, those denials nevertheless constitute an adjudication of O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims on the merits. <em>See, e.g., Jimenez v. Walker, </em>458 F.3d 130, 141 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we review that adjudication to determine whether it \u201c(1) re-suited in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see Jimenez, </em>458 F.3d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) his attorney\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Courts need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one\u201d and need not consider the first <em>Strickland </em>component before turning to the second. <em>Id. </em>at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">O\u2019Connor claims that his appellate counsel erred by failing to submit on direct appeal the transcript of a pre-trial hearing, held pursuant to <em>People v. Sandoval, </em>34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), on the admissibility for impeachment purposes of O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s prior criminal record. Because of this omission, O\u2019Connor urges, the state appeals court was unable to confirm that trial counsel had; in fact, requested a <em>\u201cSandoval </em>compromise,\u201d under which the fact of O\u2019Connor\u2019s prior convictions, but not the underlying details, could be used for impeachment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record is devoid, however, of any evidence showing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>transcript would have played a material role in the state appeals court\u2019s adjudication of O\u2019Connor\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>challenge. On appeal, O\u2019Connor disputed the trial court\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>ruling on the ground that it improperly permitted cross-examination on a prior conviction that was too remote in time and too similar to the crime at issue. In the course of making this argument, O\u2019Connor\u2019s appellate brief referenced, <em>inter alia, </em>trial counsel\u2019s request for a <em>Sandoval </em>compromise. While it is true that the state disputed whether such a compromise was ever requested, the state did not rest its opposition to O\u2019Connor\u2019s challenge on that basis and defended at length the trial court\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>ruling on the merits. There is no reason to assume, based on the record before us, that the question of whether trial counsel proposed a <em>Sandoval </em>compromise was central to the resolution of the claim on appeal. Accordingly, O\u2019Connor cannot demonstrate any prejudice from his attorney\u2019s failure to submit the transcript, because he has not shown that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, but for the transcript\u2019s omission, his conviction would not have been affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In addition, O\u2019Connor asserts that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise O\u2019Connor\u2019s exclusion from a purported material stage of the trial: a sidebar conference held during the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing. Appellate counsel\u2019s omission of this claim did not run afoul of an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d for at least two reasons. First, \u201c\u2018counsel does not have a duty to advance every nonfrivolous argument that could be made\u2019 \u201d on direct appeal of a criminal conviction, <em>Clark v. Stinson, </em>214 F.3d 315, 322 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Mayo v. Henderson, </em>13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.1994)), and O\u2019Connor has not shown \u201cthat counsel omitted significant and obvious issues while pursuing issues that were clearly and significantly weaker,\u201d <em>id. </em>Second, a reasonably competent attorney would be excused for not pressing this argument in 1988, as the New York State Court of Appeals decision setting forth a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a <em>Sandoval </em>hearing, <em>People v. Dokes, </em>79 N.Y.2d 656, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 595 N.E.2d 836 (1992), was issued in 1992 and, even then, addressed a defendant\u2019s exclusion from the entire <em>Sandoval </em>proceeding, not simply a sidebar conference held during the course of that proceeding. Moreover, the New York Court of Appeals explained that when \u201cdetermining whether a defendant has a right to be present during a particular proceeding, a key factor is whether the proceeding involved factual matters about which defendant might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the defendant\u2019s or countering the People\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Dokes, </em>79 N.Y.2d at 660, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 595 N.E.2d 836. It is not clear from the record that the discussion at sidebar involved factual matters within O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cpeculiar knowledge\u201d rather than a review of the allegations underlying the criminal charges O\u2019Connor faced at that proceeding. Accordingly, O\u2019Connor\u2019s appellate counsel cannot be faulted for not advancing a novel \u2014 and possibly meritless \u2014 claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that O\u2019Connor has not demonstrated that (1) counsel\u2019s omission of the <em>Sandoval </em>transcript prejudiced his appeal or (2) counsel\u2019s decision not to raise O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s exclusion from the <em>Sandoval </em>sidebar conference was objectively unreasonable under applicable law. Accordingly, O\u2019Con-nor cannot satisfy the test set forth in <em>Strickland </em>for proving ineffective assistance of counsel, much less show that the Appellate Division\u2019s resolution of his ineffective assistance claims was \u201ccontrary to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">. O\u2019Connor also maintains that, without the transcript, the state appeals court was unable to uncover the trial court's alleged misstatement of the <em>Sandoval </em>balancing standard. Because this purported misstatement was not argued on direct appeal, the omission of evidence allegedly in support thereof could not have prejudiced O\u2019Connor\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
