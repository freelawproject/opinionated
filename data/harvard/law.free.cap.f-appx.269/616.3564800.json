He contends the IJ erred in (1) holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 required him to treat Ruiz as an alien seeking admission subject to \u00a7 1182, (2) admitting a rap sheet as evidence of Ruiz\u2019s conviction, (3) determining there was sufficient evidence of a conviction and (4) finding that \u00a7 1182\u2019s petty offense exception did not apply. Claiming he did not understand the nature of the proceedings and the consequences of its outcome, Ruiz also argues the IJ\u2019s behavior violated his statutory, regulatory and due process rights in light of this lack of comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, which we now review as the agency\u2019s final determination. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii); <em>Galeana-Mendoza v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 1054, 1057 (9th Cir. 2006). We grant Ruiz\u2019s petition regarding the IJ\u2019s analysis of the petty offense exception and remand to the agency for reconsideration in light of this holding. We affirm the IJ\u2019s decision on all other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">1. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>We do not have jurisdiction over Ruiz\u2019s claims that the IJ erred in both admitting a rap sheet as evidence of his conviction and determining there, was sufficient evidence of a conviction. \u201cEven construed broadly,\u201d Ruiz\u2019s appeal to the BIA did not exhaust these claims. <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 676 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u00a7 1252(d)(1). We have jurisdiction over Ruiz\u2019s remaining claims, which pose constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). With regard to his due process and petty offense exception claims, Ruiz\u2019s appeal to the BIA satisfies this court\u2019s liberal exhaustion standard for pro se appellants. <em>See Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 877-78 (9th Cir.2002). Even though Ruiz failed to argue below that he should not be treated as an alien seeking admission subject to \u00a7 1182, the BIA has expressly held that a LPR convicted of a crime of a moral turpitude should be categorized in this manner in <em>In Re Collado-Munoz, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1061, 1064 (BIA 1998), so \u201csuch recourse would be futile and is not required\u201d when \u201cthe agency\u2019s position on the question at issue appears already set.\u201d <em>El Rescate Legal Services, Inc. v. Executive Office of Immigration Review, </em>959 F.2d 742, 747 (9th Cir.1991) (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">2. <em>Petty offense exception. </em>Ruiz argues the IJ incorrectly found him ineligible for the petty offense exception, which excludes a crime of moral turpitude as a removable offense if \u201cthe maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was convicted [ ] d[oes] not exceed imprisonment for one year, and ... the alien [is] not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii). Limiting our analysis solely to the grounds on which the IJ based his decision, we grant Ruiz\u2019s petition. <em>See Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The IJ relied only on Ruiz\u2019s original sentence and his mistaken impression that the maximum sentence under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 273.5(a) (2004) for <em>Ruiz\u2019s type of conviction </em>exceeded one year, even though Ruiz was originally sentenced to six months in jail and 36 months of probation. Critically, \u00a7 273.5(a) is a wobbler offense that is punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor. <em>See People v. Jackson, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 574, 576, 91 Cal. Rptr.2d 805 (Cal.Ct.App.2000). A wobbler offense is classified as a misdemeanor \u201cfor all purposes ... [a]fter a judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)(1) (1998). \u201cUnder California law, the maximum penalty for a misdemeanor is six months\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d <em>Ferreira v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 1045, 1051 (9th Cir. 2004). \u201cIn no case shall any person sentenced to confinement in a county or city jail ... on conviction of a misdemeanor ... or for any reason except upon conviction of more than one offense when consecutive sentences have been imposed, be committed for a period in excess of one year.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 19.2 (1989). Thus, Ruiz\u2019s original sentence converted his offense into a misdemeanor for all purposes such that the maximum sentence could not have exceeded one year of imprisonment. Given this legal status of Ruiz\u2019s conviction, the IJ should have found that Ruiz was eligible for a petty offense exception. We do not consider the government\u2019s other arguments as to why Ruiz could have been found unqualified for the exception, because we \u201ccannot uphold the decision of the BIA ... on a theory other than the one upon which it relied.\u201d <em>Malta-Espinoza v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 1080, 1082 n. 3 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">3. <em>Other claims. </em>We briefly address Ruiz\u2019s remaining claims. First, the BIA has determined that a LPR \u201cwho has committed [a crime of moral turpitude] ... [and] who departs the United States and returns, shall be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States despite his lawful permanent resident status.\u201d <em>Collado, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1064. This is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes. <em>See Camins v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 872, 879-80 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm the IJ\u2019s decision to treat Ruiz accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Second, the IJ fulfilled his statutory and regulatory duties by repeatedly informing Ruiz of his right to counsel and conducting a hearing on the merits. Even assuming arguendo that the IJ was obligated to conduct a competency hearing for Ruiz, a finding of incompetency during such an inquiry at most would have required the IJ to hold a hearing on the merits. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10(c). Because the IJ already conducted such a hearing, Ruiz was not prejudiced by any alleged violation. <em>See Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 520, 523 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, a plain reading of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.4\u2019s direction that \u201c[w]hen it is impracticable for the respondent to be present at the hearing because of mental incompetency, the attorney ... shall be permitted to appear on behalf of the respondent\u201d does not constitute a mandate that the IJ appoint such counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Finally, because we grant Ruiz\u2019s petition based on our conclusion that the IJ erred in finding that the petty offense exception did not apply, we do not reach the constitutional issues raised by his due process claim. We remand to the BIA to reconsider Ruiz\u2019s petition in light of our reversal of the IJ\u2019s determination that Ruiz was not eligible for the petty offense exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
